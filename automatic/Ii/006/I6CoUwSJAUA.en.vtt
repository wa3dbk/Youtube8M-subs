00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.140

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.000
 to know more it is still beautiful in red 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.789
 so it's already thank you for all your 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.920
 questions is a sign that it interests 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.380
 and where I have a question then I am 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.110
 called from nathan roubaix do you 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.600
 will recognize who is wrong and who are who 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.719
 made me pretty happy 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.840
 he asked me where we are and my plants 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.550
 but hollyhock and my lawyer 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.600
 it's true I had talked about it there is very 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.420
 long time when I made my shoes 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.460
 in bottles and eggs then I had 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.440
 not spoken again so it's nice enough to 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.660
 see all the people who 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.829
 are interested and who follow as and when 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.850
 measure the things i 'm already answering just 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.250
 to our question of nathan who was asking 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.920
 if we could also put ipomÃ©es 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.250
 whose bottles I know because 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.360
 all that it was ipomeas to 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.150
 future teachers it's plants 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.189
 climbing with flowers in trumpet 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.640
 so the Baptist and I knew you 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.280
 not so these pretty flowers 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.990
 so I think so that's it so many 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.329
 bad to push that my hollyhocks that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.490
 will be hard but good 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.159
 so we're going to see on video what that 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.320
 gave 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.350
 and then I answer also so I'm 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.869
 registered to a forum on which I 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.530
 will not give the address but on 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.850
 which I had talked to for a while 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.429
 worse than transplanting 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:53.049
 carrots where there were the pros and cons 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:56.470
 against or against it was said that 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.579
 it was not doing it 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.360
 not great it was small 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:04.659
 carrots short me I start from the principle 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:09.209
 that nothing is lost besides that the 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:12.250
 plant in this case my carrots con 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.530
 when I clear them up with a good 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.750
 roots I replant it works or that 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.410
 not work it's still won 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.620
 why do you have that so we left you 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.959
 go see the bocca that I gave in 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.910
 earth and for my hollyhocks 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.590
 unfortunately in sowing with bottles 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.519
 it's not a market marot I'll you 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.079
 show those who pushed on their own 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.079
 it's interesting, it's gone 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.620
 here 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.770
 and here's the lawyer what is it? 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.770
 given 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.000
 you see I loved him not even stain 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.260
 maybe mistakes but had even with 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.480
 all the wind he's done these last 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.450
 days he held me well I still 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.310
 put a little a little piece of wood 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.290
 to tie it up so I do not know 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.540
 not if it will give lawyers I think 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.750
 not but it gives a little lawyer enough 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.750
 pretty 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.860
 here we go go to hollyhocks 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.130
 so 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.380
 that's it and 11 first that pushed in 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.220
 bitumen 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:38.790
 alas for all very pretty and just to 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:42.410
 side and others if who pushed the door 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.410
 or who is also very beautiful 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.010
 for my purpose was up page 8 of them 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.580
 beat here 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.450
 so that's one I had then 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.490
 immense 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.900
 my goal was master here so yes I 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.140
 have a jerk 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.060
 another one that grows and one that is 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.130
 a little dry but who to make wars 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.660
 it too so my goal is to have a 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.700
 thing all this wall filled with roses 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.000
 hollyhocks so I saw push 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.720
 now what I'm doing is that 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.690
 people find that we ooh there 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.540
 down I have rage cleanly with the 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.540
 protein-type roots 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:33.390
 so I do not care anymore it works very 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:34.440
 well like that that's so 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.290
 this question now we will pass 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.280
 entrusts carrots cage up so 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.480
 then another one 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.070
 the rush right next to the raspberries 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.570
 and wild it drives the wild side 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.570
 daudelin then one more 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.110
 there I never plant anything that is 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.979
 possible all this so for all those 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.470
 jeans that hit the tower rouger 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:05.060
 grandjean the garden subscriber where i saw 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.880
 I did but my leeks pushed me 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:12.139
 below the video 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.930
 the bikers do not suddenly invent here are 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:18.139
 the carrots that I could have sown 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:32.319
 in February under coward so watch this 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:32.319
 gives a killer a good view 4 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:52.420
 here is the original another beautiful 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:56.200
 carrot and next at the beginning I tell myself 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:06:00.460
 said we have more and that's before 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.580
 all the carrots that I have also everything 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.580
 simply 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:16.420
 look at those two carrots 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:27.120
 because I did not tear it off at the concert 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:27.120
 41.2 feet and it's friends here 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:38.250
 that's good, it's not everything but it 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.250
 as well 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:54.060
 it's also enjoying it so make 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:56.180
 like me do not lose your little plans 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.370
 when you light up 6 and things 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.260
 transplant it works or it does not work you 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.490
 have a little disappointing it works or it does not 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:14.090
 not work but there is never anything 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:17.100
 lost we see the carrot 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:21.960
