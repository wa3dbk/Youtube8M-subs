00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.690
 hello to all and all these masters 4 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.480
 2 today we find ourselves for one 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.860
 tutorial on pes 2013 that also works 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.270
 on ps 2014 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.850
 so I do not know if you've been 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.330
 faced with disconnections 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.480
 untimely on the game so often 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.200
 when you are you are in the process of 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.489
 win and so the opponent disconnects 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.170
 we do not know why there is a 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.829
 deterioration of the connection 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.470
 apparently and what they say 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.100
 so I did not really believe it and that's 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.329
 a little annoying 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.399
 every time I asked myself the question 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.019
 the why of how do we do it 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.760
 did the guys get to disconnect 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.329
 like that and without losing money 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.460
 together without being penalized 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.980
 so I searched a little on net I 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.969
 poked a little on the net and I 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.339
 finally found 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.790
 so the purpose of this video and of 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:07.430
 share share with you excuse me 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.250
 well the little trick and what 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.550
 will put everyone on the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.550
 same pedestal 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.470
 so here I am we are we see on the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.380
 video I just scored a goal so there 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.530
 until she has no problem so 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.210
 at the base I wanted myself disconnected 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.300
 but then I came across a cheater 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.590
 who must surely have the trick then 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.790
 I do not know if it's if it's a 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.000
 Spanish or pose it's true it's 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.270
 a big community that often 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.770
 on spanish that it falls so there 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.400
 it was a special match I won 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.400
 a little more than 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.359
 of 5 or 6 million I remember more 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.009
 exactly 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:52.520
 so here it was an important match 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.469
 will say for me and for him so even 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.049
 he had a big bonus so we're 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.509
 of course ps 2013 so here it starts to 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.130
 the guiche do not know if you see so 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.490
 continue playing no worries I say to myself 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:09.560
 I will launch the software just after 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:13.010
 and here I am, I wait a little and there 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.870
 as by chance as the status of the 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.450
 transmission has deteriorated the match of 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.190
 your help must be canceled 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.530
 so that's what happens and it's 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.060
 really really really annoying so 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.849
 we will go to practice 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.860
 so in fact it's very simple to sell 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.290
 he was talking about some kind of cables he 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.470
 had to cut is called lake switch or 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.510
 something like that and you did not know 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.970
 great thing so here it is I put you 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.470
 the software skit all so you 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.910
 go on start on network tools 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.590
 Then you go on a flooder sword 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.030
 at the end of the video everything will be all 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.310
 described so I'm going to want to describe in 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.170
 end of video 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.160
 so here is a little software so in 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.590
 the first box you put some 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.120
 twenty-seven instead of what they 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.579
 had so I think what is 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.160
 exactly so you put 27 points 27 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.950
 points 27 points 27 and in the second 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.450
 box what to do in fact 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.760
 it is necessary to put 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.500
 you have to put date in fact already there is already 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.450
 dating and so we have to put several 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.299
 data so I explain in the video 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.970
 how to do so data point 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.940
 date after date after date to etc etc 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.650
 they will put about 25 25 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.850
 at 50 or more for fat 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.000
 connection this is what allows 2 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.560
 to bring down the outright band 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.740
 passing the teeth width of your 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.610
 connection and that deteriorate the 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.680
 connection is so 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.270
 so you're disconnected from the ps server 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.470
 so that's it's not it's not very 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.940
 complicated to do it's not very 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.830
 complicated to achieve but needed the 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.500
 find and today it makes me 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.170
 pleasure to share it with you here 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.450
 so it's not the people to come in 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.860
 far from it so I want m I get it 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.280
 I want things to be really 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.830
 clear well there are tired there are fed up 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.880
 people who leave rich like 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:18.060
 this and so here I wanted I wanted 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:21.160
 share it with you so I hope that 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.200
 pes finally ge forgive me konami va 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.420
 take out a patch that is going to adjust this 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.460
 worry there because there are really fed up 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.960
 it's end in that year I 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.910
 not taken the ps 2014 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.070
 because of that because they work 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:38.710
 again I wish I would love konami 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:40.330
 is an opportunity to see this this trick 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.270
 all to work is to work on 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.890
 on spell and 2 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.249
 Okay, we can do more than we can 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.899
 can do more because 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:52.589
 because it's true that it ruins everything 

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:55.829
 the pleasure of the game me I play on 2013 

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:57.299
 rarely alas on 2014 I'm not even 

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:59.429
 took the lead in buying it because it 

00:04:57.299 --> 00:05:01.919
 not even worth the guys fall from 

00:04:59.429 --> 00:05:04.679
 cristiano ronaldo at the end of 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.419
 two weeks three weeks I find 

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:09.089
 it does not make sense and I do not find it 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.759
 fair play so here I hope you have 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:13.739
 your my video i hope it will do 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.189
 pleasure to some I hope will do less 

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:18.479
 pleasure to others that I'm sure 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:22.319
 excuse me for others it's true 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:24.689
 that it is not easy there we will say 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:29.369
 that I had the ass between two chairs 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:31.919
 on the one hand I will facilitate access to the 

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:34.649
 cheat for this game and on the other hand I 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.919
 say a big info for precisely 

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:38.999
 for that stops the fact of all the 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.369
 world be aware that everyone 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:45.059
 few can do it 

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:48.569
 and ben I hope we'll have a 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:52.979
 new patch from konami 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:56.309
 so here I hope I hope that 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:59.699
