00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello how are you when we buy books 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.110
 the truth that we never know where the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.540
 we are going to save and demand spaces and 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.669
 that is an increasingly scarce good for 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.190
 that today we are going to make a bookseller 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:21.199
 modular desk that is based on 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.199
 modules that can be added to one such 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.940
 the furniture will be removable and very simple 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.520
 of doing the beginning will be based on 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.350
 inclined vertical supports of pine 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.360
 brushed that will be supported on the wall 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.280
 these are going to hold pine shelves 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.590
 finger let's do two types of 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.840
 modules the first one is going to have five 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.400
 shelves and the second on the desk the 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.190
 Wine brushed side supports 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.660
 the pine shelves will be two meters 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.400
 fingers that could be of any 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.680
 other material such as melamine 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.160
 they will be smaller up and bigger 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.559
 below also the desktop module will be 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.479
 wider than the shelving module in 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.600
 total it is about eight different pieces 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.589
 for the desk module we ask in the 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.860
 shop the following pieces 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:10.940
 dimensions of pine finger one of 20 x 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.360
 60 centimeters one of 25 x 60 and one of 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.979
 40 x 60 that will be the work table and 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.490
 for the shelving module we have 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:26.560
 units of 20 x 40 25 x 40 30 x 40 35 x 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.560
 40 and finally 40 x 40 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.480
 we have twice as many pieces of 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.900
 shelf module because we're going to do 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.250
 two one on each side of the desk 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.070
 remember that all the measures of this 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.840
 project are in the pdf on www dot 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.280
 here this same point cl can 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.210
 print and take it to the store to 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.180
 measure the dimensioned finger pine we're going 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.920
 to cut the sides of the 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.410
 brushed pine that have a length of 3 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.120
 20 meters and we're also going to cut these 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.050
 three quarters that will be the 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.050
 magazine pads 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.940
 of three quarter quarters 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.990
 we have to cut 10 of 40 centimeters 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.990
 and 3 of 60 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.129
 the inspiration that we are going to give to 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.620
 lateral is very slight and to achieve it 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.290
 let's measure from this point towards 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.019
 up 9 millimeters and let's join that 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.920
 mark with a line up this corner and 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.920
 that will give us the inclination 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.830
 so that it can be disassembled let's play 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.049
 The mini fix system when you buy 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.549
 in the shop a piece of furniture that is unarmed is the 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.099
 same system that bring these furniture 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.709
 for you to build the house 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.290
 It consists of a slope or expansion that 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.610
 goes in piece 1 of wood are introduced 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.709
 with a hammer after making a 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.159
 drilling with drill then comes the 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.170
 connector that is screwed to the plug and 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.629
 then we move on to piece 2 so that 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.030
 It has a cavity with two exits on the 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.200
 first output enters the connector and by 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.959
 the second enters the box 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.900
 that catches the connector and when turning it 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.459
 press piece 1 with piece 2 a 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.260
 very important detail to use the 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.300
 mini fix system is that wood where 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.310
 goes the box must have a minimum thickness 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.530
 15 millimeters as the sides 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.209
 they are inclined to review them 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.090
 we are perfectly horizontal 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.010
 we are going to occupy a false block that we 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.330
 allows to replicate any type of 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.430
 angle 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.650
 the first thing is to mark the height of the 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.170
 shelves on the outer edge of the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.630
 sides in the shelf module the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.940
 ledge lower will go to 40 centimeters 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.360
 of the soil and then the next four 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.920
 to 35 centimeters between them in the 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.079
 desktop module the surface of 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.690
 work to go to 75 centimeters from 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.489
 the soil that is the standard measure and 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.060
 then he will have two upper shelves 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.329
 the first to 145 and the next to 180 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.329
 centimeters 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.820
 we set the angle in the false square and 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.700
 then we move that angle to the 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.220
 marks on the shelves and we draw a 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.220
 line as if it were a squadron 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.220
 traditional 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.530
 for the room of the plugs 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.130
 we mark the midpoint on the line 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.010
 straight then from the middle we mark 15 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.330
 centimeters to each side and that will be 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.729
 the final location of the terms 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.800
 We are going to start installing the plugs of 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.050
 expansion and connectors and for that 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.909
 let's use a 10 millimeter drill bit 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.710
 to do the drilling and the 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:45.190
 depthmeter to 12 millimeters 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.680
 then to emboss the dowels we use the 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.250
 hammer and then we just had 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.250
 the connectors 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.920
 so that the shelf is left in 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.050
 relation to vertical 11 centimeters and 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.410
 touching the wall on the back piercing 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.840
 on the ledge will go from outside towards 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.820
 in to 13 centimeters and 16 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.850
 centimeters and in the case of the desk 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.750
 they will go from the outside in to 18 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.750
 already 21 centimeters 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.230
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.970
 cavity for the box for that we're going to 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.250
 use a 15 mm drill bit 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.290
 diameter and the adjusted depth gauge 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.760
 also at 15 millimeters 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.650
 this is to ensure the correct 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.070
 drilling that we will do later for the 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.070
 singing 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.640
 we take them from jonquil we are going to paste them 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.800
 to the shelves in this way and for that 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.070
 we are going to use quarter points and with 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.070
 the cold 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:17.180
 when we have ready all the pieces 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.180
 we have to fix with sandpaper of 150 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:30.139
 i 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.990
 to achieve a tone that contrasts with the 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.819
 target of the wall we are going to apply to 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.220
 furniture a color wood dye 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:41.050
 chocolate with a room temperature 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.370
 approximately 20 degrees this dye 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.370
 dries only in 10 minutes 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:22.539
 I change the house gold without a doubt that if 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:24.669
 we simply use a handsaw and 

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:26.710
 high effort if you missed some detail 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:29.110
 You can watch this program in the channel 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.149
 youtube or at www dot to the east same 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.649
 point cl where you can share if you want 

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:36.149
 this project with his friends in the 

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:36.149
 social networks we see you chau chau
