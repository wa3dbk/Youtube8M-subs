pointing out that I noticed when I first

pointing out that I noticed when I first
played<00:00:44.540> the<00:00:44.690> vibrato<00:00:44.990> was<00:00:45.739> that<00:00:45.920> it<00:00:46.010> takes<00:00:46.190> a

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
played the vibrato was that it takes a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.979 
played the vibrato was that it takes a
short<00:00:46.640> time<00:00:46.970> just<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.450> get<00:00:47.570> used<00:00:47.750> to<00:00:47.840> the

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
short time just to get used to the

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.810 
short time just to get used to the
finger<00:00:48.440> pressure<00:00:48.680> required<00:00:49.220> to<00:00:49.430> seal<00:00:49.670> the

finger pressure required to seal the
pants<00:00:50.060> properly<00:00:50.570> it's<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.350> fact<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:51.710> the

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
pants properly it's the fact that the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.490 
pants properly it's the fact that the
pads<00:00:52.610> are<00:00:52.820> made<00:00:52.850> from<00:00:53.180> this<00:00:53.450> silicon<00:00:53.930> material

and that they're self leveling that

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.450 
and that they're self leveling that
means<00:00:56.750> that<00:00:56.960> it<00:00:57.020> needs<00:00:57.050> a<00:00:57.260> reasonable<00:00:57.950> but<00:00:58.280> not

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
means that it needs a reasonable but not

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.700 
means that it needs a reasonable but not
excessive<00:00:59.090> pressure<00:00:59.360> to<00:00:59.809> create<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.410> correct

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
whatever you may have but it will give

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.590 
whatever you may have but it will give
you<00:01:24.259> something<00:01:24.530> a<00:01:24.799> bit<00:01:24.979> different<00:01:25.569> the<00:01:26.569> other

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
you something a bit different the other

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.660 
you something a bit different the other
thing<00:01:27.020> worth<00:01:27.289> pointing<00:01:27.350> out<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.280> this<00:01:28.369> isn't

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
thing worth pointing out and this isn't

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.819 
thing worth pointing out and this isn't
obvious<00:01:28.969> from<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.270> video<00:01:29.810> review<00:01:29.990> such<00:01:30.380> as<00:01:30.560> this

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
obvious from a video review such as this

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.340 
obvious from a video review such as this
is<00:01:31.310> that<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.670> sax<00:01:31.939> is<00:01:32.119> just<00:01:32.359> so<00:01:32.719> light<00:01:33.020> it

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
is that the sax is just so light it

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.830 
is that the sax is just so light it
almost<00:01:33.619> beggars<00:01:33.950> belief<00:01:34.279> and<00:01:34.700> from<00:01:35.659> this

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
almost beggars belief and from this

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.199 
almost beggars belief and from this
point<00:01:36.049> of<00:01:36.200> view<00:01:36.229> for<00:01:36.619> children<00:01:37.249> learning<00:01:38.029> it

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:38.209 
point of view for children learning it

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:39.489 
point of view for children learning it
would<00:01:38.329> make<00:01:38.479> it<00:01:38.630> an<00:01:38.719> excellent<00:01:39.139> first

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:39.499 
would make it an excellent first

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.980 
would make it an excellent first
saxophone<00:01:40.090> so<00:01:41.090> let's<00:01:41.270> do<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.450> demonstration

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
saxophone so let's do a demonstration

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.690 
saxophone so let's do a demonstration
and<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:42.649> can<00:01:42.859> make<00:01:43.039> up<00:01:43.189> your<00:01:43.340> own<00:01:43.369> mind

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
and you can make up your own mind

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.039 
and you can make up your own mind
whether<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.029> think<00:01:44.149> it<00:01:44.299> sounds<00:01:44.569> different<00:01:44.749> to

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
whether you think it sounds different to

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:55.530 
whether you think it sounds different to
a<00:01:45.079> regular<00:01:45.439> sax<00:01:45.679> on

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.570 

Oh
