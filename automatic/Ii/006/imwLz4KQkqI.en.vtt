00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.259
 hello the rotation sensor it informs the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.439
 control unit by means of a signal 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:34.100
 that allows synchronization 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.739
 of the system ie time of injection 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.989
 ignition and top dead center 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.229
 its signal is critical to beginning 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.030
 operating mode, ie if the 

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:47.399
 rotation sensor did not report the unit 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.780
 that the engine started to rotate the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:58.649
 car does not handle 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:01:02.670
 let's close disconnect the whip 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.660
 sensor to adjust the time both in the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.940
 resistance in two cars 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.539
 insert the probes into the pins with 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.020
 1 and 2 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:25.110
 the value obtained should be around 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:25.950
 950 ameo or ons to analyze the signal of the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.600
 sensor 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.479
 We're going to need someone 's help. 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.259
 to start the game at the moment of 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.770
 test 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.570
 let's proceed as follows 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.049
 keep the sensor in the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.840
 whip and adjust the mixed team on the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.579
 alternating voltage, insert the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.289
 tests on pins 1 and 2 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.180
 we remember that the sensor is disconnected 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.200
 so the car will not go 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.880
 take 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.700
 depending on the vehicle result 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.860
 found will be one to two goals before 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.130
 to purchase or install a 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.470
 bs rotation see the application in 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.269
 catalog or on the website www.dpf.gov.br 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.180
 because some models are similar 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.549
 physically but with values of 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.600
 completely different resistance due to 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:23.519
 to the number of turns of the coil in the sensor 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.160
 follow 10 on social networks 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.489
 follow our tips and news 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.840
 and remember to make sure you're using technology 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.840
 quality only
