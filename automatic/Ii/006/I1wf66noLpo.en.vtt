00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.589
 Jalloh love wrong friends here on YouTube 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.090
 so nice it is here 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.730
 then whistle 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.719
 such mental ones have silver or golden ornamental features 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.640
 so noble that looks so soon late maturing 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.529
 this combination 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.749
 want to participate from with 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.509
 and metal on request 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.210
 At some point most metal applications start tapping 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.890
 at least if you do not have this FIFA regularly in your hand and when 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.580
 Smoking times riding off in between 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.090
 with the rag so marched by a payment and the times to fish 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.320
 with a smaller number of FIFA this may still be true 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.090
 makeable 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.480
 once the number of false security speak the highest 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.270
 you usually do not have the time regularly with the rag 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.390
 turn things around 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.179
 and to polish these metals application 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:00.320
 so that they shine so beautifully just looks like rolling as it is on 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:01.180
 to run 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.750
 the included 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.250
 in budget ornaments is a problem 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.210
 but this problem can be eliminated quite easily 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.410
 where should he go today? 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.250
 says Polak 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.979
 suggested also Germany, for example, tells with Kugler says nothing new 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.570
 then this time has long been used 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.210
 to limit jewelry 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.659
 because this is saying "or, coincidentally, here in conversation 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.700
 also on site 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.100
 it does not make sense 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.770
 I have this big stop 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.920
 can get along so casually 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.040
 is not a problem if you promise them Spree appeal effect 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.460
 just a little bit of it to do 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.940
 in the cap and carries the date 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.920
 with a fine brush on this path have applications on 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.340
 of course, one has to say that now, a certain amount is needed 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.229
 remain fine motor 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.460
 because he has problems and ads and locks wood off 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.490
 For example, he can cover the wood a bit on impact 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.520
 Translator Polak really represents Mio on the metal devices 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.040
 dry dr invisible from so he gives no clear layer of protection 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.479
 and it does not help 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.949
 prevent the metal from restarting 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:19.720
 By the way, this does not only apply to 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.759
 the petite of the whistle 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.319
 So I got through this on this 4 2 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.609
 one demonstrates 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:30.150
 you can see that very well this untreated page is just starting here 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:35.359
 This Brendan again melt on Mansiz, maybe not quite like that in the camera 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.329
 well the other side you can see them sooner 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:38.889
 it will be a video too 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.229
 so dark 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.149
 dirty so very dirty 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:45.909
 and the side with tractors 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.760
 he has been treated that really retains one 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.700
 radiantly beautiful shine 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.459
 have won for a long time 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.729
 and here again 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:59.689
 that is the untreated remains like a bit of dirt here too 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:00.339
 above 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:03.109
 this is this cup of o2's 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.859
 Dirt starts right here 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.009
 that's not the case with Dr Pawlak says 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:11.449
 and so you can be very nice 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:12.360
 the 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.240
 accelerate that again 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.970
 and that to Poland 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.289
 from this goal bring spang 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.779
 to Russell's problem I think the preparation is not 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:23.779
 which should be natural 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:28.029
 Dr Brinkmann to skip such FIFA must be sparkling before 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:34.509
 that is clear that means clean and then with as possible 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:39.149
 Percent off, for example, careful and in the wood while doing so 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:40.370
 League to do 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.469
 degrease 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.489
 Let it dry a bit and then polak 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.500
 Carefully said otherwise apply these wood surfaces Jun for example with 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.130
 a touch or a 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.290
 cover the piece of paper Dr Map strokes 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.169
 Musician I do not think that means little care clock 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.069
 and it does not seem to have been reached yet 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.919
 should be done is actually clear I can only say the effect 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:08.320
 AUD is a fabulous one 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.739
 long long time 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.219
 the view stays on you 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.949
 misted and discolored again 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:16.370
 tell 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.229
 and adorns has a speech 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.509
 since Monday 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.860
 I think there is in every hardware store 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.469
 does not cost the world 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:28.729
 What I would do, however, is especially if you look at such a spree band 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.430
 says Bullock worriedly pleading with the cops 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.460
 It makes the best children were closed 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.389
 even during the bush government 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.440
 the judge already prepares for her work 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.779
 and that certainly does not give it 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:46.620
 the children above all things 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.820
 to the ladies of the house will then not only the nose up 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.340
 I'll probably go summertime with Pfeiffer and tell Polak 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.340
 either on the balcony because banished to the basement 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.430
 he can, of course, Frese 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.080
 my advice 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.740
 start of defense of metal applications Ochmann metal 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.800
 silver 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.010
 to prevent both wrong and for example on vehicles 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:15.719
 for trial 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:19.099
 that would be my tip the wars of me from her before today 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.009
 I said thank you for seeing 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:22.679
 Until next time
