sitting there on your phone but

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
sometimes I think like if people just

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.090 
sometimes I think like if people just
like<00:03:03.720> if<00:03:03.959> they<00:03:04.079> don't<00:03:04.200> always<00:03:04.440> edit<00:03:04.799> their

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
like if they don't always edit their

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.590 
like if they don't always edit their
pictures<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.549> everything<00:03:05.910> like<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.420> could

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
pictures and everything like it could

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.930 
pictures and everything like it could
get<00:03:06.900> better<00:03:07.079> rather<00:03:07.560> than<00:03:07.739> saying<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.819> look

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
get better rather than saying to look

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.190 
get better rather than saying to look
like<00:03:09.120> us<00:03:09.299> you<00:03:09.480> have<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.630> wear<00:03:09.840> lots<00:03:09.989> of<00:03:10.140> makeup

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
like us you have to wear lots of makeup

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.199 
like us you have to wear lots of makeup
surely<00:03:11.130> they<00:03:11.250> can<00:03:11.430> turn<00:03:11.579> that<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.819> other<00:03:11.910> way

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
surely they can turn that the other way

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.599 
surely they can turn that the other way
and<00:03:12.569> I<00:03:13.230> think<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:14.069> could<00:03:14.220> make<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.400> big

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
and I think that could make a big

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.330 
and I think that could make a big
difference
