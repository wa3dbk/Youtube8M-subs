I brought you here to show you how

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.140 
I brought you here to show you how
simple<00:00:07.429> Scandinavian<00:00:08.429> design<00:00:08.580> can<00:00:08.940> have<00:00:09.120> a

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
simple Scandinavian design can have a

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.839 
simple Scandinavian design can have a
fantastic<00:00:09.660> dramatic<00:00:10.380> effect<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:11.280> also<00:00:11.460> can<00:00:11.820> be

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
fantastic dramatic effect it also can be

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.589 
fantastic dramatic effect it also can be
something<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.349> very<00:00:13.519> simplistic

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
something that is very simplistic

curvature<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:18.029> building<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:18.930> simple

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
curvature of this building is so simple

things<00:00:28.470> about<00:00:28.710> designing<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.490> interior

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
things about designing in the interior

things about designing in the interior
of<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.060> car<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.779> actually<00:00:31.500> looking<00:00:31.890> at<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
of a car is actually looking at the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.410 
of a car is actually looking at the
exterior<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.640> what's<00:00:32.820> going<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
outside of the car Steve matting was

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.299 
outside of the car Steve matting was
really<00:00:36.239> strong<00:00:36.989> an<00:00:37.290> adamant<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.070> how<00:00:38.250> he

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
really strong an adamant of how he

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.190 
really strong an adamant of how he
wanted<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.850> face<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.450> car<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> exterior

wanted the face of the car the exterior

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.549 
wanted the face of the car the exterior
of<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> car<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.800> look<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:42.140> we<00:00:43.140> noticed<00:00:43.500> that

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
of the car to look and we noticed that

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.440 
of the car to look and we noticed that
strong<00:00:43.950> faces<00:00:44.399> things<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.910> people<00:00:45.270> people

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
strong faces things that people people

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.080 
strong faces things that people people
that<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> were<00:00:45.899> most<00:00:46.140> familiar<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.969> had<00:00:47.969> an

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
that you were most familiar with had an

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.910 
that you were most familiar with had an
asymmetry<00:00:48.390> about<00:00:48.870> them<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.620> take<00:00:49.739> for

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
asymmetry about them if you take for

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.270 
asymmetry about them if you take for
example<00:00:49.980> Sean<00:00:50.820> Connery<00:00:51.289> has<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> very<00:00:52.590> raised

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
example Sean Connery has a very raised

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.979 
example Sean Connery has a very raised
eyebrow<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.850> some<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.210> bond<00:00:54.420> films<00:00:54.809> and

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
eyebrow and some of the bond films and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.229 
eyebrow and some of the bond films and
Robbie<00:00:55.829> Williams<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.399> example<00:00:56.820> curls<00:00:57.090> his

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
Robbie Williams for example curls his

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.389 
Robbie Williams for example curls his
lip<00:00:57.449> up<00:00:57.600> when<00:00:57.809> he's<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.140> know<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.410> stage<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.309> we

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
lip up when he's you know on stage so we

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.220 
lip up when he's you know on stage so we
took<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.850> into<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.359> interior<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.050> car

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
took that into the interior of the car

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.290 
took that into the interior of the car
and<00:01:01.440> decided<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.160> make<00:01:02.340> an<00:01:02.489> asymmetrical

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
and decided to make an asymmetrical

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.690 
and decided to make an asymmetrical
instrument<00:01:04.229> panel<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.979> always<00:01:05.309> wanted<00:01:05.580> this

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
instrument panel we always wanted this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.000 
instrument panel we always wanted this
cockpit<00:01:05.970> feeling<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.720> feeling<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.260> very

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
cockpit feeling this feeling of very

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.490 
cockpit feeling this feeling of very
much<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.430> control<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:09.390> very<00:01:10.020> apparent<00:01:10.320> when

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
much in control it's very apparent when

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.560 
much in control it's very apparent when
you<00:01:10.619> sit<00:01:10.830> inside<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> car<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:12.060> we've<00:01:12.210> taken

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
you sit inside the car that we've taken

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.859 
you sit inside the car that we've taken
the<00:01:12.869> center<00:01:13.200> stack<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.830> we've<00:01:14.250> actually

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
the center stack and we've actually

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.600 
the center stack and we've actually
angled<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.110> towards<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> driver<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.490> we

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
angled that towards the driver that we

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.850 
angled that towards the driver that we
never<00:01:18.180> did<00:01:18.420> before<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.470> gives<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.830> a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
never did before and that gives you a

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.649 
never did before and that gives you a
self<00:01:20.250> confidence<00:01:20.790> everything<00:01:21.180> towards<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
self confidence everything towards the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.660 
self confidence everything towards the
driver<00:01:21.930> leaning<00:01:22.409> leaning<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.340> give<00:01:23.520> this

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
driver leaning leaning in to give this

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.730 
driver leaning leaning in to give this
driver<00:01:24.030> dynamic<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.960> what<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.170> wanted<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.500> do

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
driver dynamic and what we wanted to do

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.190 
driver dynamic and what we wanted to do
actually<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> xc60<00:01:27.060> was<00:01:27.659> take<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
actually with the xc60 was take it a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.840 
actually with the xc60 was take it a
little<00:01:28.470> bit<00:01:28.680> higher<00:01:28.920> give<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.579> bit<00:01:29.729> more

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
little bit higher give a little bit more

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.240 
little bit higher give a little bit more
luxury<00:01:30.240> feeling<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.869> actually<00:01:31.619> use<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
luxury feeling and actually use the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.490 
luxury feeling and actually use the
center<00:01:32.579> stack<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.240> give<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.570> Scandinavian

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
center stack to give this Scandinavian

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.370 
center stack to give this Scandinavian
feeling<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.009> also<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.369> give<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.700> asymmetry

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
feeling but also to give this asymmetry

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.690 
feeling but also to give this asymmetry
self-confidence<00:01:37.380> performance<00:01:38.040> feeling<00:01:38.579> of
