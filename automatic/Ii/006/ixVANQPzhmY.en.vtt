two-dimensional model out of a
two-dimensional<00:00:30.109> drawing<00:00:30.859> which<00:00:31.399> we<00:00:31.579> call<00:00:31.819> it

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
two-dimensional drawing which we call it

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.950 
two-dimensional drawing which we call it
live<00:00:32.750> 2d<00:00:33.079> model<00:00:33.379> and<00:00:33.590> you<00:00:34.129> can<00:00:34.340> use<00:00:34.660> live<00:00:35.660> 2d

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
live 2d model and you can use live 2d

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.990 
live 2d model and you can use live 2d
model<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:36.530> animate<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.429> also<00:00:37.670> you<00:00:37.730> can

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
model to animate and also you can

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.020 
model to animate and also you can
interact<00:00:38.420> with<00:00:38.719> live<00:00:39.019> 2d<00:00:39.320> model<00:00:42.609> so<00:00:43.609> in<00:00:43.940> a

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
interact with live 2d model so in a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.930 
interact with live 2d model so in a
nutshell<00:00:44.379> it's<00:00:45.379> what<00:00:45.949> you<00:00:46.100> draw<00:00:46.370> is<00:00:46.579> but<00:00:46.789> you

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
nutshell it's what you draw is but you

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.689 
nutshell it's what you draw is but you
move<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:47.749> this<00:00:47.929> is<00:00:48.109> just<00:00:48.320> a<00:00:48.469> an<00:00:48.710> example<00:00:49.249> of<00:00:49.550> a

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
move so this is just a an example of a

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.369 
move so this is just a an example of a
live<00:00:49.879> 2d<00:00:50.239> model<00:00:50.570> in<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:51.649> iPhone<00:00:52.429> app<00:00:52.579> and<00:00:53.289> as<00:00:54.289> you

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
live 2d model in a iPhone app and as you

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.060 
live 2d model in a iPhone app and as you
can<00:00:54.499> see<00:00:55.449> this<00:00:56.449> model<00:00:56.719> this<00:00:57.079> character<00:00:57.890> is

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
can see this model this character is

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.979 
can see this model this character is
interacting<00:00:58.699> with<00:00:58.909> my<00:00:59.269> finger<00:00:59.719> and<00:00:59.929> my

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
interacting with my finger and my

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.220 
interacting with my finger and my
emotions<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:01.039> this<00:01:01.940> is<00:01:02.059> not<00:01:02.239> a<00:01:02.269> video<00:01:02.510> this<00:01:03.050> is

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
emotions and this is not a video this is

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.439 
emotions and this is not a video this is
a<00:01:03.260> model<00:01:03.649> that<00:01:03.679> you're<00:01:03.890> interacting<00:01:04.220> with<00:01:04.460> so

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
a model that you're interacting with so

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.109 
a model that you're interacting with so
this<00:01:05.990> model<00:01:06.380> was<00:01:07.009> made<00:01:07.040> out<00:01:07.340> of<00:01:07.549> a<00:01:07.850> single

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
this model was made out of a single

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.620 
this model was made out of a single
drawing<00:01:08.560> not<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:11.439> series<00:01:12.439> of<00:01:13.360> drawings<00:01:14.360> just

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
drawing not the series of drawings just

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.100 
drawing not the series of drawings just
a<00:01:14.960> one<00:01:15.170> single<00:01:15.890> drawing<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:16.490> we<00:01:17.240> layout

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
a one single drawing and we layout

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.580 
a one single drawing and we layout
polygons<00:01:18.829> and<00:01:19.159> at<00:01:19.640> motion<00:01:20.060> parameters<00:01:20.689> so

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
polygons and at motion parameters so

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.209 
polygons and at motion parameters so
that<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:23.030> character<00:01:23.570> looks<00:01:24.320> exactly<00:01:25.009> how<00:01:25.159> you

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
that the character looks exactly how you

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.459 
that the character looks exactly how you
want<00:01:25.549> it<00:01:25.579> to<00:01:25.700> look<00:01:25.820> at<00:01:26.119> each<00:01:26.570> directions<00:01:27.170> you

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
want it to look at each directions you

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.660 
want it to look at each directions you
know<00:01:27.590> each<00:01:27.979> different<00:01:29.799> expressions<00:01:30.799> or

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
know each different expressions or

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.029 
know each different expressions or
emotions<00:01:32.270> what<00:01:33.049> we<00:01:33.170> really<00:01:33.409> believe<00:01:33.439> is<00:01:33.890> that

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
emotions what we really believe is that

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.100 
emotions what we really believe is that
the<00:01:34.280> it's<00:01:34.960> drawing<00:01:35.960> can<00:01:36.289> be<00:01:36.320> really<00:01:36.710> powerful

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
the it's drawing can be really powerful

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.520 
the it's drawing can be really powerful
you<00:01:39.110> can<00:01:39.399> you<00:01:40.399> you<00:01:41.299> can<00:01:41.479> create<00:01:41.719> anger<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.350> can

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
you can you you can create anger you can
