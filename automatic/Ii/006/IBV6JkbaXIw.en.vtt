00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.910 
to that that I forgot that it's stupid
well<00:04:08.450> I<00:04:08.480> mean<00:04:08.600> third<00:04:09.319> strike<00:04:09.560> it's<00:04:09.709> all<00:04:09.800> about

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
well I mean third strike it's all about

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.410 
well I mean third strike it's all about
four<00:04:10.190> words<00:04:10.400> I<00:04:10.610> thought<00:04:10.819> the<00:04:10.970> other<00:04:11.150> choice

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
four words I thought the other choice

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.360 
four words I thought the other choice
same<00:04:11.750> thing<00:04:14.140> no<00:04:15.140> no<00:04:15.200> like<00:04:15.680> medium<00:04:15.950> kick<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:16.280> at

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
same thing no no like medium kick and at

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.710 
same thing no no like medium kick and at
least<00:04:16.459> four<00:04:16.730> words<00:04:16.880> a<00:04:16.940> little<00:04:17.030> riskier<00:04:17.540> than<00:04:17.600> a

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
least four words a little riskier than a

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.990 
least four words a little riskier than a
short<00:04:18.320> I<00:04:18.560> guess<00:04:19.160> but<00:04:19.519> it's<00:04:19.639> just<00:04:19.760> because<00:04:19.940> the

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
short I guess but it's just because the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.050 
short I guess but it's just because the
game<00:04:20.120> is<00:04:20.239> slower<00:04:21.490> so<00:04:22.490> so<00:04:22.639> much<00:04:22.760> easier<00:04:23.000> to

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
game is slower so so much easier to

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.920 
game is slower so so much easier to
confirm<00:04:23.360> that<00:04:24.880> anyway<00:04:25.880> John<00:04:26.150> Greyson<00:04:26.570> up<00:04:26.780> by
