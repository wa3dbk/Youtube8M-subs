they're like us
I<00:01:13.310> was<00:01:14.180> thinking<00:01:14.540> that<00:01:14.600> maybe<00:01:15.430> we<00:01:16.430> could

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
I was thinking that maybe we could

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.200 
I was thinking that maybe we could
initiate<00:01:18.350> other<00:01:18.890> people<00:01:19.370> into<00:01:19.910> future

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
initiate other people into future

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.460 
initiate other people into future
muffins<00:01:20.540> bunches<00:01:20.900> so<00:01:21.050> we<00:01:21.170> would<00:01:21.320> have

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
muffins bunches so we would have

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.710 
muffins bunches so we would have
different<00:01:21.710> days<00:01:21.980> of<00:01:22.010> the<00:01:22.400> week<00:01:22.520> because<00:01:23.510> I

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
different days of the week because I

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.610 
different days of the week because I
think<00:01:23.780> that'd<00:01:24.020> be<00:01:24.050> a<00:01:24.170> really<00:01:24.350> good<00:01:24.530> idea

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
think that'd be a really good idea

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.250 
think that'd be a really good idea
because<00:01:25.100> we<00:01:25.790> have<00:01:25.940> like<00:01:26.150> zero<00:01:26.780> views<00:01:27.020> on<00:01:27.170> all

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
because we have like zero views on all

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:35.110 
because we have like zero views on all
our<00:01:27.410> videos<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:28.810> yeah<00:01:33.400> so<00:01:34.400> what<00:01:34.790> do<00:01:34.850> you<00:01:34.910> think

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
our videos and yeah so what do you think

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.420

we could have I don't know we could just

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.780 
we could have I don't know we could just
