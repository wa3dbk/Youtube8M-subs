00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
plate so I've actually made some march

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.160 
plate so I've actually made some march
here<00:00:34.149> to<00:00:35.879> where<00:00:36.879> I<00:00:36.910> found<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:37.570> camera<00:00:37.780> to<00:00:38.050> be<00:00:38.140> a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
here to where I found the camera to be a

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.139 
here to where I found the camera to be a
perfectly<00:00:38.800> balanced<00:00:39.339> i<00:00:39.429> read<00:00:39.730> i<00:00:39.760> could<00:00:40.030> go

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
perfectly balanced i read i could go

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.270 
perfectly balanced i read i could go
ahead<00:00:40.210> and<00:00:40.629> i<00:00:40.960> can<00:00:41.140> just<00:00:41.289> tighten<00:00:41.649> up<00:00:41.829> that<00:00:41.890> set

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
ahead and i can just tighten up that set

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.450 
ahead and i can just tighten up that set

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
added a handle padding here this is

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.240 
added a handle padding here this is
nothing<00:00:55.750> more<00:00:55.930> than<00:00:55.989> a<00:00:56.410> little<00:00:56.770> type

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
nothing more than a little type

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.689

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
insulator pad and i added on to our mini

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.180 
insulator pad and i added on to our mini
tripod<00:01:01.180> that<00:01:01.390> we<00:01:01.510> use<00:01:01.690> it<00:01:01.840> to<00:01:01.870> gamble<00:01:02.320> that

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
tripod that we use it to gamble that

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.740 
tripod that we use it to gamble that
makes<00:01:03.489> shooting<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.239> little<00:01:04.390> bit<00:01:04.600> more

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
makes shooting a little bit more

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.040 
makes shooting a little bit more
comfortable<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.530> also<00:01:06.520> damping<00:01:07.420> some<00:01:07.720> of<00:01:07.869> the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
comfortable and also damping some of the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.469 
comfortable and also damping some of the
rocking<00:01:08.619> motion<00:01:08.650> and<00:01:09.130> that<00:01:09.250> sort<00:01:09.520> of<00:01:09.550> thing<00:01:09.610> so

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
rocking motion and that sort of thing so

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.660 
rocking motion and that sort of thing so
you<00:01:10.570> can<00:01:10.600> kind<00:01:10.930> of<00:01:10.990> basically<00:01:11.800> you<00:01:12.340> can<00:01:12.490> use

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
you can kind of basically you can use

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.149 
you can kind of basically you can use
this<00:01:12.820> two-headed<00:01:13.659> most<00:01:14.050> two<00:01:14.680> different<00:01:15.009> way

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
this two-headed most two different way

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.249 
this two-headed most two different way
and<00:01:17.130> he's<00:01:18.130> completely<00:01:18.310> hands-free<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.390> you

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
stabilizer here also I've added a nut to

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.400 
stabilizer here also I've added a nut to
screw<00:01:32.890> here<00:01:33.250> on<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.970> bottom<00:01:34.119> or<00:01:34.509> i<00:01:34.899> can<00:01:35.050> add

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410
