difference it's just that little bit of
black<00:01:57.579> is<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.850> little<00:01:58.090> thicker<00:01:58.450> so<00:01:58.570> overall<00:01:59.530> not

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
black is a little thicker so overall not

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.760 
black is a little thicker so overall not
much<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.600> difference<00:02:02.079> you're<00:02:02.439> gonna<00:02:02.560> be

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
much of a difference you're gonna be

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.219 
much of a difference you're gonna be
getting<00:02:03.069> a<00:02:03.189> sleek<00:02:03.640> phone<00:02:04.030> that<00:02:04.659> looks<00:02:04.929> great

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
feels great operates great fast and

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.050 
feels great operates great fast and
steady<00:02:07.780> all<00:02:08.130> for<00:02:09.130> just<00:02:09.280> a<00:02:09.369> little<00:02:09.490> bit<00:02:09.610> more<00:02:10.000> I

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
steady all for just a little bit more I

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.370 
steady all for just a little bit more I
haven't<00:02:10.360> really<00:02:10.509> powered<00:02:10.780> this<00:02:10.869> one<00:02:11.050> on<00:02:11.170> yet

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
haven't really powered this one on yet

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.890 
haven't really powered this one on yet
but<00:02:12.010> we've<00:02:12.280> already<00:02:12.430> seen<00:02:12.670> plenty<00:02:12.880> about<00:02:13.210> the

but we've already seen plenty about the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.310 
but we've already seen plenty about the

razor max and the Droid Razr HD as far

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.170 
razor max and the Droid Razr HD as far
as<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.530> software<00:02:17.830> here<00:02:18.010> with<00:02:18.130> Android<00:02:18.430> 4.0<00:02:18.940> so

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
as the software here with Android 4.0 so

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.650 
as the software here with Android 4.0 so
the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.620 
the
difference<00:02:19.990> here<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.800> is<00:02:21.120> $1.99<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.420> this

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
difference here this is $1.99 and this

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.530 
difference here this is $1.99 and this
is<00:02:22.810> $2.99<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:23.680> has<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:24.030> 2500<00:02:25.030> milliamp<00:02:25.360> hour

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
is $2.99 this has a 2500 milliamp hour

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.950 
is $2.99 this has a 2500 milliamp hour
battery<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:26.470> is<00:02:26.650> 3300<00:02:27.340> milliamps<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.210> before

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
battery this is 3300 milliamps so before

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.020 
battery this is 3300 milliamps so before
it<00:02:29.020> was<00:02:29.080> almost<00:02:29.290> double<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.920> original<00:02:30.070> but

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
it was almost double the original but

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.960 
it was almost double the original but
here<00:02:31.450> with<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.660> HD<00:02:32.140> it's<00:02:33.070> it's<00:02:33.430> just<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.820> little

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
here with the HD it's it's just a little

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.230 
here with the HD it's it's just a little
bit<00:02:34.150> bigger<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:35.220> 2530<00:02:36.220> milliamp<00:02:36.640> hours<00:02:37.030> and

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
bit bigger so 2530 milliamp hours and

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.620 
bit bigger so 2530 milliamp hours and
this<00:02:37.750> one<00:02:37.990> comes<00:02:38.290> with<00:02:38.430> 3300<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:40.030> look<00:02:40.540> you

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
this one comes with 3300 so look you

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.910 
this one comes with 3300 so look you
still<00:02:40.810> gave<00:02:40.990> you<00:02:41.020> a<00:02:41.110> decent<00:02:41.380> amount<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.800> then

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
still gave you a decent amount and then

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.800 
still gave you a decent amount and then
it<00:02:42.040> also<00:02:42.250> has<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:43.000> 32<00:02:43.420> gigs<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.750> internal

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
it also has a 32 gigs of internal

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.610 
it also has a 32 gigs of internal
storage<00:02:44.440> this<00:02:45.250> only<00:02:45.580> has<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:46.120> 16<00:02:46.630> but<00:02:47.320> they<00:02:47.500> both

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
storage this only has a 16 but they both

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.620 
storage this only has a 16 but they both
have<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.040> SD<00:02:48.400> slot<00:02:48.640> on<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.880> side<00:02:49.060> for

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
have the SD slot on the side for

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.040 
have the SD slot on the side for
expanded<00:02:50.170> storage<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:51.220> what<00:02:51.370> we<00:02:51.460> have<00:02:51.640> here

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
expanded storage so what we have here

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.150 
expanded storage so what we have here
just<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.170> little<00:02:53.260> bit<00:02:53.410> more<00:02:53.620> onboard<00:02:53.980> storage

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
just a little bit more onboard storage

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.400 
just a little bit more onboard storage
bigger<00:02:54.550> battery<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:55.450> will<00:02:55.570> run<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.840> $100

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
bigger battery and it will run you $100

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.220 
bigger battery and it will run you $100
more<00:02:56.740> so<00:02:57.070> whether<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:58.300> something<00:02:58.660> you'd

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
more so whether that is something you'd

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.890 
more so whether that is something you'd
like<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.620> do<00:02:59.770> is<00:02:59.920> up<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.690> personally<00:03:01.690> I

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
like to do is up to you personally I

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.050 
like to do is up to you personally I
mean<00:03:02.290> if<00:03:02.740> you<00:03:02.980> need<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.340> battery<00:03:03.640> life<00:03:03.820> this

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
mean if you need the battery life this

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.870 
mean if you need the battery life this
is<00:03:04.210> 100%<00:03:04.780> worth<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.620> get<00:03:06.040> extra<00:03:06.370> storage<00:03:06.700> and

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
is 100% worth it get extra storage and

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.510 
is 100% worth it get extra storage and
just<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.240> tiny<00:03:07.600> bit<00:03:07.810> bigger<00:03:08.080> of<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.320> phone<00:03:08.590> for

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
just a tiny bit bigger of a phone for

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.880 
just a tiny bit bigger of a phone for
four<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.180> know<00:03:10.270> hardly<00:03:10.600> any<00:03:10.930> compromise<00:03:11.620> here

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
four you know hardly any compromise here

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.100 
four you know hardly any compromise here
it<00:03:12.010> really<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.370> is<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.360> sleek<00:03:13.840> phone

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
it really is is this a sleek phone

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.560 
it really is is this a sleek phone
overall<00:03:14.530> so<00:03:14.830> this<00:03:15.040> puts<00:03:15.340> anything<00:03:16.150> else<00:03:16.390> to

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
overall so this puts anything else to

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.210 
overall so this puts anything else to
shame<00:03:16.810> in<00:03:16.990> terms<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.380> battery<00:03:17.560> life<00:03:17.830> that<00:03:18.100> is

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
shame in terms of battery life that is

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.010 
shame in terms of battery life that is
foreshore<00:03:18.850> between<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.300> big<00:03:19.480> battery<00:03:19.840> and

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
foreshore between that big battery and

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
the Snapdragon s4 processor can be

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.050 
the Snapdragon s4 processor can be
