how<00:02:53.040> on<00:02:53.370> my<00:02:54.000> inspiration<00:02:54.720> piece<00:02:54.959> because<00:02:55.380> I

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
how on my inspiration piece because I

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.800 
how on my inspiration piece because I
was<00:02:55.950> looking<00:02:56.130> off<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.820> side<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.480> wanted

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
was looking off to the side so I wanted

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.990 
was looking off to the side so I wanted
to<00:02:57.870> make<00:02:58.020> sure<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:59.370> did<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.790> same<00:03:00.090> thing

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
to make sure that I did the same thing

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.310 
to make sure that I did the same thing
it<00:03:03.000> looks<00:03:03.180> like<00:03:03.300> he'slooking<00:03:04.020> to<00:03:04.230> the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
it looks like he'slooking to the

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.100 
it looks like he'slooking to the
left<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.680> little<00:03:04.709> bit<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:06.150> takes<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.570> white<00:03:06.750> gel

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
left a little bit and takes a white gel

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:15.350 
left a little bit and takes a white gel
pen<00:03:10.880> make<00:03:11.880> this<00:03:12.030> eye<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:13.610> then<00:03:14.610> for<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.970> fins

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
pen make this eye and then for the fins

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.300 
pen make this eye and then for the fins
I<00:03:15.810> thought<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.410> know<00:03:16.530> what<00:03:16.739> I<00:03:16.920> think<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.280> can

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
I thought you know what I think I can

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.960 
I thought you know what I think I can
use<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.870> wing<00:03:19.350> off<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.160> two<00:03:20.370> stepford

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
use the the wing off of the two stepford

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.840 
use the the wing off of the two stepford
hunch<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:23.070> go<00:03:24.030> ahead<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.540> punch<00:03:25.640> through<00:03:26.640> the

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
hunch and go ahead and punch through the

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.050 
hunch and go ahead and punch through the
wings<00:03:27.060> out<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:29.190> wings<00:03:29.370> are<00:03:29.549> on<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.850> top

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
wings out and the wings are on the top

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.789 
wings out and the wings are on the top
of<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.390> punch<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:30.720> that's<00:03:31.080> good<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.560> don't

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
of the punch so that's good you don't

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.370 
of the punch so that's good you don't
need<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.040> necessarily<00:03:32.160> punch<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.120> whole<00:03:33.380> bird

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
need to necessarily punch the whole bird

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.300 
need to necessarily punch the whole bird
out<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:36.200> I've<00:03:37.200> made<00:03:37.440> these<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.709> couple<00:03:38.190> of

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
out and I've made these a couple of

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.150 
out and I've made these a couple of
times<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:39.000> for<00:03:39.269> me<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.630> trick<00:03:39.870> is<00:03:40.160> I'm

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
times and so for me the trick is I'm

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.900 
times and so for me the trick is I'm
calling<00:03:41.580> this<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.820> belly<00:03:42.269> part<00:03:43.019> of<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.980> of

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
calling this the belly part of the of

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.729 
calling this the belly part of the of
the<00:03:45.180> wing<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.630> we'll<00:03:46.620> put<00:03:46.799> our<00:03:46.970> two<00:03:47.970> way<00:03:48.120> glue

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
the wing and we'll put our two way glue

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:55.940 
the wing and we'll put our two way glue
loop<00:03:49.739> then<00:03:50.010> down<00:03:50.250> there<00:03:50.489> and

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.770 

I'm<00:03:56.459> gonna<00:03:56.580> have<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.819> have<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.030> face<00:03:57.330> me<00:03:57.569> for

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
I'm gonna have to have it face me for

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.670 
I'm gonna have to have it face me for
just<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.110> second<00:03:59.450> and<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.599> becomes<00:04:01.019> his<00:04:01.290> top

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
just a second and that becomes his top

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.229 
just a second and that becomes his top
thin<00:04:03.019> see<00:04:04.019> how<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.379> that<00:04:04.920> looks<00:04:05.220> I'm<00:04:05.910> sure

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
thin see how that that looks I'm sure

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.059 
thin see how that that looks I'm sure
you<00:04:06.420> can<00:04:06.569> make<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.959> little<00:04:07.140> sharp<00:04:07.530> or<00:04:07.709> something

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
you can make a little sharp or something

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.240 
you can make a little sharp or something
out<00:04:08.190> of<00:04:08.220> that<00:04:08.459> as<00:04:08.640> well<00:04:08.849> and<00:04:09.260> then<00:04:10.260> again<00:04:11.010> put

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
out of that as well and then again put

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.319 
out of that as well and then again put
the<00:04:11.459> glue<00:04:12.420> on<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.660> belly<00:04:12.959> of<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.260> wing<00:04:17.329> that

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
the glue on the belly of the wing that

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:26.360 
the glue on the belly of the wing that
underneath<00:04:22.580> and<00:04:23.900> then<00:04:24.900> for<00:04:25.139> his<00:04:25.350> tail<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:26.190> took

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
underneath and then for his tail I took

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.690 
underneath and then for his tail I took
the<00:04:26.940> butterfly<00:04:27.389> punch<00:04:31.220> punched<00:04:32.220> one<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.490> those

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
the butterfly punch punched one of those

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.280 
the butterfly punch punched one of those
out<00:04:33.169> and<00:04:34.169> then<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:35.010> can<00:04:35.220> either<00:04:35.460> take<00:04:35.880> an<00:04:36.290> inch

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
out and then you can either take an inch

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.860 
out and then you can either take an inch
circle<00:04:37.950> punch<00:04:37.979> or<00:04:38.610> come<00:04:38.970> back<00:04:39.150> with<00:04:39.630> the

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
one side of the wing come in and we're

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.840 
one side of the wing come in and we're
gonna<00:04:45.210> make<00:04:45.479> his<00:04:45.750> thin<00:04:46.110> part<00:04:46.470> but<00:04:47.310> quite
