00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.860

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.110

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.940
 Ribbon square of course they are 5 by 5 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.030
 centimeters which we most often 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.170
 use with you and what else do we need 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.579
 scissors and lighter this petal 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.469
 you can do two-color can 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.989
 one color I will show you today 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.390
 how we make two-color here recently we 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.690
 did you make a petal like that 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.509
 triangular in round as if yes he is very 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:15.450
 similar to this one a little bit different 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:18.619
 technology so let's put yes that is 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.630
 everything is all the same as they did 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:26.369
 there is a triangular petal in a round 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:31.490
 called here and so do matter further 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.470
 all the same one here alone here 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.720
 now back the same thing happens here 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.940
 so here we have a petal but here already 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.759

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.759

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.979
 another fold 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.340
 It turns out that such a petal is very 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.420
