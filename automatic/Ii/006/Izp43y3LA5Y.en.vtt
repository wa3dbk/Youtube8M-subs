together<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.680> also<00:01:01.829> get<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.489> system<00:01:04.670> you

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
together you also get the system you

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.340 
together you also get the system you
also<00:01:05.820> get<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:07.229> san<00:01:08.189> jamar<00:01:08.720> system<00:01:09.720> setting<00:01:10.200> us

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.850 
also get the san jamar system setting us
so<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.439> one<00:01:13.710> has<00:01:14.990> enabled<00:01:15.990> tablet<00:01:16.680> mode

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
so so this one has enabled tablet mode

so so this one has enabled tablet mode
as<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.460> my<00:01:17.640> other<00:01:17.790> ports<00:01:18.210> does<00:01:18.479> not<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.990> them

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
as of my other ports does not have them

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.130 
as of my other ports does not have them
you<00:01:19.920> cannot<00:01:20.220> switch<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.479> tablet<00:01:21.960> node

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140

android<00:01:27.750> settings<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.380> fully<00:01:28.650> functioning

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
android settings is fully functioning

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.810 
android settings is fully functioning
and<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:30.780> course<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.619> get<00:01:31.860> some<00:01:32.130> force

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and of course you do get some force

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.450 
and of course you do get some force
closest<00:01:33.270> because<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.619> combine<00:01:35.100> there

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
closest because you just combine there

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.539 
closest because you just combine there
were<00:01:35.490> two<00:01:35.790> roms<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.390> 213<00:01:38.240> actually<00:01:40.070> two<00:01:41.070> really

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
were two roms in 213 actually two really

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.490 
were two roms in 213 actually two really
can't<00:01:41.729> avoid<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.689> kind<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.049> hard<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
can't avoid that it's kind of hard to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.730 
can't avoid that it's kind of hard to
disable<00:01:44.250> them<00:01:44.369> all<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:45.420> they<00:01:46.369> actually<00:01:47.369> work

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
disable them all but they actually work

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.520 
disable them all but they actually work
and<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.310> didn't<00:01:50.729> take<00:01:50.939> effect<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.750> it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
and that didn't take effect and it

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.580 
and that didn't take effect and it
smells<00:01:53.009> out<00:01:53.360> yeah

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.060 

so<00:01:58.159> what<00:01:58.429> really<00:01:58.670> works<00:01:58.850> is<00:01:59.710> everything<00:02:00.710> don't

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
so what really works is everything don't

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.690 
so what really works is everything don't
touch<00:02:01.460> these<00:02:01.759> two<00:02:02.469> tiny<00:02:03.469> tools<00:02:03.920> in<00:02:04.369> here

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
touch these two tiny tools in here

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.630 
touch these two tiny tools in here
because<00:02:05.149> it<00:02:05.420> could<00:02:05.689> kill<00:02:06.229> your<00:02:06.380> phone<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.490> the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
because it could kill your phone so the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.779 
because it could kill your phone so the
SAS<00:02:07.909> bar<00:02:08.239> really<00:02:08.720> works<00:02:09.280> battery<00:02:10.280> Trisha

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
SAS bar really works battery Trisha

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.320 
SAS bar really works battery Trisha
Barry<00:02:11.060> style<00:02:11.420> by<00:02:11.870> our<00:02:12.019> icon<00:02:12.379> I<00:02:12.620> context<00:02:13.370> that

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
Barry style by our icon I context that

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.309 
Barry style by our icon I context that
one<00:02:14.480> looks<00:02:14.750> like<00:02:14.840> nonsense<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.709> very<00:02:16.430> well<00:02:16.640> and

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
one looks like nonsense is very well and

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.539 
one looks like nonsense is very well and
that<00:02:18.319> bar<00:02:18.560> don't<00:02:18.920> happen<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.340> bar<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:21.549> yeah

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
that bar don't happen that bar so yeah

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.380 
that bar don't happen that bar so yeah
performance<00:02:23.330> peeps<00:02:23.739> understand<00:02:25.390> navigation

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
performance peeps understand navigation

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.569 
performance peeps understand navigation
bar<00:02:26.599> I<00:02:26.629> can<00:02:26.870> able<00:02:27.049> the<00:02:27.319> fat<00:02:27.590> bar<00:02:29.530> that's<00:02:30.530> big<00:02:31.010> so

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
bar I can able the fat bar that's big so

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.600 
bar I can able the fat bar that's big so
I<00:02:31.610> was<00:02:32.120> included<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.780> nice<00:02:33.500> boot<00:02:33.980> animation

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
I was included a nice boot animation

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.569 
I was included a nice boot animation
from<00:02:34.819> pac-man<00:02:35.590> makes<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.860> experience<00:02:37.010> more

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
from pac-man makes the experience more

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.199 
from pac-man makes the experience more
nicer<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:39.650> cannot<00:02:39.950> avoid<00:02:40.340> force<00:02:40.760> closes

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
nicer so you cannot avoid force closes

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.360 
nicer so you cannot avoid force closes
because<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.780> can<00:02:42.079> combine<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.860> Paranoid

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
because you can combine the Paranoid

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.460 
because you can combine the Paranoid

Android and aokp sand and mud into one
blast<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:51.310> they<00:02:52.310> could<00:02:52.549> conflict<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.650> give

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
blast so they could conflict and give

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.490 
blast so they could conflict and give
you<00:02:55.810> one<00:02:56.810> tiny<00:02:57.440> fourth<00:02:58.340> was<00:02:58.700> this<00:02:59.510> this<00:03:00.049> tiny

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
you one tiny fourth was this this tiny

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.449 
you one tiny fourth was this this tiny
area<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:02.030> it's<00:03:02.540> not<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:03.139> hard<00:03:03.319> so<00:03:03.829> this<00:03:04.160> is<00:03:04.430> a

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
area so it's not that hard so this is a

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.650

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.949 
boot animation from pack and so at first
boot<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.560> might<00:03:09.829> take<00:03:10.069> a<00:03:10.100> while<00:03:10.600> it's<00:03:11.600> going<00:03:11.900> to

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959
