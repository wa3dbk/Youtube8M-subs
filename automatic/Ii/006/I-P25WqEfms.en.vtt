at<00:00:27.090> e3<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.449> previewed<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.650> was

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
at e3 I previewed this and I was

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.200 
at e3 I previewed this and I was
actually<00:00:29.130> i<00:00:29.160> came<00:00:29.369> away<00:00:29.490> surprised<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.060> thought

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
actually i came away surprised I thought

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.820 
actually i came away surprised I thought
it<00:00:30.300> was<00:00:30.390> really<00:00:30.660> cool<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.050> expected<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.590> suck

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
it was really cool I expected it to suck

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.200 
it was really cool I expected it to suck
but<00:00:32.009> despite<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.550> was<00:00:32.790> still<00:00:32.969> worried

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
but despite that I was still worried

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.850 
but despite that I was still worried
about<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> full<00:00:33.719> main<00:00:33.960> game<00:00:34.260> would<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.620> hold

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
about the full main game would it hold

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.770 
about the full main game would it hold
my<00:00:35.040> interest<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.910> turns<00:00:36.090> out<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.480> actually

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
my interest and it turns out it actually

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.420 
my interest and it turns out it actually
really<00:00:36.960> does<00:00:37.050> well<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.770> don't<00:00:38.010> think<00:00:38.070> dying

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
really does well I don't think dying

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.459 
really does well I don't think dying
light<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:39.000> everybody<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.570> think<00:00:39.989> some

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
light is for everybody I think some

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.569 
light is for everybody I think some
people<00:00:40.559> are<00:00:40.800> really<00:00:41.040> gonna<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> good<00:00:41.460> time

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
people are really gonna have a good time

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.979 
people are really gonna have a good time
with<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.850> if<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.030> makes<00:00:42.239> sense<00:00:42.360> dying<00:00:42.750> light

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
with it if this makes sense dying light

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.020 
with it if this makes sense dying light

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
kind of cater to my less critical side

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.090 
kind of cater to my less critical side

light is just a lot of fun it's really

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.920 
light is just a lot of fun it's really
simple<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> combat<00:01:03.329> there's<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:03.750> really

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
simple the combat there's not really

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.509 
simple the combat there's not really
much<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.830> visceral<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
much to it but it is visceral and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.050 
much to it but it is visceral and
hard-hitting

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
hard-hitting

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.640 
hard-hitting
despite<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.750> there's<00:01:06.960> not<00:01:07.080> really<00:01:07.140> much<00:01:07.590> you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
despite that there's not really much you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.410 
despite that there's not really much you
can<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.040> other<00:01:08.280> than<00:01:08.400> swing<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.090> zombie's

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
can do other than swing and a zombie's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.210 
can do other than swing and a zombie's
head<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.600> thousand<00:01:10.110> times<00:01:10.290> until<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:10.799> die<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
head a thousand times until they die and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.770 
head a thousand times until they die and
honestly<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:11.939> pretty<00:01:12.119> difficult<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.570> kill<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
honestly it's pretty difficult to kill a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.179 
honestly it's pretty difficult to kill a
zombie<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.260> pretty<00:01:13.439> much<00:01:13.590> find<00:01:13.890> yourself

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
zombie you pretty much find yourself

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.620 
zombie you pretty much find yourself
avoiding<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> most<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.180> game<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.509> that's

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
avoiding the most of the game and that's

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.300 
avoiding the most of the game and that's
kind<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.930> cool<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.290> game<00:01:16.439> has<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> lot<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.979> pros

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
kind of cool the game has a lot of pros

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.590 
kind of cool the game has a lot of pros
on<00:01:17.520> its<00:01:17.670> list<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> most<00:01:18.150> part<00:01:18.450> it's

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
what they were doing but despite that

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.570

that's all you
we<00:02:13.560> do<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:13.920> game<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.310> run<00:02:14.850> from<00:02:15.060> A<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.180> B

we do in this game is run from A to B

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.050 
we do in this game is run from A to B
kill<00:02:16.020> some<00:02:16.200> zombies<00:02:16.230> claim<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.070> point<00:02:17.430> or<00:02:17.760> grab

kill some zombies claim a point or grab

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.730 
kill some zombies claim a point or grab
a<00:02:18.090> thing<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.690> bring<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.020> back<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.380> there<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.710> a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
a thing and bring it back and there is a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.100 
a thing and bring it back and there is a
lot<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.310> walking<00:02:21.030> around<00:02:21.300> there<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.540> no<00:02:21.750> fast

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
lot of walking around there is no fast

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.510 
lot of walking around there is no fast
travel<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.740> think<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.070> kind<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.310> maybe

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
travel and I think it's kind of maybe

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.680 
travel and I think it's kind of maybe
like<00:02:23.730> they<00:02:23.910> tried<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.150> make<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> game<00:02:24.660> a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
like they tried to make the game a

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.510 
like they tried to make the game a
little<00:02:25.020> longer<00:02:25.260> by<00:02:25.590> making<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.070> do<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.250> mission

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
little longer by making you do a mission

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.730 
little longer by making you do a mission
and<00:02:26.850> run<00:02:27.030> all<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.450> way<00:02:27.480> across<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.080> map<00:02:28.260> but

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
and run all the way across the map but

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.950 
and run all the way across the map but
despite<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.490> map<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.030> varied<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.660> so

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
despite that the map is so varied and so

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.990 
despite that the map is so varied and so
enjoyable<00:02:31.410> there's<00:02:31.650> two<00:02:31.830> big<00:02:32.070> sections<00:02:32.550> it's

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000
