are pretty expensive I don't know the

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.250 
are pretty expensive I don't know the
exact<00:07:32.050> cost<00:07:32.320> but<00:07:33.070> these<00:07:33.730> six<00:07:34.630> elites<00:07:34.960> would<00:07:35.110> be

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:37.930 
about 400 ATK and then the Gold's would

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.310
