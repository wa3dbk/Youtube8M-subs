anything like the Conchords have to get
them<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.700> know<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.390> letting<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:52.590> a

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
them so you know just letting see a

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.209 
them so you know just letting see a
similarities<00:01:54.530> laces<00:01:55.530> similar<00:01:57.829> you<00:01:58.829> know<00:01:58.860> and

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
similarities laces similar you know and

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.039 
similarities laces similar you know and
it's<00:01:59.369> got<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> Col<00:01:59.820> away<00:02:00.060> basically<00:02:00.479> yet<00:02:00.810> I

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
it's got the Col away basically yet I

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.389 
it's got the Col away basically yet I
think<00:02:01.439> they<00:02:01.619> could<00:02:01.799> have<00:02:01.890> done<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.070> better<00:02:02.159> job

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
think they could have done a better job

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.459 
think they could have done a better job
with<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.049> how<00:02:04.049> they<00:02:04.200> did<00:02:06.079> black<00:02:07.079> patent

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
with the how they did black patent

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.719 
with the how they did black patent
leather<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.829> would<00:02:08.099> have<00:02:08.190> spread<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.580> out<00:02:08.670> a

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
leather I would have spread it out a

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.460 
leather I would have spread it out a
little<00:02:08.940> more<00:02:09.209> than<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.840> toe<00:02:10.020> box<00:02:10.319> but

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
little more than just a toe box but

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.890 
little more than just a toe box but
we'll<00:02:12.370> see<00:02:12.640> I'm<00:02:13.150> hoping<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.630> they<00:02:13.750> don't

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
we'll see I'm hoping that they don't

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.300 
we'll see I'm hoping that they don't
crease<00:02:14.380> up<00:02:14.590> too<00:02:14.830> much

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
crease up too much

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.760 
crease up too much
when<00:02:15.460> I<00:02:15.490> finally<00:02:15.760> wear<00:02:16.120> them<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.560> will<00:02:17.560> get

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
when I finally wear them I will get

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.370 
when I finally wear them I will get
around<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.160> wearing<00:02:18.430> them<00:02:18.490> eventually<00:02:19.320> but<00:02:20.320> uh

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
around to wearing them eventually but uh

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.320 
around to wearing them eventually but uh
you<00:02:21.070> know<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.280> was<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.430> real<00:02:21.670> simple

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
you know it was a real simple

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.110 
you know it was a real simple
she<00:02:22.660> picked<00:02:23.260> these<00:02:23.380> up<00:02:23.440> early<00:02:24.010> before<00:02:24.580> release

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
she picked these up early before release

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.310 
she picked these up early before release
actually<00:02:25.360> off<00:02:25.810> ebay<00:02:26.530> they<00:02:27.280> were<00:02:27.340> 100<00:02:27.730> bucks

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320
