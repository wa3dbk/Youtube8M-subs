00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.680
 I think they got it right 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.820
 in this proposal 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.430
 the state to take off 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.800

 I think this example of the town hall should be followed in other 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.220
 cameras should be followed in other environments I think the whole state could 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.420
 To have all that Brazil could have is an opportunity and I 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.590

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.079
 knowing that it is a good project 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.609
 after taking the lingering here because it's upgraded 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:06.569
 It is true that we here in Italy face Egypt - come on we think 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:15.349
 I've been halfway to what the breathalyzer test wants to celebrate 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.379
 marked their learning, the preference is 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.559

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:26.910
 a confectionery shop 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.190
 is that the guild will have to take a meal that exactly 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.509
 It's hard to take a teacher. 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:35.819
 it was complicated but 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.830
 are many details that 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.409
 sometimes make the 2004 difference in the heart since he frequents it 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:45.409
 the debates of my inauguration was the 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:51.139
 This is a place I like very often when there are 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.629
 defect something this most of the time praise very much praise many to 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.889
 comenda is always good here and I'm suspicious to say that family 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.580
 really is very good massage done here not everything fresh you see they are 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.509
 products 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.629
 assumptions such as 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:10.139
 and made with carts that the mother always important her splendor the students 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.139
 on here 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.009
 to keep an eye on this kid is here to take him to work 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:17.339
 with them the good ones here 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.379
 Tidy jobs in the city 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:23.189
 need more than 100 projects in Brazil 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.139
 Pine 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.029
 not only here in são paulo 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:30.210
 but they were from the chamber but the legislative assemblies cesare alippi 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.189
 because even bringing people indoors 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:38.719
 and it is a necessary service, do not comment on São Paulo, that the city of 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.249
 the restaurants' 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:42.889
 and to me it's very good 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.740
 This year we've been committing 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.289
 talk again about how much time this time is not in the right place and on the way 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:48.990
 right 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.990
 a lot of satire, thank you
