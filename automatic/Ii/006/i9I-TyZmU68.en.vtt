you<00:03:13.920> see<00:03:14.129> that<00:03:15.319> this<00:03:16.319> one's<00:03:16.500> great<00:03:16.709> because<00:03:16.769> it

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
you see that this one's great because it

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.119 
you see that this one's great because it
looks<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:18.049> blood<00:03:19.049> but<00:03:19.379> as<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.590> can<00:03:19.709> see<00:03:19.769> it's

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
looks like blood but as you can see it's

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.940 
looks like blood but as you can see it's
running<00:03:20.280> down<00:03:20.549> my<00:03:20.580> hand<00:03:20.700> very<00:03:21.090> quickly<00:03:21.950> it's

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
running down my hand very quickly it's

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.300 
running down my hand very quickly it's
very<00:03:23.010> very<00:03:23.849> liquidy<00:03:24.269> I<00:03:24.769> find<00:03:25.769> that<00:03:25.950> quite

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
very very liquidy I find that quite

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:34.009 
very very liquidy I find that quite
difficult<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:27.360> apply<00:03:32.030> my<00:03:33.030> friend<00:03:33.420> used<00:03:33.659> it<00:03:33.840> and

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
difficult to apply my friend used it and

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.350 
difficult to apply my friend used it and
it<00:03:34.440> was<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.739> first<00:03:34.950> time<00:03:35.159> she<00:03:35.430> was<00:03:35.549> dying

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
it was the first time she was dying

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.729 
it was the first time she was dying
ahead<00:03:36.780> with<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:36.930> vegetarian<00:03:37.349> she<00:03:37.440> found<00:03:37.650> it

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
ahead with the vegetarian she found it

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.130 
ahead with the vegetarian she found it
really<00:03:37.860> good<00:03:38.040> because<00:03:38.690> you<00:03:39.690> can<00:03:39.840> sort<00:03:40.079> of

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
really good because you can sort of

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.949 
really good because you can sort of
spread<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.680> very<00:03:40.709> very<00:03:41.069> evenly<00:03:41.720> without<00:03:42.720> much

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
spread it very very evenly without much

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.880 
spread it very very evenly without much
hassle<00:03:44.840> but<00:03:45.840> I<00:03:45.900> find<00:03:46.230> if<00:03:46.379> you<00:03:46.470> turn<00:03:46.739> it

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
hassle but I find if you turn it

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.440 
hassle but I find if you turn it
especially<00:03:47.370> around<00:03:47.459> like<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.819> hairline<00:03:48.209> if

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
especially around like the hairline if

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.509 
especially around like the hairline if
you're<00:03:48.569> trying<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.780> paint<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.200> on<00:03:49.349> with<00:03:50.220> brush

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
you're trying to paint it on with brush

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.309 
you're trying to paint it on with brush
it's<00:03:50.790> quite<00:03:51.000> difficult<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.569> doesn't<00:03:51.840> go<00:03:51.959> onto

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
it's quite difficult it doesn't go onto

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.520 
it's quite difficult it doesn't go onto
the<00:03:52.410> brush<00:03:52.620> very<00:03:52.799> well<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:54.480> is<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.140> is<00:03:55.290> quite

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
the brush very well and is it is quite

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.809 
the brush very well and is it is quite
nice<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.890> spread<00:03:56.129> it<00:03:56.250> through<00:03:56.430> because<00:03:56.700> it's

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
nice to spread it through because it's

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.880 
nice to spread it through because it's
so<00:03:56.910> liquidy<00:03:57.329> but<00:03:57.870> especially<00:03:58.019> if<00:03:58.349> you've<00:03:58.530> wet

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
so liquidy but especially if you've wet

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.910 
so liquidy but especially if you've wet
your<00:03:59.040> hair<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.340> use<00:03:59.549> it<00:03:59.790> like<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.450> suggests<00:04:00.920> you

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
your hair to use it like it suggests you

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.319 
your hair to use it like it suggests you
can't<00:04:02.159> really<00:04:02.370> see<00:04:02.609> where<00:04:02.849> you're<00:04:03.120> applying

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329
