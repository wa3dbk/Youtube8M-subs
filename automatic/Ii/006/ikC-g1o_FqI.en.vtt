00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.350 
whenever you use a Valkyrie strategy
you're<00:01:25.740> really<00:01:26.159> relieved<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> get<00:01:27.090> one

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you're really relieved just to get one

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.050 
you're really relieved just to get one
star<00:01:27.689> maybe<00:01:28.049> two<00:01:28.380> stars<00:01:28.710> especially<00:01:29.400> against

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
star maybe two stars especially against

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.380 
star maybe two stars especially against
a<00:01:30.150> maxout<00:01:30.570> base<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.740> he's<00:01:31.920> at<00:01:32.070> 70%<00:01:32.610> he<00:01:33.119> still

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
a maxout base but he's at 70% he still

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.270 
a maxout base but he's at 70% he still
has<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> full<00:01:33.900> health<00:01:34.079> King<00:01:34.409> full<00:01:34.710> health<00:01:34.890> Queen

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
has a full health King full health Queen

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.840 
has a full health King full health Queen
pretty<00:01:36.000> much<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.860> yeah<00:01:37.860> his<00:01:38.130> Valkyries<00:01:38.640> did

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
pretty much and yeah his Valkyries did

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.609 
pretty much and yeah his Valkyries did
so<00:01:39.119> much<00:01:39.270> work<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> core<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.229> his<00:01:40.380> base

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
so much work in the core of his base

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.289 
so much work in the core of his base
that<00:01:41.189> they<00:01:41.340> should<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.729> able<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.000> run<00:01:42.180> around

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
that they should be able to run around

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.300 
that they should be able to run around
and<00:01:42.750> get<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> three-star<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> rest<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and get a three-star on the rest of the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.359 
and get a three-star on the rest of the
base<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:44.990> this<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.229> goes<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.409> show<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.770> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
base so this just goes to show you you

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.620 
base so this just goes to show you you
can<00:01:47.520> use<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> lot<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.149> different<00:01:48.420> army

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
