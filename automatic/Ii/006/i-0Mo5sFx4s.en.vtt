00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
they actually animated it better because

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.559 
they actually animated it better because
the<00:03:37.570> animation<00:03:38.140> was<00:03:38.320> very<00:03:38.560> slow<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.420> kind<00:03:40.420> of

the animation was very slow and kind of
clunky<00:03:40.810> is<00:03:41.020> even<00:03:41.530> at<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.709> dancing<00:03:42.130> scene

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
clunky is even at the dancing scene

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.280 
clunky is even at the dancing scene
which<00:03:42.640> was<00:03:42.760> my<00:03:42.880> favorite<00:03:43.030> part<00:03:43.360> but<00:03:43.600> if<00:03:43.780> if

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290
