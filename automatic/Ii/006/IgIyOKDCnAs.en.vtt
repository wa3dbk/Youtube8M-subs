00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.279
 Hello dear friends and today I 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.900
 I want to make such a small review dash 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.480
 test ganzo wife of the firm's business in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.639
 the fact that my very first leg was also 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.240
 Ganza therefore I have some kind of 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.820
 I do not know if love for this company can 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.050
 undeservedly may not know but in general 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.029
 as it is so it is in the words of one 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:31.470
 a blogger with whom I absolutely agree 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.360
 that any product can be judged by 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 his most budget line for example 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.870
 there is a clock there 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.120
 i don't know aren't you mean that you take 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.629
 buy the budget i knew the line 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.460
 there is a series of 3 stars and evaluate it 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.140
 the quality of the whole product you do not 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.510
 need to be assessed for there royal orient and 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.949
 Renstar ie buy the cheapest 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.030
 ruler if it suits you by 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.129
 Quality means this product 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.260
 which is more expensive will be natural 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.010
 quality if the budget line 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.770
 bad did not try not thought 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.530
 it is clear that where there is a large price tag 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.170
 will try here that's why this is the one 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.869
 such is probably one of the budget if not 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:27.119
 the most budget line of knives Hanza is 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:28.979
 ganzo g sage 616 here and let's start with 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.869
 box box me always them to me 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.610
 I liked the fact that she knows this 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.320
 as recalled 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.970
 some kind of boxes and u professional 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.380
 some kind of instrumentation and have professional 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.680
 there are no tools here 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.380
 painted glossy things there she 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.250
 such a harsh cardboard immediately such 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.790
 it feels like it's really 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.810
 some kind of ganzo tool 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.939
 us impossible la bla bla so that's what 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.250
 I was pleased with this that thinking about 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.960
 people who can't talk and 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.329
 read in chinese here 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.850
 Nakleechka data there folding knife 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:07.160
 tourist hanse dice 606 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:11.129
 lock type liner lock blade material 440 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.410
 440 just even indicated the degree well 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:17.070
 hardening 55 to 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.500
 arugula handle material and abs length 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.260
 blade 79 millimeters weight 99 grams 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.420
 manufacturer bla bla bla bla country from 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.820
 grill china is understandable well naturally 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:33.870
 legs want to say that this man stands 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.730
 only 150 hryvnia in the store is not in 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.730
 the internet on the internet seems to me he 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.380
 will cost even less 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.420
 Now that would be if you are some 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.840
 beginner click yes not even with them 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.730
 quite rich then you can go to 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.620
 shop and buy such a knife rack it 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.780
 do but now give according to you 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.270
 together with you so plastic lining 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.970
 as already stated here there is a clip 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.910
 which is not rearranged in any way they are 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:07.830
 extra hole so wear 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:10.560
 it can only be here and so much 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.410
 convenient clip I still do not know here 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.340
 there is such a fin which 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.530
 implies that it can there 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:24.660
 spring loaded some thing on really 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:27.240
 there is really no reason for that 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.520
 what's just to have a finger here 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.709
 rested but actually here he is and so 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.470
 Here at the expense of the shape of the handles will be 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.410
 abut and we fold it yes we 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.740
 it turns out that here fin is sticking out 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:45.209
 nothing he sticks out I don't quite understand well 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.170
 okay lock type liner liner is well 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:52.380
 I will not hide 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:54.720
 the plan is already in the middle here from the inside 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.500
 I see no polishing here 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.510
 Here for that price rely on 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.239
 polished whale surface i think 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.300
 it's stupid to have a peg for one-handed 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:10.050
 opening but only on one side here 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:14.910
 here it is not there that is also an economy 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.770
 savings here liner enough 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.380
 convenient knife in the hand well 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:22.139
 opens easily 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:26.449
 Here are some inconveniences with the grip I 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:29.430
 not experiencing with him let's try 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:33.180
 factory sharpening I have yet nothing 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:40.069
 absolutely did absolutely nothing 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:43.259
 did well let's say so undermines cuts but 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:47.060
 so here across will not cut it 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:50.430
 definitely share cuts too so with difficulty 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:55.800
 this side leads away like that i'm really 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:05:09.479
 We are now trying to work a little 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:12.830
 According to Art. We plan to understand the wood 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.830
 to the front side 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:28.300
 but in principle it is comfortable with enough 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:31.300
 hand is not us on it is the coast 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.300
 planes 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:49.120
 So 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.710
 suffered derevyahu try 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.840
 to show 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:06:05.790
 klinochek no see absolutely 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:11.610
 on it damage - 9 small so 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.610
 batoning trusted three 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:35.290
 but I do not see anything and of course especially 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.500
 they don't do anything like that 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.500
 business 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.450
 that is, any such work he does 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.450
 no problem at all 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:12.450
 continue to knit well with canned goods 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:15.000
 Sorry now is no yes really 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:19.020
 I really don't need to think of opening them 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:28.850
 preservatives filter and Alanya look 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:28.850
 now it stands on the edge here 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:41.690
 there is no big backlash well such 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.690
 slightly slightly 

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:49.380
 Here we have PTFE inside washer 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:54.919
 Naturally, well, such a budget 

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:59.570
 budget but actually know how 

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:59.570
 one day to take the future and what else is needed 

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:04.410
 pull up a little 

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:07.800
 everything will be ok, well, something like this 

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:10.410
 knife ganzo of 116 

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.110
