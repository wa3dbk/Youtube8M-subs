00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.750
 very good to everyone here rail lag and today 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.389
 we are here when sub of services of 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.670
 minecraft in which is a basic guide 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.350
 about the enemies inside the 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.830
 game 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.180
 let's start now 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.010
 first we have this zombie bug 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.400
 the zombies of the most basic enemies 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.880
 of the game there are many 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.150
 appears at night 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.610
 has 10 hearts of life and needs 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.390
 approaching to attack does not attack 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.399
 distance 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.710
 at its weak point is sunlight 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.300
 has a large percentage of throwing meat 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.450
 rotten 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.120
 and it also has a very low percentage 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:50.020
 to throw carrots 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.450
 the rotten flesh gives a state of hunger 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.470
 in the long run it takes away more food from 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.470
 the one that gives you 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.340
 we go with the next 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.700
 the next we have is the skeleton 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:08.520
 the secret is a very very difficult enemy 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.920
 to kill because it attacks from a distance 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.480
 weakness is sunlight too 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.370
 when it gives sunlight as the 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.130
 zombie burns him and takes away 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.880
 life until they die has 10 hearts 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.969
 of life and what he shoots is basically 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.640
 of bones and arrows to use them 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:29.220
 then with the bow we go with the next 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.610
 repair script you are a pretty bug 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.110
 bastard because when you approach him 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.670
 explode 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.040
 is very stealthy and makes a noise when 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.490
 is about to explode the style as 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.490
 a wick 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.270
 when you kill him he throws gunpowder he has 10 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.500
 hearts of life and it's pretty 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.950
 problematic because it usually appears from 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.100
 stealthy and can break all kinds 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.100
 of cubes from carbon iron diamond 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.070
 all wood that's why you have to have 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.300
 Be careful if you have a house or something to have 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.490
 beware of clippers 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.190
 we go with the next and the next 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.690
 that we have is the spider the spider is a 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.319
 pretty basic bug 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.840
 his weakness is sunlight 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.460
 although weakness is not that the light of 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.400
 Here you life to the others not 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.550
 in this case the spider when there is light 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.600
 solar does not attack is not hostile so no 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.600
 you have to worry about light 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.060
 has life decorations and can 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.520
 climb all kinds of things so 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.340
 do not trust us we have already fixed a wall or 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.170
 something because he cheats them scaled 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.900
 we go with the following the next 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.390
 said that we have here is res line slim 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.690
 is a is a basic patient bug has 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.100
 eight hearts of life and it is very difficult 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.520
 give you 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.850
 when they are attacking and when you take away one 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.620
 determined life is divided in two and 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.620
 when you kill that they are divided into four 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.970
 it removes very little life and is very slow 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.380
 and it makes a very characteristic sound 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.860
 when it's close 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.980
 I usually throw mucus balls 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.190
 they really do not help at all we go with 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.250
 the next 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.200
 and the last of the video the leander man 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.390
 the leander man is a pretty bug 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.520
 peculiar 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.940
 more than anything to say that the basic is 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.580
 the hardest because he has 20 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.600
 hearts of life 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.820
 7 of transport and first is passive 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.150
 and if you look at his face he becomes hostile 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.190
 and is going to attack you the weakness of this 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.160
 bug is water 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.610
 the complication that has then to be 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.590
 teleport and other good I hope that 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.360
