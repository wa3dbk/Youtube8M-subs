00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
at the bottom it says microseismic a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.120 
at the bottom it says microseismic a
power<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.720> definitely<00:00:30.900> true<00:00:31.289> you

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
get stock the shoot about 40-plus feet

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.500 
get stock the shoot about 40-plus feet
40<00:00:35.280> maybe<00:00:35.820> 45<00:00:37.520> with<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> whistlers<00:00:39.030> included

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
40 maybe 45 with the whistlers included

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.400 
40 maybe 45 with the whistlers included
which<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.870> get<00:00:40.020> two<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.610> also<00:00:41.610> tristan's<00:00:42.149> here

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
which you get two of also tristan's here

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.900 
which you get two of also tristan's here
so<00:00:43.410> we're<00:00:43.890> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.070> unbox<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.760> just

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
so we're going to unbox this it's just

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
so we're going to unbox this it's just
like<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> necessary<00:00:45.930> secret<00:00:46.379> pocket<00:00:46.710> last<00:00:46.829> you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
like a necessary secret pocket last you

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.520 
like a necessary secret pocket last you
just<00:00:47.450> rip<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.539> open<00:00:49.039> basically<00:00:54.500> like<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
just rip it open basically like the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.279 
just rip it open basically like the
spring<00:00:55.980> version<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> SS<00:00:56.969> PV<00:00:57.360> basically

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
spring version of the SS PV basically

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.889 
spring version of the SS PV basically
and<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:59.309> direct<00:00:59.730> plunger<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.359> that's<00:01:00.719> good

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
and it's direct plunger so that's good

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.770 
and it's direct plunger so that's good
okay<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.100> basically<00:01:02.280> what<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.820> get<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
okay so basically what you get is the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.340 
okay so basically what you get is the
jolt<00:01:04.439> which<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.920> says<00:01:05.100> right<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:06.229> it's<00:01:07.229> got

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
jolt which it says right there it's got

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.070 
jolt which it says right there it's got
the<00:01:07.439> end<00:01:07.590> strike<00:01:07.770> symbol<00:01:08.130> nerve<00:01:08.930> here<00:01:09.930> from

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the end strike symbol nerve here from

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.210 
the end strike symbol nerve here from
the<00:01:10.170> other<00:01:10.290> side<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.680> then<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.100> two

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the other side and then you two

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.080 
the other side and then you two
whistlers<00:01:11.580> um<00:01:12.619> that<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.549> catch<00:01:14.880> mechanism

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
whistlers um that is the catch mechanism

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.490 
whistlers um that is the catch mechanism
in<00:01:15.479> there<00:01:15.630> then<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.960> pull<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.170> trigger<00:01:16.259> so

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
in there then you pull the trigger so

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.690 
in there then you pull the trigger so
you<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.890> moving<00:01:17.360> okay<00:01:19.520> just<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> give

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you can see it moving okay just to give

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.280 
you can see it moving okay just to give
you<00:01:20.790> an<00:01:20.850> idea<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.090> how<00:01:21.180> big<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.600> plunger<00:01:21.900> tubas

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you an idea of how big the plunger tubas

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.710 
you an idea of how big the plunger tubas
this<00:01:22.680> entire<00:01:23.070> casing<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.090> basically<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
this entire casing is basically the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.710 
this entire casing is basically the
plunger<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.520> our<00:01:26.520> plunger<00:01:26.850> tube<00:01:27.150> sorry<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
plunger and our plunger tube sorry and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.450 
plunger and our plunger tube sorry and
the<00:01:28.229> springs<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.770> these<00:01:28.950> are<00:01:29.130> actually

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the springs and these are actually

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.240 
the springs and these are actually
they're<00:01:30.360> not<00:01:30.390> bad<00:01:30.689> they're<00:01:31.079> pretty<00:01:31.619> beefy<00:01:31.770> um

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
they're not bad they're pretty beefy um

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.399 
they're not bad they're pretty beefy um
there's<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.820> ton<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.119> pre<00:01:33.600> compression<00:01:33.900> which

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
there's a ton of pre compression which

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.710 
there's a ton of pre compression which
makes<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.920> great<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.400> there's<00:01:35.610> what<00:01:36.150> what

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
makes it so great like there's what what

makes it so great like there's what what
about<00:01:36.869> three-quarter<00:01:37.799> inch<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> an<00:01:38.220> inch<00:01:38.280> of

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
about three-quarter inch to an inch of

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.859 
about three-quarter inch to an inch of
free<00:01:38.700> compression<00:01:39.240> what<00:01:39.479> are<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.630> springs

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
free compression what are the springs

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.749 
free compression what are the springs
like<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> specter<00:01:40.590> almost<00:01:41.040> your<00:01:41.460> kind<00:01:41.700> of

feet<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:14.110> can<00:04:14.140> hit<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.650> like<00:04:15.100> six-inch<00:04:15.550> target

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
feet you can hit a like six-inch target

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.270 
feet you can hit a like six-inch target
almost<00:04:16.330> every<00:04:16.630> time<00:04:16.810> it's<00:04:17.170> really<00:04:17.680> like<00:04:18.100> not

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
almost every time it's really like not

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.590 
almost every time it's really like not
even<00:04:18.430> really<00:04:18.760> like<00:04:19.030> aiming<00:04:19.360> down<00:04:19.450> the<00:04:19.510> sights

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
even really like aiming down the sights

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.150 
even really like aiming down the sights
or<00:04:19.810> anything<00:04:20.080> just<00:04:20.200> like<00:04:20.410> depends<00:04:20.980> on<00:04:21.070> how

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
or anything just like depends on how

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.680 
or anything just like depends on how
good<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:21.489> are<00:04:21.610> just<00:04:21.850> holding<00:04:22.060> it<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.510> mean

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
good you are just holding it I mean

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.170 
good you are just holding it I mean
that's<00:04:22.990> what<00:04:23.380> we<00:04:23.500> were<00:04:23.650> doing<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:25.810> yeah<00:04:26.080> that's

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
that's what we were doing so yeah that's

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.600 
that's what we were doing so yeah that's
basically<00:04:28.180> all<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.290> jolt<00:04:29.500> is<00:04:29.680> give<00:04:30.520> you

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
basically all that the jolt is give you

basically all that the jolt is give you
a<00:04:30.640> view<00:04:30.850> of<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.030> peg<00:04:31.570> in<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.870> air<00:04:31.990> shifter<00:04:32.200> in

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
a view of the peg in the air shifter in

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.550 
a view of the peg in the air shifter in
there<00:04:32.590> here's<00:04:33.520> a<00:04:33.610> no<00:04:33.760> um<00:04:33.970> okay<00:04:34.960> here<00:04:35.320> we<00:04:35.470> have

there here's a no um okay here we have

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.130 
there here's a no um okay here we have
an<00:04:35.650> open<00:04:35.890> one<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:37.180> just<00:04:37.210> undo<00:04:37.540> the<00:04:37.660> screws<00:04:37.900> and

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
an open one you just undo the screws and

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.990 
an open one you just undo the screws and
you<00:04:38.230> pull<00:04:38.410> us<00:04:38.500> out<00:04:38.680> pull<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.550> trigger<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:39.880> get

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
you pull us out pull the trigger to get

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.450 
you pull us out pull the trigger to get
it<00:04:40.090> past<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.300> catch<00:04:40.540> and<00:04:40.840> open<00:04:41.140> it<00:04:41.230> up<00:04:41.350> you<00:04:42.310> can

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
it past the catch and open it up you can

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.340 
it past the catch and open it up you can
see<00:04:42.730> in<00:04:42.820> there<00:04:43.000> that<00:04:43.420> is<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.780> air<00:04:43.900> stricter

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
see in there that is the air stricter

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.780 
see in there that is the air stricter
you<00:04:44.650> pull<00:04:44.890> the<00:04:44.980> arrow<00:04:45.070> stricter<00:04:45.430> spring<00:04:45.670> out

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
you pull the arrow stricter spring out

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.700 
you pull the arrow stricter spring out
snap<00:04:46.240> three<00:04:46.630> pegs<00:04:46.870> with<00:04:47.290> a<00:04:47.320> flathead

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
snap three pegs with a flathead

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.200 
snap three pegs with a flathead
screwdriver<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.370> then<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.580> have<00:04:48.700> to<00:04:48.790> weasel

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
screwdriver and then you have to weasel

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.570 
screwdriver and then you have to weasel
the<00:04:49.510> whole<00:04:49.800> body<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:51.160> air<00:04:51.250> switch<00:04:51.490> you're

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
the whole body of the air switch you're

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.110 
the whole body of the air switch you're
out<00:04:51.670> with<00:04:51.820> pliers<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:54.040> spring<00:04:54.400> is<00:04:54.610> bigger

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
out with pliers the spring is bigger

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.360 
out with pliers the spring is bigger
than<00:04:55.510> that<00:04:55.570> as<00:04:56.050> you<00:04:56.260> can<00:04:56.380> see<00:04:56.590> when<00:04:56.830> I<00:04:56.860> compress

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
than that as you can see when I compress

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.970 
than that as you can see when I compress
it<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.910> comes<00:04:58.270> out<00:04:58.390> of<00:04:58.510> the<00:04:58.600> plunger<00:04:58.870> head<00:04:59.050> this

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
it it comes out of the plunger head this

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.620 
it it comes out of the plunger head this
is<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.250> plunger<00:05:00.550> head<00:05:00.760> right<00:05:01.270> here<00:05:01.480> is<00:05:01.600> where

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
is the plunger head right here is where

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.110 
is the plunger head right here is where
it<00:05:01.840> catches<00:05:02.200> that<00:05:02.650> is<00:05:02.860> the<00:05:02.980> o-ring<00:05:03.370> this

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
it catches that is the o-ring this

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.090 
it catches that is the o-ring this
little<00:05:04.420> orange<00:05:04.540> piece<00:05:04.840> goes<00:05:05.260> into<00:05:05.620> a<00:05:05.650> groove

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
little orange piece goes into a groove

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.780 
little orange piece goes into a groove
in<00:05:06.340> the<00:05:06.400> shell<00:05:06.760> to<00:05:07.000> help<00:05:07.210> dampen<00:05:07.570> it<00:05:07.810> a<00:05:07.990> bit<00:05:08.170> and

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
in the shell to help dampen it a bit and

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.090 
in the shell to help dampen it a bit and
there's<00:05:09.790> a<00:05:09.880> curved<00:05:10.260> piece<00:05:11.260> up<00:05:11.410> on<00:05:11.560> top<00:05:11.710> to<00:05:11.950> help

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
there's a curved piece up on top to help

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.990 
there's a curved piece up on top to help
too<00:05:12.510> so<00:05:13.510> when<00:05:14.290> you<00:05:14.350> want<00:05:14.500> to<00:05:14.560> put<00:05:14.650> it<00:05:14.740> back<00:05:14.800> in

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
too so when you want to put it back in

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.060 
too so when you want to put it back in
just<00:05:16.000> pull<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.450> trigger<00:05:16.650> slide<00:05:17.650> it<00:05:17.770> in<00:05:17.890> and

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
just pull the trigger slide it in and

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.610 
just pull the trigger slide it in and
then<00:05:18.370> as<00:05:18.550> you<00:05:18.700> can<00:05:18.730> see<00:05:19.030> you<00:05:19.240> have<00:05:19.570> to<00:05:19.870> compress

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
then as you can see you have to compress

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.070 
then as you can see you have to compress
it<00:05:20.820> quite<00:05:21.820> a<00:05:21.850> bit<00:05:21.910> so<00:05:22.660> he's<00:05:22.780> gonna<00:05:22.900> put<00:05:23.050> that

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
it quite a bit so he's gonna put that

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.710 
it quite a bit so he's gonna put that
back<00:05:23.260> together<00:05:23.500> and<00:05:23.710> I<00:05:24.250> guess<00:05:25.180> that's<00:05:25.450> all<00:05:25.630> we

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
back together and I guess that's all we

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.680 
back together and I guess that's all we
have<00:05:25.870> for<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:26.080> today<00:05:26.200> so<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:28.210> integration<00:05:28.840> up

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
have for you today so the integration up

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.810 
have for you today so the integration up
what<00:05:31.690> exercise<00:05:32.100> now<00:05:33.100> own<00:05:33.310> thing<00:05:33.490> every<00:05:33.700> word

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
what exercise now own thing every word

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.110 
what exercise now own thing every word
anyway<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:35.650> possibility<00:05:36.430> of<00:05:36.460> integration<00:05:37.030> is

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
anyway the possibility of integration is

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.659 
anyway the possibility of integration is
really<00:05:37.570> good<00:05:38.050> because<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:38.980> top<00:05:39.190> is<00:05:39.430> pretty

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
really good because the top is pretty

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.370 
really good because the top is pretty
much<00:05:39.790> flat<00:05:40.150> and<00:05:40.450> the<00:05:40.540> really<00:05:40.690> tiny<00:05:40.930> so<00:05:41.230> you<00:05:41.290> can

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
much flat and the really tiny so you can

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.110 
much flat and the really tiny so you can
just<00:05:41.410> put<00:05:41.770> them<00:05:41.890> onto<00:05:42.040> anything<00:05:42.400> you<00:05:42.610> want<00:05:43.169> you

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
just put them onto anything you want you

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.030 
just put them onto anything you want you
could<00:05:46.120> also<00:05:46.330> like<00:05:46.780> integrate<00:05:47.169> them<00:05:47.350> side<00:05:48.010> by

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
could also like integrate them side by

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.250 
could also like integrate them side by
side<00:05:48.220> or<00:05:48.850> up<00:05:49.450> and<00:05:49.570> down<00:05:49.690> or<00:05:50.050> something

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
side or up and down or something

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.330 
side or up and down or something
whatever<00:05:51.070> works<00:05:51.370> for<00:05:51.580> you<00:05:51.669> um<00:05:52.770> yeah<00:05:53.770> so<00:05:54.100> go<00:05:54.280> to
