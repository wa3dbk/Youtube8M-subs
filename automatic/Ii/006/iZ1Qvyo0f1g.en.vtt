to<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.000> new<00:00:03.330> video<00:00:03.510> I<00:00:03.899> thought<00:00:04.410> it<00:00:04.560> was<00:00:04.650> about

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
to a new video I thought it was about

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.550 
to a new video I thought it was about
time<00:00:04.859> that<00:00:05.160> I<00:00:05.400> bought<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:06.150> 1090<00:00:07.049> power<00:00:07.290> boot

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
time that I bought the 1090 power boot

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.950 
time that I bought the 1090 power boot
so<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:07.859> thought<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.580> best<00:00:08.610> boots<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.210> buy<00:00:09.389> right

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
so I thought the best boots to buy right

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.060 
so I thought the best boots to buy right
now<00:00:10.139> with<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.410> current<00:00:10.620> state<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.950> game

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
now with the current state of the game

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.950 
now with the current state of the game
will<00:00:11.309> probably<00:00:11.490> be<00:00:11.820> Flair<00:00:12.240> frost<00:00:12.570> boots<00:00:12.809> I

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
will probably be Flair frost boots I

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.629 
will probably be Flair frost boots I
wanted<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.320> give<00:00:13.500> them<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.740> go<00:00:13.920> try<00:00:14.340> them<00:00:14.490> out

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
wanted to give them a go try them out

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.790 
wanted to give them a go try them out
and<00:00:14.820> see<00:00:14.929> what<00:00:15.929> experience<00:00:16.410> they<00:00:16.500> would<00:00:16.619> give

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
and see what experience they would give

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.710 
and see what experience they would give
me<00:00:16.830> at<00:00:17.340> next<00:00:17.820> for<00:00:17.940> example<00:00:18.000> where<00:00:18.480> I've<00:00:18.570> heard

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
me at next for example where I've heard

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.150 
me at next for example where I've heard
they're<00:00:18.930> pretty<00:00:19.140> good<00:00:19.320> at<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.680> there's<00:00:20.130> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
they're pretty good at and there's a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.410 
they're pretty good at and there's a
couple<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.430> reasons<00:00:20.550> why<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.060> I'll<00:00:21.150> go<00:00:21.240> into

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
couple of reasons why and I'll go into

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.269 
couple of reasons why and I'll go into
those<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.750> second<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.439> decided<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.070> buy

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
comparatively compared to the tier 80

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.350 
comparatively compared to the tier 80
version<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.549> pur<00:01:26.700> next<00:01:26.939> boots<00:01:27.119> let's

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
version so like the pur next boots let's

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.179 
version so like the pur next boots let's
say<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.780> range<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.439> they<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.650> two<00:01:28.890> more

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
say for range so they have two more

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.399 
say for range so they have two more
range<00:01:29.790> bonus<00:01:30.329> than<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> pur<00:01:30.810> next<00:01:31.079> boots<00:01:31.259> they

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
honest let's just admit that the armor

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.749 
honest let's just admit that the armor
rating<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.840> around<00:01:42.930> 24<00:01:43.770> more<00:01:44.009> armor<00:01:44.369> rating<00:01:44.460> so

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.060 
rating is around 24 more armor rating so
that's<00:01:44.880> quite<00:01:45.119> nice<00:01:45.329> as<00:01:45.600> well<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.680> overall

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
that's quite nice as well but overall

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.679 
that's quite nice as well but overall
you<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.759> gives<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:47.970> an<00:01:48.060> extra<00:01:48.240> 2<00:01:48.450> damage
