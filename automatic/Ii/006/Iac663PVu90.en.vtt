00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.529
 as short and compact overview as possible 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.860
 about the features and basics about 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.700
 coming mmo rpg named white star 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.160
 strap on and let's go first 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.100
 once a few little basics 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.920
 developers of wildstar are the bodies 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.660
 in studios this team is under 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.609
 Others from the already participate 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.029
 a big projects like world of 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.910
 warcraft everquest 1 and 2 or too 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.829
 for example, starcraft or diablo 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.370
 2 have worked together 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.329
 the publisher of wildstar is nc soft 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.700
 and who this name is not a concept nc 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.340
 soft has games like guild 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.309
 It was 1 2 and everything in it 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.850
 is related as well as one or even 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.520
 la netz now publishes but 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.120
 because there we come to the setting of 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.859
 Wildstar plays in space 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.970
 a mysterious planet named 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.840
 nexus on which two fractions 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.970
 the clashes are absolutely 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.110
 can not smell and they are 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.619
 linked and the dominion 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.810
 There are eight in total 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.110
 playable races the faction is that 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.030
 So four playable races to the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.180
 banished belong on the one hand the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.670
 people to the other the gran ob das 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.070
 are big living stone beings the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.250
 galactic sins are the third 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.610
 russell a relative are the aurin 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.150
 these are fighting forest dwellers and 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.060
 the fourth and last russell in the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.610
 Fraction of the warned are the most fashionable 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.670
 they have an alchemical one 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.000
 Bust behind and he has 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.880
 made into zombies worth millions 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.460
 the kruzians belong to humans 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.700
 that come from the planet casus 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.100
 on the other hand there are the drakens that are 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.659
 hunters only by strength and 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.170
 let violent change 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.170
 the cow or do something crazy 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.790
 Inventor with fur respectively 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.519
 banged inventors are hamster look 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.769
 the fourth and last race in the 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.989
 Dominion are the me ari 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.430
 these are rational mechanical ones 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.900
 or killing machines 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.500
 classes in wales there are altogether 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.989
 six not every race also every one 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.299
 will be able to play class 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.910
 So far, there are warriors for coarse than 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.970
 Finely sliced ​​alkane protect for 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.250
 precise and deadly hail of bullets 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.790
 Beuchler as a disguised murderer from the 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.190
 shadow and sp as a tormentor with 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.110
 psychic energy the two others 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.660
 classes have not yet been published 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.209
 More is likely in the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.530
 next time 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.079
 Now that we have some basics 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.849
 we have come to a conclusion 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.109
 little more to the game elements of 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:11.310
 wildstar because star has housing 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:13.349
 crafting pva and pvp content to housing 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.480
 can be roughly said that 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.319
 of course, having your own house in it 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.230
 connection stands 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.690
 you will have your own facility 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.139
 really make your home individually 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.049
 can 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.639
 you will have a garden and also 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.370
 to grow resources 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.549
 There are many in the housing 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.840
 cool additional features that you design 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.989
 can and expand 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.310
 when crafting, there are definitely 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.410
 two forms 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.120
 but that's still the case 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.670
 not too much known the 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.790
 Information about crafting will be in the 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.129
 likely to follow in the near future 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.000
 to the dvd can say that it is endgame 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:58.870
 story content will be 20 and also 40 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.060
 man rays will be in the game and that 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.840
 Trends are also regular 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.489
 to change 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.989
 another big aspect of the pps are 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.690
 the players are bland 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.540
 what are the player paths there are 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.209
 settler explorer soldiers and 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.090
 scientist and among these four 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.220
 you can get one at the beginning 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.050
 choose his character creation 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.320
 that means one for each character 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.840
 create one selects path from each 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.750
 after bad is propagated in the game running 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.030
 Special content with quests offered 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.510
 which is especially fun for the players 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.760
 makes 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.030
 also in the group game one stands with 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.510
 His path is an enrichment for others 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.610
 is 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.639
 this can be the case with the settler, for example 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.160
 that he can build special objects 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.400
 that are of benefit to others or 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.700
 when exploring the eventual exploration 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.310
 bring quests we come to the pvp of 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.700
 wildstar here it becomes arena 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:04.330
 Give matches and they will be in format 2 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.740
 against 23 against three and five against five 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.919
 can take place 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.930
 in a last man standing system that 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.840
 means at the beginning of each arena 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.289
 matches each group has a certain 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.650
 set number of response dies 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:23.139
 a member of the group sinks this 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.720
 respawn the goal will be the 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.940
 opposing group with their respawn in 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.810
 to force the knee and ultimately 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.610
 eliminate all enemies that no 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.710
 response are more possible 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.080
 whoever sat it still stands 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.510
 won for guilds exist in this 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.969
 connecting flying fortresses the 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.489
 are intended for building and removal 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:48.069
 is that done pulls you into the fight 

00:05:45.489 --> 00:05:49.929
 Guild against others and fight each other 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:51.869
 almost with its flying islands 

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:53.949
 protected and all others 

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:56.169
 war machines you build yourself like that 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.539
 has the fight system of wales there 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:01.629
 overall , action &amp; movement 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:03.699
 dodge based based goals or too 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:06.579
 disarming his weapon really 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:09.459
 recapturing is going on in the fight 

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:11.979
 Be sure of any case if you are now 

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:13.569
 I would like to see more in detail 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.729

 to look in because they really are 

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:25.389
 extremely successful extremely entertaining 

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:28.809
 and you really know more about it after that 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:30.309
 very specific features even deeper 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:33.489

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:35.189

 they like to be taken in there 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:49.300
 I would like to be in the list
