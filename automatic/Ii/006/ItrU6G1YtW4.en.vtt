00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
section right here now we have two

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.420 
section right here now we have two
versions<00:04:14.810> of<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.930> widget<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.860> one<00:04:16.130> that<00:04:16.370> I

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
versions of the widget the one that I

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.199 
versions of the widget the one that I
showed<00:04:16.669> you<00:04:16.820> before

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
showed you before

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.199 
showed you before
where<00:04:17.299> is<00:04:17.449> the<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:18.859> card<00:04:19.220> look<00:04:19.489> which<00:04:19.789> in<00:04:20.060> my

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
where is the the card look which in my

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.460 
where is the the card look which in my
opinion<00:04:20.329> is<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.750> best<00:04:21.019> look

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
opinion is the best look

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.710 
opinion is the best look
so<00:04:22.340> we're<00:04:22.490> three<00:04:22.729> with<00:04:22.910> just<00:04:22.940> last<00:04:23.330> which<00:04:23.569> is<00:04:23.690> a

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
so we're three with just last which is a

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.020 
so we're three with just last which is a
one<00:04:23.930> by<00:04:24.110> one<00:04:24.139> widget<00:04:24.620> which<00:04:24.770> is<00:04:24.889> just<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:25.910> a

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
one by one widget which is just a a

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.520 
one by one widget which is just a a
little<00:04:28.840> icon<00:04:29.840> so<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.080> don't<00:04:30.259> even<00:04:30.319> worry<00:04:30.500> about

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
little icon so I don't even worry about

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.749 
little icon so I don't even worry about
that<00:04:30.830> when<00:04:30.949> you<00:04:31.069> want<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.250> look<00:04:31.400> at<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.550> four

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
that when you want to look at the four

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.460 
that when you want to look at the four
point<00:04:32.000> three<00:04:32.060> one<00:04:32.240> two<00:04:32.720> by<00:04:32.870> two<00:04:32.930> so<00:04:33.199> the<00:04:33.289> four

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
point three one two by two so the four

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.710 
point three one two by two so the four
point<00:04:33.680> three<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:34.430> comes<00:04:34.669> up<00:04:34.789> like<00:04:34.819> this<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:35.660> you

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
point three it comes up like this so you

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.499 
point three it comes up like this so you
actually<00:04:35.840> can<00:04:36.080> scroll<00:04:36.349> and<00:04:36.410> see<00:04:36.860> different

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
actually can scroll and see different

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.730 
actually can scroll and see different
widgets<00:04:38.509> and<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:39.020> cool<00:04:39.259> thing<00:04:39.289> I<00:04:39.560> like<00:04:39.710> about

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
widgets and the cool thing I like about

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.320 
widgets and the cool thing I like about
would<00:04:40.069> have<00:04:40.099> developer<00:04:40.580> did<00:04:40.789> is<00:04:40.910> that<00:04:41.030> he<00:04:41.210> had

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
would have developer did is that he had

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.320 
would have developer did is that he had
the<00:04:41.449> resizing<00:04:41.930> widgets<00:04:42.530> in<00:04:43.069> mind<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:44.090> you<00:04:44.210> can

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
the resizing widgets in mind so you can

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.790 
the resizing widgets in mind so you can
make<00:04:44.479> it<00:04:44.569> as<00:04:44.660> big<00:04:44.870> or<00:04:45.110> as<00:04:45.169> small<00:04:45.289> as<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:45.710> want

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
make it as big or as small as you want

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.480 
make it as big or as small as you want
in<00:04:46.220> every<00:04:46.460> sizes<00:04:47.000> now<00:04:47.720> in<00:04:48.349> my<00:04:48.590> opinion<00:04:48.710> that

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
in every sizes now in my opinion that

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.520 
in every sizes now in my opinion that
which<00:04:49.669> is<00:04:49.849> good<00:04:50.090> but<00:04:50.599> it's<00:04:50.660> not<00:04:50.840> good<00:04:51.199> as<00:04:51.349> the

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
which is good but it's not good as the

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.350 
which is good but it's not good as the
stacks<00:04:52.220> widget<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:52.820> I'm<00:04:52.880> gonna<00:04:53.030> go<00:04:53.090> ahead<00:04:53.150> and
