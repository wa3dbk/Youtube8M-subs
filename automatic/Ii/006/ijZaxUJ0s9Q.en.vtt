 the second set 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.869
 to make a picture or look 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.960
 because discrimination and I have my hand the future the markets seem 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.090
 and that is how to make a guy part-time day 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.120
 but as you may have received a wildcard but I still think max 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.980

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.330

 and after that a little early tidy 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.110
 that did 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.390
 I always try it will not be possible to see the reason through 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.819
 pleasure the implementation 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:07.090
 contacts time they start making city 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.550

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.290
 6 too bad 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.620

 the nothing we hear does not bother in poles but with you the viewer 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.690

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.000
 to make power together a helicopter and a bus you name it 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.300
 I really had 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.300
 However, this car or an animal can last as long as that does not want to meet each other 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.960
 6 Jun suk looks right something no longer counts 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.210

 a few hours later to us 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.909
 and this year that there is one between the planning 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.329

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.399

 but we get them said to benefit 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.349
 the club is expected to be lower 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.349
 or arsenal 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.819

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.199
