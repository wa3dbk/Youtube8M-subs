00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello very good kids welcome from 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.000
 new to the channel guys today we are here 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.400
 in a video somewhat different from what 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.349
 I'm used to uploading you ok 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.360
 as you are seeing in the title it puts 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.670
 tutorial on how to add 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.250
 activities in social club or how to add 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.199
 activities in social club and other vouchers 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.539
 something related to these guys and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.490
 Now I am going to explain to you why it is worth 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.529
 how are you looking good in the background you go to 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.029
 see the tutorial this obviously and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.920
 many people I will say but you go or by 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.980
 what do you do this if a lot of people no longer know 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.980
 I do not know what, guys, I'm doing it 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.290
 at popular request, what does it mean? 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.570
 to produce at popular request yesterday rose 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.059
 a 500 money trick without help where 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.890
 you had to add two races worth 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.469
 a race for the people of play and other 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.870
 for another for the people of xbox then my 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.910
 surprise has been very very big when 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.789
 I have seen that the good majority most 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.539
 no but I have answered more than 200 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.000
 messages telling me that they did not know how to add 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.370
 the race is worth or that the links were 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.500
 broken and others when the links I'm 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.409
 testing right now and they work 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.549
 perfectly the trick 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.100
 but what I come to show you here is 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.740
 how to add careers activities 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.509
 ballet then for this I have done 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.549
 I can understand that there are people who are 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.409
 new who has not played the gta is at 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.299
 just as you have recently and not 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.979
 races are added but at this point 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.990
 that we have been playing for two years 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.479
 that you do not know that sometimes social with 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.340
 it fails that we can not add careers and 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.020
 that they have to do some little thing what 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.240
 I have seen very strange and in the end I say 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.159
 you know what I do tutorial okay I'm going to 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.570
 do guys let's go to the mess I do not want that 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.280
 be a very long video 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.860
 I will not do from scratch it's worth 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.840
 you will enter my channel at 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.119
 yesterday's video with another account alive 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.619
 in the one of my secondary channel and here in 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.630
 the social groups also as if it were 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.500
 you are worth not from my channel or anything 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.500
 weird is how you see forgiveness here we are 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.090
 guys already in yesterday's video I guess 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.619
 that good here as you see and the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.149
 handedly filter such and such a date 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.130
 it's in the grass I'm going to cover it, I suppose 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.720
 some black thing so they do not look 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.069
 the videos of people like me 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.290
 You can report by the thumbnail 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.330
 etc 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.340
 if you open good I will teach it from 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.230
 zero for another time, if you want to add 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.210
 a social club league you have to go to 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.920
 link where it is worth my case is here 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.500
 in the description of this video and here 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.150
 as you see puts races worth we are going to 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.180
 add these two races people 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.890
 says it does not come out I'll close social 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.050
 club ok let's close this social 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.350
 club we close and we will open by 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.200
 example the first link that 3 ps4 as 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.340
 witnesses that this is normal is worth going 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.440
 to say that the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.380
 mission here people also a mission 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.270
 is not I do not know what's worth and answer in the 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.070
 right side of social group I did not put it 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.230
 also in the link where the video is 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.930
 of dailymotion also puts it but 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.580
 I guess people do not read it said the 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.190
 link has to be opened more than once 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.720
 correct on the right band is worth 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.230
 we have to go in the band on the side 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.750
 straight 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.850
 here tells us the platform where 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.459
 we want to open the link very very 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.890
 important social club series this in 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.170
 an error I do not know because it always puts pc 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.959
 to ibex to xbox 360 because I've tried it 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.850
 before and now I have opened the play 4 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.260
 that's why he tells me we're going to do 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.480
 very easy 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.480
 play 4 play 3 whatever it is worth I'll 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.760
 leave play 4 let's update 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.340
 ok and now obviously we will not go 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.230
 ok we close again and now 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.810
 we would have to open the link again 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.569
 we open the link in play 4 and here 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.700
 we have our carrer vale you have 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.590
 that you notice that the race opens for you 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.629
 hit that does not open a window with 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.269
 a lot of racing and now the only thing 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.609
 that would be added to the game is worth 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.010
 now what am I going to do I am going to teach you 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.590
 that the xbox also works that is 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.420
 very easy we add vale I'll open the 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.799
 of xbox in principle you would not have to 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.629
 open although sometimes it does open 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.060
 because I have play four posts 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.519
 obviously does not open I have play 4 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.769
 we come to the right side we change 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.700
 our platform is already xbox one xbox 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.430
 360 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.769
 I'm going to put xbox 360 guys and now not 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.659
 it opens up obviously we close and 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.370
 we have to reopen I thought 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.900
 have to open it twice and change 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.000
 the platform knew how to do all the 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.900
 world but I see mere and that's why I do this 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.450
 video 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.730
 we open xbox 360 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.489
 and even guys we already have the race is 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.169
 which is the easiest thing in the world I hope that 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.950
 you liked the tutorial worth guys 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.570
 if I'm a little bit pissed off but yes 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.480
 that a tad annoyed after seeing 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.280
 that so many people did not know how to do it and 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.139
 because they did not know how to do it because 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.210
 pass but it is that I do not explain 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.830
 answered hundreds of comments that 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.200
 it costs to look a little at the comments 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.330
 what people say in the same link 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.760
 where I put the dailymotion video there 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.720
 I explain it and it pisses me off that people this 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.940
 do not read it 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.190
 German goes direct seek liquidity or what 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.410
 that I put additional that normally puts 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.940
 the link congo post it as does not read it 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.229
 and that's why I get a little bit upset and 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.030
 also because I made this video for the 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.800
 people who do not know is worth less ask 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.720
 apologies and nothing like I hope that 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.370
 be clear, you know how to burst the 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.070
 button like share it so that what 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.229
 as many people as possible see it because it is 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.560
 necessary and see you the next video 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.560
 bye
