00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.670 
the pocket and doesn't pick up the block
now<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:30.810> you're<00:01:30.930> running<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.290> play<00:01:31.500> what

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
now when you're running this play what

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.230 
now when you're running this play what
you<00:01:31.710> want<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.100> careful<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
you want to be careful of is the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.640 
you want to be careful of is the
quarterback<00:01:33.570> scrambling<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> right

quarterback scrambling to the right

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.090 
quarterback scrambling to the right
which<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.549> why<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> spy<00:01:36.860> we<00:01:37.860> could

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
which is why we like a spy we could

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.969 
which is why we like a spy we could
contain<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:38.939> he<00:01:39.210> starts<00:01:39.450> rolling<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:40.020> quickly

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
contain if he starts rolling out quickly

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.780 
contain if he starts rolling out quickly
and<00:01:41.450> that'll<00:01:42.450> stop<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.899> immediately<00:01:43.670> but<00:01:44.670> if

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
and that'll stop that immediately but if

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.730 
and that'll stop that immediately but if
he<00:01:44.909> does<00:01:45.090> start<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:46.049> know<00:01:46.170> rolling<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
he does start you know rolling to the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.080 
he does start you know rolling to the
right<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.159> then<00:01:47.250> running<00:01:47.579> right<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
right and then running right up the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.880 
right and then running right up the
middle<00:01:48.299> we're<00:01:48.899> gonna<00:01:49.020> need<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.439> guy<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
middle we're gonna need that guy in the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.940 
middle we're gonna need that guy in the
spy<00:01:50.689> because<00:01:51.689> he's<00:01:52.049> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.320> stop<00:01:52.560> any

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
coming in with a spy so essentially we

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.430 
coming in with a spy so essentially we
have<00:02:53.100> all<00:02:53.400> our<00:02:53.460> d-backs<00:02:54.090> out<00:02:54.330> there<00:02:54.660> so

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
have all our d-backs out there so

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.990 
have all our d-backs out there so
there's<00:02:55.710> a<00:02:55.830> lot<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.040> coverage<00:02:56.430> on<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.700> field

there's a lot of coverage on the field

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.390 
there's a lot of coverage on the field
good<00:02:57.360> man<00:02:57.600> coverage<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.350> we<00:02:58.710> are<00:02:58.830> able<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.190> do

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
good man coverage and we are able to do

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.160 
good man coverage and we are able to do
whatever<00:03:00.180> we<00:03:00.390> want<00:03:00.630> with<00:03:00.750> those<00:03:00.930> three
