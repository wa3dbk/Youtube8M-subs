00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.819
 to a new video game with more 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.069
 childrens toys we will now 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.620
 together that kids soft knead 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.650
 Playdough games will be a try 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.820
 a true tongue twister and to 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.990
 Let's sort out the first thing 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.289
 we are all now 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.840
 mess and knead once the abc 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.359
 through now we have the whole 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.099
 letters molds according to 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.540
 order in alphabet and knead now 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.800
 once all letters from a to z through 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.899
 I do not show you all because 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.969
 otherwise it will take a while 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.930
 but at the end you see that 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.770
 final result I am already at 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.050
 arrived I show you now how 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.629
 I kneaded the last letters 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.840
 so you can see that too now 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.719
 just now make the blue with it too 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.010
 the colors alternate are all this 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.250
 bit more colorful then I take the v 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.100
 in that case there is still a bit 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.299
 the flat roller that was there I have 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.299
 actually not used at all 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.189
 it was similar to the biscuits 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.619
 the kneading also bake it like crazy 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.860
 actually, if a bit warmer 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.679
 then he gets ready too 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:37.500
 that feels a bit like that too 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:41.210
 JÃ¼lich to the kita then we take now 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.210
 the white kneading 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.810
 then it just turns that w flat 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.810
 to press 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.100
 the consistency reminds of the consistency 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:13.170
 Of this damp man a little to the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:16.790
 play plus do not knead this too tough 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.790
 but pretty soft 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.530
 then come the last ones 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.530
 two letters 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.050
 or last three, we are only now 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.050
 arrived 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.240
 this almost looks like chocolate 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.710
 I do not eat too unfortunately 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.550
 if only natural ingredients but 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:11.980
 are or food ingredients can 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.980
 unfortunately you do not knead 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.410
 or we take again the pink 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.410
 kneader 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.409
 for the y 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.830
 and then again the light green kneading for 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.830
 the Z 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.270
 so 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:47.510
 and done is our abc we have now 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:58.890
 everything from a to zabcdefgh 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:05:01.290
 ijklmnopqrstuvw xyz with 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.420
 the finished kneading alphabet you can 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:12.590
 then words like this place 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:12.590
 example and interrogate each other 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.240
 There you can think up a lot of things 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.070
 if you liked the video give me 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.170
 but a thumbs up left me 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.940
 a nice comment and forget 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.530
 not to subscribe to the channel we see 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.530
 Next time we go bye
