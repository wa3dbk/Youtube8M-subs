 milliliters of brandy is no longer needed for 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.020
 beginning we will prepare a syrup for pears 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.690

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.280
 liter of water and in which we throw honey 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.450
 sugar and our spices 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.450
 Well, let's get started 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.640
 bring the water to a boil in boiling water 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.640
 we add sugar 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.229
 cardamom and cloves cinnamon 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:44.890
 the ginger which I cut large and lemon 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:51.119
 I also cut half a lemon on 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.119
 quarters and do not forget about honey 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:02.000
 all this should dissolve well to and 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:07.789
 get a pear syrup and don't forget 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.310
 add brandy penny and we should 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:15.230
 peel and by the way take the pears 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.150
 surely with a tail so they will 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.239
 more beautiful look and more comfortable will be 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.489
 dough stick up what toys are fragrant 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:27.260
 very nice by the way in the winter to eat such 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:30.290
 fruit and pear cut off the tower fat 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.599
 eat have a penny we need to cut off 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.340
 the basis that they were more stable 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:41.660
 left plunge pear boiling water 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:44.239
 already syrup leave them stew on 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.549
 average heat about 20 minutes readiness we 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.340
 we will check with a fork while pears 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.470
 cooked we will cook puff pastry for 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.680
 sprinkle it with flour 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:00.400
 we got snowy Santa Claus and 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.400
 roll out the dough to 2-3 millimeters 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:20.400
 Now you need to cut the puff pastry into 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.739
 strips since the load is 4 lanes and should 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.150
 be at least four 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:29.340
 I will do more just in case 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.810
 strips about two and a half wide 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.319
 centimeter oven warmed up to 180 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:40.620
 degrees well then pears get cold 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:46.010
 to their windings take a strip of puff pastry 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:48.739
 and wrapped our pear 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.049
 if I didn't have enough dough for you 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:55.170
 take one more strip and wrap 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.769
 until the end we leave the tip is obtained 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.040

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.200
 do the rest with your pennies or 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.340
 Putting pears in a baking sheet with 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.780
 non-stick coating or you can 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.380
 do as i cover the parchment and 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.380
 send pears bake 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:19.979

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.700
 I put the pears in a beautiful dish 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.820
 pour the syrup that we stayed and 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.530
 add more 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.470
 powdered sugar but that's all pears 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.630

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.360
