00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
back here your firm will hit into this

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.159 
back here your firm will hit into this
part<00:04:32.580> here<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:33.120> when<00:04:33.300> slam<00:04:33.630> firing<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.050> will

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
part here and when slam firing it will

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.659 
part here and when slam firing it will
start<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.500> hurt<00:04:34.650> a<00:04:34.680> little<00:04:34.889> so<00:04:35.400> what<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:35.580> suggest

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
start to hurt a little so what I suggest

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.640 
start to hurt a little so what I suggest
when<00:04:36.240> priming<00:04:36.600> is<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:36.900> put<00:04:37.169> your<00:04:37.290> thumb<00:04:37.500> out

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
when priming is you put your thumb out

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.700
