00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:18.320
 good afternoon dear friends again glad to see you 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.670
 greet lemon model 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.740
 founder end with tesla coils 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.150
 center 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.400
 today i would like a little bit of you 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.919
 moral teaching is necessary to read it will be 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.230
 touch the fact that I'm already tired 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.220
 listen to your numerous complaints 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.830
 there on numerous copiers 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.230
 which develop themselves a lot 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.650
 a message comes that here I gave the bill 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.830
 did not have time on the same day 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:53.540
 own something to blame for a long time 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:58.060
 so that these people for example have 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:01.160
 to the fence of his rejoice at the details 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.710
 his policy was that someone who 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.060
 takes account takes example balance 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:11.360
 Almost 50,000 cease before it almost all 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.990
 I'm afraid of his balance when he gains a rope 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.990
 many bills 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:21.100
 10 20 30 daily works on 5 accounts 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.280
 made a bet with a maximum 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.560
 bet I will give 150 thousand in the accounts of you here 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.140
 and gets up at 7 and stitch you here still by 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.870
 the banks play that is straight clone well 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.030
 clouds this profit you when you lose it 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.680
 is taken for the next bill that is 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.070
 tactic this tactic is a benefit for him 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.110
 very and quick to use but for 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.030
 she is fraught with you that is no one is with him 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.450
 earns ie today we are 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.910
 earned tomorrow for working us another day 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.040
 This is the best I tell you 1 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.570
 there is to pay him a profit and on the third 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.020
 day and still happy 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.630
 Ie 3 practically not given why I 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.030
 I say this because I am daily 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.060
 VKontakte come messages which not 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:09.369
 actually bored already with regards to that 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:12.340
 that I didn’t merge the account there and so on 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.560
 Yesterday, while another person screamed 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.090
 please burn works want my but 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.099
 save not hope 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.040
 and so on we are not the last 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.500
 hope than our difference from these 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.170
 which we do not seek to quickly unleash and 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.790
 somehow 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.130
 that is, we do not risk all balance there 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.170
 our client, we sensibly evaluate 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.020
 situation we know what inserts 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.840
 fraught with such actions and experienced drops 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.610
 will never risk all banks 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.780
 it will only be looking for that person 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.220
 which is actually only 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.810
 works for itself and shop get 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.500
 profit is all the same to him 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.510
 and now this technique is still being said if 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.110
 lose account save money again 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.410
 send 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.810
 that is, constantly this kind of agitation 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.920
 I pass the day you received the Che is you 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.810
 you do n't care how our resource will be 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.790
 this is completely different as who already 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.870
 noticed who worked as for 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.819
 forecasts for the sport 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.580
 other resources have what we see 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.850
 statistics is not the end either it if there is 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.850
 tones 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.819
 the crowd saying you are derived from the total for 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.620
 month without the bare numbers in general without that 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.129
 what was given daily so on with us 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.140
 completely transparent so think 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.239
 especially compared analyze 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.079
 situation will not be deceived 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:39.230
 Further Simka take about whom I speak from him 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:42.230
 there accounts balance and takes on a hundred thousand and 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.970
 immediately costs 70 to one hundred thousand that is 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.069
 from the balance of you here it is still 170 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.079
 thousand there is a risk he has almost everyone 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.170
 banks at the same time are at a factor of 1 and 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:54.079
 2 Is not this funny and you should 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.049
 think if you see copper when 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.090
 100,000 balance puts almost the entire bank and 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.230
 shows the gain well, so it is shown 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.569
 winning bid only 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.930
 and how many failures on such he had 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.720
 people stalker was losing their banks about it 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.909
 you need to think and you see these numbers 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.120
 think about and I will not play you either 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.769
 show results that merge 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.239
 that's all just think a little bit i 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:23.560
 we are tired of reporting 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.419
 it is personally your trouble is that you 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.460
 don't trust the essay 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.199
 rationally by whether it's all obvious who 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.340
 how does it work then what else 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:37.310
 what makes us different is what we don’t 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.289
 allowed to leave a balance on the balance of 30,000 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.400
 no more than 20 percent of the bank we allow 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.919
 stand no more 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.419
 This is a criterion for all copiers 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.690
 someone is worth more you can please 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:51.979
 personally to me and we will take action already 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:55.430
 but this does not happen as a rule further 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.400
 what's the difference what we are all 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.380
 always checked competitions 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.840
 if the indicator times a bunch below 80 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.810
 percent hives spun the house 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.810
 respectively, already removed from office 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:12.960
 a stormy paint of which is held 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.290
 everything just thinking and analyzing is not 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.020
 get fooled you know bare show-off there here 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:23.630
 these screens are winning only, that's all 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.370
 people success on which proper 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.139
 designed for human greed 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.139
 which 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:33.699
 you provoke what you 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.699
 used the services of these people 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.789
 in general, all this is a warning if 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.479
 my advice i'm not saying enjoy our 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.300
 services 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.639
 I just do n't feel sorry for the only one 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.050
 and you were deceived 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.590
 all thanks all the best we will be still 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.590
 meet
