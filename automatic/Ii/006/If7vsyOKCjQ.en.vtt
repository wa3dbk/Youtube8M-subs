00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
can which this one holds a gallon then I

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.160 
can which this one holds a gallon then I
poured<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.160> into<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.640> now<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.930> have

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
poured it into this now that I have

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.810 
poured it into this now that I have
these<00:00:28.380> all<00:00:28.680> planted<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.310> roots<00:00:29.519> are<00:00:29.699> not

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
these all planted the roots are not

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.920 
these all planted the roots are not
connected<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:32.040> reason<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.489> have<00:00:32.610> a

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
connected and the reason I have a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.670 
connected and the reason I have a
watering<00:00:33.930> can

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
watering can

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.740 
watering can
sprayer<00:00:35.309> they<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.670> spray<00:00:35.880> upside<00:00:35.910> down<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
sprayer they can spray upside down and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.010 
sprayer they can spray upside down and
so<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.140> what<00:00:37.290> I'm<00:00:37.410> doing<00:00:37.440> right<00:00:37.710> now<00:00:39.020> you

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
so I can do what I'm doing right now you

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.720 
so I can do what I'm doing right now you
want<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> spray<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.800> around<00:00:41.100> each<00:00:41.370> one<00:00:41.640> of

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
want to spray in around each one of

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.310 
want to spray in around each one of
these<00:00:41.820> plants<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:43.129> couple<00:00:44.129> shots<00:00:45.110> that<00:00:46.110> will

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
these plants a couple shots that will

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.490 
these plants a couple shots that will
get<00:00:47.100> down<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.670> make<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.450> roots<00:00:48.690> attached<00:00:49.170> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
get down and make the roots attached to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.319 
get down and make the roots attached to
the<00:00:49.620> soil<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.399> won't<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.699> any<00:00:53.820> chance<00:00:54.090> of

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the soil and it won't be any chance of

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.619 
the soil and it won't be any chance of
I'm<00:00:54.480> dying<00:00:55.010> because<00:00:56.010> they've<00:00:56.430> got<00:00:56.670> liquid

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
I'm dying because they've got liquid

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.569 
I'm dying because they've got liquid
near<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.530> roots<00:00:58.739> because<00:00:59.010> right<00:00:59.309> now<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
near the roots because right now the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.819 
near the roots because right now the
roots<00:00:59.969> are<00:01:00.149> not<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:00.870> clinging<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.620> any

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
roots are not actually clinging to any

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.940 
roots are not actually clinging to any
of<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> sole<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.750> covered<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.530> I

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.340 

did<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> little<00:01:08.189> research<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.000> spoon<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
did a little research on this spoon the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.250 
did a little research on this spoon the
largest<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:12.049> tablespoon<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> half

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
largest in is a tablespoon and a half

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380 
largest in is a tablespoon and a half
and<00:01:13.770> they<00:01:14.369> said<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> average<00:01:15.060> water<00:01:15.240> in

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
and they said the average water in

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.390 
and they said the average water in
Cannon<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.930> gallon<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.530> half<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.340> you

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
Cannon is a gallon and a half so you

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.090 
Cannon is a gallon and a half so you
would<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.180> level<00:01:18.689> not<00:01:18.960> heaping<00:01:19.439> just

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
would have that level not heaping just

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.649 
would have that level not heaping just
like<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.430> you're<00:01:20.520> making<00:01:20.759> biscuits<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
like if you're making biscuits in the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.450 
like if you're making biscuits in the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
powder or baking soda you would level

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.850 
powder or baking soda you would level
your<00:01:27.030> measurements<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:28.259> would<00:01:28.439> go<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
your measurements that would go for a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.969 
your measurements that would go for a
gallon<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> half<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:30.540> water<00:01:30.710> this<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.770> a
