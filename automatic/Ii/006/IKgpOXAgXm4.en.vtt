00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
is going to be a shorter wheelbase

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.359 
is going to be a shorter wheelbase
version<00:00:19.779> and<00:00:20.349> the<00:00:20.829> other<00:00:20.949> one<00:00:21.099> a<00:00:21.130> longer

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
version and the other one a longer

wheelbase<00:00:21.610> version<00:00:21.820> both<00:00:22.449> have<00:00:22.660> got<00:00:22.779> their

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
wheelbase version both have got their

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.780 
wheelbase version both have got their
pros<00:00:23.140> and<00:00:23.169> cons<00:00:23.500> let's<00:00:24.070> check<00:00:24.340> them<00:00:24.460> out<00:00:24.550> and

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
pros and cons let's check them out and

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.889 
pros and cons let's check them out and
see<00:00:25.000> what<00:00:25.090> they're<00:00:25.239> all<00:00:25.300> about<00:00:27.450> so<00:00:28.450> basically

this<00:00:29.230> exit<00:00:29.619> evo<00:00:29.829> here<00:00:30.040> from<00:00:30.219> piaggio<00:00:30.640> is<00:00:30.700> what

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
this exit evo here from piaggio is what

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.700 
this exit evo here from piaggio is what
I'd<00:00:31.029> consider<00:00:31.180> be<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.599> long-wheelbase<00:00:32.020> scooter

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
I'd consider be a long-wheelbase scooter

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.500 
I'd consider be a long-wheelbase scooter
you<00:00:32.980> can<00:00:33.100> see<00:00:33.309> it's<00:00:33.760> quite<00:00:33.910> a<00:00:34.000> stretched<00:00:34.360> out

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
you can see it's quite a stretched out

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.900 
you can see it's quite a stretched out
sort<00:00:34.809> of<00:00:34.840> look<00:00:35.020> tend<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:35.860> sit<00:00:36.010> down<00:00:36.219> inside<00:00:36.730> the

perimeter<00:00:37.090> of<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.450> bike<00:00:37.660> they<00:00:38.170> often<00:00:38.379> have<00:00:38.500> a

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
perimeter of the bike they often have a

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.590 
perimeter of the bike they often have a
screen<00:00:38.890> and<00:00:39.100> they're<00:00:39.879> fantastic<00:00:40.059> for

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
screen and they're fantastic for

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.270

so<00:03:03.910> in<00:03:04.299> conclusion<00:03:04.480> here's<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.410> deal<00:03:05.590> as<00:03:05.769> far

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
so in conclusion here's the deal as far

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.070 
so in conclusion here's the deal as far
as<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:06.250> said<00:03:06.519> if<00:03:07.030> you're<00:03:07.239> riding<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.630> work<00:03:07.810> five

as I said if you're riding the work five

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.780 
as I said if you're riding the work five
days<00:03:08.290> a<00:03:08.350> week<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.830> that's<00:03:09.340> they<00:03:09.489> think<00:03:09.700> what

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
days a week and that's they think what

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.009 
days a week and that's they think what
you're<00:03:09.880> going<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.030> use<00:03:10.180> your<00:03:10.299> scoop<00:03:10.570> for<00:03:10.750> I'd

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
you're going to use your scoop for I'd

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.690 
you're going to use your scoop for I'd
probably<00:03:11.410> consider<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:12.190> short<00:03:12.489> wheelbase

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
probably consider the short wheelbase

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.550 
probably consider the short wheelbase
