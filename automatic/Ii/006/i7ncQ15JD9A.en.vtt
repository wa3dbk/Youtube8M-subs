 San Alejo Flea Market: June 2015 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.540
 There is a flea market that takes place on the first Saturday of every month 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.980
 The Sanalejo flea market is a traditional event where many artisans and merchants sell their merchandise 

00:00:34.254 --> 00:00:41.474
 Although the majority of the market is occupied by artisans, there is also a section of plants and products for the garden 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.089
 On the right! 

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:55.742
 Here you can not find products found in the big stores. Instead, you will find home-made products and cultivated plants of local farmers or merchants 

00:00:57.188 --> 00:01:02.888
 Orchids are the most common plants to find, but there is also a wide variety of tropical plants 

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:09.518
 But you can not come expecting to find something in particular. You will never know what you are going to find! 

00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:17.956
 Orchids can be found in a wide range of prices, which you can always negotiate with the seller 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.680
 This is usually my first stop. Here I buy some hardy cattleyas 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.020
 Continuing, we find many more varieties 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.780
 I wanted those two Cattleyas, but when I stopped recording they had already sold them :( 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:52.089
 Even though I buy orchids also in nurseries and stores, the orchids I buy here are among the healthiest 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.980
 It all depends on choosing wisely and giving them good treatments as soon as they get home 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.840
 (sorry, it's the other way around!) 

00:03:22.087 --> 00:03:27.207
 Other popular plants in the market are bromeliads and anthuriums 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.500
 Succulent plants are also very common to find 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.100
 The materos are sold in all sizes and materials, as well as wooden and wire baskets 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.240
 As a substrate they sell: * What they call 'rotten stick' which are pieces of wood from dead trees 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.940
 * BoÃ±iga: it is a common substrate used by peasants 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.020
 * Rice husk: for bromeliads or as part of other substrate mixtures 

00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:17.095
 As a fertilizer they use more than all foliar mixtures. I do not use any of these substrates, but I think they work under certain conditions. 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.160
 We can discuss this topic in a separate video! 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.800
