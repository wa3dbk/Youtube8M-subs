so here it is with the antenna right so
here<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.420> batteries<00:04:46.400> sticker<00:04:47.400> small<00:04:48.150> parts

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
here the batteries sticker small parts

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.050 
here the batteries sticker small parts
the<00:04:50.070> battery<00:04:50.720> for<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.900> card<00:04:52.310> needy<00:04:53.310> the

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
the battery for the card needy the

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.949 
the battery for the card needy the
charger

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:56.959 

00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:01.009 

yeah<00:04:57.959> the<00:04:58.199> transmitter<00:04:59.209> so<00:05:00.209> far<00:05:00.509> I<00:05:00.539> really

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:01.019 
yeah the transmitter so far I really

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:03.469 
yeah the transmitter so far I really
like<00:05:01.169> this<00:05:01.349> let's<00:05:02.129> sink<00:05:02.429> the<00:05:02.580> body<00:05:02.789> pins<00:05:03.179> off

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
like this let's sink the body pins off

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:10.489 
like this let's sink the body pins off
and<00:05:03.809> see<00:05:04.019> what's<00:05:04.169> inside<00:05:04.289> of<00:05:06.289> the<00:05:07.289> body<00:05:09.499> see

00:05:10.489 --> 00:05:10.499 
and see what's inside of the body see

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:20.389 
and see what's inside of the body see
how<00:05:10.649> to<00:05:10.709> get<00:05:10.889> this<00:05:11.039> off<00:05:17.089> I<00:05:18.739> let<00:05:19.739> the<00:05:19.860> body<00:05:20.069> and

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:20.399 
how to get this off I let the body and

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:22.669 
how to get this off I let the body and
so<00:05:20.550> what<00:05:20.759> looks<00:05:21.059> like<00:05:21.269> it's<00:05:21.479> pretty<00:05:21.809> strong

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:22.679 
so what looks like it's pretty strong

00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:26.149 
so what looks like it's pretty strong
body<00:05:23.539> my<00:05:24.539> friend<00:05:24.869> had<00:05:25.199> the<00:05:25.349> circuit<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:25.889> he

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
body my friend had the circuit and he

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.019 
body my friend had the circuit and he
crashing<00:05:26.639> into<00:05:26.879> the<00:05:26.909> poles<00:05:28.789> shattered<00:05:29.789> like

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029 
crashing into the poles shattered like

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:33.919 
crashing into the poles shattered like
it<00:05:30.209> was<00:05:30.360> one<00:05:30.539> of<00:05:30.569> those<00:05:30.749> plastic<00:05:31.079> cups<00:05:32.360> so<00:05:33.360> this

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:33.929 
it was one of those plastic cups so this

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:36.879 
it was one of those plastic cups so this
one<00:05:34.169> seems<00:05:34.469> a<00:05:34.889> lot<00:05:35.189> more<00:05:35.219> durable<00:05:35.729> matter<00:05:35.999> I

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
one seems a lot more durable matter I

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.519 
one seems a lot more durable matter I
