00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
both so when you're in the tablet mode

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.230 
both so when you're in the tablet mode
as<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.800> see<00:02:14.100> when<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.460> flip<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.910> into<00:02:15.090> the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
as you see when you flip it into the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.800 
as you see when you flip it into the
sample<00:02:15.630> mode<00:02:15.810> we<00:02:16.620> go<00:02:16.830> into<00:02:17.250> different<00:02:17.910> UI<00:02:18.300> so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
sample mode we go into different UI so

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.020 
sample mode we go into different UI so
it's<00:02:18.930> 107<00:02:19.350> premium<00:02:19.920> but<00:02:20.070> we've<00:02:20.220> got<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.430> very

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
it's 107 premium but we've got a very

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.430 
it's 107 premium but we've got a very
touch<00:02:21.360> optimized<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.350> with<00:02:22.650> large<00:02:22.920> icons

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
touch optimized you I with large icons

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.960 
touch optimized you I with large icons
