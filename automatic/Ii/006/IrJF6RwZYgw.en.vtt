00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.980
 leachate leachates is not only 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.020
 a problem that falls within the field of 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.869
 engineering because it's also a problem 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.970
 of education and integral management of 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.850
 solid waste from the generation 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.090
 until the final disposition including 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.750
 the aspects of segregation 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:41.150
 storage collection transport 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.739
 classification and treatment is to say a 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.050
 good integral management of 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.870
 authorities against waste 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.300
 solid minimize the generation of 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.280
 the byproducts of degradation of the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.440
 biodegradable organic matter 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.559
 what is meant by segregation a 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.660
 source is the process of separating 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.969
 solid waste at the point where it 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.909
 generates locating it according to the class and 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.909
 container to which it corresponds in a 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.620
 effort to reduce reuse and 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.780
 Recycle 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.080
 It is seen in this dump shakira 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.060
 the disorderly disposition of 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.580
 solid waste or the lack of a 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.710
 integral policy and especially the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.470
 sensitivity of the mayor's authority 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.270
 of the municipality of cusco 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.570
 when the segregation of waste 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.580
 solids is nil or deficient makes 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.830
 the classification of them so 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.620
 that are mostly arranged without due 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.750
 separation and classification in places of 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.290
 final exhibition in which there is room 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.090
 the degradation of solid waste 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.310
 biodegradable products that generate their products 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.140
 which are broken down through 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.630
 a series of biological processes and 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.960
 physical chemistries during this process 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.320
 decomposition gases are formed methane 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.860
 loyal hydrocarbon and ccoo among others and a 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.370
 liquid effluent called leachate 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.740
 what are the exiles the leachates are 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.590
 liquids of an intense black color or 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.530
 brown with unpleasant odor with a 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.160
 high organic load and toxicity 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.310
 what are highly polluting 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.470
 how the exiles are generated 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.480
 are generated by the degradation of 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.290
 organic matter biodegradable 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.540
 present in solid waste 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.510
 due to the humidity of the material 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.060
 organic and to the water drilling of 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.760
 rains through the fact of waste 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.060
 solids dragging and dissolving 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.530
 different components that with 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.890
 the explorer if the solids deposit 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.069
 such as heavy metals nitrogen 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.770
 ammoniacal inorganic salts among others 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.680
 in some cases they have found 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.040
 200 different compounds some of 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.440
 they toxic and even carcinogenic the 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.420
 leached and the environment the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.450
 leached by its high organic load 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.090
 and its high toxicity is one of the 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.730
 most polluting byproducts should be 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.000
 otherwise handled properly 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.010
 pollute the air the floors and can 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.290
 reach the surface waters and 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.840
 underground causing as a result 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.820
 environmental and health problems because 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.060
 many times these polluted waters 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.580
 are used for irrigation and for consumption 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.319
 human without the proper treatment 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.810
 what most of the cases 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.030
 leachate are re circulated in the 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.850
 places of final disposal and treaties 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.400
 in oxidation lagoons 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.460
 it is noted that the exiles are 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.890
 exceeding the oxidation ponds of this 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.820
 shakira dump and they are running 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.290
 towards the lower area of the ravine 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:56.260
 contaminating the environment of this 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.260
 area called shakira community
