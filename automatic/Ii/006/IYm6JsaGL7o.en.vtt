 In 2014, the Brazilian World Cup team will have to tell me that someone has failed me. 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.780
 Ask fits often fail when you look 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.660
 Because the World Cup is not a place to experience but a place to show, 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.690
 I think that I did not prove it. 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:55.269
