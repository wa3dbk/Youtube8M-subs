00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.530
 Martin is a former athlete 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.600
 and weightlifters and earlier 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.090
 national coach in women's hammer throw 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.190
 He is considered an expert in the field of 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.619
 athletics and is a referee for 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.520
 power and speed nationally like 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.220
 international 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.750
 The 53-year-old is a club draft 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.939
 support point trainer in kulmbach and 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.699
 accompanies young up-and-coming talents 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:38.539
 your task is a task that the conscience 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.549
 something of course a special charm then 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.559
 especially in our society it 

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:44.170
 is so the young generation 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.089
 always a bit the zero buck 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.829
 characters after st we have but then 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.829
 here with us already a whole row from 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:56.359
 very ambitious young people who 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.699
 actually it does not wait until the 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.170
 to be led but wait for it 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.969
 to be properly guided and then 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.040
 also makes it fun to accompany and 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.810
 again and again a little bit 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.159
 butt to get to praise the other 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.590
 the other a little bit to cope 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.689
 but tear in the large whole is a 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.399
 very funny compact family 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.479
 I have that in the month or the 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.409
 kirsten mÃ¼nchow on people too 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.929
 world championships 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.340
 brought European championships have 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.380
 medals have also been placed well 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.570
 won at higher 23 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.789
 European championships for example but 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.530
 the biggest successes with surprising 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.619
 and there is a whole row where you can 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.729
 just suddenly believed sudden 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.670
 somebody became german youth master 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.829
 quite a few without the right one 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.049
 Preparation is not a master of 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.520
 What did martin steltner like? 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.520
 maybe special training methods 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:48.040
 a whole lot though 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.390
 an eerie width we also in the 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.270
 run the training year in 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.470
 different phases on walls important 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.360
 is always that they the the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.210
 training methods interlock that 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.180
 is piece by piece based and that 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.560
 always enough change there that is 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.899
 from the exercises of the methods 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.310
 also to always new stimuli 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.050
 do not just put within one 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.530
 training camps but also over years 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.930
 away for a talent if the 1 2 years 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.480
 the same training rather than the noon 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.900
 Let's try and discuss 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.730
 javelin hammer throw or shot put 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.910
 Anyway, understanding has none 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.100
 favorite discipline 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.080
 He becomes his young offspring athlete 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.290
 and continue to stand by the side and see 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.069
 Sent in the direction of the future we have 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.630
 now here in our group a few 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.519
 top-class talents like our brothers 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.030
 probably the last year as the best 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.030
