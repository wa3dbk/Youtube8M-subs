support this all the newer games will be

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.090 
support this all the newer games will be
supporting<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.609> newer<00:00:59.820> MF<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.620> standard<00:01:01.620> which

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
supporting a newer MF I standard which

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.579 
supporting a newer MF I standard which
this<00:01:02.520> doesn't<00:01:02.820> support<00:01:03.180> unfortunately<00:01:03.870> now

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
this doesn't support unfortunately now

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.320 
this doesn't support unfortunately now
as<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.890> mentioned<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.400> controller<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.970> very

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
as I mentioned this controller is very

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.149 
as I mentioned this controller is very
similar<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> layout<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.500> an<00:01:07.619> Xbox<00:01:07.799> 360

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
similar to the layout of an Xbox 360

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.490 
similar to the layout of an Xbox 360
controller<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.170> has<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
controller and as you can see it has the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.260 
controller and as you can see it has the
two<00:01:10.680> analog<00:01:11.010> sticks<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.520> d-pad<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.180> buttons

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
two analog sticks the d-pad and buttons

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.469 
two analog sticks the d-pad and buttons
and<00:01:13.260> shoulder<00:01:13.680> buttons<00:01:13.979> now<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> d-pad<00:01:15.000> isn't

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and shoulder buttons now the d-pad isn't

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.359 
and shoulder buttons now the d-pad isn't
great<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.990> little<00:01:16.229> bit<00:01:16.409> mushy<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.979> very

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
great it's a little bit mushy and very

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.149 
great it's a little bit mushy and very
similar<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.030> fact<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> Xbox<00:01:19.140> 360<00:01:19.770> d-pad

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
similar in fact to the Xbox 360 d-pad

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.609 
similar in fact to the Xbox 360 d-pad
but<00:01:20.189> actually<00:01:20.759> worse<00:01:21.020> surprisingly<00:01:22.020> if<00:01:22.200> that

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
but actually worse surprisingly if that

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.539 
but actually worse surprisingly if that
was<00:01:22.830> even<00:01:22.860> possible

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
was even possible

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.370 
was even possible
apart<00:01:24.180> from<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.509> though<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.960> rest<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
apart from that though the rest of the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.990 
apart from that though the rest of the
controller<00:01:25.710> works<00:01:25.950> really<00:01:26.159> nicely<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.820> works

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
controller works really nicely it works

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.850 
controller works really nicely it works
really<00:01:27.180> well<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.540> games<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.020> played<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.680> with<00:01:28.829> a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
really well in games I played it with a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.760 
really well in games I played it with a
ps1<00:01:29.310> emulator<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:31.530> n64<00:01:32.430> emulator<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.590> used<00:01:34.590> it

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
ps1 emulator and n64 emulator I used it

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.990 
ps1 emulator and n64 emulator I used it
with<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> handful<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.280> games<00:01:35.460> from<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> Play

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
with a handful of games from the Play

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.030 
with a handful of games from the Play
Store<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.299> used<00:01:36.600> dead<00:01:36.869> trigger<00:01:37.140> Virtua<00:01:37.950> Tennis

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
Store I used dead trigger Virtua Tennis
and<00:01:38.460> Riptide<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.119> all<00:01:39.270> worked<00:01:39.509> perfectly

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and Riptide and all worked perfectly

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.289 
and Riptide and all worked perfectly
well<00:01:40.140> different<00:01:41.130> from<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> original<00:01:41.520> 360

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
why these were included but the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.929 
why these were included but the
up-and-down<00:01:49.530> volumes<00:01:50.159> make<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> lot<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.700> sense

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939

for about 20 hours

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.340 
for about 20 hours
I<00:02:05.460> found<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.180> lasted<00:02:06.600> for<00:02:06.719> quite<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> long<00:02:07.110> time

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
I found it lasted for quite a long time

I found it lasted for quite a long time
and<00:02:07.590> longer<00:02:07.920> than<00:02:08.310> my<00:02:08.640> phone<00:02:08.849> ever<00:02:09.149> would<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.509> I

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
and longer than my phone ever would so I

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.729 
and longer than my phone ever would so I
don't<00:02:09.780> think<00:02:09.929> it's<00:02:10.050> ever<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.289> concern<00:02:10.709> that

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
don't think it's ever a concern that

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.290 
don't think it's ever a concern that
this<00:02:11.009> would<00:02:11.069> run<00:02:11.340> out<00:02:11.430> battery<00:02:11.879> before<00:02:12.000> your

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
this would run out battery before your

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.070 
this would run out battery before your
phone<00:02:12.480> would

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
phone would

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.900

now<00:02:13.590> sometimes<00:02:14.070> found<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.490> little<00:02:14.790> bit

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
now sometimes found it a little bit

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.730 
now sometimes found it a little bit
fiddly<00:02:15.150> when<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:15.870> was<00:02:16.050> reconnecting<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
fiddly when I was reconnecting the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.590 
fiddly when I was reconnecting the
controller<00:02:17.070> after<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.640> turned<00:02:17.880> off<00:02:18.120> or<00:02:18.360> I'd

controller after it turned off or I'd

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.420 
controller after it turned off or I'd
turned<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.080> off<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.470> think<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.040> best<00:02:20.220> thing<00:02:20.400> to

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
turned it off I think the best thing to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.220 
turned it off I think the best thing to
do<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.790> always<00:02:21.030> on<00:02:21.210> pair<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.630> controller<00:02:22.020> and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
do is always on pair the controller and

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.200 
do is always on pair the controller and
then<00:02:22.380> just<00:02:22.560> repair<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.220> with<00:02:23.340> your<00:02:23.490> phone<00:02:23.700> once

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
then just repair it with your phone once

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.120 
then just repair it with your phone once
you<00:02:24.330> turn<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.600> Bluetooth<00:02:24.780> back<00:02:25.170> on<00:02:25.380> if<00:02:25.560> you

you turn the Bluetooth back on if you

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
for a controller especially one which is
