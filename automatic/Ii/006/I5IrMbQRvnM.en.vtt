00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.490 
to make this more of a a trophy base
rather<00:02:14.370> than<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.970> combination<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:16.080> resource

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
rather than a combination of a resource

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.120 
rather than a combination of a resource
and<00:02:16.770> trophy<00:02:17.130> base<00:02:17.310> then<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.510> can<00:02:18.540> easily

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
and trophy base then you can easily

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.640 
and trophy base then you can easily
switch<00:02:20.130> out<00:02:20.340> your<00:02:20.640> two<00:02:20.910> wizard<00:02:21.840> oops

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
gold storages and you'll see it right

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.530 
gold storages and you'll see it right
when<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.480> do<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.900> where's<00:02:34.320> my<00:02:34.440> other<00:02:34.590> one

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
when I do that where's my other one

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.340 
when I do that where's my other one
let's<00:02:36.540> put<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.810> up<00:02:36.930> there<00:02:37.970> zoom<00:02:38.970> back<00:02:39.180> out<00:02:39.450> and

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
let's put it up there zoom back out and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.100 
let's put it up there zoom back out and
you<00:02:41.160> can<00:02:41.310> see<00:02:41.490> now<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:42.180> have<00:02:42.390> pretty

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
you can see now that you have pretty

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.140 
you can see now that you have pretty
substantial<00:02:43.890> coverage<00:02:44.280> on<00:02:44.490> your<00:02:44.550> Town<00:02:44.910> Hall

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
substantial coverage on your Town Hall

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.900 
substantial coverage on your Town Hall
right<00:02:45.390> there<00:02:45.570> in<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.750> middle<00:02:46.640> this<00:02:47.640> is

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
right there in the middle this is

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.210 
right there in the middle this is
probably<00:02:48.270> what<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.570> would<00:02:48.720> roll<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:49.470> over<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
probably what I would roll with over the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.350 
probably what I would roll with over the
other<00:02:50.400> one<00:02:50.670> because<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:52.700> like<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.910> trophies<00:02:54.330> a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
other one because I like the trophies a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.130 
other one because I like the trophies a
little<00:02:54.630> bit<00:02:54.750> more<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:57.630> player

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
little bit more in this the player

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.050 
little bit more in this the player
versus<00:02:58.440> player<00:02:58.470> action<00:02:59.130> in<00:02:59.340> clash<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.790> clans

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
versus player action in clash of clans

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.210 
versus player action in clash of clans
is<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.270> little<00:03:00.570> bit<00:03:00.690> more<00:03:00.870> fun<00:03:01.140> than<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.739> player

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
is a little bit more fun than the player

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.060 
is a little bit more fun than the player
player<00:03:03.180> versus<00:03:03.600> player<00:03:03.630> action<00:03:04.350> in<00:03:04.590> samurai

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
player versus player action in samurai

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.930 
player versus player action in samurai
siege<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:06.180> that's<00:03:06.540> why<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.900> would<00:03:07.440> like<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.940> more

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
siege so that's why I would like to more

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.120 
siege so that's why I would like to more
thoroughly<00:03:09.120> protect<00:03:09.660> my<00:03:09.810> town<00:03:10.050> hall<00:03:12.980> but<00:03:13.980> yeah

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
thoroughly protect my town hall but yeah

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.680 
thoroughly protect my town hall but yeah
either<00:03:14.340> worse<00:03:14.610> fun<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:15.120> can<00:03:15.270> do<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.510> whatever

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
either worse fun you can do it whatever

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.270 
either worse fun you can do it whatever
you<00:03:15.930> want<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.200> do<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:17.160> could<00:03:17.310> even<00:03:19.280> switch

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
you want to do you could even switch

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:31.370 
you want to do you could even switch
these<00:03:20.640> out

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.870 

and<00:03:32.380> then<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.590> think<00:03:32.680> that's<00:03:32.920> also<00:03:33.310> very<00:03:33.340> very

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
and then I think that's also very very

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.330 
and then I think that's also very very
solid<00:03:34.180> very<00:03:34.770> solid<00:03:35.770> defense<00:03:36.069> right<00:03:36.280> there

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
solid very solid defense right there

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.090 
solid very solid defense right there
because<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:37.330> still<00:03:37.600> have<00:03:37.810> your<00:03:38.100> wizard

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
because you still have your wizard

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.150 
because you still have your wizard
towers<00:03:39.430> right<00:03:39.640> here<00:03:39.850> in<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.030> middle<00:03:41.160> you've

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
towers right here in the middle you've

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
towers right here in the middle you've
got<00:03:42.400> your<00:03:42.580> gold<00:03:42.850> pretty<00:03:43.240> well<00:03:43.390> protected<00:03:45.180> and

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
got your gold pretty well protected and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.949 
got your gold pretty well protected and
then<00:03:47.050> you've<00:03:47.200> got<00:03:47.380> three<00:03:48.330> powerful<00:03:49.330> defenses

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
then you've got three powerful defenses

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.370 
then you've got three powerful defenses
on<00:03:50.110> that<00:03:50.260> on<00:03:50.410> either<00:03:50.709> side<00:03:52.200> actually<00:03:53.200> I<00:03:53.230> think

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
on that on either side actually I think

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.750 
on that on either side actually I think
I<00:03:53.590> like<00:03:53.770> this<00:03:53.920> setup<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.340> little<00:03:54.520> bit<00:03:54.640> better

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
I like this setup a little bit better

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.470 
I like this setup a little bit better
than<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.060> last<00:03:55.239> one<00:03:55.360> but<00:03:57.090> yeah<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.150> can<00:03:58.390> play

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480
