I've done a lot of work with Fred Earle
and<00:00:56.079> I<00:00:56.140> think<00:00:56.380> you're<00:00:56.500> familiar<00:00:56.650> with<00:00:56.890> a<00:00:56.980> lot

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
and I think you're familiar with a lot

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.530 
and I think you're familiar with a lot
of<00:00:57.250> material<00:00:57.640> I've<00:00:57.700> written<00:00:57.880> about<00:00:58.060> the<00:00:58.300> five

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
of material I've written about the five

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.740 
of material I've written about the five
keys<00:00:58.840> to<00:00:58.870> building<00:00:59.770> self-confidence<00:01:00.540> but<00:01:01.540> as

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
keys to building self-confidence but as

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.369 
keys to building self-confidence but as
regards<00:01:02.290> your<00:01:02.710> eyes<00:01:03.629> there's<00:01:04.629> a<00:01:04.720> very<00:01:04.960> common

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
regards your eyes there's a very common

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.670 
regards your eyes there's a very common
error<00:01:05.560> I<00:01:05.619> see<00:01:05.950> on<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.220> court<00:01:07.350> many<00:01:08.350> players

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
error I see on the court many players

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.399 
error I see on the court many players
are<00:01:09.009> extremely<00:01:09.640> good<00:01:09.820> at<00:01:09.960> zooming<00:01:10.960> about

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
are extremely good at zooming about

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.950 
are extremely good at zooming about
keeping<00:01:11.920> their<00:01:12.070> eyes<00:01:12.450> focused<00:01:13.450> on<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.630> ball

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
keeping their eyes focused on the ball

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.280 
keeping their eyes focused on the ball
when<00:01:14.229> hitting<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:15.729> not<00:01:15.939> always<00:01:16.210> at<00:01:16.600> as<00:01:16.869> good

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
when hitting but not always at as good

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.919 
when hitting but not always at as good
at<00:01:17.439> scanning<00:01:18.069> and<00:01:18.219> seeing<00:01:18.909> exactly<00:01:19.749> what's

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
at scanning and seeing exactly what's

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:21.289 
at scanning and seeing exactly what's
happening<00:01:20.229> on<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.439> other<00:01:20.469> side<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:20.859> the<00:01:20.920> court

happening on the other side of the court

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.660 
happening on the other side of the court
exactly<00:01:22.299> what<00:01:22.479> is<00:01:22.630> most<00:01:22.899> likely<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.380> happen

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
exactly what is most likely to happen

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.789 
exactly what is most likely to happen
others<00:01:24.670> somehow<00:01:25.060> are<00:01:25.450> very<00:01:25.899> good<00:01:26.079> at<00:01:26.200> scanning

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
others somehow are very good at scanning

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.709 
others somehow are very good at scanning
they<00:01:27.009> see<00:01:27.069> things<00:01:27.520> over<00:01:27.789> there<00:01:28.030> but<00:01:28.600> they

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
they see things over there but they

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.559 
they see things over there but they
can't<00:01:28.990> track<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.469> ball<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.759> years<00:01:31.209> ago<00:01:31.270> I<00:01:31.450> came

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
can't track the ball so years ago I came

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:33.179 
can't track the ball so years ago I came
across<00:01:31.749> something<00:01:32.259> called<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.679> test<00:01:32.950> of

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
across something called the test of

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.429 
across something called the test of
attentional<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.389> attention<00:01:35.259> and

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
attentional and attention and

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.679 
attentional and attention and
interpersonal<00:01:35.799> style<00:01:36.310> kind<00:01:36.999> of<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.149> big<00:01:37.359> phrase

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
interpersonal style kind of a big phrase

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.599 
interpersonal style kind of a big phrase
but<00:01:38.049> it<00:01:38.200> was<00:01:38.319> an<00:01:38.439> assessment<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:39.219> would

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
but it was an assessment that would

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.749 
but it was an assessment that would
identify<00:01:39.759> whether<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:41.289> have<00:01:41.799> more<00:01:42.159> skills<00:01:42.520> as

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
identify whether you have more skills as

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.569 
identify whether you have more skills as
a<00:01:42.789> watchmaker<00:01:43.740> working<00:01:44.740> in<00:01:44.859> small<00:01:45.159> confined

a watchmaker working in small confined

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.969 
a watchmaker working in small confined
areas<00:01:45.999> zooming<00:01:46.600> or<00:01:46.810> you'd<00:01:47.289> have<00:01:47.499> more<00:01:47.709> skill

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
areas zooming or you'd have more skill

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.190 
areas zooming or you'd have more skill
as<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.159> policeman<00:01:48.789> seeing<00:01:49.539> everything<00:01:49.749> on<00:01:49.990> the

as a policeman seeing everything on the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.889 
as a policeman seeing everything on the
court<00:01:50.499> or<00:01:50.709> on<00:01:50.819> the<00:01:51.819> street<00:01:52.149> such<00:01:52.569> that<00:01:52.779> they

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
court or on the street such that they

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.010 
court or on the street such that they
think<00:01:52.959> a<00:01:53.399> policeman's<00:01:54.689> visual<00:01:55.689> acuity

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
think a policeman's visual acuity

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.050 
think a policeman's visual acuity
wouldn't<00:01:56.529> work<00:01:56.679> well<00:01:56.920> for<00:01:57.219> a<00:01:57.279> watchmaker<00:01:57.849> or<00:01:57.969> a

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
wouldn't work well for a watchmaker or a

wouldn't work well for a watchmaker or a
vice<00:01:58.240> versa

vice versa

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.980 
vice versa
I<00:01:58.959> believe<00:01:59.679> tennis<00:02:00.009> players<00:02:00.249> must<00:02:00.729> have<00:02:01.299> both

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
I believe tennis players must have both

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.830 
I believe tennis players must have both
and<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:02.770> watch<00:02:02.979> on<00:02:03.189> TV<00:02:03.399> we're<00:02:04.270> seeing<00:02:04.569> players

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
and we watch on TV we're seeing players

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.649 
and we watch on TV we're seeing players
who<00:02:05.020> can<00:02:05.170> zoom<00:02:05.469> and<00:02:05.740> scan<00:02:06.219> simply<00:02:07.119> because<00:02:07.450> if

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
who can zoom and scan simply because if

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.480 
who can zoom and scan simply because if
they<00:02:07.840> couldn't<00:02:08.140> do<00:02:08.289> either<00:02:08.440> they'd<00:02:09.069> never<00:02:09.250> be

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
they couldn't do either they'd never be

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.850 
they couldn't do either they'd never be
good<00:02:09.640> enough<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.849> make<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.240> on<00:02:10.450> TV<00:02:10.990> but<00:02:11.680> when

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
good enough to make it on TV but when

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.830 
good enough to make it on TV but when
