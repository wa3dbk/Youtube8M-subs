00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:08.250
 Yes Hi commercial law Yes this time I want to do the technique of sonic reverse 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.450
 I think 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.810
 Well when I got to it is it's Sonic the reverse is 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.980
 Now I can do it while practicing Harmony Calsonic 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:24.289
 The Tteyuu harmonica Re Sonic 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.850
 It's such a skill , I should say that I get sonic reverse after doing sonic 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.120
 but 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.750
 Well but sonic reverse is not alone 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.280
 I can do it 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.880
 First of all, Hawaii Calsonic 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.360
 Though 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.130
 Doing prasonic 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:49.480
 I do line sonic reverse with that momentum 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:51.650
 Well, if I'm going to do this alone, I'll use that momentum a little 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.980
 Because it is easy to do 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.079
 Keep like this First 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.850
 Then I went to school from here 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.860
 And we'll put the momentum I doing flying 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.300
 It's cheap 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.860
 And 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.640
 Because it is moving opposite to sonic 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.850
 First of all 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.190
 this 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.580
 Tilt this with care have from here tilt the pen 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:24.470
 if you do 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.409
 Now when the pen hits this ring finger , it bends the middle finger like this 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.700
 Yes 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.909
 After that, let's comfort the hen to this side and release your index finger 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.070
 In the middle finger and ring finger 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.850
 Move 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.450
 Wearing something like this break and do it again 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:47.659
 If the pen hits the ring finger, turn away the middle finger 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.290
 It is moving to the side here. 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.470
 It is a weapon like this 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:58.600
 But with this alone, I still don't feel like I'm turning around 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.420
 I want to put out the feeling of the turn 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.230
 And what to do 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.810
 This 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.120
 Oh dear 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.619
 I wonder if I say 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:14.210
 Well I'd have tricks Tteyuu sound effects Sonic Reverse say this 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.480
 It seems to be a movement that feels a little closer to it 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.480
 9 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:25.239
 I already had this when I put on this pond 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.239
 It seems that it's a bit over the public flat rate 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.550
 High 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.860
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.860
 This while using the momentum 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.290
 I will rotate 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.290
 I don't think it 's going to rotate at the outset 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.620
 First of all, as a tip 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.620
 While using this pond 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.250
 The 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.510
 as soon as possible 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:05.230
 It is not early but not early 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:09.310
 When smooth first so that it is this movement 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.450
 I think it's good I like when I went to Sonic 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.590
 This 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.590
 It is such a movement of feeling 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.140
 Of not the same as almost Sonic Day 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.640
 I really get used to it 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.640
 At first this movement is too 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.290
 Please try a little practice much even in this movement only 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.290
 And When 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:39.110
 Line have in the way of the middle of the pen or later remove the gradually I force 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.980
 This movement and are doing much 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:46.930
 Say soon to be over between the accustomed way to have this around 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.560
 I think I will get hold 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:58.569
 So by all means this sonic reverse is a bit alone 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.569
 You will be able to easily perform Harmony Calsonic as well . 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:07.709
 It was commentary of such a feeling 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:10.769
 Well I think it is good to practice from Harmony Calsonic In that case Sonic 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:15.530
 Using a 9 system from doing 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:18.650
 Please go into the line sonic reverse Sonic reverse alone 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.250
 If you want to do it is the momentum here 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.040
 With this kind of feeling 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.990
 Please try it by all means 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.460
 Yes 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.460
 I Ja was a show N'
