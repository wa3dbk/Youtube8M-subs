00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.500
 hello how about in this design I'm going to 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.170
 jump what it is to make the almond 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.600
 I do not want to take so so 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.330
 we already have the almond by art 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.760
 of magic and I want to thank dennis 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.930
 jones 65 that he gave me 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.850
 its hard conversation mix or hearts 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.970
 talkative is that this beautiful right now 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.190
 I'm going to show them more but 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.580
 soon I explain that if as is a 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.400
 mixture that has decoration very well not 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.250
 very but the decoration is not big 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.980
 all that I mean with the very normal 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.629
 the little hearts so they look 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.270
 accommodate the then you will see 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.199
 here that I tried to sweep the glitter 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.170
 up is it is beautiful be it me 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.670
 he sent that in a mix but I did 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.610
 I had to separate the little hearts like that 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.060
 that is not a problem and quickie there 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.340
 they put on but that's the way it looks 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.870
 you have to accommodate the ones I'm 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.410
 impressed with the same 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.810
 and is that this woman has a 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.200
 creativity what a barbarian always 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.460
 I'm watching your channel and tell ago 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.920
 she has no better decision does not have 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.500
 idea for me how excited I 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.480
 I was when she sent me this mixture 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.280
 so I wanted to throw the last 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.890
 design because if I already choke with the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.530
 little hearts I wanted to throw the last 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.650
 design with this mixture of it 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.770
 and I hope you like the design to me already 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.640
 It made me really liked the precious 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.110
 final I tell you to work a 3d that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.509
 the best they are going to say and so that their 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.300
 smile if he came to put the bun on top 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:05.009
 but the truth is, girls and boys, I 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.420
 I have always told them the truth I do not know 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.970
 what I'm doing when I'm 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.360
 recording sometimes I do not like sometimes 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.220
 recorded 23 nails but more one I like and 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.160
 so this time I said something 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.019
 know the mixture and I started doing it and 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.160
 afterwards it came to my mind 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.890
 can i put 3d 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.760
 but in the end the bun of putting for the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.939
 smile of the nail 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.459
 there I am already doing and they moÃ±ito 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:35.090
 I talk about what I usually do 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.040
 mixture of 50 ketones 50 monomer and here 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.500
 it did not help me much because 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.780
 first I know that the 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.690
 metallic this organic like that 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.370
 remove the acetone or how it is 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.569
 which is very weird it's like I have 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.549
 no oil do not think you understand 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.129
 much to this metal but for something 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.959
 It shines like pure metal of 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:01.340
 have a different formula the case is 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.580
 that I had to do it like that without acetone and 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.650
 yes yes 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.200
 that you fight a little bit is that it takes 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.410
 more in drying 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.860
 when I form a bow tie three of the 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.870
 monitos the truth 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.519
 I think this is my third world 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.580
 one of my first videos that I went up and 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.210
 here at the business was a set that 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.080
 I made a sister of mine 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.790
 and I was wearing a little bun and I do not know now 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.920
 it seemed like also for the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.170
 hearts that are encapsulated I wanted 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.260
 do something different on the outside but so 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.920
 work I do not know if it's the most 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.050
 easy or the right way for me like this 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.860
 it's easier as they're seeing me 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.480
 I did I do what the platform says 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.799
 down 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.540
 and on top of that it dries the platform 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.969
 finished doing 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.209
 above if you look for 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:04:01.150
 example is how to make a petal of a 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.840
 flower but you do it like taquitos 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.329
 like up the sides but like what 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.269
 you let me know that by the time you come and 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.730
 you put the part of it above you no longer 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.099
 worry that the bottom part be 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.250
 I came or nothing then you start 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.160
 handle 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.700
 the fast top 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.870
 that does not sink to raise it 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:28.169
 so that this 3d effect is left 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.820
 we give texture and there are the 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.529
 slats the slats are fine 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.689
 facilites 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:35.759
 actually and for example I'm trying 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:37.589
 to stretch it but if you have to let 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:42.479
 dry a little bit that gets like 

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:44.759
 plasticine type plus and it is put in 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:48.689
 this consistency and then there I come and 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:52.190
 I pushed him and you let those loops and toxo 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:56.060
 you do it like one throws 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.120
 and already there finally I took an eyeliner 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.660
 golden and I wanted him to underline two 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.470
 little hearts I do not know why but there 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.740
 I just added that and ready with the gel 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.930
 ultraviolet stayed I loved that mixture 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.980
 I thank Denis very much for having 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.300
 taken the time and already when I have 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.420
 I commented in his video that it's good because 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.300
 I always tell him I love his 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:28.060
 mixes as I said and we went up and already 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.060
 he wanted to send me this gift he told me 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.950
 It is all well that you have a good night 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.950
 later I already come with something different than 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:41.290
 no longer be of hearts that spend very 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.290
 happy valentine's day until soon
