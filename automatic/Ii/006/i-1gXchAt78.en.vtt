that nice and handy overall the gun is a
little<00:03:06.660> large<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.500> do<00:03:07.829> like<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.610> simulated

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
little large I do like the simulated

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.970 
little large I do like the simulated
laser<00:03:09.450> sight<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.379> trigger<00:03:10.560> does<00:03:10.769> move

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
laser sight and the trigger does move

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.130 
laser sight and the trigger does move
the<00:03:11.970> trigger<00:03:12.239> does<00:03:12.420> not<00:03:12.599> hook<00:03:12.780> up<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.049> the

the trigger does not hook up to the

the trigger does not hook up to the
laser<00:03:13.319> sight<00:03:13.849> and<00:03:14.849> it<00:03:15.390> does<00:03:15.510> take<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.720> while<00:03:15.810> to

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
laser sight and it does take a while to

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.080 
laser sight and it does take a while to
transform<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.680> gun<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.160> took<00:03:17.579> me<00:03:17.730> way<00:03:18.030> too

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
transform this gun that took me way too

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.970 
transform this gun that took me way too
long<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.750> when<00:03:19.170> I<00:03:19.200> was<00:03:19.410> finished<00:03:19.590> there<00:03:19.890> were

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
long and when I was finished there were

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.190 
long and when I was finished there were
some<00:03:20.220> spaces<00:03:20.670> between<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:21.150> parts<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:21.959> it's

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
some spaces between the parts so it's

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.110 
some spaces between the parts so it's
not<00:03:22.349> flush<00:03:22.950> like<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.340> would<00:03:23.489> have<00:03:23.579> liked<00:03:23.790> then

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
not flush like I would have liked then

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.879 
not flush like I would have liked then
again<00:03:24.329> it<00:03:24.510> might<00:03:24.660> be<00:03:24.720> just<00:03:25.049> me<00:03:25.230> transforming

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
again it might be just me transforming

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.250 
again it might be just me transforming
it<00:03:26.010> overall<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.030> engineering<00:03:27.630> on<00:03:27.720> these<00:03:27.930> they
