and it supports a bit more Hertz and of
course<00:00:21.990> they're<00:00:22.109> all<00:00:22.260> 4k<00:00:22.800> because<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.250> have

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
course they're all 4k because we have

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.759 
course they're all 4k because we have
the<00:00:23.460> X<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.910> name<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.720> CX<00:00:25.170> always<00:00:25.560> stands

big round on the middle just in the
middle<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.489> would<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.790> not<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.780> handy<00:01:07.710> so

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
middle it would be not that and handy so

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.130 
middle it would be not that and handy so
let's<00:01:08.070> check<00:01:08.369> out<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> few<00:01:08.670> ports<00:01:09.180> or<00:01:09.360> them<00:01:09.900> how

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
let's check out a few ports or them how

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.630 
let's check out a few ports or them how
you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.439> use<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.799> be<00:01:10.920> human<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.400> can

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
you can use it to be human so you can

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.030 
you can use it to be human so you can
see<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:11.939> example<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.390> two<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.930> use<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> menu

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
see for example for two and use the menu

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.410 
see for example for two and use the menu
if<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.189> don't<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.880> can't<00:01:15.090> find<00:01:15.299> the

if you don't if you can't find the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.640 
if you don't if you can't find the
remote<00:01:15.509> which<00:01:15.990> would<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.350> course

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
remote which would be of course

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.399 
remote which would be of course
unhandy<00:01:17.460> whether<00:01:17.700> big<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.450> big<00:01:18.930> TV<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
unhandy whether big this big TV and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.920 
unhandy whether big this big TV and
check<00:01:19.590> out<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> other<00:01:20.159> side<00:01:20.689> you'll<00:01:21.689> see<00:01:21.720> that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
check out the other side you'll see that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.810 
check out the other side you'll see that
we<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.409> only<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.860> some<00:01:23.070> USB<00:01:23.430> ports<00:01:23.700> an<00:01:23.790> HDMI

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
we not only have some USB ports an HDMI

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.600 
we not only have some USB ports an HDMI
and<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.630> smart<00:01:25.200> capital<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:25.740> also<00:01:25.890> an<00:01:26.100> SD<00:01:26.369> card

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
slot which is a little bit new to me but

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.890 
slot which is a little bit new to me but
quite<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.880> could<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.180> quite<00:01:30.299> handy<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.810> then

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
here on the back of course of my force

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.870 
here on the back of course of my force
and<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.509> looks<00:01:33.689> everything<00:01:37.490> look<00:01:38.490> at<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.729> from
