00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.900 

don't<00:00:17.860> make<00:00:18.520> a<00:00:18.880> sound

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.010 

quiet<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.539> way<00:00:25.850> we<00:00:26.850> went<00:00:27.510> through<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> quite<00:00:27.990> a

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
quiet this way we went through a quite a

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.420 
quiet this way we went through a quite a
process<00:00:28.439> trying<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.650> fair<00:00:28.770> what<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.040> infected

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
process trying to fair what the infected

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.609 
process trying to fair what the infected
were<00:00:29.700> gonna<00:00:29.850> be<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.330> very<00:00:30.930> big<00:00:31.110> directive<00:00:31.500> from

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
were gonna be a very big directive from

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.440 
were gonna be a very big directive from
the<00:00:31.770> very<00:00:31.950> beginning<00:00:32.400> was<00:00:32.640> they're<00:00:33.090> not

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the very beginning was they're not

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.200 
the very beginning was they're not
zombies<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.980> early<00:00:35.309> inception<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.000> idli

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
zombies the early inception for idli

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.770 
zombies the early inception for idli
came<00:00:36.540> from<00:00:37.190> a<00:00:38.190> BBC<00:00:38.790> video<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.300> saw<00:00:39.480> called

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
came from a BBC video we saw called

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.689 
came from a BBC video we saw called
planet<00:00:40.080> Earth<00:00:40.309> where<00:00:41.309> they<00:00:41.400> were<00:00:41.489> talking

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
planet Earth where they were talking

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:44.630 
planet Earth where they were talking
about<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.449> quarter<00:00:43.170> cept<00:00:43.410> fungus<00:00:43.860> as<00:00:44.430> soon<00:00:44.550> as

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
about a quarter cept fungus as soon as

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.799 
about a quarter cept fungus as soon as
we<00:00:44.760> saw<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:44.970> we<00:00:45.090> were<00:00:45.180> intrigued<00:00:45.540> by<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.720> idea

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
we saw it we were intrigued by the idea

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.979 
we saw it we were intrigued by the idea
of<00:00:46.460> what<00:00:47.460> if<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.640> jumped<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.910> humans<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.750> what

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
of what if it jumped to humans and what

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.780 
of what if it jumped to humans and what
interesting<00:00:49.530> ways<00:00:49.710> would<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.250> take<00:00:50.460> over<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
interesting ways would it take over a

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.299 
interesting ways would it take over a
human<00:00:51.210> body<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.840> enforce<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.949> spread<00:00:53.190> that

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
human body and enforce it to spread that

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.130 
human body and enforce it to spread that
infection<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.239> figured<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> real

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
infection and we figured that the real

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.590 
infection and we figured that the real
evil<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.799> game<00:00:55.979> is<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.670> fungus<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.420> not

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
evil in the game is the fungus it's not

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.020 
evil in the game is the fungus it's not
the<00:00:57.720> people<00:00:58.019> we<00:00:58.379> want<00:00:58.589> to<00:00:58.680> see<00:00:58.860> what<00:00:59.729> kind<00:00:59.760> of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the people we want to see what kind of

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.729 
the people we want to see what kind of
choices<00:01:00.269> a<00:01:00.479> human<00:01:00.839> makes<00:01:01.049> under<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.470> kind<00:01:01.650> of

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
choices a human makes under that kind of

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.230 
choices a human makes under that kind of
pressure

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.570 

so<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:06.690> we're<00:01:06.870> trying<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.200> develop<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:08.340> look

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
so as we're trying to develop the look

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.719 
so as we're trying to develop the look
of<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> infected<00:01:09.650> we<00:01:10.650> went<00:01:10.890> through<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.520> many

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
of the infected we went through so many

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.280 
of the infected we went through so many
different<00:01:12.060> iterations<00:01:12.240> some<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.049> looked

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
different iterations some that looked

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.330 
different iterations some that looked
really<00:01:14.100> alien<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.940> subhuman<00:01:15.890> some<00:01:16.890> dead<00:01:17.100> look

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
really alien and subhuman some dead look

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.539 
really alien and subhuman some dead look
just<00:01:17.940> essentially<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.750> zombies<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:20.310> we

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
just essentially like zombies and we

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.820 
just essentially like zombies and we
couldn't<00:01:20.880> find<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.600> an<00:01:21.840> original<00:01:22.110> place<00:01:22.590> for

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
couldn't find like an original place for

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.219 
couldn't find like an original place for
them<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.580> one<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.760> our<00:01:24.000> concept<00:01:24.570> artists<00:01:25.049> took

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
them but one of our concept artists took

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.710 
them but one of our concept artists took
a<00:01:25.290> bunch<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.710> images<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.760> diseases<00:01:27.090> or<00:01:27.390> images

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
a bunch of images of diseases or images

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.930 
a bunch of images of diseases or images
of<00:01:27.840> fungal<00:01:28.320> overgrowth<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.730> kind<00:01:29.880> of

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
of fungal overgrowth and you kind of

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.760 
of fungal overgrowth and you kind of
mash<00:01:30.120> it<00:01:30.300> all<00:01:30.360> together<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.050> you<00:01:31.140> threw<00:01:31.410> it<00:01:31.470> on

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
mash it all together and you threw it on

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.010 
mash it all together and you threw it on
this<00:01:31.980> person<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:33.420> was<00:01:33.540> definitely<00:01:33.930> very

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
this person it was definitely very

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.790 
this person it was definitely very
challenging<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.660> try<00:01:36.660> to<00:01:36.720> convert<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.320> 2d

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
challenging to try to convert that 2d

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.820 
challenging to try to convert that 2d
concept<00:01:38.280> into<00:01:38.730> 3d<00:01:39.090> getting<00:01:40.020> kind<00:01:40.230> of<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
concept into 3d getting kind of the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.140 
concept into 3d getting kind of the
feeling<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.280> from<00:01:41.490> all<00:01:41.670> different<00:01:41.880> angles

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
feeling right from all different angles

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.270 
feeling right from all different angles
this<00:01:42.810> isn't<00:01:43.170> some<00:01:43.320> decaying<00:01:43.710> corpse<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
this isn't some decaying corpse on the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.800 
this isn't some decaying corpse on the
ground<00:01:44.550> this<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> living<00:01:45.150> thing<00:01:45.240> that's

going to be coming after you in the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.700 
going to be coming after you in the
world<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:48.210> seems<00:01:48.480> so<00:01:48.720> creepy<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.380> so

out<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.730> this<00:01:57.030> look

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.040 

they<00:02:00.830> use<00:02:01.070> a<00:02:01.100> form<00:02:01.460> of<00:02:01.580> echolocation<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:02.540> track

down<00:02:03.260> their<00:02:03.590> enemies<00:02:03.980> just<00:02:04.820> like<00:02:04.970> bats<00:02:05.270> or

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
down their enemies just like bats or

down their enemies just like bats or
even<00:02:06.290> some<00:02:06.530> blind<00:02:06.860> people<00:02:07.220> can<00:02:07.400> see<00:02:07.640> by<00:02:07.820> making

even some blind people can see by making
a<00:02:08.240> clicking<00:02:08.630> sound<00:02:08.679> like<00:02:09.679> Oh<00:02:09.830> what<00:02:10.070> if<00:02:10.160> they

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
a clicking sound like Oh what if they

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.030 
a clicking sound like Oh what if they
make<00:02:10.550> this<00:02:10.759> sound<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:12.410> now<00:02:12.530> they<00:02:12.680> can<00:02:12.800> sing

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
make this sound and now they can sing

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.590 
make this sound and now they can sing
the<00:02:13.160> dark<00:02:15.370> sound<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.670> on<00:02:16.820> its<00:02:17.000> own<00:02:17.209> wouldn't
