00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 we will have seen it all 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.130
 and the tone are long I hope that 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.480
 you did say that we will really 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.030
 I think today for a new 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.799
 video with today at the program the 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.030
 42nd episode of the campaign the one 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.789
 other tasks flank with an episode 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.960
 who will be called super villain we will not 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.640
 to do the old cooking we go 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.369
 do well in order a little to get 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.640
 household and turn archers level 6 that 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.140
 is she is leveling 6 and I 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.630
 look forward to seeing ben I got the job will be 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.670
 I think it was implemented 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.850
 so that's where we go where the particle 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.850
 Swiss 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.540
 so we will close to date who will we 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.950
 who can bring them because it's 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.950
 not on what does it earn 150 miles where that 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.390
 begins to be a little more complex 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.940
 here he does not like third party attackers 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.110
 is a type and recel what my distance to 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.000
 what is good is that here we are 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.000
 no he is really safe from the years 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.310
 this is good that we will fuck 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.650
 roofs made with rage and I t 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.280
 love is barbaric beast is 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.060
 enough damage 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.800
 so here and now so now 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:26.380
 how we will do it we're going to knock 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.380
 m no but what has I got 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.159
 this is good he broke well so 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.900
 there we go to all our giants we go 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.240
 put some broken brick we're going to get 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.229
 in fact the law in all our units 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.200
 but I think I'll have to go to 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.759
 air attacks because otherwise I 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.039
 think it's going to be it's going to be a bit hard 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.780
 now to make it to win I 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.890
 no air attacks in the east 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.200
 I hope to win 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.399
 I'm really not sure to tell you 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.020
 I am not sure of winning 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.799
 because it really begins to be 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:02.030
 harder and harder but hey if it will have to 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:05.240
 do for the short yes it'll do it 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.800
 that to do it but you must really I 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.929
 start thinking about another 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.920
 tactical of attaching so surely to 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.830
 next episode 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:18.650
 yes does it arm or if it's done 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.190
 good all the stuff so here we win 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.200
 still 1500 elections and 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.430
 offside just look at the head of the 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.190
 next budget not troops 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.739
 yeah I think we will really need me 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.590
 that I think of another technique 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.850
 of attac so maybe airy so 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.230
 so here's between that I do that this 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.579
 video will have pleased you was not you 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.810
 subscribe to put a jean marc share 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.810

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.110
