00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.550
 These are dreams sent this camera here qnx 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.190
 thousand and it was announced at the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.230
 year during a press conference 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.080
 the great advantage of it is that it is a password 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.000
 Professional Interchangeable Lenses and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.980
 although not available in Brazil 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.390
 the other 10 lenses that can be 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.189
 docked this camera 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.710
 We ask pressure on them. 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.230
 said that they are still going to bring 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.969
 cool this camera is that it has functions 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.280
 matthew efe 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.550
 in this case both things are well 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.649
 different than the smart function function 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.980
 smart of this camera a self regulate 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.210
 So for example if you look here 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.789
 lens 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.449
 as I change the position of the lens 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.090
 she decides to decide what is the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.890
 best focus any better scene at 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.960
 best lucius opening will use flash 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.780
 or it is not because that coupled states 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.060
 but come with flash is you connect here 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.030
 it really brings the practicality to a post 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.040
 a kick for a 100 professional and for 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.960
 them and without professional she still has 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.909
 every part you can fit here 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.820
 in the manual 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.860
 then for example if you want to adjust 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.220
 shutter speed the aperture of the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.530
 lens to pose smooth color spacing 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.820
 image assistance sure you can 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.070
 I do not use it that much 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.920
 uncomfortable in my hand is if this 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.840
 button depending on it too so that it 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.159
 it serves when you tighten if the child 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.840
 you can set a scene mode 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.619
 through this ring here 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.020
 this is the focus ring of the lens he 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.990
 if you put up to 50 and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.159
 to calculate a little the optimal use of 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.829
 up to 3x 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.500
 but this is my place here for you 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.530
 in certain functions 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.200
 I find it more practical to select with 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.909
 This is it here. 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.100
 but you can have people you like 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.409
 comfortable equipment leave here in 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.939
 hand is not so practical at last she has 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.940
 other functions composition of this framework 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.459
 magical you can put a few 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.709
 effects then recorded 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:21.560
 old or full movie session waves 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.959
 and vignettes that know here the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.220
 edges of the fisheye screen that 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:34.610
 distort the image can not get here 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:37.370
 It may be normal here in the camera is 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.200
 all distorted the outline that was where 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.970
 it was like a lapse effect 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.739
 completely obscure something and 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.900
 camera recording recording in full hd 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.660
 but the tests that we did 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.829
 we find that it does not record in 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.010
 full hd 1920 x 1080p rock only she 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:04.970
 records 30p 30 frames per second at 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:09.019
 1081 1080p feature 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.510
 if you access here the menu output hdmi 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.590
 You see she can only get out 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.980
 1080 there 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.319
 still, but it's very good and one 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.180
 microphone can also capture 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.980
 It's all very well because I 'm here in the 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.389
 test room nor your warrant of 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.380
 will be able to catch all 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.060
 street sounds 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.160
 if someone talked to the sheet he also 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.680
 will get the same quality line from a 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.630
 camcorder a semi-professional camera 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.609
 but this one was just an entry in the 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.260
 I'm going to talk about the next game 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.260
 wifi that has seven functions
