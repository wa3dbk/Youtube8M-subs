00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:34.839 
times that you get wallet cases you get

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:37.200 
times that you get wallet cases you get
the<00:00:34.930> ones<00:00:35.110> that<00:00:35.409> cover<00:00:35.710> up<00:00:36.070> and<00:00:36.550> go<00:00:36.820> in<00:00:36.970> and<00:00:37.150> out

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.180 
the ones that cover up and go in and out
thing<00:00:37.629> is<00:00:37.780> is<00:00:37.960> that<00:00:38.110> messes<00:00:38.470> with<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:38.710> camera

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
thing is is that messes with the camera

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.310 
thing is is that messes with the camera
this<00:00:39.729> one<00:00:39.970> is<00:00:40.150> just<00:00:40.180> simply<00:00:40.720> on<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.049> back

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
this one is just simply on the back

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.979 
this one is just simply on the back
which<00:00:41.559> is<00:00:41.769> why<00:00:41.920> I<00:00:41.949> like<00:00:42.309> it<00:00:42.489> a<00:00:42.549> lot<00:00:42.760> more<00:00:43.150> the

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
which is why I like it a lot more the

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.399 
which is why I like it a lot more the
other<00:00:44.229> interesting<00:00:44.650> thing<00:00:44.949> is<00:00:45.400> that<00:00:45.460> this

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409 
other interesting thing is that this

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.200 
other interesting thing is that this
takes<00:00:47.409> the<00:00:47.739> speaker<00:00:48.280> that's<00:00:48.460> in<00:00:48.549> the<00:00:48.640> back<00:00:48.850> and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
takes the speaker that's in the back and

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.439 
takes the speaker that's in the back and
moves<00:00:50.019> it<00:00:50.229> to<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.559> front<00:00:50.890> moving<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:52.150> sound

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
moves it to the front moving the sound

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.899 
moves it to the front moving the sound
to<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.110> front<00:00:53.409> so<00:00:54.070> we're<00:00:54.309> going<00:00:54.430> to<00:00:54.489> see<00:00:54.729> how

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
to the front so we're going to see how

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.840 
to the front so we're going to see how
that<00:00:55.180> works<00:00:55.390> as<00:00:55.659> well<00:00:56.339> other<00:00:57.339> than<00:00:57.430> that<00:00:57.519> it's

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
that works as well other than that it's

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.579 
that works as well other than that it's
supposed<00:00:57.970> to<00:00:58.119> be<00:00:58.210> durable<00:00:58.690> as<00:00:58.900> well<00:00:59.080> and<00:00:59.379> it<00:00:59.440> is

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
supposed to be durable as well and it is

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.729 
supposed to be durable as well and it is
pretty<00:01:00.010> slim<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:00.820> let's<00:01:01.150> check<00:01:01.360> it<00:01:01.510> out<00:01:01.629> as<00:01:01.930> you

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
pretty slim so let's check it out as you

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.490 
pretty slim so let's check it out as you
can<00:01:02.830> see<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:04.239> gives<00:01:04.420> you<00:01:04.510> access<00:01:04.659> to<00:01:04.839> cards<00:01:05.409> you

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
can see it gives you access to cards you

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.069 
can see it gives you access to cards you
can<00:01:05.590> put<00:01:05.770> up<00:01:05.799> to<00:01:05.950> three<00:01:06.189> cards<00:01:06.549> in<00:01:06.700> there<00:01:07.079> the

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
can put up to three cards in there the

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:12.539 
can put up to three cards in there the
buttons<00:01:08.590> feel<00:01:09.520> very<00:01:10.390> easy<00:01:10.719> to<00:01:11.020> push<00:01:11.229> and<00:01:11.590> as

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
buttons feel very easy to push and as

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.160 
buttons feel very easy to push and as
well<00:01:12.759> as<00:01:12.789> like<00:01:13.210> I<00:01:13.299> said<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:14.259> sound<00:01:14.590> on<00:01:14.979> here

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
well as like I said the sound on here

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.410 
well as like I said the sound on here
travels<00:01:17.170> from<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.500> back<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.490> front<00:01:19.000> in

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
travels from the back to the front in

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.510 
travels from the back to the front in
order<00:01:20.289> to<00:01:20.469> play<00:01:20.679> so<00:01:20.740> we'll<00:01:21.039> see<00:01:21.340> how<00:01:21.369> that

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
order to play so we'll see how that

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.450 
order to play so we'll see how that
actually<00:01:22.000> works<00:01:22.710> alright<00:01:23.710> so<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:24.130> can<00:01:24.250> carry

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
actually works alright so you can carry

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.630 
actually works alright so you can carry
three<00:01:24.789> cards<00:01:25.270> not<00:01:25.509> so<00:01:25.719> bulky<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.500> again<00:01:27.399> it's

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
three cards not so bulky and again it's

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.190 
three cards not so bulky and again it's
just<00:01:27.789> a<00:01:27.969> slate<00:01:28.299> style<00:01:28.719> rather<00:01:29.320> than<00:01:29.950> a<00:01:30.899> regular

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.950 

wallet<00:01:35.200> case<00:01:35.740> which<00:01:36.189> we<00:01:36.340> typically<00:01:36.729> see<00:01:36.960> as

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
wallet case which we typically see as

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.539 
wallet case which we typically see as
you<00:01:38.140> can<00:01:38.200> see<00:01:38.439> you<00:01:38.499> can<00:01:38.799> fit<00:01:38.979> cards<00:01:39.340> in<00:01:39.460> the

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
you can see you can fit cards in the

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.630 
you can see you can fit cards in the
back<00:01:39.729> right<00:01:39.939> here<00:01:40.380> which<00:01:41.380> is<00:01:41.560> very<00:01:42.070> nice<00:01:42.310> and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
back right here which is very nice and

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.300 
back right here which is very nice and
simple<00:01:42.880> you<00:01:43.659> do<00:01:43.810> up<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:43.929> three<00:01:44.020> it's<00:01:44.950> to

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
simple you do up to three it's to

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.739 
simple you do up to three it's to
comfortably<00:01:45.909> and<00:01:46.060> then<00:01:46.179> three<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.509> kind<00:01:46.689> of

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:46.749 
comfortably and then three is kind of

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:48.029 
comfortably and then three is kind of
like<00:01:46.810> tight<00:01:47.109> I<00:01:47.319> guess<00:01:47.530> it's<00:01:47.740> kind<00:01:47.920> of<00:01:47.950> like

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
like tight I guess it's kind of like

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.340 
like tight I guess it's kind of like
stretching<00:01:48.310> it<00:01:48.579> what<00:01:49.149> you<00:01:49.270> know<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.630> fine<00:01:49.929> I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
stretching it what you know is fine I

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.690 
stretching it what you know is fine I
mean<00:01:50.530> if<00:01:50.710> you're<00:01:50.859> just<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:51.159> would<00:01:51.340> probably<00:01:51.670> use

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
mean if you're just I would probably use

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.309 
mean if you're just I would probably use
like<00:01:51.999> business<00:01:52.450> cards<00:01:52.810> or<00:01:52.929> something<00:01:53.049> like

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
like business cards or something like

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.849 
like business cards or something like
that<00:01:53.380> in<00:01:53.649> there<00:01:54.749> and<00:01:55.749> there<00:01:56.229> we<00:01:56.380> have<00:01:56.409> it<00:01:56.590> so

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
that in there and there we have it so

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.160 
that in there and there we have it so
you<00:01:56.950> can<00:01:57.069> see<00:01:57.219> this<00:01:57.369> is<00:01:57.609> the<00:01:57.810> mechanism<00:01:58.810> which

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
you can see this is the mechanism which

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.870 
you can see this is the mechanism which
is<00:01:59.319> just<00:01:59.499> basically<00:01:59.649> it<00:01:59.979> leaves<00:02:00.219> space<00:02:00.819> for

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
is just basically it leaves space for

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.330 
is just basically it leaves space for
the<00:02:01.240> sound<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.600> travel<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.229> then<00:02:02.979> brings<00:02:03.219> it

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
the sound to travel and then brings it

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.099 
the sound to travel and then brings it
to<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.549> front<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:04.119> now<00:02:04.780> we're<00:02:04.869> going<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:05.020> put

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
to the front and now we're going to put

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.650 
to the front and now we're going to put
this<00:02:05.259> case<00:02:05.469> on<00:02:07.200> so

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
this case on so

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.270 
this case on so
you<00:02:09.650> can<00:02:09.800> see<00:02:10.040> it<00:02:10.870> and<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.740> can<00:02:12.860> see<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.100> has<00:02:13.160> a

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
you can see it and you can see it has a

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.100 
you can see it and you can see it has a
little<00:02:13.550> hump<00:02:13.880> there<00:02:14.030> on<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.240> bottom<00:02:14.450> for<00:02:15.080> the

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
little hump there on the bottom for the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.520 
little hump there on the bottom for the
sound<00:02:15.650> come<00:02:15.920> out<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.460> this<00:02:17.390> is<00:02:17.570> how<00:02:17.810> the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
sound come out of and this is how the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.710 
sound come out of and this is how the
case<00:02:19.340> looks<00:02:19.820> like<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:21.200> it's<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.560> really<00:02:21.710> nice

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
case looks like so it's a really nice

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.380 
case looks like so it's a really nice
simplistic<00:02:23.720> design<00:02:24.260> as<00:02:24.850> you<00:02:25.850> can<00:02:25.970> see<00:02:26.150> here

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
simplistic design as you can see here

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.640 
simplistic design as you can see here
for<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:27.220> cue<00:02:28.220> card<00:02:28.550> case<00:02:28.910> really<00:02:29.810> nice<00:02:30.110> i<00:02:30.500> like

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
for the cue card case really nice i like

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.110 
for the cue card case really nice i like
the<00:02:30.830> leather<00:02:31.010> texture<00:02:31.400> on<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.580> back<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:32.000> makes

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
the leather texture on the back it makes

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.330 
the leather texture on the back it makes
feel<00:02:32.330> really<00:02:32.510> good<00:02:32.690> really<00:02:33.620> good<00:02:33.740> grip<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.310> it

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
feel really good really good grip to it

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.760 
feel really good really good grip to it
the<00:02:34.820> volume<00:02:35.030> rocker<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.600> power<00:02:36.080> key<00:02:36.410> feel

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
the volume rocker and power key feel

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.060 
the volume rocker and power key feel
fine<00:02:37.130> easy<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.760> press<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.740> now<00:02:39.740> we're<00:02:39.950> going

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
fine easy to press and now we're going

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.260 
fine easy to press and now we're going
to<00:02:40.160> test<00:02:40.490> how<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.720> displays<00:02:42.020> sound<00:02:42.950> quality<00:02:43.550> so

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
to test how it displays sound quality so

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.200 
to test how it displays sound quality so
let's<00:02:44.870> see<00:02:45.110> how<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.410> does<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:46.400> first

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
let's see how it does that and first

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.970 
let's see how it does that and first
thing<00:02:47.330> we're<00:02:47.450> going<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.600> do<00:02:47.750> is<00:02:47.930> we're<00:02:48.890> going

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
thing we're going to do is we're going

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.490 
thing we're going to do is we're going
to<00:02:49.040> take<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.760> case<00:02:49.970> off<00:02:50.210> so<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:50.990> can<00:02:51.080> see<00:02:51.290> how

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
to take the case off so you can see how

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.140 
to take the case off so you can see how
the<00:02:51.560> sound<00:02:52.100> would<00:02:52.280> normally<00:02:52.700> play<00:02:52.850> on<00:02:53.030> the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
the sound would normally play on the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.300 
the sound would normally play on the
phone<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.660> then<00:02:54.410> we're<00:02:54.590> going<00:02:54.770> to<00:02:54.890> take<00:02:55.100> it

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
phone and then we're going to take it

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.610 
phone and then we're going to take it
put<00:02:55.670> it<00:02:55.730> back<00:02:55.940> on<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.510> see<00:02:57.140> what<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.470> guys

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
put it back on and see what you guys

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.760 
put it back on and see what you guys
think<00:02:58.690> alright<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:00.110> let's<00:03:00.380> start<00:03:00.590> from<00:03:00.710> the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
think alright so let's start from the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:16.840 
think alright so let's start from the
beginning<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:02.660> play<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.930> song

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:40.690 

no<00:03:21.820> okay<00:03:23.920> no<00:03:24.920> okay<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:38.420> now<00:03:38.720> we<00:03:39.260> shall<00:03:39.560> see<00:03:40.040> how

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
no okay no okay so now we shall see how

00:03:40.700 --> 00:04:37.000 
no okay no okay so now we shall see how
it<00:03:40.930> sounds<00:04:32.920> so<00:04:33.920> all<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:35.060> case<00:04:35.650> does<00:04:36.650> move

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
it sounds so all the case does move

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.800 
it sounds so all the case does move
forward<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.520> feel<00:04:37.760> it<00:04:37.910> it's<00:04:38.240> a<00:04:38.360> little<00:04:38.540> bit

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
forward I feel it it's a little bit

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.890 
forward I feel it it's a little bit
lower<00:04:39.080> when<00:04:39.410> the<00:04:39.500> case<00:04:39.710> is<00:04:39.920> on<00:04:40.420> however<00:04:41.420> it<00:04:41.750> is

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
lower when the case is on however it is

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.990 
lower when the case is on however it is
nice<00:04:42.170> that<00:04:42.200> I<00:04:42.560> can<00:04:42.710> tell<00:04:42.950> that<00:04:43.130> it's<00:04:43.160> facing<00:04:43.490> me

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
nice that I can tell that it's facing me

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.050 
nice that I can tell that it's facing me
instead<00:04:44.900> of<00:04:45.020> facing<00:04:45.230> the<00:04:45.440> background<00:04:45.920> so<00:04:46.760> that

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
instead of facing the background so that

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.560 
instead of facing the background so that
was<00:04:47.750> again<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.950> cue<00:04:49.310> card<00:04:49.670> case<00:04:50.000> let<00:04:50.360> me<00:04:50.450> know
