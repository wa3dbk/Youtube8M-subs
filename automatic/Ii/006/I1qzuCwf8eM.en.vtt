00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
was slow cooked cr2 being one of them so

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.780 
was slow cooked cr2 being one of them so
he<00:01:40.150> was<00:01:40.300> the<00:01:40.330> one<00:01:40.540> who<00:01:40.570> impressed<00:01:40.960> me<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.320> most

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
he was the one who impressed me the most

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.090
