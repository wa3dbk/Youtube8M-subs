called the RV 01 this guy is one of our
newer<00:00:26.849> cases<00:00:27.330> if<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.199> actually<00:00:28.289> take<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> look

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
newer cases if you actually take a look

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.009 
newer cases if you actually take a look
at<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.820> very<00:00:30.000> small<00:00:30.119> form-factor<00:00:30.539> case

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
at it it's a very small form-factor case

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.170 
at it it's a very small form-factor case
and<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:32.219> also<00:00:32.369> actually<00:00:32.610> capable<00:00:32.940> of

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
and it's also actually capable of

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.700 
and it's also actually capable of
holding<00:00:33.329> quite<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> fit<00:00:33.840> quite<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.320> bit<00:00:34.500> inside

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
holding quite a fit quite a bit inside

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.410 
holding quite a fit quite a bit inside
of<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.579> for<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.030> first<00:00:36.149> thing<00:00:36.300> you'll

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
of it so for the first thing you'll

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.549 
of it so for the first thing you'll
notice<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.020> actually<00:00:37.140> don't<00:00:37.350> see<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
notice is that you actually don't see a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.410 
notice is that you actually don't see a
GPU<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.430> reason<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.850> don't<00:00:39.000> see<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.329> is

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
GPU the reason that you don't see one is

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.310 
GPU the reason that you don't see one is
that<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.660> actually<00:00:39.780> hidden<00:00:40.050> underneath

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
that it's actually hidden underneath

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.170 
that it's actually hidden underneath

thing<00:02:10.080> they're<00:02:10.200> going<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.410> see<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.770> mlo<00:02:11.069> 7

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
thing they're going to see is the mlo 7

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.220 
thing they're going to see is the mlo 7
this<00:02:11.940> guy<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.180> based<00:02:12.569> off<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> same<00:02:13.050> body

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
this guy is based off of the same body

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.910 
this guy is based off of the same body
that<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.470> went<00:02:13.680> ahead

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
that I went ahead

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.650 
that I went ahead
just<00:02:14.160> showed<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.520> but<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.090> key<00:02:15.270> differences

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
just showed you but the key differences

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.360 
just showed you but the key differences
are<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.930> actual<00:02:16.230> faceplate<00:02:16.770> if<00:02:17.220> you're

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
are the actual faceplate if you're

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.160 
are the actual faceplate if you're
looking<00:02:17.610> at<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> RV<00:02:17.940> 01<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:18.690> got<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> bit<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.110> a

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
looking at the RV 01 it's got a bit of a

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.100 
looking at the RV 01 it's got a bit of a
more<00:02:19.349> aggressive<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:20.120> front<00:02:21.120> looking<00:02:21.330> more

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
more aggressive and front looking more

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.839 
more aggressive and front looking more
aggressive<00:02:22.440> look<00:02:22.590> towards<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:22.980> with<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.550> mlo

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
aggressive look towards it with the mlo

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.220 
aggressive look towards it with the mlo
7<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:24.300> decided<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.720> go<00:02:24.810> with<00:02:24.900> something<00:02:24.989> that

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
7 we decided to go with something that

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.390 
7 we decided to go with something that
was<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.349> little<00:02:25.470> bit<00:02:25.680> calmer<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.190> little<00:02:26.340> bit

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
was a little bit calmer and a little bit

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.979 
was a little bit calmer and a little bit
more<00:02:26.550> tame<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:27.120> with<00:02:27.239> something<00:02:27.480> like<00:02:27.599> this<00:02:27.750> it

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
more tame so with something like this it

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:28.850 
more tame so with something like this it
would<00:02:28.080> be<00:02:28.170> something<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.470> you'd<00:02:28.620> be<00:02:28.709> proud

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
would be something that you'd be proud

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.350 
would be something that you'd be proud
to<00:02:29.010> show<00:02:29.069> in<00:02:29.220> your<00:02:29.280> living<00:02:29.489> room<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.270> would

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
to show in your living room and it would

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.400 
to show in your living room and it would
kind<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.569> blend<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:30.900> with<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.290> other

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
kind of blend in with the other

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.800 
kind of blend in with the other
components<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.459> have<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.510> both<00:02:33.780> of

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
ITX build matx build because if you

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.770 
ITX build matx build because if you
notice<00:03:31.950> there<00:03:32.130> are<00:03:32.220> actually<00:03:32.609> no<00:03:32.820> five<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:33.750> a

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
notice there are actually no five and a

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.030 
notice there are actually no five and a
quarter<00:03:33.930> inch<00:03:34.170> bays<00:03:34.380> in<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.590> very<00:03:34.769> front<00:03:34.890> of

quarter inch bays in the very front of
this<00:03:35.190> guy<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:35.970> because<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.630> doesn't<00:03:36.810> have

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
this guy so because it doesn't have

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.720 
this guy so because it doesn't have
those<00:03:37.049> Bay's<00:03:37.260> we<00:03:37.440> realize<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:38.130> lot<00:03:38.519> of

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
those Bay's we realize that a lot of

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.190 
those Bay's we realize that a lot of
people<00:03:38.790> don't<00:03:39.120> use<00:03:39.299> those<00:03:39.510> anymore<00:03:39.540> unless<00:03:40.019> if

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
people don't use those anymore unless if

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.680 
people don't use those anymore unless if
you're<00:03:40.320> using<00:03:40.440> an<00:03:40.590> OD<00:03:40.829> d<00:03:40.980> as<00:03:41.160> an<00:03:41.280> example<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.660> a

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
you're using an OD d as an example so a

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.789 
you're using an OD d as an example so a
lot<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:42.900> people<00:03:42.989> don't<00:03:43.290> use<00:03:43.440> those<00:03:43.590> Bay's

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
lot of people don't use those Bay's

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.020 
lot of people don't use those Bay's
anymore<00:03:44.160> so<00:03:44.280> we're<00:03:44.400> able<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.640> go<00:03:44.730> ahead<00:03:44.850> and

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
anymore so we're able to go ahead and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.849 
anymore so we're able to go ahead and
eliminate<00:03:45.209> those<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:45.870> build<00:03:46.380> into<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> very

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
eliminate those and build into a very

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.130 
eliminate those and build into a very
small<00:03:46.920> tight<00:03:47.400> form<00:03:47.880> if<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.180> would<00:03:48.329> in

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
small tight form if you would in

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.710 
small tight form if you would in
addition<00:03:49.820> if<00:03:50.820> you<00:03:51.000> actually<00:03:51.150> still<00:03:51.450> do<00:03:51.570> need

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
addition if you actually still do need

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.750 
addition if you actually still do need
to<00:03:51.780> know<00:03:51.870> DD<00:03:52.200> this<00:03:52.769> case<00:03:53.010> does<00:03:53.250> recognize<00:03:53.609> that

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
to know DD this case does recognize that

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.550 
to know DD this case does recognize that

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
itself it also has a two-and-a-half-inch

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.580 
itself it also has a two-and-a-half-inch
two<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:12.090> those<00:04:12.209> as<00:04:12.389> well<00:04:12.510> so<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:12.870> can<00:04:12.959> put<00:04:13.170> SSDs

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
two of those as well so you can put SSDs

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.930 
two of those as well so you can put SSDs
behind<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:13.950> motherboard<00:04:14.340> tray<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.730> be<00:04:14.850> able

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
behind the motherboard tray and be able

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.729 
behind the motherboard tray and be able
to<00:04:15.060> have<00:04:15.359> all<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.930> storage<00:04:16.139> capability<00:04:16.650> that

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
to have all the storage capability that

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.819 
to have all the storage capability that
you<00:04:16.859> need<00:04:17.690> very<00:04:18.690> similarly<00:04:19.049> we<00:04:19.260> also<00:04:19.410> have<00:04:19.680> the

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
you need very similarly we also have the

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.130 
you need very similarly we also have the
RV<00:04:20.190> 05<00:04:20.579> in<00:04:20.880> terms<00:04:21.419> of<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.600> internal<00:04:21.959> build

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
RV 05 in terms of the internal build

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.690 
RV 05 in terms of the internal build
with<00:04:22.289> it<00:04:22.409> it's<00:04:22.530> very<00:04:22.830> similar<00:04:23.070> on<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.460> part

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
with it it's very similar on that part

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.860 
with it it's very similar on that part
so<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:23.940> have<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.240> same<00:04:24.419> 90<00:04:24.690> degree

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
so you have that same 90 degree

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.899 
so you have that same 90 degree
