is six point eight square miles putting
that<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.260> together<00:01:13.409> that's<00:01:13.799> forty<00:01:14.220> eight

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that all together that's forty eight

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.300 
that all together that's forty eight
point<00:01:14.580> four<00:01:14.990> square<00:01:15.990> miles<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.860> GTA<00:01:17.220> 5

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.510 
point four square miles and the GTA 5
map<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.970> 49<00:01:18.840> square<00:01:19.170> miles<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.979> much

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
map is 49 square miles so it is much

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.100 
map is 49 square miles so it is much
bigger<00:01:20.759> than<00:01:20.909> any<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.509> them<00:01:21.630> maps<00:01:21.869> put

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
bigger than any of them maps put

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.609 
bigger than any of them maps put
together<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:23.040> fact<00:01:23.310> Manhattan<00:01:24.000> Island<00:01:24.150> is

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
together and in fact Manhattan Island is

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.679 
together and in fact Manhattan Island is
23<00:01:25.619> square<00:01:25.799> miles<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.369> yes<00:01:26.610> GTA<00:01:27.060> 5<00:01:27.330> will<00:01:27.600> be

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
23 square miles so yes GTA 5 will be

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.710 
23 square miles so yes GTA 5 will be
twice<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> size<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.500> IRL<00:01:29.009> Manhattan<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.570> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
twice the size of IRL Manhattan so it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.390 
twice the size of IRL Manhattan so it
really<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.229> big<00:01:31.530> map<00:01:31.740> an<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.009> screen<00:01:32.159> now

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
really is a big map an on screen now

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.039 
really is a big map an on screen now
I've<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.670> put<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> Liberty<00:01:33.299> City<00:01:33.450> islands

I've just put the Liberty City islands

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.810 
I've just put the Liberty City islands
compared<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> Grand<00:01:34.860> Theft<00:01:35.009> Auto<00:01:35.189> farm<00:01:35.610> up

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
compared to the Grand Theft Auto farm up

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.520 
compared to the Grand Theft Auto farm up
and<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.180> see<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.900> put<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.229> those

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
and you can see if you put all of those

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.649 
and you can see if you put all of those
islands<00:01:38.070> from<00:01:38.159> liberty<00:01:38.579> city<00:01:38.610> together<00:01:39.030> that
