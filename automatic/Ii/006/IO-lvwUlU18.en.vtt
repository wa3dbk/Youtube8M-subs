plate bulbs as well they're gonna round
off<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.840> exterior<00:05:04.169> now<00:05:04.530> before<00:05:05.310> we<00:05:05.430> wrap<00:05:05.580> it

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
off the exterior now before we wrap it

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.060 
off the exterior now before we wrap it
up<00:05:05.849> a<00:05:05.970> couple<00:05:06.240> of<00:05:06.300> safety<00:05:06.780> features<00:05:07.110> include

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
up a couple of safety features include

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.460 
up a couple of safety features include
continuously<00:05:08.759> welded<00:05:09.060> seams<00:05:09.570> so<00:05:10.349> you'll

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
continuously welded seams so you'll

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.899 
continuously welded seams so you'll
notice<00:05:10.740> there's<00:05:10.919> no<00:05:11.039> weather<00:05:11.280> stripping<00:05:11.699> here

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
notice there's no weather stripping here

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.270 
notice there's no weather stripping here
I<00:05:12.090> think<00:05:12.720> of<00:05:12.780> it<00:05:12.870> as<00:05:12.990> a<00:05:13.020> zipper<00:05:13.889> versus<00:05:14.250> a

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
I think of it as a zipper versus a

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.050 
I think of it as a zipper versus a
button<00:05:14.639> in<00:05:14.789> terms<00:05:15.630> of<00:05:16.020> strength<00:05:16.710> and<00:05:16.860> rigidity

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
button in terms of strength and rigidity

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.870 
button in terms of strength and rigidity
okay<00:05:18.090> you<00:05:18.599> also<00:05:18.750> get<00:05:19.020> reinforced<00:05:19.880> b-pillars

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
okay you also get reinforced b-pillars

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.969 
okay you also get reinforced b-pillars
so<00:05:21.240> if<00:05:21.330> you<00:05:21.449> were<00:05:21.539> to<00:05:21.659> come<00:05:21.840> here<00:05:22.169> and<00:05:22.680> kind<00:05:22.889> of

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
so if you were to come here and kind of

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.770 
so if you were to come here and kind of
try<00:05:23.159> to<00:05:23.220> grab<00:05:23.820> around<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.180> b-pillar<00:05:24.479> there

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
try to grab around the b-pillar there

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.659 
try to grab around the b-pillar there
you're<00:05:25.289> gonna<00:05:25.440> notice<00:05:25.710> it's<00:05:26.039> nice<00:05:26.250> and<00:05:26.460> thick

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
you're gonna notice it's nice and thick

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.460 
you're gonna notice it's nice and thick
so<00:05:26.880> that's<00:05:27.270> one<00:05:27.419> of<00:05:27.509> the<00:05:27.570> primary<00:05:27.900> impact

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
so that's one of the primary impact

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.029 
so that's one of the primary impact
spots

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
spots

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.129 
spots
all<00:05:29.759> right<00:05:29.909> coupling<00:05:30.360> with<00:05:30.479> that<00:05:30.659> you<00:05:30.990> get

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
all right coupling with that you get

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.589 
all right coupling with that you get
space<00:05:31.470> between<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.610> actual<00:05:33.000> B<00:05:33.180> pillar<00:05:33.449> and

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
space between the actual B pillar and

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:34.939 
space between the actual B pillar and
the<00:05:33.720> seat<00:05:33.990> you're<00:05:34.139> not<00:05:34.289> tucked<00:05:34.650> right<00:05:34.740> up

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
the seat you're not tucked right up

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.399 
the seat you're not tucked right up
against<00:05:35.310> that<00:05:35.340> is<00:05:36.000> again<00:05:36.389> nobody<00:05:36.930> wants<00:05:37.169> to<00:05:37.229> be

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
against that is again nobody wants to be

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.719 
against that is again nobody wants to be
up<00:05:37.979> against<00:05:38.370> a<00:05:38.490> crash<00:05:39.090> zone<00:05:40.070> lastly<00:05:41.070> you<00:05:41.699> have

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
up against a crash zone lastly you have

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.330 
up against a crash zone lastly you have
forged<00:05:42.300> hinges<00:05:42.720> for<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:43.020> doors<00:05:43.259> so<00:05:44.099> a<00:05:44.130> good

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
forged hinges for the doors so a good

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.890 
forged hinges for the doors so a good
example<00:05:44.490> we<00:05:44.849> like<00:05:45.000> to<00:05:45.090> do<00:05:45.210> is<00:05:45.360> if<00:05:45.479> you<00:05:45.570> wanted

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
example we like to do is if you wanted

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.390 
example we like to do is if you wanted
to<00:05:45.990> you<00:05:46.139> can<00:05:46.229> jump<00:05:46.440> on<00:05:46.560> top<00:05:46.770> of<00:05:46.889> this<00:05:46.949> door<00:05:47.190> here

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
to you can jump on top of this door here

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.089 
to you can jump on top of this door here
and<00:05:47.610> kind<00:05:48.210> of<00:05:48.330> ride<00:05:48.539> it<00:05:48.690> like<00:05:48.719> a<00:05:48.870> gate<00:05:49.169> and<00:05:49.349> then

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
and kind of ride it like a gate and then

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.730 
and kind of ride it like a gate and then
