the<00:00:04.970> first<00:00:05.210> thing<00:00:05.360> you<00:00:05.450> need<00:00:05.540> to<00:00:05.600> think<00:00:05.690> about

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990 
the first thing you need to think about

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.250 
the first thing you need to think about
is<00:00:06.319> going<00:00:07.040> to<00:00:07.130> be<00:00:07.250> varieties<00:00:07.970> let's<00:00:08.810> assuming

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
is going to be varieties let's assuming

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.509 
is going to be varieties let's assuming
that<00:00:09.380> we're<00:00:09.500> going<00:00:09.650> to<00:00:09.740> be<00:00:09.860> in<00:00:09.950> the<00:00:10.070> deep<00:00:10.250> south

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
that we're going to be in the deep south

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.280 
that we're going to be in the deep south
now<00:00:10.820> and<00:00:11.000> we<00:00:11.090> might<00:00:11.240> be<00:00:11.420> ordering<00:00:11.690> a<00:00:11.840> rabbit<00:00:12.170> I

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
now and we might be ordering a rabbit I

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.560 
now and we might be ordering a rabbit I
variety<00:00:12.770> what<00:00:13.550> you<00:00:13.700> want<00:00:13.850> to<00:00:13.910> remember<00:00:14.090> about

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
variety what you want to remember about

that<00:00:18.439> you're<00:00:18.560> going<00:00:18.740> to<00:00:18.830> need<00:00:18.980> to<00:00:19.100> order<00:00:19.279> more

that you're going to need to order more

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.939 
that you're going to need to order more
than<00:00:19.699> one<00:00:20.119> variety<00:00:20.539> some<00:00:21.410> of<00:00:21.529> these<00:00:21.619> are

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
than one variety some of these are

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.370 
than one variety some of these are
absolutely<00:00:22.640> self<00:00:23.150> sterile<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:23.960> rabbit<00:00:24.289> eyes

absolutely self sterile the rabbit eyes

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.349 
absolutely self sterile the rabbit eyes
in<00:00:24.589> particular<00:00:24.890> meaning<00:00:25.429> that<00:00:25.579> they<00:00:25.999> will<00:00:26.179> not

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
in particular meaning that they will not

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.329 
in particular meaning that they will not
pollinate<00:00:26.929> themselves<00:00:27.439> so<00:00:27.560> you<00:00:27.650> must<00:00:27.859> have<00:00:27.980> at

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:28.339 
pollinate themselves so you must have at

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.970 
pollinate themselves so you must have at
least<00:00:28.369> two<00:00:29.119> different<00:00:29.599> varieties<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.800> same

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
least two different varieties the same

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.409 
least two different varieties the same
thing<00:00:31.159> is<00:00:31.249> true<00:00:31.279> for<00:00:31.429> the<00:00:31.669> northern<00:00:32.029> high<00:00:32.180> bush

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
thing is true for the northern high bush

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.360 
thing is true for the northern high bush
there<00:00:32.900> are<00:00:33.020> somewhat<00:00:33.380> self-fertile<00:00:34.040> but<00:00:34.250> you

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
there are somewhat self-fertile but you

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.700 
there are somewhat self-fertile but you
get<00:00:34.520> a<00:00:34.579> lot<00:00:34.730> better<00:00:35.239> production<00:00:36.050> if<00:00:36.410> you<00:00:36.530> have

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
get a lot better production if you have

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.040 
get a lot better production if you have
two<00:00:36.920> varieties<00:00:37.250> for<00:00:37.730> cross-pollination<00:00:38.570> so

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
two varieties for cross-pollination so

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.939 
two varieties for cross-pollination so
that's<00:00:39.199> the<00:00:39.289> first<00:00:39.440> thing<00:00:39.559> you<00:00:39.710> must<00:00:39.770> remember

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
that's the first thing you must remember

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.830 
that's the first thing you must remember
cross<00:00:40.730> pollination<00:00:41.180> and<00:00:41.390> blueberries

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
cross pollination and blueberries

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.479 
cross pollination and blueberries
because<00:00:42.140> a<00:00:42.170> single<00:00:42.500> variety<00:00:43.010> will<00:00:43.340> not

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
because a single variety will not

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.880 
because a single variety will not
pollinate<00:00:43.940> itself<00:00:44.269> either<00:00:44.600> not<00:00:45.199> at<00:00:45.350> all<00:00:45.469> or

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
pollinate itself either not at all or

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.880 
pollinate itself either not at all or
very<00:00:46.219> poorly<00:00:46.579> so<00:00:47.449> as<00:00:47.660> we<00:00:47.780> do<00:00:47.960> that<00:00:48.170> what<00:00:48.739> other

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
very poorly so as we do that what other

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.889 
very poorly so as we do that what other
considerations<00:00:49.640> should<00:00:49.730> we<00:00:49.969> have<00:00:50.179> besides

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
considerations should we have besides

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.869 
considerations should we have besides
two<00:00:51.170> different<00:00:51.500> varieties<00:00:51.859> probably<00:00:52.760> the

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
two different varieties probably the

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.310 
two different varieties probably the
single<00:00:53.179> most<00:00:53.210> important<00:00:53.780> consideration

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
single most important consideration

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.569 
single most important consideration
there<00:00:54.469> is<00:00:54.590> spreading<00:00:55.039> the<00:00:55.160> harvest<00:00:55.550> season

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
there is spreading the harvest season

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.430 
there is spreading the harvest season
out<00:00:55.969> you<00:00:56.359> probably<00:00:56.600> don't<00:00:56.750> want<00:00:57.079> all<00:00:57.230> your

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
out you probably don't want all your

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.079 
out you probably don't want all your
blueberries<00:00:57.949> ripe<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.339> same<00:00:58.550> two<00:00:58.730> weeks<00:00:58.940> in

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
blueberries ripe the same two weeks in

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.729 
blueberries ripe the same two weeks in
the<00:00:59.149> middle<00:00:59.359> of<00:00:59.449> the<00:00:59.510> summer<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.440> what<00:01:00.620> we

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
the middle of the summer so what we

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.380 
the middle of the summer so what we
would<00:01:00.859> suggest<00:01:01.010> on<00:01:01.399> this<00:01:01.550> one<00:01:01.730> is<00:01:01.850> selecting

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
would suggest on this one is selecting

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.910 
would suggest on this one is selecting
varieties<00:01:02.809> from<00:01:02.929> the<00:01:03.079> nursery<00:01:03.410> catalogs

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
varieties from the nursery catalogs

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.920 
varieties from the nursery catalogs
looking<00:01:04.699> up<00:01:04.870> Cooperative<00:01:05.870> Extension

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
looking up Cooperative Extension

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.390 
looking up Cooperative Extension
publications<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:06.890> other<00:01:06.980> things<00:01:07.220> to

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
publications and other things to

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.940 
publications and other things to
determine<00:01:07.850> what<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.509> season<00:01:08.990> of<00:01:09.110> ripening<00:01:09.650> is

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
determine what the season of ripening is

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.249 
determine what the season of ripening is
for<00:01:10.280> those<00:01:10.400> individual<00:01:11.060> varieties<00:01:11.540> what<00:01:12.170> we

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
for those individual varieties what we

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.899 
for those individual varieties what we
would<00:01:12.380> suggest<00:01:12.560> is<00:01:12.979> if<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:13.460> want<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:13.700> spread

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
would suggest is if you want to spread

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.490 
would suggest is if you want to spread
your<00:01:13.970> season<00:01:14.420> out<00:01:14.509> by<00:01:14.750> something<00:01:15.290> that's

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
your season out by something that's

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.490 
your season out by something that's
early<00:01:16.130> season<00:01:16.549> mid<00:01:17.210> season<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:17.720> late<00:01:18.200> season

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
early season mid season and late season

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.590 
early season mid season and late season
so<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:19.340> could<00:01:19.520> have<00:01:19.640> blueberries<00:01:20.149> over

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
so that you could have blueberries over

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.359 
so that you could have blueberries over
quite<00:01:21.110> a<00:01:21.140> time<00:01:21.409> period<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:22.189> average

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
quite a time period the average

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.039 
quite a time period the average
blueberry<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:22.939> going<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.180> ripen<00:01:23.450> over<00:01:23.689> several

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
blueberry is going to ripen over several

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.990 
blueberry is going to ripen over several
weeks<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.470> single<00:01:24.799> variety<00:01:25.100> will<00:01:25.220> ripen<00:01:25.640> over

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
weeks a single variety will ripen over

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.300 
weeks a single variety will ripen over
several<00:01:26.240> weeks<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:27.020> if<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:27.229> had<00:01:27.290> early<00:01:28.100> mid

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
several weeks so if you had early mid

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.380 
several weeks so if you had early mid
and<00:01:28.460> late<00:01:28.549> season<00:01:28.729> verizon<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.240> could

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
and late season verizon you could

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.969 
and late season verizon you could
certainly<00:01:29.600> have<00:01:30.140> them<00:01:30.380> for<00:01:30.560> several<00:01:30.770> months

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
certainly have them for several months

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.469 
certainly have them for several months
in<00:01:31.189> the<00:01:31.250> summertime<00:01:31.549> it's<00:01:31.880> probably<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.390> way

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
in the summertime it's probably the way

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.840 
in the summertime it's probably the way
you'd<00:01:32.630> like<00:01:32.689> to<00:01:32.869> do<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:33.430> always<00:01:34.430> having<00:01:34.610> some

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
you'd like to do it always having some

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.429 
you'd like to do it always having some
fresh<00:01:35.030> blueberries<00:01:35.479> available<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:36.320> other

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
fresh blueberries available the other

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.870 
fresh blueberries available the other
great<00:01:36.649> thing<00:01:36.710> about<00:01:36.920> blueberries<00:01:37.579> is<00:01:37.729> that

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
great thing about blueberries is that

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.580 
great thing about blueberries is that
they<00:01:38.000> also<00:01:38.149> freeze<00:01:38.659> really<00:01:39.079> well<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:39.409> if<00:01:39.500> you

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
they also freeze really well so if you

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.139 
they also freeze really well so if you
have<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.950> lot<00:01:40.280> of<00:01:40.310> blueberries<00:01:40.729> ripening<00:01:41.060> at

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
have a lot of blueberries ripening at

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.120 
have a lot of blueberries ripening at
one<00:01:41.299> time<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:41.960> can<00:01:42.170> freeze<00:01:42.469> them<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:42.890> get

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
one time you can freeze them and get

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.440 
one time you can freeze them and get
them<00:01:43.250> up<00:01:43.340> for<00:01:43.490> later<00:01:43.640> use<00:01:43.820> in<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.299> they're

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
them up for later use in and they're

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.779 
them up for later use in and they're
very<00:01:45.340> appropriate<00:01:46.340> kind<00:01:46.549> of<00:01:46.640> use<00:01:46.759> of

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
very appropriate kind of use of

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.940 
very appropriate kind of use of
blueberries<00:01:47.270> great<00:01:47.780> kind<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.049> pies<00:01:48.530> and

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
blueberries great kind of pies and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.709 
blueberries great kind of pies and
blueberry<00:01:49.700> muffins<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.240> everything<00:01:50.570> in<00:01:50.659> the

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
blueberry muffins and everything in the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.649 
blueberry muffins and everything in the
middle<00:01:50.930> of<00:01:51.049> winter<00:01:51.170> lives<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:51.770> think<00:01:52.219> about

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
middle of winter lives so think about

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.149 
middle of winter lives so think about
freezing<00:01:53.659> think<00:01:54.170> about<00:01:54.350> preserving<00:01:54.829> think

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
freezing think about preserving think

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.410 
freezing think about preserving think
about<00:01:55.340> saving<00:01:55.640> some<00:01:55.789> of<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:55.909> blueberries<00:01:56.329> in

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
about saving some of the blueberries in

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.999 
about saving some of the blueberries in
the<00:01:56.509> early<00:01:56.780> mid<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.079> late<00:01:57.200> season<00:01:57.439> varieties

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
the early mid and late season varieties

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.609 
the early mid and late season varieties
so<00:01:58.789> once<00:01:59.329> we<00:01:59.509> selected<00:02:00.020> something<00:02:00.350> along

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
so once we selected something along

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.800 
so once we selected something along
those<00:02:00.859> lines<00:02:01.070> for<00:02:01.909> commercial<00:02:02.359> growers<00:02:02.630> there

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
those lines for commercial growers there

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.719 
those lines for commercial growers there
may<00:02:02.930> be<00:02:02.960> simply<00:02:03.380> other<00:02:03.680> considerations<00:02:04.520> but

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
may be simply other considerations but

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.639 
may be simply other considerations but
primarily<00:02:05.149> for<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.659> homeowner<00:02:05.990> you're

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
primarily for the homeowner you're

primarily for the homeowner you're
looking<00:02:07.009> at<00:02:07.159> season<00:02:07.789> most<00:02:08.270> of<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.539> varieties

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
looking at season most of the varieties

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.020 
looking at season most of the varieties
that<00:02:08.930> we<00:02:09.110> have<00:02:09.320> today<00:02:09.500> have<00:02:09.979> similar<00:02:10.610> disease

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
that we have today have similar disease

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.180 
that we have today have similar disease
and<00:02:11.300> insect<00:02:11.800> resistance<00:02:12.800> characteristics

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
and insect resistance characteristics

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.309 
and insect resistance characteristics
some<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.300> them<00:02:14.360> are<00:02:14.480> slightly<00:02:14.840> different<00:02:15.290> in

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
some of them are slightly different in

some of them are slightly different in

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360

slightly<00:02:17.750> different<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.200> terms<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.620> flavor<00:02:18.860> of

slightly different in terms of flavor of

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
the berry but in general you can't

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.270 
the berry but in general you can't
really<00:02:21.140> go<00:02:21.350> too<00:02:21.410> wrong<00:02:21.590> with<00:02:21.950> any<00:02:22.100> of<00:02:22.190> the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
really go too wrong with any of the

really go too wrong with any of the
modern<00:02:22.580> varieties<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:23.030> blueberries<00:02:23.570> or

modern varieties of blueberries or

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.330 
modern varieties of blueberries or
they're<00:02:23.900> out<00:02:23.930> there<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.470> just<00:02:25.040> choose<00:02:25.280> one

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
they're out there so just choose one
