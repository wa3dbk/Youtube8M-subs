00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
that's what I did so that this one is

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.930 
that's what I did so that this one is
what<00:01:53.630> you're<00:01:53.840> going<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.080> do<00:01:54.610> take<00:01:55.610> out<00:01:55.820> the

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
tubing that connects this and this

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.140 
tubing that connects this and this
basically<00:01:59.360> six<00:01:59.750> right<00:01:59.960> here

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
basically six right here

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.300 
basically six right here

this part it's like right there and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.609 
this part it's like right there and
that's<00:02:05.120> the<00:02:05.240> actual<00:02:05.660> motor

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
that's the actual motor

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:16.339 
that's the actual motor
all<00:02:08.280> right<00:02:09.800> one<00:02:10.800> second<00:02:15.170> all<00:02:16.170> right

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
all right one second all right

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.990 
all right one second all right

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
this is the like the motor like this is

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.420 
this is the like the motor like this is
motor<00:02:21.209> but<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.440> know<00:02:22.560> fan<00:02:23.099> thing

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
motor but this the you know fan thing

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.539 
motor but this the you know fan thing
and<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.709> going<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.920> be<00:02:25.980> connected<00:02:26.190> to

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
and this is going to be connected to

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.280 
and this is going to be connected to
this<00:02:26.670> piece<00:02:26.940> right<00:02:27.120> here<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:28.019> tube<00:02:28.200> is

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.120 

this<00:02:45.989> will<00:02:46.200> help<00:02:46.370> like<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.670> clogging<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:49.130> I

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
this will help like the clogging and I

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.460 
this will help like the clogging and I
would<00:02:50.310> do<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:53.450> there's<00:02:54.450> not<00:02:54.569> really<00:02:54.750> much<00:02:55.079> to

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
would do it there's not really much to

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.650 
would do it there's not really much to
it<00:02:56.540> basically<00:02:57.540> cut<00:02:58.319> that<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.860> then<00:02:59.549> take<00:03:00.510> this

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
it basically cut that and then take this

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.710 
it basically cut that and then take this
piece<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:03.450> connect<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:05.329> would<00:03:06.329> do<00:03:06.540> this

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
piece and you connect it I would do this

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.559 
piece and you connect it I would do this

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.250 

then<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.849> can<00:03:42.000> hot<00:03:42.239> glue<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:42.599> or<00:03:43.790> silicone<00:03:44.790> and

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
then you can hot glue it or silicone and

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.710 
then you can hot glue it or silicone and
this<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:46.440> how<00:03:46.650> it's<00:03:47.160> going<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.459> like<00:03:47.669> stick<00:03:48.090> on

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
this is how it's going to like stick on

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.909 
this is how it's going to like stick on
the<00:03:48.870> cord<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:50.459> these<00:03:51.419> these<00:03:52.319> power<00:03:52.680> heads

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
the cord and these these power heads

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.949 
the cord and these these power heads
they're<00:03:53.220> made<00:03:53.400> they're<00:03:54.120> supposed<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.810> sit

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
they're made they're supposed to sit

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.309 
they're made they're supposed to sit
outside<00:03:55.310> so<00:03:56.310> you're<00:03:56.459> going<00:03:56.639> to<00:03:56.669> need<00:03:57.319> to

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
outside so you're going to need to

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.110 
outside so you're going to need to
silicone<00:03:58.889> or<00:03:59.010> hot<00:03:59.220> glue<00:03:59.720> so<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:02.430> like<00:04:02.700> where

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
silicone or hot glue so this like where

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.600 
silicone or hot glue so this like where
the<00:04:03.239> wire<00:04:03.419> meets<00:04:04.519> so<00:04:05.519> then<00:04:05.700> it's<00:04:05.819> sealed

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
the wire meets so then it's sealed

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.870 
the wire meets so then it's sealed
and<00:04:08.610> then<00:04:08.760> taught<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.240> go<00:04:10.700> if<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:11.850> have
