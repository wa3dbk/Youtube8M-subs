00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:13.230
 Hello everyone in the description with you 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.740
 marakasi you are watching the transfer of fun and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.800
 bugs issue 60 we start with barbie which 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.260
 occurred on the map murovanka players 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.099
 the green team decided to embark on 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.070
 capture and win the fight this way but 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.560
 capture for some reason does not go like this 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.410
 global bug that prevented 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.469
 green team players win 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.940
 although they have long been able to do it 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.829
 such a bug is not an isolated case I honestly 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.870
 saying for sure upset 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.360
 green team players well 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.640
 imagine you got on the capture left 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.820
 wait a bit to win the fight and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.469
 here once tank and you probably from this 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.260
 spoil the mood 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.730
 this bug betrays a single player she 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.090
 whole team 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.640
 i.e. 15 players in this mernik fight 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.760
 Were not happy because we wanted 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.330
 to take the base in the end the tank prevented them from doing so 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.380
 do some dudes can just on 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.619
 flat place 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.930
 find yourself some bug while they 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.680
 don't even look for him just like that 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.229
 rides and somewhere climbs into a corner and in the end 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.659
 then suspect them spins 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.060
 in the air but it’s just that you need to be able to 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.479
 I personally will never succeed 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.520
 also some players somehow manage 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.390
 crashing on a rock just like this 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.409
 are going 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.049
 bumps into it and self destructs not 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.360
 I know how they do it, I start 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.270
 a hundred times crashed at full speed there 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.180
 in stone but I didn’t have apt-1 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.140
 he goes to attack sees below opponents and 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.090
 decides to jump off this cliff and 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.470
 see what happens he just 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.290
 falls into 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.110
 and does not lose a unit of strength I 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.929
 of course I understand that cr-1 is a cheat 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.300
 tank but not so much so that he jumped 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:18.330
 here from that distance and did not lose 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:20.790
 the strength of apt-1s sees the tree below gives 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.209
 because homework and then takes her 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.280
 to the sides and here another player pulls up 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.140
 on the tree that are just killed by a ram 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.380
 about our hero 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.040
 3 tree pulls up as they agreed 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.400
 she turns around shoots ground aka 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.040
 gives her a spank and takes her away in a ram 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.670
 These are the three merry Christmas trees that are 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.220
 love to ram heavy tanks isu-152 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.010
 decides to drown himself at the end of the fight because 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.430
 she stayed here alone alive falls on 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.489
 bottom and opponents decide to follow 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.310
 she, too, they are heated in general, well done 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.400
 just see how many enemies are just 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.200
 so drank themselves and probably really want 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.720
 get less experience and silver 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.730
 KV-3 goes on the attack and only thinks about 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.880
 the fact that he will now give someone 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.870
 the guard of the check and then lit up 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.810
 ahead of the t-34 3 and as always the guard 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.410
 check works with a bang and used to average 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.980
 tank explodes from and 343 need to be smaller 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.829
 side shine and here's a great way 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.850
 how can you try your luck on the map 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.690
 himmelsdorf 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.630
 just refer to the base from the top base 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.269
 Opponent shoot and you might get lucky 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.570
 how did this player start pick up 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.019
 drying happens such that ricochets in our 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.269
 the game 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.030
 pleases such as now a player on 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.329
 drying shoots at kv-2 and occurs 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.769
 ricochet from his tower and the projectile flies in 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:00.209
 straight at 34 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.670
 who tried to leave but the player on 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.700
 Yagdtigre contrary regretted that he had 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.950
 there was a rebound shoots he go 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.799
 game and somehow going on here 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.710
 ricochet and the projectile arrives right in 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.020
 ally 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.390
 any strange really 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.810
 ricochet maybe this is even some kind of bug 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.790
 waffentrager pz 4 meets arta even 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.330
 elves are not enough to her 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.730
 get and seemingly. it's just 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.580
 doomed but see what happens 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.360
 projectile flying straight as that through 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:38.140
 the tower 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:42.130
 and how do you like this situation in the randomness t-54 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:45.190
 and one along with 113 bacha there dive 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.130
 mountain and then it starts to shoot 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.850
 from somewhere opponents even around anyone 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:55.210
 no, and in theory the enemies if there were 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:58.030
 they are afraid of shining but no one is 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.640
 no less players take damage especially 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.310
 I got here bachatu which immediately 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.340
 traces naturally battled somebody 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.250
 lit up but the opponents do not shine 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.670
 Apparently this is such a terrible bug 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:16.180
 who misunderstood these players 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:19.120
 and they take damage from enemies that are on 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.130
 really stand here beside they just don't 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.120
 glow you can say such here 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.430
 invisible 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.800
 even though this bug is extremely rare 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.920
 after all any player can into it 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.460
 get there so if this situation 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.620
 happened know this is a bug and on this 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.430
