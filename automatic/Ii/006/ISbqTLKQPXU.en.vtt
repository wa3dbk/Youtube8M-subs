00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
there and a normal HTC battery just

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:47.309

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.539 

one<00:02:48.319> of<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.470> things<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.709> want<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:48.950> show<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.220> is

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
one of the things I want to show you is

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.539 
one of the things I want to show you is
the<00:02:50.000> keyboard<00:02:50.630> itself<00:02:51.130> keys<00:02:52.130> are<00:02:52.310> very

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
the keyboard itself keys are very

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.660 
the keyboard itself keys are very
shallow<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:53.420> mean<00:02:53.660> they're<00:02:54.049> domed<00:02:54.350> but<00:02:54.860> they're

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
shallow I mean they're domed but they're

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.430 
shallow I mean they're domed but they're
not<00:02:55.760> domed<00:02:56.090> as<00:02:56.630> much<00:02:56.780> as<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.019> would<00:02:57.140> see<00:02:57.319> on

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
not domed as much as you would see on

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.500 
not domed as much as you would see on
say<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.739> trio<00:02:58.190> or<00:02:58.519> Sentra<00:02:59.060> or<00:02:59.150> something<00:02:59.420> like

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
say a trio or Sentra or something like

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.009 
say a trio or Sentra or something like
that<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.730> they're<00:03:02.030> easy<00:03:02.209> enough<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.480> feel<00:03:02.810> but

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
that so they're easy enough to feel but

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.830 
that so they're easy enough to feel but
they<00:03:03.110> don't<00:03:03.380> have<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:04.030> lot<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.150> travel<00:03:05.599> in<00:03:05.690> them

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
they don't have a lot of travel in them

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.099 
they don't have a lot of travel in them
so<00:03:06.110> they're<00:03:06.410> this<00:03:07.690> reasonable<00:03:08.690> tactile

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
so they're this reasonable tactile

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.220 
so they're this reasonable tactile
feedback<00:03:09.440> but<00:03:10.030> somehow<00:03:11.030> it<00:03:11.600> just<00:03:11.630> feels<00:03:12.079> a<00:03:12.200> bit

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
feedback but somehow it just feels a bit

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.259 
feedback but somehow it just feels a bit
flat<00:03:14.380> just<00:03:15.380> there<00:03:15.829> t-mobile<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.760> HTC<00:03:17.180> have

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
flat just there t-mobile and HTC have

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.880 
flat just there t-mobile and HTC have
both<00:03:17.420> had<00:03:17.660> far<00:03:17.930> better<00:03:17.959> keyboards<00:03:18.739> in<00:03:18.859> the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
both had far better keyboards in the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.150 
both had far better keyboards in the
past<00:03:19.190> so<00:03:19.519> it's<00:03:20.120> usable<00:03:20.660> it's<00:03:20.989> just<00:03:21.200> not<00:03:21.380> good

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.500 

the<00:03:25.160> trackball<00:03:25.609> controller<00:03:26.090> on<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.329> other

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
the trackball controller on the other

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.870 
the trackball controller on the other
hand<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:26.959> really<00:03:27.470> good<00:03:27.739> it's<00:03:28.489> great<00:03:28.640> for

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
hand is really good it's great for

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.099 
hand is really good it's great for
moving<00:03:29.030> around<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.359> display<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:29.989> can

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
moving around the display and you can

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.449 
moving around the display and you can
actually<00:03:30.470> get<00:03:30.620> away<00:03:30.709> with<00:03:30.950> not<00:03:31.070> using<00:03:31.370> the
