00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.689
 plowing in front of him the ground he undermines 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.310
 mines 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.440
 robot technical complex 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.450
 demining are not terrible military explosions 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.210
 say his armor will withstand even direct 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.460
 hit from a grenade launcher using one 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.120
 car clearance we can safely 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.119
 to replace 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.800
 at least one sapper department robot 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.900
 the sapper passes the test paired with 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.789
 as a fire robot, he joins the job 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.390
 when all the explosive devices are on the way 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.519
 neutralized easily handles blockage of 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.619
 logs breaks through the category of fire and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.540
 extinguish it from the latent barrel capacity 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.760
 water tanks that are hidden under 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.050
 refractory casing 2 tons 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.190
 the possibility of refueling directly from the reservoirs 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.110
 robotic complexes are controlled 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.910
 remotely operators can be located 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.309
 from them at a distance of two kilometers 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.410
 what happens on the front line they see on 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.480
 displays of its consoles video signal 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.239
 comes from cameras that are mounted on 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.940
 driving basics 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.170
 get used than 2 3 3 days for the basics 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.870
 fire tracer work 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.799
 will fall a little longer therefore completely 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.030
 the course leaves about a month completely 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.040
 to drive a car professionally 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.990
 account of various attachments 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.180
 these remotely controlled cars 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.990
 able to perform quite wide 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.240
 range of tasks 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.729
 such ticks are in service 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.140
 robotic complex 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.540
 fire extinguishing and have sizes with them 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.759
 similar to the formidable beetles the pressure in these 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.909
 steel clamps enough to lift 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.920
 concrete block weighing one and a half tons more 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.470
 one experimental sample which 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.090
 interested in the ministry of defense 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.350
 passive exoskeleton in it and its and 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.390
 someone else's burden does not pull 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.159
 demonstrated for the first time can 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.770
 used in the security kit 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.020
 sappers have testers sergei exoskeletons 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.329
 evil hole in a backpack over 35 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.520
 kilograms easier for me to go upstairs with 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.990
 Him than without him then already part of 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.369
 load is not in my 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.890
 musculoskeletal system 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.259
 namely through and skeletons presses on 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.290
 the ground and the back are always unloaded 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.549
 constantly too big big plus and 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.079
 robotic complexes exoskeleton 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.659
 purely domestic development 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.399
 test results will improve them 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.410
 and only then after the general 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.599
 checks they can be put on 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.730
