00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.040
 yes thank you I think I'm my best 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.620
 match I had the goal and the two 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.300
 assists and good happy for the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.720
 team victory first we 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.820
 was missing to win play well and good of that 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.379
 tranquility to the group I think it 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.150
 they had done good matches just do not know 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.429
 they had given us the results and now 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.660
 with this game where they are given to 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.339
 I strongly believe that it is 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.130
 important to the team's spirit and 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.779
 to continue taking that level that 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.079
 we have all and that can take us to 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.610
 qualify and look for the championship and hopefully 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.280
 that can support me because this is from 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.470
 keep being regular I think that 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.320
 van there are just six matches there are there 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.940
 to finish the tournament in a good way 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.440
 Well, of course it 's my dream it 's my 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.810
 biggest dream someday to be able to form 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.090
 part of my selection is obviously a 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.610
 I dream but I know that everything is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.290
 that base of work and it takes time I 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.970
 I'm working and I'm very, very 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.590
 quiet here I want to do things 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.020
 well in contributing to my team having 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.310
 regularity and if first god to the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.040
 possibility to go for me enchanted 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.900
 that there is no such thing, it's the parties 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.369
 what more do they want to earn in those that more in 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.480
 the ones that hook you the most then I think 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.190
 to make a match 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.440
 very very complicated is going to be a match 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.620
 that we have to be very smart yes 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.140
 Obviously the one that is lion gives you 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.570
 that extra that extra ingredient that you 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.670
 motivates more you get hooked more with the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.620
 players and as the teacher says they are 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.240
 nice games to play is where 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.010
 where you have to take out the character and 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.650
 I hope you see that we are going to be a good 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.510
 match keep adding three points and 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.240
 continue positioning in the high part 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.760
 of the table if I see it because I have 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.320
 lost the final hurts we know what's left 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.090
 the penalty of many of us 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.500
 I think we lacked a bit of 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.360
 experience a bit of malice to 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.250
 to win the game because we 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.860
 we carry a very good advantage of 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.450
 visit and good obviously one wants 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.550
 win again wants to take the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.530
 spine of the final and hopefully left the 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.510
 Saturday's game we can take out 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.790
 the three points we will deploy a good 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.080
 football we can make a great game that 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.720
 fall 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.260
 Clear pachuca we have more titles and some 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.260
 american
