00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
race formula wheels this wheel is mainly

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.420 
race formula wheels this wheel is mainly
designed<00:00:14.099> for<00:00:14.490> free<00:00:14.849> riding<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.509> sliding

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
designed for free riding and sliding

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.439 
designed for free riding and sliding
pretty<00:00:17.430> much<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.730> only<00:00:17.760> thing<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.240> wheel

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
pretty much the only thing this wheel

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.070 
pretty much the only thing this wheel
has<00:00:18.480> going<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.230> it's<00:00:19.890> its<00:00:20.070> durability

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
has going for it it's its durability

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.189 
has going for it it's its durability
these<00:00:22.080> wheels<00:00:22.260> last<00:00:22.529> quite<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.250> long<00:00:23.310> time<00:00:23.789> and

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
these wheels last quite a long time and

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.029 
these wheels last quite a long time and
even<00:00:25.199> though<00:00:25.350> they<00:00:25.529> are<00:00:26.269> 82a<00:00:27.269> they<00:00:28.260> feel<00:00:28.859> like

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
even though they are 82a they feel like

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.710 
even though they are 82a they feel like
a<00:00:29.070> hard<00:00:29.310> wheel<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.699> they<00:00:29.789> last<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.510> hard

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
a hard wheel and they last like a hard

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.600 
a hard wheel and they last like a hard
wheel<00:00:30.869> I've<00:00:31.560> been<00:00:31.769> writing<00:00:31.949> these<00:00:32.130> for<00:00:32.430> a

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
wheel I've been writing these for a

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.490 
wheel I've been writing these for a
little<00:00:32.790> over<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.120> month<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.570> they've<00:00:34.260> lasted

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
little over a month and they've lasted

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.680 
little over a month and they've lasted
longer<00:00:35.100> than<00:00:35.130> most<00:00:35.280> wheels<00:00:35.610> I've<00:00:35.790> used<00:00:35.969> some

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
longer than most wheels I've used some

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.229 
longer than most wheels I've used some
of<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.809> issues<00:00:36.989> with<00:00:37.320> these<00:00:37.500> wheels<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.950> that

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
of the issues with these wheels is that

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.930 
of the issues with these wheels is that
they<00:00:39.239> don't<00:00:39.510> slide<00:00:39.719> very<00:00:40.559> well<00:00:40.800> at<00:00:40.950> all<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.399> was

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
they don't slide very well at all I was

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.700 
they don't slide very well at all I was
running<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> other<00:00:42.480> day<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
running these the other day and I

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.310 
running these the other day and I
noticed<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.730> once<00:00:45.120> they<00:00:45.270> get<00:00:45.420> down<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:46.289> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
noticed that once they get down to a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.100 
noticed that once they get down to a
fairly<00:00:46.710> small<00:00:46.770> size<00:00:47.360> they<00:00:48.360> really<00:00:48.750> wear<00:00:48.930> down

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
fairly small size they really wear down

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.139 
fairly small size they really wear down
quickly<00:00:49.500> when<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.460> started<00:00:50.730> writing<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:51.090> were

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
quickly when I started writing they were

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.549 
quickly when I started writing they were
probably<00:00:51.329> about<00:00:51.539> five<00:00:51.809> millimeters<00:00:52.079> better

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
probably about five millimeters better

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.209 
probably about five millimeters better
than<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.629> five<00:00:55.620> runs<00:00:55.980> or

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
than this and that was like five runs or

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.459 
than this and that was like five runs or
so<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.449> what<00:00:57.840> they<00:00:57.989> started<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> look

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
so so this is what they started to look

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.970 
so so this is what they started to look
like<00:00:58.710> they<00:00:58.890> chip<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.489> get<00:01:00.390> very<00:01:00.719> rough<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.350> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
like they chip and get very rough as you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.560 
like they chip and get very rough as you
can<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.309> there's<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.609> huge<00:01:02.940> chip<00:01:03.329> right<00:01:03.510> there

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
can see there's a huge chip right there

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.590 
can see there's a huge chip right there
like<00:01:04.019> massive<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:06.000> surface<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
like massive and then the surface of the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.850 
like massive and then the surface of the
wheel<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.290> all<00:01:07.409> messed<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:10.470> lips<00:01:10.710> are

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
wheel is all messed up and the lips are

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.980 
wheel is all messed up and the lips are
just<00:01:10.920> gone<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:13.500> chipping<00:01:13.830> will<00:01:13.979> not<00:01:14.159> occur

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
just gone the chipping will not occur

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.690 
just gone the chipping will not occur
for<00:01:15.990> probably<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.650> month<00:01:16.740> or<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.549> you're

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
for probably a month or so if you're

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.539 
for probably a month or so if you're
going<00:01:17.790> hard<00:01:18.060> sliding<00:01:18.560> these<00:01:19.560> wheels<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:20.130> very

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
going hard sliding these wheels are very

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.640 
going hard sliding these wheels are very
large<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> free<00:01:21.420> ride<00:01:21.570> wheel<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.259> they<00:01:22.439> will

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
large for a free ride wheel so they will

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890 
large for a free ride wheel so they will
chatter<00:01:23.159> for<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> first<00:01:23.759> while<00:01:24.390> until<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
chatter for the first while until you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.120 
chatter for the first while until you
wear<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> min<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.470> get<00:01:25.560> him<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> little<00:01:25.860> smaller

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
wear a min and get him a little smaller

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.190 
wear a min and get him a little smaller
like<00:01:26.580> take<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.939> couple<00:01:27.119> Mills<00:01:27.330> these<00:01:27.960> wheels

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
like take up a couple Mills these wheels

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.440 
like take up a couple Mills these wheels
will<00:01:28.650> work<00:01:28.860> alright<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.400> downhill<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.150> mean<00:01:30.420> I

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
will work alright for downhill I mean I

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.620 
will work alright for downhill I mean I
have<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> lot<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:30.960> grip<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:32.119> you<00:01:33.119> will<00:01:33.329> feel

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
have a lot of grip and you will feel

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.270 
have a lot of grip and you will feel
them<00:01:33.840> go<00:01:34.020> out<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> bit<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.590> turns<00:01:34.860> but<00:01:35.130> they

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
them go out a bit on turns but they

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.280 
them go out a bit on turns but they
won't<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.299> completely<00:01:36.630> slide<00:01:36.990> they'll

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
won't like just completely slide they'll

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.469 
won't like just completely slide they'll
start<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.680> lose<00:01:38.310> grip<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.880> they<00:01:39.240> work<00:01:39.390> pretty

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
start to lose grip so they work pretty

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.270 
start to lose grip so they work pretty
well<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.990> these<00:01:40.619> wheels<00:01:40.799> are<00:01:40.950> fairly

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
well for that these wheels are fairly

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.399 
well for that these wheels are fairly
resilient<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.270> flat<00:01:42.479> spotting<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.079> they<00:01:43.200> are

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
resilient to flat spotting and they are

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.510 
resilient to flat spotting and they are
all<00:01:43.619> right<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:44.100> San<00:01:44.280> up<00:01:44.399> slides<00:01:44.640> such<00:01:44.909> as<00:01:45.060> this

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
all right for San up slides such as this

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.270 
all right for San up slides such as this
and<00:01:47.520> they're<00:01:48.330> pretty<00:01:49.170> good<00:01:49.410> for<00:01:49.650> down<00:01:50.040> ill

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and they're pretty good for down ill

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.010 
and they're pretty good for down ill
speech<00:01:50.670> acts<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.150> stuff<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.510> this<00:01:54.020> if

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
speech acts and stuff like this if

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.940 
speech acts and stuff like this if
you're<00:01:55.170> looking<00:01:55.260> for<00:01:55.410> something<00:01:55.650> in<00:01:55.800> between

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
you're looking for something in between

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.430 
you're looking for something in between
downhill<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.880> freeride<00:01:57.080> you're<00:01:58.080> not<00:01:58.260> going

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
downhill and freeride you're not going

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.020 
downhill and freeride you're not going
to<00:01:58.500> get<00:01:58.620> anything<00:01:58.890> that's<00:01:59.190> great<00:01:59.640> for<00:01:59.880> both

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
to get anything that's great for both

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.210 
to get anything that's great for both
sides<00:02:00.300> so<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.200> would<00:02:01.440> just<00:02:01.680> recommend<00:02:01.830> getting

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
sides so I would just recommend getting

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.520 
sides so I would just recommend getting
something<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.910> a<00:02:02.940> fake<00:02:03.600> limit<00:02:03.900> flashback<00:02:04.380> or

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
something like a fake limit flashback or

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.330 
something like a fake limit flashback or
free<00:02:04.800> rod<00:02:05.010> and<00:02:06.110> something<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.260> a<00:02:07.290> big<00:02:07.890> zygor

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
free rod and something like a big zygor

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.029 
free rod and something like a big zygor
some<00:02:08.490> cannibals<00:02:08.940> for<00:02:09.360> downhill<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:10.140> then

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
some cannibals for downhill and then

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.290 
some cannibals for downhill and then
you'll<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.250> two<00:02:11.400> sets<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.670> wheels<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:12.060> if

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
you'll have two sets of wheels you if

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.640 
you'll have two sets of wheels you if
you<00:02:12.390> flat<00:02:12.600> spot<00:02:12.840> here<00:02:12.959> free<00:02:13.110> on<00:02:13.230> wheels<00:02:13.440> you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
you flat spot here free on wheels you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.410 
you flat spot here free on wheels you
will<00:02:13.980> still<00:02:14.340> be<00:02:14.370> able<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.760> do<00:02:14.910> some<00:02:15.090> down<00:02:15.240> male

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
will still be able to do some down male

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.920 
will still be able to do some down male
so<00:02:16.380> these<00:02:16.530> are<00:02:17.209> not<00:02:18.209> really<00:02:18.540> worth<00:02:18.690> your<00:02:18.900> money

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
so these are not really worth your money

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.380 
so these are not really worth your money
I<00:02:19.290> would<00:02:19.709> not<00:02:19.920> get<00:02:20.160> these<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.900> would<00:02:21.900> get<00:02:23.270> like<00:02:24.270> I

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
I would not get these I would get like I

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.810 
I would not get these I would get like I
just<00:02:24.450> said
