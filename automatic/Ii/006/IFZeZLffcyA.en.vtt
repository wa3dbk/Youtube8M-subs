00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
if you do miss do not worry because you

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.279 
if you do miss do not worry because you
can<00:00:50.370> reload<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> checkpoint<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.539> try<00:00:51.930> again

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
can reload the checkpoint and try again

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
time though rather than not trying to

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.740 
time though rather than not trying to
rush<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.880> as<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.180> enemies<00:01:12.479> are<00:01:12.630> coming
