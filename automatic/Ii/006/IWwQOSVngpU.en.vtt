2014 the first blood moon of the

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.730 
2014 the first blood moon of the
2014-2015<00:00:13.650> tech<00:00:14.160> tread<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.730> blood<00:00:15.120> moons<00:00:15.740> and

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
2014-2015 tech tread of blood moons and

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.560 
2014-2015 tech tread of blood moons and
the<00:00:17.310> Blood<00:00:17.670> Moon<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:18.029> happening<00:00:18.359> directly

the Blood Moon is happening directly

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.710 
the Blood Moon is happening directly
above<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.680> star<00:00:19.920> Spica<00:00:20.430> which<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.210> will<00:00:21.570> go

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
above the star Spica which I will go

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.890 
above the star Spica which I will go
into<00:00:21.869> later<00:00:22.260> as<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.970> significance<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
into later as to the significance of the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.320 
into later as to the significance of the
star<00:00:25.140> Spica<00:00:25.640> but<00:00:26.640> let's<00:00:26.820> look<00:00:26.970> at<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.180> blood

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
star Spica but let's look at the blood

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.529 
star Spica but let's look at the blood
moons<00:00:27.570> first<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.769> say<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.670> first<00:00:30.359> one

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
moons first as I say it's the first one

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.620 
moons first as I say it's the first one
of<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.830> 2014-2015<00:00:31.830> tetrad<00:00:32.579> which<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:34.280> now<00:00:35.630> two

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
of the 2014-2015 tetrad which is now two

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.430 
of the 2014-2015 tetrad which is now two
weeks<00:00:36.750> time<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.809> lunar<00:00:40.290> tetrad

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
weeks time and the the lunar tetrad

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.150 
weeks time and the the lunar tetrad
happens<00:00:41.100> when<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:42.379> four<00:00:43.379> blood<00:00:44.129> moons

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
happens when you have four blood moons

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
happens when you have four blood moons

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
in 1948 then there was another tetrad in

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.600 
in 1948 then there was another tetrad in
1967-68<00:01:15.140> at<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.470> six-day<00:01:16.920> war<00:01:16.950> where<00:01:17.490> the

Jews<00:01:17.850> retake<00:01:18.479> Temple<00:01:18.960> Mount<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.100> see

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
Jews retake Temple Mount so you can see

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.999 
Jews retake Temple Mount so you can see
these<00:01:20.460> tetrads<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.810> got<00:01:22.020> very<00:01:22.350> significant

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
these tetrads have got very significant

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.749 
these tetrads have got very significant
events<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.850> life<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.780> Jews<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.759> this

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
events in the life of the Jews and this

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.230 
events in the life of the Jews and this
is<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.030> first<00:01:27.060> blood<00:01:27.479> moon<00:01:27.950> of<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.090> then

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
is the first blood moon of that so then

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.510 
is the first blood moon of that so then
we<00:01:30.329> look<00:01:30.450> at<00:01:30.600> Spiker<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.650> why<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.920> moon<00:01:32.250> in

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
we look at Spiker and why the moon in

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.700 
we look at Spiker and why the moon in
front<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.939> moon<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.750> front<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.049> spica<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
front of moon in front of spica is

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.340 
front of moon in front of spica is
important<00:01:35.400> because<00:01:36.000> Spica<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:36.840> hidden<00:01:37.079> by

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
important because Spica was hidden by

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.580 
important because Spica was hidden by
the<00:01:38.009> moon<00:01:38.220> four<00:01:38.670> times<00:01:39.000> last<00:01:39.299> year<00:01:39.570> which<00:01:39.990> it

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the moon four times last year which it

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.920 
the moon four times last year which it
hadn't<00:01:40.950> been<00:01:40.979> hidden<00:01:41.310> since<00:01:41.720> 1995<00:01:42.720> or

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
hadn't been hidden since 1995 or

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.690 
hadn't been hidden since 1995 or
something<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.829> was<00:01:43.920> hidden<00:01:44.100> four<00:01:44.430> times

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
something so it was hidden four times

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.149 
something so it was hidden four times
making<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.270> pattern<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.750> seven<00:01:46.140> there's<00:01:46.799> one<00:01:46.979> on

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
making a pattern of seven there's one on

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.440 
making a pattern of seven there's one on
one<00:01:47.340> off<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:48.000> off<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.329> had<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
one off one on one off so you had a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.569 
one off one on one off so you had a
pattern<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.960> seven<00:01:49.380> there<00:01:49.590> where<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.159> Spyker

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
pattern of seven there where the Spyker

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.999 
pattern of seven there where the Spyker
hit<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> moon<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.780> you've<00:01:51.990> got<00:01:52.170> seven<00:01:52.770> more

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
hit the moon then you've got seven more

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.940 
hit the moon then you've got seven more
moons<00:01:53.340> which<00:01:53.640> miss<00:01:53.939> spyker<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.530> then<00:01:55.680> this

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
moons which miss spyker so and then this

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.240 
moons which miss spyker so and then this
is<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.369> eighth<00:01:56.610> moon<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.750> Blood<00:01:58.530> Moon<00:01:58.560> so

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
is the eighth moon the the Blood Moon so

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.100 
is the eighth moon the the Blood Moon so
you<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.790> hidings<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.390> Spiker<00:02:00.810> and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
you can see the hidings of Spiker and

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.219 
you can see the hidings of Spiker and
the<00:02:01.950> moon<00:02:02.159> or<00:02:02.399> point<00:02:03.000> towards<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:04.049> moon

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
the moon or point towards this this moon

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.730 
the moon or point towards this this moon
as<00:02:04.409> well<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.930> then<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> sign<00:02:07.560> in

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
as well and then you have the sign in

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.210 
as well and then you have the sign in

of<00:03:30.480> april<00:03:30.900> 2014<00:03:31.859> and<00:03:32.579> they're<00:03:33.569> also<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.440> Virgo

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
of april 2014 and they're also in Virgo

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.280 
of april 2014 and they're also in Virgo
which<00:03:35.100> I<00:03:35.250> think<00:03:35.459> could<00:03:35.609> represent<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.989> two

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
which I think could represent the two
