00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
about our dancing maps and they're very

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.390 
about our dancing maps and they're very
portable<00:00:11.880> their<00:00:12.389> rollout<00:00:13.040> they're<00:00:14.040> made<00:00:14.219> of

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
portable their rollout they're made of

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.420 
portable their rollout they're made of
solid<00:00:14.849> wood<00:00:15.139> that<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.590> thick<00:00:16.859> enough<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.279> be

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
solid wood that is thick enough to be

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.269 
solid wood that is thick enough to be
sanded<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.240> refinished<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:19.109> time<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.920> they

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
sanded and refinished in time so they

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.730 
sanded and refinished in time so they
can<00:00:20.699> last<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.210> virtually<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.840> lifetime<00:00:22.380> and

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
choose to dance and it's made that we

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.030 
choose to dance and it's made that we
can<00:00:29.099> make<00:00:29.429> them<00:00:29.550> out<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.699> any<00:00:29.910> type<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.150> wood

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
can make them out of any type of wood

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.170 
can make them out of any type of wood
the<00:00:32.040> ones<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.489> we're<00:00:32.610> looking<00:00:32.850> at<00:00:32.969> right<00:00:33.149> now

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
the ones that we're looking at right now

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.280 
the ones that we're looking at right now
are<00:00:33.600> oak<00:00:34.130> we<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.430> red<00:00:35.670> oak<00:00:35.820> white<00:00:36.090> oak<00:00:36.290> we

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
are oak we can do red oak white oak we

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.049 
are oak we can do red oak white oak we
do<00:00:37.440> maple<00:00:37.950> Brazilian<00:00:38.610> cherry<00:00:39.800> and<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:41.879> all

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
do maple Brazilian cherry and we do all

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.479 
do maple Brazilian cherry and we do all
kinds<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.420> different<00:00:42.570> species<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.170> they<00:00:43.800> have

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
kinds of different species so they have

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.680 
kinds of different species so they have
a<00:00:44.550> particular<00:00:44.850> wood<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.450> you're<00:00:45.539> really

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
a particular wood that you're really

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.229 
a particular wood that you're really
interested<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.680> can<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.399> maple

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
interested in we can do it in that maple

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.740 
interested in we can do it in that maple
seems<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> best<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.800> sound

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
seems to be the best for sound

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.910 
seems to be the best for sound
resilience<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.410> we're<00:00:52.739> resonance<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:54.920> just

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
resilience and we're resonance and just

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.139 
resilience and we're resonance and just
wanted<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> go<00:00:56.280> through<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.670> show<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
wanted to go through and show you the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.670 
wanted to go through and show you the
size<00:00:57.390> difference<00:00:57.989> because<00:00:58.260> that's<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.620> to

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
size difference because that's going to

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.920 
size difference because that's going to
that's<00:00:59.399> been<00:00:59.550> one<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.940> our<00:01:00.059> biggest<00:01:00.270> questions

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that's been one of our biggest questions

that's been one of our biggest questions
on<00:01:01.230> there's<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.129> three<00:01:02.370> by<00:01:02.520> three<00:01:02.550> big<00:01:03.030> enough

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
on there's a three by three big enough

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.550 
on there's a three by three big enough
to<00:01:03.539> dance<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.559> need<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> four<00:01:05.100> by<00:01:05.220> five<00:01:06.560> so

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
right now we're looking at a three by

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.039 
right now we're looking at a three by
three<00:01:13.490> let<00:01:14.490> me<00:01:14.610> span<00:01:14.970> out<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.720> show<00:01:15.990> you

standard<00:01:38.579> four<00:01:39.090> by<00:01:39.270> five<00:01:40.250> you<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.430> see<00:01:41.670> is

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
standard four by five you can see is

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.980 
standard four by five you can see is
quite<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.689> bit<00:01:42.899> bigger<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:45.090> gives<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.630> much

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
quite a bit bigger and it gives you much

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.090 
quite a bit bigger and it gives you much
more<00:01:46.020> space<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.220> practice<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.950> nice

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
more space to practice on so the nice

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.880 
more space to practice on so the nice
thing<00:01:50.130> about<00:01:50.369> our<00:01:50.610> mats<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.290> put

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
thing about our mats is that you can put

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.649 
thing about our mats is that you can put
them<00:01:52.979> together<00:01:53.130> they're<00:01:53.820> perfectly<00:01:54.270> square

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
them together they're perfectly square

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.560 
them together they're perfectly square
and<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.770> you've<00:01:56.610> got<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.790> three<00:01:57.060> by<00:01:57.270> three

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and so if you've got a three by three

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.209 
and so if you've got a three by three
and<00:01:57.600> decided<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.290> wasn't<00:01:58.500> big<00:01:58.740> enough<00:01:58.979> and

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
and decided that wasn't big enough and

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.990 
and decided that wasn't big enough and
you<00:01:59.610> wanted<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> get<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> couple<00:02:00.479> more<00:02:00.659> then

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
you wanted to get a couple more then

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.290 
you wanted to get a couple more then
and<00:02:02.090> suddenly<00:02:02.330> you've<00:02:02.630> got<00:02:02.660> a<00:02:02.930> 9x9<00:02:04.150> I'm<00:02:05.150> going

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
and suddenly you've got a 9x9 I'm going

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.810 
and suddenly you've got a 9x9 I'm going
to<00:02:05.360> go<00:02:05.450> ahead<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:05.810> roll<00:02:06.020> out<00:02:06.050> a<00:02:06.490> another<00:02:07.490> four

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
to go ahead and roll out a another four

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.400 
to go ahead and roll out a another four
