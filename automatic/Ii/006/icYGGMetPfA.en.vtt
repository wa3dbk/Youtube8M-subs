we're<00:00:36.210> maximizing<00:00:36.540> flow<00:00:37.020> into<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.309> Pearl

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
we're maximizing flow into the the Pearl

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.590 
we're maximizing flow into the the Pearl
star<00:00:38.820> 900<00:00:39.270> engine<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.680> this

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
star 900 engine so we have this

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.870 
star 900 engine so we have this

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
resonator box starting with that the air

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.319 
resonator box starting with that the air
comes<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:46.379> reducing<00:00:46.829> noise<00:00:47.329> intake

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329

malanez<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> operator<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.500> also<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
malanez to the operator but it also is a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.819 
malanez to the operator but it also is a
big<00:00:50.239> it's<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.329> buffer<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.930> know<00:00:52.500> where<00:00:52.649> there's

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
big it's a buffer you know where there's

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.410 
big it's a buffer you know where there's
a<00:00:52.890> big<00:00:53.100> volume<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.550> air<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:53.969> ready<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.270> go

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
a big volume of air here ready to go

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.260 
a big volume of air here ready to go
into<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> engine<00:00:58.039> large<00:00:59.039> tube<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.910> don't

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
into the engine large tube so you don't

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.330 
into the engine large tube so you don't
have<00:01:00.360> any<00:01:00.739> restrictions<00:01:01.739> getting<00:01:02.039> into<00:01:02.219> your

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
have any restrictions getting into your

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.639 
have any restrictions getting into your
air<00:01:02.520> box<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.079> large

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
air box and then we have this large

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.800 
air box and then we have this large
panel<00:01:05.249> air<00:01:05.429> filter<00:01:05.789> it's<00:01:05.999> the<00:01:06.060> same<00:01:06.270> filter

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
panel air filter it's the same filter

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.109 
panel air filter it's the same filter
media<00:01:07.139> that<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.439> developed<00:01:07.829> for<00:01:07.889> razer<00:01:08.219> but<00:01:08.999> it

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
media that we developed for razer but it

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.139 
media that we developed for razer but it
has<00:01:09.240> 90%<00:01:09.959> more<00:01:10.229> surface<00:01:10.649> area<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.039> you<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.279> it

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
has 90% more surface area so you can it

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.760 
has 90% more surface area so you can it
matches<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> higher<00:01:12.840> performance<00:01:13.049> engine

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
matches the higher performance engine

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.980 
matches the higher performance engine
but<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:13.979> even<00:01:14.159> goes<00:01:14.279> beyond<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.149> and<00:01:15.539> that's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
but it even goes beyond so and that's

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.359 
but it even goes beyond so and that's
what<00:01:16.109> you<00:01:16.200> want<00:01:16.439> at<00:01:16.560> an<00:01:16.679> off-road<00:01:17.099> vehicle

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
what you want at an off-road vehicle

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.429 
what you want at an off-road vehicle
where<00:01:17.939> you're<00:01:18.090> you're<00:01:18.599> drawing<00:01:18.899> sand<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.349> so

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
where you're you're drawing sand and so

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.730 
where you're you're drawing sand and so
it<00:01:19.499> keeps<00:01:19.619> your<00:01:19.859> engine<00:01:19.950> clean<00:01:21.499> and<00:01:22.499> then<00:01:22.649> it

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
it keeps your engine clean and then it

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.139 
it keeps your engine clean and then it
goes<00:01:22.859> directly<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.490> see<00:01:23.609> the<00:01:23.729> trumpets

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
goes directly you can see the trumpets

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.800 
goes directly you can see the trumpets
here<00:01:24.829> going<00:01:25.829> into<00:01:26.039> the<00:01:26.130> dual<00:01:26.659> throttle<00:01:27.659> body

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
here going into the dual throttle body

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.889 
here going into the dual throttle body

46 millimeter bore throttle body located

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.659 
46 millimeter bore throttle body located
right<00:01:31.049> next<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.529> head<00:01:31.709> it's<00:01:32.219> out<00:01:32.429> from<00:01:32.579> a

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:32.669 
right next to the head it's out from a

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:33.980 
right next to the head it's out from a
place<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.149> that<00:01:33.270> throttle<00:01:33.450> body<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:33.899> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
place to have that throttle body so you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.989 
place to have that throttle body so you
get<00:01:34.109> that<00:01:34.289> that<00:01:34.590> snap<00:01:34.950> fast<00:01:35.340> response<00:01:35.759> when

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:35.999 
get that that snap fast response when

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:38.910 
get that that snap fast response when
you<00:01:36.119> punches<00:01:36.810> accelerator<00:01:37.289> than<00:01:37.499> Florida

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
you punches accelerator than Florida

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.200 
you punches accelerator than Florida
they're<00:01:39.920> similar<00:01:40.160> high-performance<00:01:40.970> shocks

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
they're similar high-performance shocks

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.690 
they're similar high-performance shocks
the<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.200> difference<00:01:42.500> there's<00:01:42.740> Fox<00:01:43.070> podium<00:01:43.580> X

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
the the difference there's Fox podium X

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.510 
the the difference there's Fox podium X
2.0<00:01:44.150> shocks<00:01:44.480> but<00:01:45.440> you<00:01:45.590> do<00:01:45.800> have<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:45.950> dual<00:01:46.190> rate

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
2.0 shocks but you do have a dual rate

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.030 
2.0 shocks but you do have a dual rate
spring<00:01:46.970> in<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.450> back<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.230> it<00:01:48.320> has<00:01:48.440> 14<00:01:48.830> inches

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
you spread up your mounting points so

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.510 
you spread up your mounting points so
you're<00:02:33.290> able<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.560> transfer<00:02:34.010> those<00:02:34.160> loads<00:02:34.370> from

into<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.090> frame<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.350> it's<00:02:39.500> strong<00:02:39.890> and

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340

the<00:02:40.490> other<00:02:40.610> thing<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:40.910> does<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:41.270> by<00:02:41.590> moving<00:02:42.590> the
