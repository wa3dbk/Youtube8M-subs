00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
spinner female and I want to breed her

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.860 
spinner female and I want to breed her
actually<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.390> lesser<00:02:27.430> hostile<00:02:28.430> now

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
actually to the lesser hostile now

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.620 
actually to the lesser hostile now
that's<00:02:29.870> kind<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.550> little<00:02:31.550> insight<00:02:32.090> into<00:02:32.120> my

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
that's kind of a little insight into my

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.560 
that's kind of a little insight into my
breeding<00:02:33.020> plan<00:02:33.320> I<00:02:33.770> guess<00:02:34.070> for<00:02:34.370> them<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.910> then

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
breeding plan I guess for them and then

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.480 
breeding plan I guess for them and then
hopefully<00:02:35.660> make<00:02:36.020> some<00:02:36.230> Queen<00:02:36.530> spin<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.370> it

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
hopefully make some Queen spin so it

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.830 
hopefully make some Queen spin so it
