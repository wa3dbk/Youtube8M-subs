show you it's about the method of how I
apply<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.239> makes<00:02:12.450> this<00:02:12.659> look<00:02:12.900> natural<00:02:13.560> so

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890

have a pump--ow foundation on my hand

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.710 
have a pump--ow foundation on my hand
instead<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.010> using<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.549> flat<00:02:17.849> top<00:02:18.150> brush<00:02:18.209> which

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
instead of using a flat top brush which

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.809 
instead of using a flat top brush which
is<00:02:18.930> one<00:02:19.799> of<00:02:19.830> my<00:02:19.980> favorite<00:02:20.340> methods<00:02:20.700> of

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
is one of my favorite methods of

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.660 
is one of my favorite methods of
applying<00:02:21.120> foundation<00:02:21.540> but<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.440> find<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.430> it's

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
applying foundation but I find that it's

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.819 
applying foundation but I find that it's
more<00:02:23.909> full<00:02:24.390> coverage<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.409> want<00:02:25.650> something

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829

light so instead of that I'm going to

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.850 
light so instead of that I'm going to

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
on an everyday basis it's just not

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.630 
on an everyday basis it's just not
comfortable<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:10.420> wear<00:03:10.770> so<00:03:11.770> even<00:03:12.220> though<00:03:12.250> like

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
comfortable to wear so even though like

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.339 
comfortable to wear so even though like
this<00:03:12.910> is<00:03:12.970> not<00:03:13.270> completely<00:03:13.630> concealed<00:03:14.050> and

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
this is not completely concealed and

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.290 
this is not completely concealed and
things<00:03:14.770> are<00:03:14.950> not<00:03:15.130> completely<00:03:15.489> concealed<00:03:15.940> this

things are not completely concealed this

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.630 
things are not completely concealed this
is<00:03:16.450> usually<00:03:16.630> what<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.020> would<00:03:17.230> do<00:03:17.440> coverage<00:03:18.400> wise

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
is usually what I would do coverage wise

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.940 
is usually what I would do coverage wise
because<00:03:19.120> it's<00:03:19.270> light<00:03:19.569> and<00:03:19.870> it's<00:03:20.319> comfortable

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
because it's light and it's comfortable

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.380 
because it's light and it's comfortable
on<00:03:21.160> my<00:03:21.280> skin<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:21.700> that's<00:03:21.790> kind<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.120> what<00:03:22.239> I'm

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
on my skin and that's kind of what I'm

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.090 
on my skin and that's kind of what I'm
more<00:03:22.630> concerned<00:03:22.870> about<00:03:23.110> like<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.890> this

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
more concerned about like is this

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.440

very vibrant in that area so I'm just

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.550 
very vibrant in that area so I'm just
going<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.090> take<00:05:39.240> a<00:05:39.300> lipstick<00:05:39.690> something

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.960 
going to take a lipstick something
natural<00:05:40.950> something<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.340> doesn't<00:05:41.640> look<00:05:41.670> like

in class and try to enjoy myself and

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.420 
in class and try to enjoy myself and
then<00:06:06.930> this<00:06:07.080> way<00:06:07.259> I<00:06:07.289> don't<00:06:07.439> look<00:06:07.830> like<00:06:07.889> I

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
then this way I don't look like I

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.070 
then this way I don't look like I
strolled<00:06:09.029> out<00:06:09.120> of<00:06:09.300> bed<00:06:09.449> but<00:06:09.629> at<00:06:09.689> the<00:06:09.749> same<00:06:09.930> time

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
strolled out of bed but at the same time

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.439 
strolled out of bed but at the same time
it's<00:06:10.409> not<00:06:10.650> like<00:06:10.800> I<00:06:10.889> put<00:06:11.129> a<00:06:11.400> craft<00:06:11.879> of<00:06:12.029> effort<00:06:12.360> in

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
it's not like I put a craft of effort in

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:13.790 
it's not like I put a craft of effort in
because<00:06:12.689> in<00:06:12.930> reality<00:06:13.080> I<00:06:13.379> just<00:06:13.469> don't<00:06:13.770> have

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
because in reality I just don't have

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.790 
because in reality I just don't have
time<00:06:14.069> so<00:06:14.729> this<00:06:14.999> is<00:06:15.120> it<00:06:15.300> and<00:06:15.599> that's<00:06:16.560> basically

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
time so this is it and that's basically

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.429 
time so this is it and that's basically
what<00:06:17.189> I<00:06:17.219> wear<00:06:17.460> for<00:06:17.789> my<00:06:18.090> school<00:06:18.449> every<00:06:19.020> day<00:06:19.050> and
