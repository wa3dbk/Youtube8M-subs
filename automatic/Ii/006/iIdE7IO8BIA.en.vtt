00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.259
 Well, hello today, someday I'll get to know more about her process 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.349
 Let me see. 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:14.269
 There's one cell in the air. 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:18.710
 Cells will grow to a certain extent and grow larger. 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:24.349
 But just not just doing the field, it's the same genetic blister . 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:29.960
 Because I have to have it, I caught it during my first cold in the short term, and I have this nucleus . 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:35.900
 Slip inside the nucleus of the cell nucleus that is dyed yarns with genetic material 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:41.780
 This is how the welfare is divided into four before dyeing . 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.500
 And we double the chromosomes of this dyed cloth, double the amount of certain substances and welfare 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.060
 I will. 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:52.670
 ' Cause it's divided into two, first cold. 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:57.240
 When colds are more nuclei of cells showing staining and bought in the nucleus 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:02.460
 Duplicating the genetic material by a factor of 5 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:06.660
 Now, in the case of electricity, four types of dyes are compressed and condensed 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:11.670
 Now that I'm twisted, I'm starting to make a chromosome . 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.320
 Anyhow, the dyed buds are now twisted, twisted, twisted , 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.810
 I'll make it . 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.340
 Learn to color now Dust like this is a chromosome branch It's just in our body 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.420
 There are 40 units. 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.140
 I am now . Only you once made me. 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.440
 And this dyed powder, the child chromosome. 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:37.830
 I'm so is while each penny overdue 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:41.610
 Two of them are not international , so this chromosome is the same as this dyed fan . 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:47.550
 We have this same problem and we have a waist belt 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:52.500
 As it is called , the central part of this chromosome is called the mobilization body . 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.450
 So uh, like a belt doengeot'll do that from the middle of example, 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.300
 uh 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.040
 The'm feeling chromosomes appear earlier and now are gradually showing more Porch 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:08.840
 It's disappearing. 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:13.340
 And the arrest is starting to show up like a net on both sides of the party. 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:18.920
 Oh, I'm electric electricity chromosomes v Security 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:26.170
 The tangs disappear and the rosary comes out on both sides. 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.170
 Now after that time, then the battery mid middle. Very weapons 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.650
 Now ready to go beyond the language in the city is dyed by the holding room Chusa 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.110
 They're central. 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:43.150
 There is no line in the middle of the word. 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.520
 I have to give it in the middle 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:51.580
 It's really a lot to kill. 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:57.700
 Here And Now ilgibang Chusa differences are mobilized's shares dye waist 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:02.680
 Yes well I've stuck to the left side of jewel-party saenggyeotdeon so loose parts are left 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.020
 It is connected to the body parts of the body like a switch to fill Ah Handcuffs 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.020
 I was different. 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:12.900
 Ah 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:18.540
 The characteristics of Lee Lee Jun Ki are that the uro - chromosomes are centered on the line 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.980
 Steps that we can best observe the existence of chromosomes through cooperation 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.550
 I will move on. 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:29.019
 Now, after you passed the road, 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:34.569
 Later in the past 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:39.910
 For example by mobilizing've tied the West while Chusa by Gentile Chusa 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.989
 They 're dragging them on the other side like this. 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:47.010
 Despite 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:49.690
 Now, now that the chromosomes have been divided into their respective pennies, 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.349
 I'm going to be dragged. Cherry 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.560
 Debts attracted to Asian deliberations 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:59.890
 I can get through to the end with the streaming sound . 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:05.380
 Further chromosome by HOT Rosa de 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:11.080
 But the debts are drawn to the other side. 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:16.320
 After 2 Late Wow Then After Now Late 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:19.709
 Oh, I'll think about it. 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.340
 4 Yes, when I know. 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.820
 Each of the smell bodies got attracted to me like this. 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.820
 On the other side 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.370
 These opportunities were dragged to the other side between the chambers 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.750
 Yeah. Late in the afternoon. 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:53.729
 At the end of the dyes, 7 , 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:58.410
 I 'll cry like this, yeah. 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:03.350
 As usual, the chromosomes are promoted in this way, and they are released in four dyes. 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:07.199
 So I used to search the color of the color of the silicate powder so I use it like this 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:10.830
 And then it starts to work out little by little. 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:13.620
 Then the dyes are here. 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:18.539
 HOT politics ever buying disappears 5 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:22.470
 And uh party or nucleus of the cell 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:28.620
 These two of the pack yards are normal. 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:34.949
 In the center, the cell wall is wiped from the center in the central part of the cell 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:37.349
 So that one cell of the tax law now has two rooms 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:42.660
 It's divided into two drops . 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:48.060
 So one more chef is divided into two. 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:55.550
 At the end of the cycle, the chromosomes that were present in the chromosomes were loosened, 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:06:01.830
 And when the nucleus is reborn and there is a cell wall in the center of the cell 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:03.000
 While animation is a process that is one cell into two jindamyeon addressed 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.800
 Things should be big again. 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.669
 They want to go out and eventually grow bigger again . This is the arrest . 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.090
 The course 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.120
 I will. 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.120
 5
