what situations they want to use this
deficient<00:00:12.660> anybody<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.259> drop<00:00:13.559> shots<00:00:13.830> for

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
deficient anybody that drop shots for

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.460 
deficient anybody that drop shots for
bass<00:00:14.250> or<00:00:14.580> walleye<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.480> ideal<00:00:15.900> saltwater

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470

bass or walleye this is ideal saltwater
guys<00:00:16.740> do<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:18.150> certain<00:00:18.510> species<00:00:18.720> but

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
guys do it on certain species but

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.990 
guys do it on certain species but
basically<00:00:19.619> what<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.070> does<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.640> allow<00:00:20.939> you

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
basically what this does is allow you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.040 
basically what this does is allow you
360<00:00:21.930> degree<00:00:22.230> rotation<00:00:22.680> or<00:00:23.130> axis<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.150> your<00:00:24.779> hook

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
360 degree rotation or axis of your hook

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.529 
360 degree rotation or axis of your hook
on<00:00:25.529> your<00:00:25.590> main<00:00:25.949> line<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.580> prevents<00:00:26.939> line<00:00:27.180> twist

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
on your main line it prevents line twist

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.330 
on your main line it prevents line twist
which<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.900> huge<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.590> deeper<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.039> fish

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
which is huge the deeper you fish

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.030 
which is huge the deeper you fish
anybody<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.300> drop<00:00:30.750> shots<00:00:31.050> knows<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.830> lime

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
anybody that drop shots knows that lime

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.770 
anybody that drop shots knows that lime
twist<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.460> an<00:00:32.579> issue<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.329> other<00:00:33.480> thing<00:00:33.540> it

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
twist is an issue and the other thing it

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.090 
twist is an issue and the other thing it
does<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.110> makes<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.530> bait<00:00:34.739> look<00:00:34.920> more

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
does is it makes the bait look more

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.280 
does is it makes the bait look more
natural<00:00:35.520> because<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.940> hook<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.290> actually

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
natural because the hook is actually

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.889 
natural because the hook is actually
moving<00:00:37.739> from<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.430> main<00:00:38.610> line<00:00:38.850> whereas<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.780> a

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
moving from the main line whereas on a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.709 
moving from the main line whereas on a
traditional<00:00:40.590> drop<00:00:40.950> shot<00:00:41.190> rig<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:42.390> hook<00:00:42.600> is

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
traditional drop shot rig the hook is

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.360 
traditional drop shot rig the hook is
stationary<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.829> there's<00:00:43.950> not<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> lot<00:00:44.340> of

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
stationary so there's not a lot of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.709 
stationary so there's not a lot of
movement<00:00:44.730> at<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.850> head<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.329> way<00:00:45.539> this

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
movement at the head this way this

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.900 
movement at the head this way this
allows<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.230> bait<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.530> undulate<00:00:47.010> from<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
allows the bait to undulate from the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.279 
allows the bait to undulate from the
head<00:00:48.090> all<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.300> way<00:00:48.390> through<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> tail<00:00:48.960> right

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
head all the way through the tail right

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.560 
head all the way through the tail right
so<00:00:49.739> if<00:00:50.250> you're<00:00:50.399> fishing<00:00:50.520> deep<00:00:50.789> retrieving

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
so if you're fishing deep retrieving

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.819 
so if you're fishing deep retrieving
your<00:00:51.600> bait<00:00:51.899> you're<00:00:52.289> not<00:00:52.410> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
your bait you're not going to have the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.639 
your bait you're not going to have the
line<00:00:53.640> twist<00:00:53.969> issues<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.750> you're<00:00:54.870> confronted

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
line twist issues that you're confronted

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.319 
line twist issues that you're confronted
with normally<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.640> best<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> show<00:00:57.210> in

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
with normally and one best to show in

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.569 
with normally and one best to show in
its<00:00:57.449> category<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.050> icast<00:00:58.469> show<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.340> this

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
its category at the icast show so this

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.990 
its category at the icast show so this
is<00:00:59.760> an<00:01:00.079> extra<00:01:01.079> layer<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.379> finesse<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.609> finesse

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
is an extra layer of finesse for finesse

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.299 
is an extra layer of finesse for finesse
tactic<00:01:03.780> that's<00:01:03.930> well<00:01:04.199> put<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.710> couldn't<00:01:05.100> say<00:01:05.220> it

you<00:01:54.340> can<00:01:54.460> still<00:01:54.700> salvage<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.270> rig<00:01:55.510> because

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
you can still salvage the rig because

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.290 
you can still salvage the rig because
it's<00:01:56.680> on<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.860> lighter<00:01:57.160> line<00:01:57.400> generally<00:01:57.910> and

it's on a lighter line generally and
that's<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:58.780> advantage<00:01:58.960> of<00:01:59.170> this<00:01:59.290> on<00:01:59.830> a

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
that's the advantage of this on a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
the drop shot weight itself this allows

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.190 
the drop shot weight itself this allows
you<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.460> have<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.610> heavier<00:02:13.060> main<00:02:13.330> line<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:14.110> a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
you to have a heavier main line and a

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.530 
you to have a heavier main line and a
lighter<00:02:14.440> leader<00:02:15.130> with<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.760> weight<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.300> if<00:02:16.420> you

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
lighter leader with the weight so if you

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.910 
lighter leader with the weight so if you
do<00:02:16.690> get<00:02:16.870> hung<00:02:17.050> up<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.350> can<00:02:17.470> break<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.740> leader

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
do get hung up you can break the leader

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.710 
do get hung up you can break the leader
loose<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.700> save<00:02:19.060> some<00:02:19.240> money<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.600> way
