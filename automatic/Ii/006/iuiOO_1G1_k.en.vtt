00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
can see it's working really well night

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.960 
can see it's working really well night
it<00:02:13.450> reads<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.350> data<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.160> if<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.370> have<00:02:15.580> atom

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
it reads the data so if you have atom

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.630 
it reads the data so if you have atom
other<00:02:16.300> devices<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:17.230> mean<00:02:17.500> if<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:18.130> have<00:02:18.310> what<00:02:18.489> if

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
other devices I mean if you have what if

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.600 
other devices I mean if you have what if
you<00:02:18.760> drive<00:02:18.970> which<00:02:19.270> can<00:02:19.540> detect<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:20.370> USB<00:02:21.370> Drive

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
you drive which can detect a USB Drive

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.690 
you drive which can detect a USB Drive
so<00:02:22.060> then<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:22.750> can<00:02:22.900> insert<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.890> into<00:02:24.130> moto<00:02:24.400> G

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
so then you can insert this into moto G

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.270 
so then you can insert this into moto G
and<00:02:24.970> access<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.630> USB<00:02:25.989> drives<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:26.950> can<00:02:27.130> be

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
and access the USB drives so it can be

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.910 
and access the USB drives so it can be
any<00:02:27.400> external<00:02:27.870> drive<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:29.050> can<00:02:29.080> be<00:02:29.380> accessed<00:02:29.739> on

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
any external drive it can be accessed on

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.820 
any external drive it can be accessed on
Moto<00:02:30.850> G<00:02:31.150> using<00:02:31.330> OTG<00:02:31.989> functionality<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:32.650> right

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
Moto G using OTG functionality so right

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.650
