00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.600 
which such quality that you really don't
care<00:01:39.409> it's<00:01:40.409> set<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> world<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.369> set<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
care it's set the world up it set the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.940 
care it's set the world up it set the
characters<00:01:42.180> up<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:43.409> gave<00:01:43.740> us<00:01:43.920> something

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
characters up and it gave us something

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.789 
characters up and it gave us something
to<00:01:44.369> hold<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.119> when<00:01:45.840> all<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> action<00:01:46.560> scenes

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
to hold on to when all the action scenes

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.340 
to hold on to when all the action scenes
get<00:01:47.159> then<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.759> relationship<00:01:48.360> stuff<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.780> done

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
get then the relationship stuff is done

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.520 
get then the relationship stuff is done
so<00:01:49.880> realistically<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.840> truthfully

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
so realistically and and so truthfully

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.350 
so realistically and and so truthfully
and<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.040> feel<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.460> action<00:01:53.909> scenes<00:01:54.149> were

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and I feel like the action scenes were

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.469 
and I feel like the action scenes were
done<00:01:54.630> very<00:01:55.320> well<00:01:55.470> yeah<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.909> action<00:01:57.299> always

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
done very well yeah the action always

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.179 
done very well yeah the action always
made<00:01:57.659> sense<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.259> hate<00:01:58.500> those<00:01:58.649> scenes<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:58.950> movies

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
made sense I hate those scenes in movies

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.499 
made sense I hate those scenes in movies
where<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.430> two<00:01:59.610> characters<00:01:59.969> Phi<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.390> then

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
where the two characters Phi and then

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.330 
where the two characters Phi and then
one<00:02:00.659> runs<00:02:00.840> away<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.740> they<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.009> fight<00:02:02.189> later

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
one runs away so they can fight later

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.859 
one runs away so they can fight later
I've<00:02:02.579> never<00:02:02.729> happens<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.630> always

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
I've never happens in it but it always

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.139 
I've never happens in it but it always
seems<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.500> make<00:02:04.740> sense<00:02:04.799> yeah<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
seems to make sense yeah but the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.930 
seems to make sense yeah but the
mythology<00:02:06.810> aspects<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.560> idea<00:02:08.039> basically<00:02:08.220> how

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
mythology aspects the idea basically how

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.449 
mythology aspects the idea basically how
spider-man<00:02:09.599> becomes<00:02:09.929> spider-man<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
spider-man becomes spider-man the the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.369 
spider-man becomes spider-man the the
spider<00:02:11.790> bite<00:02:12.030> stuff<00:02:12.360> we've<00:02:12.750> seen<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.050> so

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
spider bite stuff we've seen that so

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.620 
spider bite stuff we've seen that so
many

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
many

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.270 
many
but<00:02:13.990> that's<00:02:14.110> part<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.470> cannon<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:15.010> feels

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
but that's part of the cannon it feels

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.980 
but that's part of the cannon it feels
like<00:02:15.430> they're<00:02:15.640> having<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.300> force<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.660> in<00:02:16.780> like

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
like they're having to force it in like

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.720 
like they're having to force it in like
that<00:02:17.020> if<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.350> wasn't<00:02:17.560> spider-man<00:02:18.310> if<00:02:18.580> they

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
that if it wasn't spider-man if they

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.610 
that if it wasn't spider-man if they
didn't<00:02:19.000> have<00:02:19.210> this<00:02:19.390> franchise<00:02:19.870> they<00:02:20.050> had<00:02:20.350> to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
didn't have this franchise they had to

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.440 
didn't have this franchise they had to
follow<00:02:20.830> maybe<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.670> lot<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.090> things<00:02:22.270> would

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
follow maybe a lot of the things would

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.060 
follow maybe a lot of the things would
have<00:02:22.570> been<00:02:22.600> different<00:02:22.690> it's<00:02:23.620> almost<00:02:23.830> as<00:02:24.010> if

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
have been different it's almost as if

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.410 
have been different it's almost as if

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
think that's 2 marc webb the director of

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.470 
think that's 2 marc webb the director of
creating<00:04:08.950> absolutely<00:04:09.640> had<00:04:09.760> done<00:04:09.880> 500<00:04:10.120> days<00:04:10.420> of

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
creating absolutely had done 500 days of

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.850 
creating absolutely had done 500 days of
summer<00:04:10.600> and<00:04:11.050> all<00:04:11.350> of<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.500> relationship

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
summer and all of that relationship

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.800 
summer and all of that relationship
stuff<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.610> he<00:04:12.700> learned<00:04:12.940> about<00:04:13.060> in<00:04:13.300> 500<00:04:13.780> days

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
stuff that he learned about in 500 days

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.480 
stuff that he learned about in 500 days
you<00:04:14.020> could<00:04:14.170> see<00:04:14.350> it<00:04:14.470> translated<00:04:14.950> right<00:04:15.220> here

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.670 
you could see it translated right here
and<00:04:15.670> i<00:04:15.910> think<00:04:16.090> it's<00:04:16.209> because<00:04:16.330> he<00:04:16.780> allows<00:04:17.170> for

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
and i think it's because he allows for

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.979 
and i think it's because he allows for
many<00:04:17.980> small<00:04:18.549> character<00:04:19.000> moments<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.690> and

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
many small character moments and and

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.150 
many small character moments and and
that<00:04:20.170> happens<00:04:20.440> with<00:04:20.530> all<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.770> supporting
