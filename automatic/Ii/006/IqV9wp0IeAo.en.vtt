planet<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.850> think<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.480> didgeridoo<00:00:24.689> an

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
Australian Aboriginal instrument is

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.470 
Australian Aboriginal instrument is
probably<00:00:27.900> about<00:00:28.019> as<00:00:28.199> close<00:00:28.699> of<00:00:29.699> sound<00:00:30.090> as<00:00:30.359> you

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
probably about as close of sound as you

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.490 
probably about as close of sound as you
can<00:00:30.599> get<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.830> kind<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.099> thing<00:00:33.230> it's<00:00:34.230> huge

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
can get to this kind of thing it's huge

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.319 
can get to this kind of thing it's huge
and<00:00:35.399> heavy<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:37.399> it's<00:00:38.399> good<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.760> recording<00:00:39.090> I

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and heavy and it's good for recording I

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.530 
and heavy and it's good for recording I
think<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.629> some<00:00:39.809> people<00:00:40.079> even<00:00:40.200> call<00:00:40.320> it

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
think that some people even call it

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.240 
think that some people even call it
called<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> harmonica<00:00:43.260> recording<00:00:43.860> king<00:00:44.040> or

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
something like that I don't know but

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.690 
something like that I don't know but
it's<00:00:46.410> good<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:46.680> freaky<00:00:47.010> sounds<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.640> know

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
armonica that's a major uh I see I think

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.740 
armonica that's a major uh I see I think
it<00:03:04.530> was<00:03:04.650> um<00:03:05.130> so<00:03:06.120> if<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.269> get<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.420> little<00:03:06.630> group

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
it was um so if you get a little group

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.810 
it was um so if you get a little group
going<00:03:07.019> on<00:03:07.140> it's<00:03:08.100> not<00:03:08.310> like<00:03:08.430> you're<00:03:08.549> gonna<00:03:08.670> do

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
any solos with this thing it's an

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.340 
any solos with this thing it's an
underlying<00:03:10.640> bassline<00:03:11.640> kind<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.269> you<00:03:12.810> could<00:03:13.230> do

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
underlying bassline kind of you could do

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.020 
underlying bassline kind of you could do
this<00:03:13.470> actually<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:14.010> mimic<00:03:14.340> your<00:03:14.430> baseline<00:03:14.820> for
