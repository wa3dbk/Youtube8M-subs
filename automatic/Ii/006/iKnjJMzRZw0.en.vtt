anything that gets into your water tank

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.990 
anything that gets into your water tank
will<00:02:09.239> be<00:02:09.420> captured<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.319> filter<00:02:11.039> prior<00:02:11.730> to

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
will be captured in that filter prior to

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.400 
will be captured in that filter prior to
getting<00:02:12.150> into<00:02:12.480> your<00:02:12.750> pond

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
getting into your pond

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.350 
getting into your pond
here<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.830> what<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.250> reason<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.000> we<00:02:15.150> do<00:02:15.330> that

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
here and what the reason that we do that

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.450 
here and what the reason that we do that
is<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:16.020> any<00:02:16.200> debris<00:02:16.500> were<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.860> get<00:02:17.040> into<00:02:17.280> there

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
is if any debris were to get into there

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.850 
is if any debris were to get into there
it<00:02:17.700> could<00:02:18.210> potentially<00:02:18.540> damage<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.260> pump<00:02:19.410> so

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
it could potentially damage the pump so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.050 
it could potentially damage the pump so
what<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:20.130> going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.400> do<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:20.670> it's<00:02:20.820> going<00:02:20.880> to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
what it's going to do is it's going to

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.760 
what it's going to do is it's going to
allow<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.480> have<00:02:21.660> years<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.260> years<00:02:22.440> and
