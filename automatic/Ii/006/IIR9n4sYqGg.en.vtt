 power nozzle to remove the fuse one 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.140
 piece of yarn this wire here personal 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.659
 You'll get a hair that you're welcome. 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.580
 well fininho will put if the whole just goes 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.350
 take only one hair of his to put 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.570
 in place of the fuse for once was the 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.720
 fuse that burned right 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.820
 you can leave but you can leave 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.979
 advise you to use the fuse you can 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.409
 replaced by a fuse of the same 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.390
 if in another block of super nintendo or 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.310
 may be placing a glass fuse 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.250
 of an average atari that will give the same 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.229
 same thing 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.509
 clothes wear here for me to remove 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.290
 exclusive game 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:06.970
 so let's get the support we're going to take 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:17.530
 paraded outside you'll warm up pulling 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:19.980
 up with the tong intoned ready and 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.980
 died 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:33.000
 I'll be back here, remove fuse now. 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.060
 here at the very end 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.740
 I'm going to get it, I have only one hair that does not 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:44.330
 I did well, I just went to the end of the day. 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.330
 that you used the staff 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.800
 depending on the yarn you use 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.820
 this one is so thin 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.530
 I believe it is even weaker than 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:16.880
 an antero and mail fuse 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:20.760
 I'm from the team already soldier 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.550
 Make it clear to you, people have 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.840
 there is no advice on how to 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.549
 none 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.670
 're doing it who what I already 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:36.410
 I've done it a few times, I've only used this 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.930
 and I already had a problem too . 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.959
 No problem with wire 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:47.760
 delma in short and the thread broke 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:52.290
 as if it were a fuse normally the 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.480
 people want but it 's there they end up agreeing 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.739
 with us but I'm here to help or 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.350
 fully 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.900
 already happened to me from the movie break 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.170
 usually like a rifle 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.019
 I said the ideal is to exchange beauty 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:12.570
 I love you. 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:14.570
 fuse but for test purposes in the 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.799
 ov 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.989
 coming back here the device already attack 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.390
 on the tv let's call him to see if 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:27.140
 it will work 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:33.480
 ai personal beauty under fire fuse same 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:37.080
 well in that case I have a plaque 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.850
 the withdrawal of parts in my store and I 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.950
 replace an original fuse of 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.020
 But as I said, you can use the 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.330
 of glass and an earlier half-year 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.510
 in the good option that will not work at all 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.810
 I hope you enjoyed the tip is coming 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.500
 a couple there join my channel 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.500
