a<00:00:12.320> journey<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.740> know<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.309> learn<00:00:14.519> something

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
a journey you know you learn something

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.720 
a journey you know you learn something
every<00:00:15.450> time<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.690> make<00:00:15.960> an<00:00:16.139> album<00:00:16.430> and<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.520> think

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
every time you make an album and I think

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.170 
every time you make an album and I think
we<00:00:18.000> learned<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.480> most<00:00:19.010> making<00:00:20.010> danger<00:00:20.699> days

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
we learned the most making danger days

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.359 
we learned the most making danger days
it's<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.480> record<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:21.900> made<00:00:22.080> twice<00:00:22.410> creatively

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
it's a record we made twice creatively

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.310 
it's a record we made twice creatively
the<00:00:23.490> process<00:00:23.939> was<00:00:24.150> just<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.449> very<00:00:24.810> big

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the process was just a very big

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.290 
the process was just a very big
undertaking<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.490> was<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.789> most<00:00:26.970> fun<00:00:27.240> I

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
undertaking but it was the most fun I

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.500 
undertaking but it was the most fun I
ever<00:00:27.539> had<00:00:27.869> doing<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.439> record<00:00:28.619> easily<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.730> it

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
ever had doing a record easily and it

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.810 
ever had doing a record easily and it
was<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> most<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.289> tune<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.769> think<00:00:32.040> mentally<00:00:32.669> we

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
was the most in tune I think mentally we

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.240 
was the most in tune I think mentally we
all<00:00:33.000> were<00:00:33.239> at<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.320> same<00:00:34.530> moment<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.160> it

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
all were at the same moment and it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.530 
all were at the same moment and it
shouldn't<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.640> been<00:00:35.790> cuz<00:00:36.180> we've<00:00:36.329> gone

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
shouldn't have been cuz we've gone

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.229 
shouldn't have been cuz we've gone
through<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.020> much<00:00:37.230> right<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:38.040> somehow<00:00:38.940> it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
through so much right but somehow it

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.060 
through so much right but somehow it
just<00:00:39.270> ended<00:00:39.660> up<00:00:39.809> working<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.440> our<00:00:40.559> favor<00:00:40.590> I

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
just ended up working in our favor I

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.310 
just ended up working in our favor I
think<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:42.180> work<00:00:42.360> best<00:00:42.750> when<00:00:42.960> we're<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
think we work best when we're the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.760 
think we work best when we're the
underdog<00:00:43.710> yeah<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.750> don't<00:00:46.379> know<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:46.620> we

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
again because you know we have to be

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.480 
again because you know we have to be
even<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.320> much<00:01:34.500> more<00:01:34.560> underdogs<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.220> became

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
even that much more underdogs it became

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.999 
even that much more underdogs it became
exponentially<00:01:36.180> harder<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.259> longer<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.860> were

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
exponentially harder the longer we were

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.350 
exponentially harder the longer we were
taking<00:01:38.340> making<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.670> record<00:01:38.880> where<00:01:39.090> was<00:01:39.210> like

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
taking making this record where was like

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.730 
taking making this record where was like
oh<00:01:39.509> my<00:01:39.659> god<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.170> how<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.560> deliver
