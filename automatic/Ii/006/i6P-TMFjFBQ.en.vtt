00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.200
 The reaction of companies and individuals and governments to the 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.309
 global warming lower carbon dioxide emissions recycling 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.999
 weaker motor debris 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:21.679
 in this case the national government and encourage the acquisition of 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.640
 speak pretty cars 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.050
 with the environment 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.069
 this is a story presented by toyota 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.699
 past for many of the future car would be something akin to 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.000
 Aragon 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.670
 to end however the great impact of the 600 million cars that today 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.200
 they go through the pianist 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.520
 about the mosquera and the quality of the air that we breathe but mainly its 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.460
 contribution with greenhouse gases makes the car of the future 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.700
 pact rather said the future of the automobile steer us towards the 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.290
 called clean technologies cars that work and entirely with biodiesel 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.880
 bioethanol other 100% electric cars powered by the energy of the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.560
 hydrogen 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.360
 all these actions will be available in future years according to the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.960
 automotive industry however the president of the car of the future seems 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.630
 Excellent 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.520
 but that is totally prohibited 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.690
 a hybrid car simply and simply even a hybrid vehicle if 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.090
 we want opened the most likely 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.300
 is any vehicle that has two power bridges 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.280
 the typical example that we go a sailboat 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.150
 cough of the sailboat because it has the sails that take it and the wind but at the same time 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.540
 an engine already in the case that there is no wind so that it can still be followed 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.640
 driving in the case to another mobile 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.930
 has two engines can be at this time what the most common thing is 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.700
 gasoline and electricity but in the future we can see many other types of 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.690
 combination of votes the toyota prius has become the hybrid car more 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.590
 sold out of the story mainly because of its fuel savings when using a 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.200
 efficient gasoline engine 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.780
 and an electric one that is charged when braking 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.210
 using so much energy that conventional cars are 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.119
 wasted 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.529
 the advantage of a hybrid vehicle with respect to public use 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.900
 so have the best combustion system is definitely 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.729
 the regenerative brake that's all the secret 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.909
 that is, the ability to regenerate 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.559
 but your savings does not just come from your engine 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:25.559
 but also dynamic actuary designs the beginning of what we call 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:29.159
 the aerodynamic coefficient that basically means that so easy 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.259
 that the prius for shortening through the air 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:32.929
 p 0 points 25 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:36.399
 him so that people would follow that means that that makes the pri or 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:40.359
 one of the most aerodynamic cars in the world however we have learned a lot 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.709
 The experience of our motor sports as Formula 1 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.050
 12 the bottom of the prius has cradle series covers then totally 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.750
 flat and that makes air also easier because it's down 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:56.110
 facebook with the aim of promoting the consumption of clean energy by the government 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.590
 has decided to exempt hybrid vehicles from taxes 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.760
 as the prius that are coming to reach the Ecuadorian market 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.319
 basically there are zero tariffs 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.449
 be an obstacle 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:07.559
 because its consumption 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:09.439
 and he and the VAT is also at zero 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.739
 According to the government, the intention is to create a double saving for both 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.470
 been to stop importing gas from abroad 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.020
 how much for the user who reduces their consumption this now I see the state 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.769
 i and for another also now money to the consumer room light slowly a 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.510
 hybrid vehicle will cost around 25% less in the equator than 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.219
 a conventional one with similar characteristics 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:38.299
 that without counting the money that will save you in fuel the vehicles 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.430
 hybrids are one of the many ways in which we can save pollution 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.290
 to the planet while consumers and state save resources decrease the 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:51.919
 dependence on the energy coming from the oil dulcilÃ­ certain we are 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.299
 interested in the environment and that we as a planet 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.529
 contribute less to what is the global impact 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:02.199
 and make a base purchase rum acquisition a hybrid vehicle is an excellent 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.929
 way I accepted the technological breakthrough allows a substantial improvement in 

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:10.759
 our means of transportation min but it is important that incentives 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:13.900
 The government attacks the most attractive to the public 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.120
 when choosing a new car
