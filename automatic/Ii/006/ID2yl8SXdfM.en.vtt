00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.739
 well I would have said the 2 often I have 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.329
 of good contest that too but it's 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:18.859
 that this is not a contest 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.859
 this is bikes 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.440
 plus 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.440
 Hello 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.630
 we want to present the first video of 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.920
 the data in the channel and therefore 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.350
 we must think that they see us for the first time 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.120
 I hope that then all the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.400
 you look for in this channel and that it is so 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.960
 yours ours and nothing our 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.640
 dearest teammates to the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.110
 two do not worry because we are going to 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.180
 keep making gilboa videos alone 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.620
 the only thing that we hope that we also 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.150
 entertain the new videos that you 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.700
 we are going to bring of not all you know the 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.030
 we leave with the video 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:10.390
 knowing the gifted presentation or the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.170
 what the gifted does is the first game 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.260
 of the saga as the 2 is the first out yes 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.780
 although it seems strange is this way descents 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.540
 of anciÃ¡ns dota was a mo created by the 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.890
 users of the game warcraft 3 was made 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.370
 so popular that it's over 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.540
 becoming an independent game 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.970
 belongs to the so-called fashion genre 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.970
 online multiplayer beats flour like 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.190
 the well-known lol in the two teams 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.810
 the radiant ones and I'll say they compete in 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.450
 teams of five for destroying the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.580
 ancestor of the enemy for this our 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.619
 Heroes must increase their power by killing 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.450
 little bugs called creeps that go 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.369
 leaving the enemy base in the 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.100
 roads there are some towers that will make 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.960
 more complex task without forgetting the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.680
 enemy heroes who will use all their 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.430
 skills to try to stop t 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.710
 the company behind gifted is valve and 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.720
 use steam software to improve the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.120
 social and community functionality of 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.980
 game so you have to create a 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.350
 account in steam and through this 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.330
 system you can be in touch with your 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.990
 friends and see if they are tailing 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.990
 hidden 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.810
 I am not studying 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.340
 to those who have never been in a 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.950
 game of this style that you come from the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.050
 classics m / m or we're not going to lie is 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.880
 hard it is very very hard to move with the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.550
 damn mouse mickey 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.770
 as a possessed and the most mature 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.540
 sure it reminds you of the devil or the 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.160
 neverwinter nights this yes that exist and 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.660
 that would be at an age and problems in the 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.580
 way to move is a game with a level 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.170
 of brutal strategy there are many things 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.000
 to take into account in the trees 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.920
 eat the donkeys bring you objects there 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.300
 that go up level buy the team choose 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.440
 the skills fight with the enemies 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.150
 flee and kill and die also has 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.920
 tournaments with cash prizes in the 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.020
 that true professionals are 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.170
 face for the honor and fame for the 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.170
 not clear pasta 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.020
 a true and sporty and the most 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.450
 surprising is that it is still in beta 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.010
 this is a beta, they are still missing 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.810
 for implementing a few heroes I think 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.190
 that in the end be more than 100 and when 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.569
 is complete the game will be free of charge 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.069
 the same way you have to have them 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.360
 pay nothing or for downloading gold or for 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.190
 play but to start playing now 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.650
 same until this beta that lasts already so 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:25.269
 less a year you have to pay the pre 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.860
 buy or do not want to pay good good 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.780
 well there is also another option that 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.280
 someone invite us we know that some 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.900
 how many tainted with free imitations 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.000
 so we will try in some way 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.290
 that those who want to play can be in 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.660
 contact with those who have invitations 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.700
 and so we can all play together and 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.650
 learn as we did with the one 2 os 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.200
 you remember good we are preparing 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.299
 tutorials to start playing guides 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.850
 commented gameplay characters 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.340
 chicken coops with the stale giving everything 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.650
 We will try to bring you also games of 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.299
 the highest competition if the copyright 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.310
 allows us analysis of the 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.080
 strategies and the wishes of the pros by 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.209

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.850

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.580
 great ideas and everything to share 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.440
 with the Spanish community in style 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.630
