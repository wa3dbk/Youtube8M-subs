00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.170
 character creation for the plot is one thing 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.270
 Well, to breathe life into them is completely 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.460
 other they can move 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.280
 how much we write is some kind of balance between 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.900
 character narration and creation 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.660
 tell people design and development 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.670
 video games and most don't even think 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.410
 about characters and acting but we 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.040
 constantly complicate the task for our 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.530
 designers 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.449
 they think through everything but because even 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.440
 when we work out some kind of script 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.820
 small scene 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.590
 you must be sure that even 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.430
 the smallest detail will play a role in 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.800
 understanding 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.600
 we usually start with a prototype and want 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.219
 accurately convey the emotions experienced 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.379
 the characters it's what he is 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.879
 represents the first character in which 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.950
 we started Bulgarian 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.140
 so say our dark hero love 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.770
 created with damage hardened in battles 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.630
 to warriors 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:15.200
 but at the same time with multifaceted 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.860
 person sir galahad the question is not yet 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.130
 resolved 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.110
 looking for galahad man who lived 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.950
 long enough to understand all my life 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.840
 and relationships 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.479
 but on the other hand he has developed 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.460
 immunity to all of this he fenced himself 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.540
 the wall I am not a supporter of passions not 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.270
 feeling passion mse 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.780
 people can't fight we fight 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.100
 Galahad people are very serious olafa is 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.850
 very ground green 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:48.590
 He is impatient and often comes at the risk of people 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.170
 mongold what difference is easy to lift 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.420
 he defuses the situation but with all this 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.700
 and in his life was what served for 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.189
 him with the hard lessons and made him 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.280
 so simple people grow up to it and 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.770
 grow up he looks more like a pupil therefore 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.640
 we needed a good contrast which 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.160
 did you balance the perception of the plot 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.530
 you never trust anyone 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.690
 the word always doubting sebastian 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.120
 Mallory is one of the oldest knights 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.930
 He lived very long and saw much 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.209
 more than others 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:28.359
 gray and hardened terra 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:30.189
 call sat down to rest we did not 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:33.150
 complicate its design and made it 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.150
 old school 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.510
 we need eyes somewhere among us 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.400
 imagine me nothing to wear lady 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.709
 Igrain is the youngest among persons and 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:50.319
 despite this she managed to enter 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:52.419
 and and halahad history we bind 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.549
 feel the distance between exactly the same 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:58.780
 time that it constantly reminds him 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:03.459
 strength I would prefer someone more 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:06.010
 experienced cool well I do not know who you are she 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.739
 plays a significant role in the lives of others she 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:13.930
 straightforward and and skills ie the same 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.519
 as well try to keep up it would be 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.549
 stupid to make toys typical 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.280
 busty skater woman especially 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.810
 if it does not correspond to those times 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.150
 if you look at the board of the time 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.370
 are they barely galya a little piece 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.030
 skin so we had to wist for 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.979
 her design 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.319
 we had to work hard that 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:37.569
 Bozhevich prototypes and give it the right 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:39.099
 emotions are the hardest character creation 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.199
 this is the human factor ki 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.449
 found wax trained so that 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.069
 instantly notice the smallest flaws 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.359
 other 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.129
 we kept all the rules 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.530
 human anatomy to character 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.750
 looked right we scanned face 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.370
 actor in 3d and then produced 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.739
 manipulations to give it 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:02.079
 uniqueness all animations of people in the game 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.150
 done by capturing camera movement and 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.430
 fastened on the heads of the actors so that we 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.680
 could track facial expressions and movements 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.540
 bodies he is charmingly wrong 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.639
 noticed it because you didn't 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.159
 french you are an american french yourself and 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:17.380
 all who i'm angry i just love freedom 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.880
 another in another difficulty for us was 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.100
 the fact that all acting skills 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.620
 which 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.700
 or pass through character 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.460
 demonstrated on the site with gray 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.010
 coated and heaps of bright light sources 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.840
 write suits and spandex cameras on 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.450
 the heads of the actors who were supposed to 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:39.330
 focus on the game so it was 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:42.690
 now tell all the knights to 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.490
 join us watch opel always 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.190
 need a balance you can either go too 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.010
 far street mechanics innovation is not 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:56.040
 overdo but for the last couple of years we 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:58.170
 succeed in keeping a balance so that 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.420
 facilitate this process and does not exist 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.910
 no magic ingredient only 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.960
 blood sweat and tears but at the end we get 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:10.850
 realistic characters where are you 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.780
 finish started now is not the time to take revenge 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.110
 technology has helped make these 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.180
 characters are realistic they allow 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.260
 we take and do what we could not 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.260
 would do before 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.560
 add a game of humanity 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:34.020
 make sure it has ours 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:35.160
 a piece of it is very important for us always 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.560
 it was important to have your own 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.540
 technology how do we have our vision 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.030
 the process of creating the game then what is it 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.860
 should be and what will be the plot but also 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.450
 we have our own vision of what 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.450
 technology direction will evolve
