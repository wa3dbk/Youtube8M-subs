00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.000 
maybe play like bras or someone else I
maybe<00:01:24.330> had<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.690> think<00:01:25.110> longer<00:01:25.380> about<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.830> but

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
maybe had to think longer about it but

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.800 
maybe had to think longer about it but
it<00:01:26.460> was<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> no-brainer<00:01:26.790> right<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.600> caught<00:01:27.750> on
