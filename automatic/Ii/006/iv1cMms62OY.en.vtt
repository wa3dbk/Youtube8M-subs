00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
learn a G run and to measure G running I

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.330 
learn a G run and to measure G running I
say<00:00:22.840> okay<00:00:23.080> but<00:00:23.230> what<00:00:23.380> song<00:00:23.619> is<00:00:23.830> it<00:00:23.860> in<00:00:24.099> because

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
to go down on the next one and that's

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.600 
to go down on the next one and that's
where<00:01:26.049> you<00:01:26.079> got<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.320> be<00:01:26.500> as<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.220> next<00:01:27.460> one<00:01:27.579> is

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
where you got to be as the next one is

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.399 
where you got to be as the next one is
going<00:01:27.850> to<00:01:28.000> occur<00:01:28.270> on<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.450> damn<00:01:28.689> feet<00:01:28.990> that's

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
going to occur on a damn feet that's

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.430 
going to occur on a damn feet that's
just<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.770> way<00:01:29.860> it<00:01:30.040> is<00:01:30.130> it's<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.490> math<00:01:30.640> of<00:01:30.850> it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.130 

now<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:36.850> it's<00:01:37.390> hard<00:01:37.570> for<00:01:37.660> you<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:37.780> change<00:01:37.960> the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
now if it's hard for you to change the

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.170 
now if it's hard for you to change the
cords<00:01:38.440> on<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.740> all<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.520> want<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.760> do<00:01:39.850> that<00:01:39.880> is

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
cords on that all you want to do that is

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.320 
cords on that all you want to do that is
just<00:01:40.210> do<00:01:41.080> straight<00:01:41.320> stones<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:43.060> then<00:01:43.150> don't

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
just do straight stones and then don't

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.490 
just do straight stones and then don't
worry<00:01:43.420> about<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.780> alternating<00:01:44.350> because

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
worry about the alternating because

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.900 
worry about the alternating because
that's<00:01:44.650> gonna<00:01:44.740> bring<00:01:44.920> another<00:01:45.160> factor<00:01:45.670> into

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
that's gonna bring another factor into

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.940 
that's gonna bring another factor into
the<00:01:46.030> mix<00:01:46.240> just<00:01:46.480> strum<00:01:47.260> that's<00:01:47.560> all<00:01:47.650> we<00:01:47.740> got<00:01:47.830> to

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
the mix just strum that's all we got to

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.490 
the mix just strum that's all we got to
do<00:01:48.120> you<00:01:49.120> can<00:01:49.300> even<00:01:49.420> strohm<00:01:49.900> just<00:01:50.140> on<00:01:50.230> every

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
do you can even strohm just on every

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.960 
do you can even strohm just on every
other<00:01:50.620> beat<00:01:50.860> if<00:01:50.980> you<00:01:51.070> want<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.400> as<00:01:51.550> long<00:01:51.580> as<00:01:51.850> you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
other beat if you want to as long as you

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.080 
other beat if you want to as long as you
get<00:01:52.240> used<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.660> not<00:01:53.020> stopping<00:01:53.670> okay<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:55.060> know

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
get used to not stopping okay you know

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.910 
get used to not stopping okay you know
here's<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.450> thing<00:01:55.630> with<00:01:55.780> what<00:01:56.380> this<00:01:56.560> is<00:01:56.740> is

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
here's the thing with what this is is
