lovely<00:04:55.510> touch<00:04:55.930> it's<00:04:56.200> not<00:04:56.470> just<00:04:56.800> doing<00:04:57.100> the

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
lovely touch it's not just doing the

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.490 
lovely touch it's not just doing the
jump<00:04:57.430> it's<00:04:57.610> doing<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.180> jump<00:04:58.419> and<00:04:59.020> if<00:04:59.169> we<00:04:59.290> saw

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
jump it's doing the jump and if we saw

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.070 
jump it's doing the jump and if we saw
it<00:04:59.680> up<00:04:59.830> she's<00:05:00.130> jumping<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.490> other<00:05:00.640> way

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
it up she's jumping the other way

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.200 
it up she's jumping the other way
it's<00:05:01.349> not<00:05:01.500> good<00:05:01.710> hatred<00:05:02.220> that's<00:05:02.819> why<00:05:03.000> he's

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
it's not good hatred that's why he's

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:19.990 
it's not good hatred that's why he's
going<00:05:03.449> Wow

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.120 

greater<00:05:20.570> say<00:05:20.780> it<00:05:20.990> must<00:05:21.140> have<00:05:21.320> been<00:05:21.380> so

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
greater say it must have been so

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.280 
greater say it must have been so
frustrating<00:05:22.370> for<00:05:22.880> her<00:05:23.000> to<00:05:23.570> come<00:05:23.720> from<00:05:23.960> such<00:05:24.260> a

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
frustrating for her to come from such a

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.130 
frustrating for her to come from such a
high<00:05:24.560> from<00:05:24.830> Calgary<00:05:25.250> two<00:05:25.430> years<00:05:25.610> ago<00:05:25.790> and<00:05:25.970> then

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
high from Calgary two years ago and then

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.810 
high from Calgary two years ago and then
just<00:05:27.140> wasn't<00:05:27.530> quite<00:05:27.710> there<00:05:27.770> time<00:05:28.250> after<00:05:28.640> time

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
just wasn't quite there time after time

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.670 
just wasn't quite there time after time
and<00:05:29.240> sometimes<00:05:29.780> you<00:05:30.050> just<00:05:30.110> want<00:05:30.410> to<00:05:30.470> give<00:05:30.650> up

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
and sometimes you just want to give up

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.770 
and sometimes you just want to give up
or<00:05:31.040> you<00:05:31.070> know<00:05:31.400> you've<00:05:31.670> got<00:05:31.820> more<00:05:32.090> to<00:05:32.300> give<00:05:32.480> and

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
or you know you've got more to give and

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.200 
or you know you've got more to give and
that<00:05:35.780> was<00:05:35.930> that<00:05:36.260> was<00:05:36.380> lovely<00:05:36.590> to<00:05:36.830> see

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210
