start<00:02:26.760> at<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.690> edges<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.470> know<00:02:29.209> where<00:02:30.209> I've<00:02:30.330> got

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540

started<00:02:30.930> where<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.080> haven't<00:02:32.690> corner<00:02:35.690> round

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
started where I haven't corner round

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.990 
started where I haven't corner round
that's

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.300

these<00:02:48.820> are<00:02:48.940> not<00:02:49.000> exact<00:02:49.360> positions<00:02:49.870> where<00:02:50.080> you

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
these are not exact positions where you

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.940 
these are not exact positions where you
want<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.350> put<00:02:50.470> them<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.680> can<00:02:50.800> put<00:02:50.890> them

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
anywhere you can make them thicker

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.210 
anywhere you can make them thicker
closer<00:02:52.630> together<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:53.140> can<00:02:53.530> do<00:02:53.710> anything<00:02:54.010> you

it once to give it a glow maybe on the
top<00:04:06.480> one<00:04:06.630> on<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.930> me<00:04:07.050> two<00:04:07.590> times<00:04:07.890> giving<00:04:08.310> an

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
extra one then I go to my other stars

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.690 
extra one then I go to my other stars
right<00:04:14.550> here

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.040 

let's<00:04:18.700> have<00:04:18.880> them<00:04:19.030> once<00:04:19.330> to<00:04:19.540> give<00:04:19.690> him<00:04:19.780> a<00:04:19.870> nice

let's have them once to give him a nice
glow<00:04:20.530> I<00:04:22.470> usually<00:04:23.470> all<00:04:24.070> my<00:04:24.390> larger<00:04:25.390> ones

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
glow I usually all my larger ones

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.920 
glow I usually all my larger ones
because<00:04:26.290> I<00:04:26.380> want<00:04:26.560> them<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.710> show<00:04:27.040> more<00:04:27.930> just

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.330 

smaller<00:04:38.380> stars<00:04:39.480> just<00:04:40.480> as<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.780> stars<00:04:41.080> are

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
smaller stars just as the stars are

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.380 
smaller stars just as the stars are
stopped<00:04:42.340> filling<00:04:42.640> those<00:04:42.850> giving<00:04:43.480> them<00:04:43.630> a<00:04:43.660> nice

go back to your pencil if you deselect
the<00:05:29.159> path<00:05:29.399> that's<00:05:30.389> what<00:05:30.569> it<00:05:30.659> looks<00:05:30.839> like<00:05:32.179> basic

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:33.179 
the path that's what it looks like basic

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:36.709 
the path that's what it looks like basic
simple<00:05:33.869> simplicity<00:05:34.439> and<00:05:35.429> if<00:05:35.969> you<00:05:36.179> really<00:05:36.539> do

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
simple simplicity and if you really do

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:39.979 
simple simplicity and if you really do

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:39.989 
want to give it an extra glow maybe I

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:46.069 
want to give it an extra glow maybe I
know<00:05:40.879> go<00:05:41.879> and<00:05:42.179> just<00:05:42.479> change<00:05:43.639> no<00:05:44.639> no<00:05:45.059> you<00:05:45.779> can<00:05:45.929> go

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:46.079 
know go and just change no no you can go

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:49.599 
know go and just change no no you can go
into<00:05:46.199> your<00:05:46.319> filters<00:05:47.569> keep<00:05:48.569> I<00:05:48.719> used<00:05:48.929> to<00:05:48.989> go<00:05:49.109> blur

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:49.609 
into your filters keep I used to go blur

00:05:49.609 --> 00:05:53.659 
into your filters keep I used to go blur
Gaussian<00:05:50.609> blur<00:05:51.439> not<00:05:52.439> a<00:05:52.469> lot<00:05:52.829> just<00:05:53.159> give<00:05:53.519> it

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
Gaussian blur not a lot just give it

00:05:53.669 --> 00:06:00.189 
Gaussian blur not a lot just give it
let's<00:05:54.089> say<00:05:56.149> two<00:05:57.149> and<00:05:57.269> a<00:05:57.389> half<00:05:57.629> maybe<00:05:58.469> three

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
let's say two and a half maybe three

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.409 
let's say two and a half maybe three
it's<00:06:01.199> okay<00:06:01.559> to<00:06:02.039> blurred<00:06:02.429> out<00:06:02.669> and<00:06:02.939> then<00:06:03.269> you

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
it's okay to blurred out and then you

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:09.199 
it's okay to blurred out and then you
just<00:06:03.449> go<00:06:03.779> in<00:06:04.349> to<00:06:05.989> lighten<00:06:06.989> it<00:06:07.579> a<00:06:08.579> little<00:06:08.999> bit<00:06:09.119> of

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:09.209 
just go in to lighten it a little bit of

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:12.709 
just go in to lighten it a little bit of
edge<00:06:10.489> not<00:06:11.489> much<00:06:11.699> of<00:06:11.849> a<00:06:11.909> difference<00:06:12.029> you<00:06:12.389> can't

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:12.719 
edge not much of a difference you can't

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:17.709 
edge not much of a difference you can't
really<00:06:12.959> tell<00:06:13.429> it<00:06:14.429> looks<00:06:14.549> nice<00:06:14.879> and<00:06:15.559> after<00:06:16.559> that

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
really tell it looks nice and after that

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:21.259 
really tell it looks nice and after that
if<00:06:18.719> you<00:06:18.869> remove<00:06:19.610> now<00:06:20.610> you<00:06:20.669> see<00:06:20.999> you've<00:06:21.089> got

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:21.269 
if you remove now you see you've got

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:23.359 
if you remove now you see you've got
this<00:06:21.360> in<00:06:21.509> a<00:06:21.569> different<00:06:21.749> layer<00:06:22.079> it's<00:06:22.799> by<00:06:23.009> itself

00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:23.369 
this in a different layer it's by itself

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:25.759 
this in a different layer it's by itself
you<00:06:24.149> can<00:06:24.329> still<00:06:24.539> see<00:06:24.809> to<00:06:25.079> make<00:06:25.199> any<00:06:25.379> changes

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:25.769
