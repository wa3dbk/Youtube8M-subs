00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.990 
newspaper's think I was going to change
it<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.770> didn't<00:00:43.980> bother<00:00:44.129> thought<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.940> looked

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
it but I didn't bother thought it looked

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.110 
it but I didn't bother thought it looked
kind<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.300> plain<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.350> did<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.430> didn't

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
kind of plain but it did but I didn't

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.690 
kind of plain but it did but I didn't
really<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.420> time<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.989> i<00:00:49.170> know<00:00:49.320> i<00:00:49.649> think<00:00:50.460> i've

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
really have time and i know i think i've

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.160 
really have time and i know i think i've
been<00:00:50.730> working<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.480> like<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.750> few<00:00:51.989> months

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
been working on it for like a few months

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.150 
been working on it for like a few months
now<00:00:52.350> well<00:00:53.219> actually<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.610> think<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.789> been<00:00:55.160> six

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
now well actually I think it's been six

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.860 
now well actually I think it's been six
months<00:00:56.340> I've<00:00:56.789> been<00:00:56.820> working<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.449> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
months I've been working on it but I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.619 
months I've been working on it but I
probably<00:00:58.649> only<00:00:58.920> did<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.370> half<00:01:00.120> an<00:01:00.359> hour<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
probably only did like half an hour a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.450 
probably only did like half an hour a
week<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.140> work<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.680> until<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.980> came<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
week and work on it until it came to the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.130 
week and work on it until it came to the
to<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.820> end<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.270> probably<00:01:03.930> could<00:01:04.110> have

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
to the end I probably could have

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.840 
to the end I probably could have
finished<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.739> under<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> month<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.549> wanted

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
finished it in under a month if I wanted

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.280 
finished it in under a month if I wanted
to<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.360> didn't<00:01:06.720> put<00:01:06.780> how<00:01:06.900> much<00:01:07.020> time

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
to but I just didn't put how much time

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.560 
to but I just didn't put how much time
and<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> think<00:01:07.799> since<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.549> released<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.150> mean<00:01:09.450> an

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and I think since I released I mean an

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.660 
and I think since I released I mean an
outside<00:01:10.020> making<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.830> think<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.939> uh

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
outside making this I think I uh

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.940 
outside making this I think I uh
