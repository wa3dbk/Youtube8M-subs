00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:14.009
 Well we continue our talk vise 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:19.050
 So I picked up a little bit here to be seen 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.350
 Transmits the camera can be seen that copper cooked 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:27.180
 a little bit of that copper color 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:29.550
 thats actually started well it was hard 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.410
 I have a crack right now 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.200
 because they still basked fell 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.280
 catching but something happened here 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.219
 now two or three times it will be necessary 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.840
 pass it all around 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.520
 It is natural to beat off the seams to see where 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.280
 then you can sharpen grinding 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.969
 boil as it should be here but the main thing 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.850
 what then after all brew 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.579
 brew everything up well you need these 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.159
 drives will be thrown back into the city 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.670
 so they can cool down there themselves 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:16.409
 heat up a little here and let them there 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:20.689
 lie well jokes get the next day 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:26.630
 see it today well done here 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:32.759
 try how it works will be seen 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:35.150
 it turned out with us or did not work here 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.150
 so here 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.210
 here is one layer brewed here in a circle 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:54.549
 it turned out pretty well cleaned now 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:02:01.329
 once I went through, there was another defect 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:05.229
 here in the middle there is a crack apparently not 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:08.470
 I noticed her immediately could not be seen and 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.569
 for dirt in general, now you will see 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:16.629
 also not to cut and boil 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:22.030
 Now I will quickly clean my 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:25.319
 I will go over and throw it in the furnace; let it be with yours 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.319
 and here also brewed where 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.560
 such are the rescue operations 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.560
 pussy continues 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:44.250
 well, so far the cooking has happened unexpected 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:48.990
 cracks for some reason become more distinct 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.350
 I'm from the heat while I cook it went 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:56.610
 here on now visible on back back 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.170
 converges did not want to clean it but apparently 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.260
 Now all the same it is necessary to have a Bulgarian 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.880
 little walk through make it and 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.500
 brew on both sides 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.940
 so too so here and such moments 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.150
 happens this is the second time I cook about 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.150
 bottom and and 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.100
 here I continue to cook here already failed 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:30.280
 everything 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:34.420
 two sides but there were five electrodes 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:39.840
 prepared by wrapped media here 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:42.340
 there are two left here 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.870
 Bulgarian had to clean up again 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.460
 to talk normally because 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:54.280
 crack who leads poorly 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:04:00.430
 it turns out but we will try to talk 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:03.070
 discovered another crack now from where 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.610
 more comfortable here you can see it here 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:11.830
 went starts coming along here since 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:15.610
 these are guides here inside the guide 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.400
 there is here they are from this country crack 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:23.680
 he was also there before it was not visible 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:28.510
 that they are all in the cracks at all now her 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.990
 I will brew then see what 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.990
 will turn out 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:42.770
 Well, finally everything ended here 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:47.580
 brewed everything spoke several times 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:51.200
 I had to have some sections right now 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:58.220
 cleaned with mark here is boiled now 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:05:02.190
 all in general one welding but what to do 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:06.030

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.740
 happen 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:24.780
 humor is worth it 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:33.990
 here on the street night evening night 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:37.160
 what we'll see will see the results yet 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.160
 then yes speaking
