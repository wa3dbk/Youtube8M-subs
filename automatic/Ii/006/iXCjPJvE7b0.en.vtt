other nutrients when you steam or boil
if<00:02:42.180> you're<00:02:42.390> boiling<00:02:42.570> make<00:02:43.080> sure<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.710> use

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
if you're boiling make sure that you use

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.770 
if you're boiling make sure that you use
the<00:02:44.490> water<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.240> boil<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.660> vegetables

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
the water that you boil the vegetables

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.380 
the water that you boil the vegetables
in<00:02:46.260> don't<00:02:46.500> throw<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:46.920> water<00:02:47.070> away<00:02:47.310> many<00:02:48.270> of

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
in don't throw that water away many of

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.760 
in don't throw that water away many of
the<00:02:48.510> nutrients<00:02:49.020> have<00:02:49.110> leached<00:02:49.380> into<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
the nutrients have leached into the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.240 
the nutrients have leached into the
water<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.220> drink<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.240> should<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.600> go<00:02:51.870> raw

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
water so drink it so should you go raw

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.740 
water so drink it so should you go raw
no<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.280> don't<00:02:53.700> think<00:02:53.940> that's<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.330> smartest

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
no I don't think that's the smartest

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.960 
no I don't think that's the smartest
choice<00:02:55.020> but<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:55.890> do<00:02:56.040> think<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:56.610> should<00:02:56.640> go<00:02:56.910> to

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
choice but I do think you should go to

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.760 
choice but I do think you should go to
your<00:02:57.120> local<00:02:57.360> supermarket<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.470> produce

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
your local supermarket to the produce

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.190 
your local supermarket to the produce
section<00:02:59.310> or<00:02:59.940> your<00:03:00.420> local<00:03:00.720> farmers<00:03:01.170> market
