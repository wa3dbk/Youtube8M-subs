00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
and their shortcomings when it when we

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.310 
and their shortcomings when it when we
talk<00:00:18.300> about<00:00:18.330> using<00:00:18.990> them<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.260> a

alar that's why they're calling the

alar that's why they're calling the
biggest<00:00:47.280> problem<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:47.789> using<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.600> cell<00:00:48.840> phone

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
biggest problem with using a cell phone

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.350 
biggest problem with using a cell phone
in<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.649> situation<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.430> they<00:00:50.760> can't<00:00:51.030> really

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
in that situation is they can't really

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.360 
in that situation is they can't really
tell<00:00:51.600> search-and-rescue<00:00:52.379> where<00:00:52.620> they<00:00:52.770> are

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.380 

one<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.520> biggest<00:00:56.789> problems<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
one of the biggest problems with a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.680 
one of the biggest problems with a
satellite<00:00:57.899> phone<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:59.239> you<00:01:00.239> really<00:01:00.539> want

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
satellite phone is that you really want

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.750 
satellite phone is that you really want
to<00:01:00.780> use<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> darn<00:01:01.350> thing<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.609> an

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
to use the darn thing and in an

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.119 
to use the darn thing and in an
emergency<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.809> battery<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.439> probably<00:01:04.680> going

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
emergency the battery is probably going

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.359 
emergency the battery is probably going
to<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.549> dead<00:01:05.820> or<00:01:06.119> too<00:01:06.390> low<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:07.049> be<00:01:07.100> effective

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
to be dead or too low to be effective

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.550 
to be dead or too low to be effective
another<00:01:09.210> problem<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:09.720> satellite<00:01:10.110> phones<00:01:10.350> is

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
another problem with satellite phones is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.219 
another problem with satellite phones is
poor<00:01:10.799> satellite<00:01:11.250> reception<00:01:11.630> you<00:01:12.630> also<00:01:13.020> have

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
poor satellite reception you also have

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.260 
poor satellite reception you also have
with<00:01:13.439> satellite<00:01:13.860> phones<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.460> same<00:01:14.760> problem

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
with satellite phones the same problem

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.640 
with satellite phones the same problem
that<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:15.840> cell<00:01:16.080> phones<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.560> that

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that you have with cell phones and that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.140 
that you have with cell phones and that
most<00:01:16.920> people<00:01:17.250> don't<00:01:17.400> know<00:01:17.549> where<00:01:17.790> they<00:01:17.939> are

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
most people don't know where they are

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.560 
most people don't know where they are
and<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.439> final<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.729> biggest<00:01:21.119> problem

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and the final really biggest problem

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.480 
and the final really biggest problem
with<00:01:21.689> relying<00:01:22.140> upon<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.500> satellite<00:01:23.009> phone<00:01:23.250> is

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
with relying upon a satellite phone is

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.179 
with relying upon a satellite phone is
they're<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.210> ruggedized<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.770> were<00:01:25.830> never

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
they're not ruggedized they were never

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.780 
they're not ruggedized they were never
intended<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.630> waterproof<00:01:28.350> or<00:01:28.670> capable<00:01:29.670> of

intended to be waterproof or capable of

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.880 
intended to be waterproof or capable of
withstanding<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.659> shock<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.259> vibration

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
withstanding the shock and the vibration

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.609 
withstanding the shock and the vibration
that<00:01:32.070> generally<00:01:32.939> associates<00:01:33.689> traumatic

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that generally associates traumatic

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.300 
that generally associates traumatic
events<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:38.060> GPS<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.390> receiver<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.560> tells<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
events a GPS is a receiver it tells you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.080 
events a GPS is a receiver it tells you
where<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:42.000> are<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.770> 406<00:01:43.770> megahertz<00:01:43.979> plb<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.030> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
where you are a 406 megahertz plb is a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.039 
where you are a 406 megahertz plb is a
transmitter

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
transmitter

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.490 
transmitter
it<00:01:46.200> tells<00:01:47.600> search-and-rescue<00:01:48.600> where<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.320> are

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
it tells search-and-rescue where you are

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.050 
it tells search-and-rescue where you are
that's<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> most<00:01:50.729> pivotal

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
that's really the most pivotal

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.819 
that's really the most pivotal
difference<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.320> also<00:01:52.470> worth<00:01:52.799> pointing

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
difference but it's also worth pointing

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.090 
difference but it's also worth pointing
out<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.549> GPS<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.439> sometimes<00:01:55.439> are<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> reason

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
out that GPS is sometimes are the reason

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.340 
out that GPS is sometimes are the reason
people<00:01:56.310> get<00:01:56.610> into<00:01:56.880> trouble<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.479> rely<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:57.960> them

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
people get into trouble we rely on them

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.880 
people get into trouble we rely on them
too<00:01:58.590> much<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.570> they<00:02:00.570> receive<00:02:01.140> these<00:02:01.380> signals

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
too much and they receive these signals

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.719 
too much and they receive these signals
which<00:02:02.070> are<00:02:02.250> transmitted<00:02:02.880> from<00:02:02.909> outer<00:02:03.689> space

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
which are transmitted from outer space

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.630 
which are transmitted from outer space
