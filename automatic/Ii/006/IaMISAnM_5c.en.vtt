told you I knew for sure but my theory

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.150 
told you I knew for sure but my theory
is<00:03:17.269> Jayco<00:03:17.780> was<00:03:17.959> flirting<00:03:18.410> with<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.650> idea<00:03:18.950> of

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
is Jayco was flirting with the idea of

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.460 
is Jayco was flirting with the idea of
making<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:20.470> side<00:03:21.470> ramp<00:03:22.160> toy<00:03:22.700> hauler<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:23.470> that

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
making a side ramp toy hauler and that

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.559 
making a side ramp toy hauler and that
concept<00:03:24.950> never<00:03:25.220> really<00:03:25.549> took<00:03:25.760> off<00:03:25.940> in<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.180> RV

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
concept never really took off in the RV

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.020 
concept never really took off in the RV
industry<00:03:26.739> so<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.769> think<00:03:28.310> they<00:03:28.519> kind<00:03:28.970> of

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
industry so I think they kind of

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.640 
industry so I think they kind of
reworked<00:03:29.419> it<00:03:29.599> into<00:03:29.840> this<00:03:29.930> bunkhouse<00:03:30.379> that

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650
