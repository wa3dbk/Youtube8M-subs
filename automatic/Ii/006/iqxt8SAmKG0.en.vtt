00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.380
 I will tell quite interesting things on 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.509
 my opinion this gadget is needed well maybe 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.880
 be and not all but almost all of those 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.890
 who use smartphones and tablets 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.529
 that is, to put it bluntly to almost everyone 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.289
 or including an external battery 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.150
 xiaomi power bank well, the firm on the left you 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.490
 probably no longer needs 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.560
 many people know what it is 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.570
 if someone does not know I will say this 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.700
 the largest chinese company which 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.059
 does well the same quality things as 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.950
 for there sony there apple samsung that is 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.570
 the quality is the same but not about it 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.600
 speech from so simply suddenly someone will say 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.300
 what is straw or mi-mi it's just but 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.039
 abbreviated spheres for sample for review 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.110
 thank you very much online store about 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.180
 house well, of course, there can be them and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.149
 buy link under this video on youtube 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.860
 and so according to the characteristics well, everything is simple 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.239
 I will give you no ikki numbers 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.430
 clearer first, there are two kinds 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.430
 batteries from 5 thousand 400 milliamps 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.510
 inside along 10 thousand four hundred two times 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.880
 more than 10400 this is exactly the capacity 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.560
 the battery I hold in my hands 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.250
 allows as an example to charge four with 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.400
 by half 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.320
 full charge for iphone 5s 4 phone 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.900
 we still have half the batteries of this 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.210
 the phone is iphone 5s exactly either 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.869
 one and a half full charge for ipad mini 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 actually very good on nutrition 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.850
 Of course here we can not charge 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.780
 only smartphones and tablets on the back 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.060
 the side that is 5 volts to 2 and 1 amp 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.369
 it's enough to charge and well 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.799
 I understand any tablet 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.600
 which is now sold at least 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.079
 Well, from my household industrial only 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.170
 not taking 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.520
 and in general, any phone is the same 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.500
 what's in from the computer or from charging 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.390
 you charge the main current that is my 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.939
 index 7 is charged absolutely without 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.860
 problems at the end of the video show body 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.899
 very important note I carefully 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.640
 read read all about this device 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.290
 so far i have 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.210
 interested and see what we have 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.520
 inside 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.080
 inside as they write on the site by forces of all this 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.420
 official website virus information 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.209
 premium lithium-ion battery from lying and 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.520
 samsung battery here 2 case it 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.160
 anodized aluminum and, moreover, the limit 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.140
 50 kilogram pressure is so written on 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.850
 The site is really that is, well, you can 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.550
 put means nothing with him 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.610
 water and collision rack surface 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.040
 enclosures need protection from overcharging and from 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.780
 over discharge protection against 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.650
 overvoltage and short circuit protection 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.989
 closures 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.459
 honestly was even surprised when on 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.000
 the site went and began to read about this 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.130
 gadget 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.450
 so much information at all 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.370
 really great 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.910
 Moreover , it is written that high 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.880
 temperature 70 degrees 96 hours test 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.400
 there was a low temperature of -40 degrees 96 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.590
 hours in appearance as im 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.989
 use all of course just there 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.030
 on / off button specifically for 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.670
 to talk show and now go from 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.989
 random discharge as i understand 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.670
 indicator that is four charged 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.220
 completely 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.260
 this micro usb connector comes 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.970
 This cable is for charging. 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.709
 the gadget itself how do you charge your 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.329
 cell phone for example here too 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.820
 most connect to computer 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.980
 for example usb port or laptop or 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.900
 just a charger and charge 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.000
 the back of the gadget is the same 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.310
 cable is a cable that comes with you 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.860
 connect the cable and charge 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.900
 for example your tablet or another cable 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.540
 ships connect charge and ipad there 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.989
 not so important in principle that's all here 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.110
 so and 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.820
 and use the kit comes yusb cable 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.980
 which I now show besides well 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.140
 that it works and for data transmission 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.299
 Well, that is, you can connect the computer 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.190
 connect the phone it is determined then 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.540
 have all the ports work as it should 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.340
 nothing more 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.650
 there is no unusual box itself 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.690
 neatly there is more instruction and all 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.270
 and inside the box the knife does not show 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.430
 of air 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.030
 sense is good in this nobody years what's there 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.990
 am again appearance and their feelings 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.870
 aluminum is really nice 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.790
 absolutely not slippery gadget such a 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.700
 a weighty measure after all miracles of course not 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.450
 happens and 10,000 milliamps is a lot 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.110
 enough 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:14.280
 at the price of the link under the video where to buy 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.590
 certainly 990 rubles from 995 thousand 400 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.650
 milliampere this I announce the information on 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.530
 September 2014

 1299 rubles 10400 silver aluminum 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.230
 which is in my hands and 1499 rubles is 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.750
 worth the gold you may be 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.390

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.580
