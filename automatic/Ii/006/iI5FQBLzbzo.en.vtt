00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
two here it stinkses are pretty much

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.790 
two here it stinkses are pretty much
full<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.910> they're<00:00:42.059> both<00:00:42.270> by<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> vino<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.680> I

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
full but they're both by a vino and I

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.770 
full but they're both by a vino and I
have<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.370> think<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.030> same<00:00:45.480> this

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
have that I think that is the same this

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.810 
have that I think that is the same this
is<00:00:45.899> aveeno<00:00:46.289> positively<00:00:46.320> radiant<00:00:47.280> daily

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
is aveeno positively radiant daily

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.420 
is aveeno positively radiant daily
cleansing<00:00:48.239> pads<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.020> then<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> aveeno<00:00:50.100> clear

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
cleansing pads and then the aveeno clear

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.540 
cleansing pads and then the aveeno clear
complexion<00:00:50.850> daily<00:00:51.809> cleansing<00:00:52.199> pads<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.770> I

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
complexion daily cleansing pads and I

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.000 
complexion daily cleansing pads and I
think<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.210> these<00:00:54.690> would<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.110> really<00:00:55.469> great

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
think that these would be really great

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.029 
think that these would be really great
except<00:00:56.640> for<00:00:56.670> some<00:00:57.059> reason<00:00:57.629> they<00:00:58.079> make<00:00:58.829> me

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
except for some reason they make me

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.250 
except for some reason they make me
break<00:00:59.280> out<00:00:59.309> or<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.300> my<00:01:00.570> skin<00:01:00.870> has<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.050> bad

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
break out or is just my skin has a bad

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.160 
break out or is just my skin has a bad
reaction<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.640> being<00:01:02.850> said<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.690> don't

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
reaction but that being said I don't

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.929 
reaction but that being said I don't
know<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.439> lot<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.309> my<00:01:05.460> skin<00:01:05.880> is

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
know if a lot of you know but my skin is

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.170 
know if a lot of you know but my skin is
pretty<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.710> very<00:01:08.100> picky<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.000> it's

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
pretty it's just very picky and it's

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.570 
pretty it's just very picky and it's
hard<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> deal<00:01:09.689> with<00:01:09.720> i<00:01:10.080> break<00:01:10.470> out<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.710> lot<00:01:11.220> I

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
hard to deal with i break out a lot I

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.460 
hard to deal with i break out a lot I
think<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.270> both<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.600> these<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:12.930> worked

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
think that both of these have worked

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.039 
think that both of these have worked
really<00:01:13.680> well<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:13.950> other<00:01:14.310> people<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.810> don't

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
review on this that was probably it's

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.870 
review on this that was probably it's
probably<00:02:25.480> up<00:02:25.840> on<00:02:25.990> my<00:02:26.110> channel<00:02:26.440> already<00:02:26.590> or<00:02:27.100> I

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
probably up on my channel already or I

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.480 
probably up on my channel already or I
did<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.150> like<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.330> testing<00:02:28.990> out<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:30.100> have

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
did it like a testing out of it I have

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.280 
did it like a testing out of it I have
that<00:02:30.670> had<00:02:30.940> this<00:02:31.120> for<00:02:31.330> quite<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.570> few<00:02:31.660> months<00:02:31.810> but

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
that had this for quite a few months but

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.530 
that had this for quite a few months but
which<00:02:33.250> might<00:02:33.459> be<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.730> reason<00:02:33.850> why<00:02:34.150> it's<00:02:34.390> doing

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
which might be the reason why it's doing

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.810 
which might be the reason why it's doing
this<00:02:34.720> but<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.320> mean<00:02:35.740> okay<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.220> feeling<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.700> it

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
this but I mean okay the feeling of it

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.990 
this but I mean okay the feeling of it
isn't<00:02:37.240> really<00:02:37.600> bad<00:02:37.750> at<00:02:37.959> all<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:39.400> did<00:02:39.610> last

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
isn't really bad at all and it did last

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.300 
isn't really bad at all and it did last
quite<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.390> while<00:02:40.480> for<00:02:40.900> me<00:02:41.140> my<00:02:41.560> only<00:02:41.709> thing<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.010> it

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
quite a while for me my only thing is it

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.960 
quite a while for me my only thing is it
did<00:02:42.520> break<00:02:42.910> me<00:02:43.180> out<00:02:43.209> i<00:02:43.360> woke<00:02:44.020> up<00:02:44.200> with<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.500> couple

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
did break me out i woke up with a couple

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.400 
did break me out i woke up with a couple
workouts<00:02:45.970> down<00:02:46.270> here<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:46.750> i<00:02:46.810> just<00:02:47.020> don't<00:02:47.230> want

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
workouts down here and i just don't want

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.680 
workouts down here and i just don't want
to<00:02:47.470> keep<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.950> because<00:02:48.910> i'm<00:02:49.060> pretty<00:02:49.330> sure<00:02:49.540> this

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
to keep it because i'm pretty sure this

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.020 
to keep it because i'm pretty sure this
broke<00:02:50.020> me<00:02:50.230> out<00:02:50.260> if<00:02:50.739> i<00:02:50.950> woke<00:02:51.160> up<00:02:51.190> with<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.580> couple

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
broke me out if i woke up with a couple

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.210 
broke me out if i woke up with a couple
different<00:02:52.540> breakouts<00:02:53.080> i'm<00:02:53.290> just<00:02:53.500> assuming<00:02:53.650> it

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
different breakouts i'm just assuming it

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.560 
different breakouts i'm just assuming it
did<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:54.550> i'm<00:02:54.670> just<00:02:54.700> on<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.060> going<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.300> try

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
did so i'm just on you going to try

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.540 
did so i'm just on you going to try
because<00:02:56.260> as<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:56.590> have<00:02:56.770> other<00:02:56.950> foundations

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
because as you have other foundations

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.160 
because as you have other foundations
that<00:02:57.670> i<00:02:57.790> like<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.239> think<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.660> this<00:02:58.810> would<00:02:58.989> be<00:02:59.140> a

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
that i like I think that this would be a

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.080 
that i like I think that this would be a
pretty<00:02:59.440> good<00:02:59.530> foundation<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.489> try<00:03:00.910> though

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
pretty good foundation to try though

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.370 
pretty good foundation to try though
because<00:03:01.270> i'm<00:03:01.450> pretty<00:03:01.750> sure<00:03:01.959> it's<00:03:02.080> really

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
because i'm pretty sure it's really

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.350 
because i'm pretty sure it's really
inexpensive<00:03:02.680> i<00:03:03.220> can't<00:03:03.459> quite<00:03:03.580> remember<00:03:03.790> but

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
inexpensive i can't quite remember but

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.240 
inexpensive i can't quite remember but
the<00:03:04.900> only<00:03:05.020> reason<00:03:05.320> why<00:03:05.410> i<00:03:05.440> don't<00:03:05.830> like<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.100> for

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
the only reason why i don't like it for

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.310 
the only reason why i don't like it for
myself<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.760> just<00:03:07.239> because<00:03:07.570> i<00:03:07.600> think<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:08.200> it

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
myself is just because i think that it

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.509 
myself is just because i think that it
made<00:03:08.470> me<00:03:08.590> break<00:03:08.770> me<00:03:08.950> out<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.190> I'm<00:03:09.310> just<00:03:09.459> not

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
made me break me out so I'm just not

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.330 
made me break me out so I'm just not
going<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.850> test<00:03:10.209> it<00:03:10.420> because<00:03:10.780> my<00:03:11.500> skin<00:03:11.769> is<00:03:11.830> so

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
going to test it because my skin is so

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.759

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
duty it does the job my only thing is it

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.890 
duty it does the job my only thing is it
feels<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:19.630> thick<00:03:20.230> um<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.640> feels<00:03:21.850> oily<00:03:22.390> to

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
me and I just don't like the feeling of

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.120 
me and I just don't like the feeling of
it<00:03:24.700> on<00:03:24.880> my<00:03:25.030> skin<00:03:25.420> personally<00:03:26.080> but<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:26.739> think

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
it on my skin personally but I think

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.590 
it on my skin personally but I think
that<00:03:27.160> this<00:03:27.370> does<00:03:27.580> a<00:03:27.610> really<00:03:27.940> great<00:03:28.269> job<00:03:28.390> of

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
that this does a really great job of

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.810 
that this does a really great job of
concealing<00:03:28.959> though<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:30.370> think<00:03:30.610> it<00:03:30.730> just

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
concealing though and I think it just

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.030 
concealing though and I think it just
depends<00:03:31.269> on<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.959> know<00:03:32.080> how<00:03:32.320> it<00:03:32.530> reacts<00:03:32.860> to

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
depends on you know how it reacts to

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.550 
depends on you know how it reacts to
your<00:03:33.280> skin<00:03:33.670> but<00:03:33.910> for<00:03:34.120> me<00:03:34.299> it<00:03:34.570> just<00:03:34.630> feels<00:03:35.200> thick

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
your skin but for me it just feels thick

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.640 
your skin but for me it just feels thick
and<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:36.820> feels<00:03:37.060> like<00:03:37.720> it's<00:03:37.989> clogging<00:03:38.320> my<00:03:38.530> pores

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
and it feels like it's clogging my pores

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.350 
and it feels like it's clogging my pores
kind<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.459> so<00:03:39.670> that's<00:03:39.850> only<00:03:39.940> reason<00:03:40.209> why<00:03:40.330> I

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
kind of so that's only reason why I

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.150 
kind of so that's only reason why I
don't<00:03:40.720> like<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:41.019> I<00:03:41.110> think<00:03:41.140> others<00:03:41.620> are<00:03:41.860> a<00:03:41.920> fan

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
don't like it I think others are a fan

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.280 
don't like it I think others are a fan
of<00:03:42.190> this<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.850> then<00:03:43.239> lastly<00:03:43.690> i<00:03:43.810> have<00:03:44.110> this

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.190 
of this and then lastly i have this

think that this is a really great lotion
it<00:03:49.480> really<00:03:50.019> is<00:03:50.260> very<00:03:50.709> ultra<00:03:51.250> healing<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.180> if

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
it really is very ultra healing so if

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.880 
it really is very ultra healing so if
you<00:03:52.390> have<00:03:52.570> dry<00:03:52.750> skin<00:03:53.140> you<00:03:53.200> might<00:03:53.500> want<00:03:53.680> to<00:03:53.769> try
