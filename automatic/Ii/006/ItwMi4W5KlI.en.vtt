you<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.250> sneaky<00:00:44.760> room<00:00:44.969> down

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
you can see it in this sneaky room down

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.970 
you can see it in this sneaky room down
there<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.600> you'll<00:00:46.140> pick<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.350> pick<00:00:46.680> yourself

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
there and you'll pick up pick yourself

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.459 
there and you'll pick up pick yourself
up<00:00:47.039> registering<00:00:47.640> number<00:00:47.969> one<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.390> an<00:00:49.200> extra

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
up registering number one and an extra

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.260 
up registering number one and an extra
life<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.520> that's<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> red

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
life so the that's going to be a red

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.380 
life so the that's going to be a red
starving<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.629> most<00:00:51.870> people<00:00:52.199> miss<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:54.149> moving

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
starving that most people miss so moving

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.360 
starving that most people miss so moving
on<00:00:54.510> right<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.020> end<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:56.039> kind<00:00:56.190> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
on right at the end of this kind of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.490 
on right at the end of this kind of
beginning<00:00:56.730> water<00:00:57.120> section<00:00:57.629> time<00:00:58.109> your<00:00:58.289> jump

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
beginning water section time your jump

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.779 
beginning water section time your jump
just<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.070> first<00:00:59.190> red<00:00:59.430> starving

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
just like for the first red starving

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.119 
just like for the first red starving
again<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.629> kill<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.109> fish<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.859> head<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
again so you kill the fish to head up to

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.070 
again so you kill the fish to head up to
that<00:01:02.280> platform<00:01:02.460> heading<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.329> cannon<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.840> we

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
that platform heading this cannon and we

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.560 
that platform heading this cannon and we
get<00:01:04.229> registering<00:01:04.619> number<00:01:04.830> two<00:01:04.979> there<00:01:05.570> right

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
get registering number two there right

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.950 
get registering number two there right
as<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.810> land<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:08.510> second<00:01:09.510> red<00:01:09.600> star<00:01:09.810> ring

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
as we land and so second red star ring

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.920 
as we land and so second red star ring
very<00:01:10.470> simple<00:01:10.860> don't<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> whole<00:01:11.400> lot

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
very simple don't have to do a whole lot

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.350 
very simple don't have to do a whole lot
right<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.110> launched<00:01:13.350> from<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> can

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
right just launched from the can

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.550 
right just launched from the can
continue<00:01:15.360> along<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.659> path<00:01:15.840> make<00:01:16.259> sure<00:01:16.290> you

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
continue along that path make sure you

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.410 
continue along that path make sure you
absolutely<00:01:17.280> hit<00:01:17.400> those<00:01:17.580> those<00:01:18.060> platforms

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
absolutely hit those those platforms

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.630 
absolutely hit those those platforms
it's<00:01:18.810> crucial<00:01:19.259> head<00:01:19.890> through<00:01:20.040> another<00:01:20.250> cannon

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
it's crucial head through another cannon

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.450 
it's crucial head through another cannon
take<00:01:21.119> out<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.390> body<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.869> badi<00:01:22.229> another<00:01:22.979> cannon

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
take out one body to badi another cannon

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.740 
take out one body to badi another cannon
and<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:23.970> we're<00:01:24.090> going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.270> kind<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.509> end<00:01:24.659> up

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
and then we're going to kind of end up

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.330 
and then we're going to kind of end up
in<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.049> half<00:01:25.290> pipe<00:01:25.530> thing<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.920> red

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
in this little half pipe thing and red

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.920 
in this little half pipe thing and red
serving<00:01:26.640> number<00:01:26.700> three's<00:01:27.030> here<00:01:27.330> that's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
serving number three's here that's

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.179 
serving number three's here that's
probably<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.290> toughest<00:01:28.650> red<00:01:28.829> starting<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
probably the toughest red starting to

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.520 
probably the toughest red starting to
get<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.460> level<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:30.540> let's<00:01:31.170> keep<00:01:31.259> moving

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
get in the level but let's keep moving

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.410 
get in the level but let's keep moving
so<00:01:32.100> after<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.490> section<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.000> cut<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.270> kind

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
so after that section you cut and kind

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.030 
so after that section you cut and kind
of<00:01:33.479> jump<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.840> some<00:01:33.990> platforms<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
of jump on some platforms and get to the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.039 
of jump on some platforms and get to the
middle<00:01:35.280> cannon<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:36.060> if<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.869> get<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
middle cannon here if you can get to

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.499 
middle cannon here if you can get to
that<00:01:37.079> middle<00:01:37.350> cannon<00:01:37.770> you'll<00:01:38.220> end<00:01:38.430> up<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.790> this

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
that middle cannon you'll end up on this

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.350 
that middle cannon you'll end up on this
kind<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.869> super<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.250> middle<00:01:41.820> path<00:01:42.030> in
