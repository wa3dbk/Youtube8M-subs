condition<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.890> interiors<00:02:46.340> nice<00:02:46.640> not<00:02:47.420> only

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
condition of the interiors nice not only

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.240 
condition of the interiors nice not only
do<00:02:47.630> you<00:02:47.660> have<00:02:47.780> dual<00:02:48.020> front<00:02:48.350> airbags<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:49.010> don't

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
do you have dual front airbags I don't

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.980 
do you have dual front airbags I don't
think<00:02:49.310> this<00:02:49.520> will<00:02:49.670> come<00:02:50.480> out<00:02:50.630> in<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.870> video

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
think this will come out in the video

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.980

pillar back there in addition to the
front<00:03:00.320> airbag<00:03:00.709> system<00:03:03.250> let's<00:03:04.250> take<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.490> look<00:03:04.700> in

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
front airbag system let's take a look in

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.000 
front airbag system let's take a look in
back<00:03:05.030> or<00:03:05.330> getting<00:03:05.660> back<00:03:05.840> just<00:03:06.140> take<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.620> look<00:03:06.860> at

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
back or getting back just take a look at

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.270 
back or getting back just take a look at
the<00:03:07.360> front<00:03:08.360> area<00:03:08.750> from<00:03:08.990> outside<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.680> car<00:03:09.890> get

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
the front area from outside the car get

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.580 
the front area from outside the car get
a<00:03:10.310> little<00:03:10.580> bit<00:03:10.700> more<00:03:10.850> perspective<00:03:11.600> now<00:03:12.470> I've

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
a little bit more perspective now I've
