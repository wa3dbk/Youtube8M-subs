anthropology scientists have discovered
that<00:00:24.609> there<00:00:24.849> are<00:00:24.910> more<00:00:25.179> similarities<00:00:25.449> between

that there are more similarities between

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.439 
that there are more similarities between
the<00:00:26.589> and<00:00:26.740> atolls<00:00:27.130> and<00:00:27.310> modern<00:00:27.730> humans<00:00:28.150> than

previously thought they now believe that

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.000 
previously thought they now believe that
Neanderthals<00:00:31.449> contributed<00:00:32.169> directly<00:00:32.770> to<00:00:32.920> the

Neanderthals contributed directly to the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.250 
Neanderthals contributed directly to the
ancestry<00:00:33.760> of<00:00:33.789> the<00:00:33.940> early<00:00:34.420> modern<00:00:34.629> humans<00:00:35.110> that

ancestry of the early modern humans that
succeeded<00:00:35.680> them<00:00:36.010> and<00:00:36.250> that<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:36.760> behavioral

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
succeeded them and that the behavioral

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.029 
succeeded them and that the behavioral
differences<00:00:37.840> between<00:00:38.050> the<00:00:38.350> two<00:00:38.500> groups<00:00:38.680> were

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
differences between the two groups were

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:56.610 
differences between the two groups were
small<00:00:54.179> now<00:00:55.179> it's<00:00:55.390> time<00:00:55.629> to<00:00:55.660> see<00:00:55.899> what's<00:00:56.170> hot<00:00:56.410> in

burn<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.390> candle<00:01:07.750> at<00:01:07.840> both<00:01:07.870> ends

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
burn the candle at both ends

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.910 
burn the candle at both ends
easy<00:01:09.190> right<00:01:09.730> well<00:01:10.570> Adrian<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:11.320> probably<00:01:11.770> is

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
easy right well Adrian it probably is

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.730 
easy right well Adrian it probably is
but<00:01:12.580> your<00:01:12.700> email<00:01:13.030> got<00:01:13.240> us<00:01:13.360> thinking<00:01:13.570> what<00:01:14.470> does

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
but your email got us thinking what does

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.200 
but your email got us thinking what does
happen<00:01:15.190> when<00:01:15.310> you<00:01:15.400> burn<00:01:15.610> a<00:01:15.640> candle<00:01:15.970> at<00:01:16.180> both

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
happen when you burn a candle at both

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.760 
happen when you burn a candle at both
ends<00:01:16.660> well<00:01:17.530> here's<00:01:17.740> what<00:01:17.920> we<00:01:18.040> found<00:01:18.220> out

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
ends well here's what we found out

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.050 
ends well here's what we found out
usually<00:01:20.770> when<00:01:20.980> a<00:01:21.010> candle<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.580> standing

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
usually when a candle is standing

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.210 
usually when a candle is standing
upright<00:01:22.390> we<00:01:22.930> only<00:01:23.110> see<00:01:23.410> the<00:01:23.560> wick<00:01:23.740> at<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.010> top

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
upright we only see the wick at the top

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.580 
upright we only see the wick at the top
of<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:24.430> candle<00:01:24.910> but<00:01:25.360> we<00:01:25.540> exposed<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.260> wick<00:01:26.440> at

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
of the candle but we exposed the wick at

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.590 
of the candle but we exposed the wick at
the<00:01:26.680> other<00:01:26.800> end<00:01:27.070> by<00:01:27.520> scraping<00:01:27.880> off<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.240> wax

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
the other end by scraping off the wax

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.800 
the other end by scraping off the wax
around<00:01:29.110> it<00:01:29.550> then<00:01:30.550> we<00:01:30.940> carefully<00:01:31.240> push<00:01:31.660> the

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
around it then we carefully push the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.270 
around it then we carefully push the
needle<00:01:31.960> through<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.440> center<00:01:32.830> of<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.040> candle

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
needle through the center of the candle

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.060 
needle through the center of the candle
and<00:01:33.580> balanced<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.510> double<00:01:34.930> ender<00:01:35.380> between<00:01:35.770> two

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
and balanced a double ender between two

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.360 
and balanced a double ender between two
glasses<00:01:36.870> next<00:01:37.870> we<00:01:38.290> lit<00:01:38.500> both<00:01:38.770> wicks<00:01:39.130> and

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
glasses next we lit both wicks and

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.390 
glasses next we lit both wicks and
observed<00:01:40.230> at<00:01:41.230> first<00:01:41.590> nothing<00:01:42.220> really

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
observed at first nothing really

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.140 
observed at first nothing really
happened<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.710> as<00:01:44.980> the<00:01:45.220> candle<00:01:45.550> began<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:46.000> burn

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
happened but as the candle began to burn

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.810 
happened but as the candle began to burn
down<00:01:46.540> it<00:01:46.870> slowly<00:01:47.350> started<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.920> tip<00:01:48.280> from<00:01:48.520> side

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
down it slowly started to tip from side

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
down it slowly started to tip from side
to<00:01:48.850> side<00:01:50.160> that's<00:01:51.160> because<00:01:51.610> each<00:01:51.820> end<00:01:52.210> takes<00:01:52.600> it

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
to side that's because each end takes it

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.450 
to side that's because each end takes it
in<00:01:52.990> turn<00:01:53.290> to<00:01:53.320> become<00:01:53.620> heavier<00:01:54.190> than<00:01:54.370> the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
in turn to become heavier than the

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.600 
in turn to become heavier than the
opposite<00:01:54.880> end<00:01:55.120> thus<00:01:55.810> tipping<00:01:56.350> downwards<00:01:56.860> when

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
opposite end thus tipping downwards when

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.090 
opposite end thus tipping downwards when
one<00:01:57.820> end<00:01:58.000> goes<00:01:58.300> down<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:59.050> melted<00:01:59.410> wax<00:01:59.620> drips

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
one end goes down the melted wax drips

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.190 
one end goes down the melted wax drips
out<00:02:00.340> making<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.060> lighter<00:02:01.330> than<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.780> other<00:02:01.930> end

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
out making it lighter than the other end

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.950 
out making it lighter than the other end
which<00:02:02.620> then<00:02:02.890> falls<00:02:03.250> then<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.300> same<00:02:04.510> happens

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
which then falls then the same happens

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.320 
which then falls then the same happens
to<00:02:05.110> that<00:02:05.290> end<00:02:05.620> and<00:02:05.890> so<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.430> seesaw<00:02:06.850> motion

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
to that end and so the seesaw motion

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.259 
to that end and so the seesaw motion
continues<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.979> also<00:02:09.129> found<00:02:09.579> that<00:02:09.879> not<00:02:10.209> only

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
continues we also found that not only

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.020 
continues we also found that not only
does<00:02:10.689> it<00:02:10.810> look<00:02:11.019> good<00:02:11.290> but

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
does it look good but

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.330 
does it look good but
can<00:02:12.150> use<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.720> hypnotize<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.230> brainiac<00:02:13.830> and

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
can use it to hypnotize a brainiac and

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:25.250 
can use it to hypnotize a brainiac and
make<00:02:14.520> him<00:02:14.700> think<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.910> aging<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.540> rugby<00:02:24.870> you

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
make him think so aging and rugby you

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.770 
make him think so aging and rugby you
can<00:02:25.560> burn<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.040> candle<00:02:26.340> at<00:02:26.430> both<00:02:26.490> ends<00:02:26.910> but<00:02:27.540> do

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
can burn the candle at both ends but do

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.479 
can burn the candle at both ends but do
