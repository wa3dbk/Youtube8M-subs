part<00:02:49.239> is<00:02:49.389> a<00:02:49.420> little<00:02:49.569> tricky<00:02:49.750> if<00:02:50.409> the<00:02:50.799> knife<00:02:50.980> can

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
part is a little tricky if the knife can

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.270 
part is a little tricky if the knife can
be<00:02:51.430> opened<00:02:52.060> with<00:02:52.209> one<00:02:52.239> hand<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.049> if<00:02:53.889> it<00:02:54.099> has

got some kind of locking mechanism then

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.879 
got some kind of locking mechanism then
you<00:02:57.010> are<00:02:57.129> not<00:02:57.340> allowed<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.909> carry<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.889> it's

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
prescription is based on two things

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.990 
prescription is based on two things
first<00:03:05.139> the<00:03:05.439> one-hand<00:03:05.799> opening<00:03:06.010> operation<00:03:06.819> and

first the one-hand opening operation and

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
second the locking blade in other words

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.050 
second the locking blade in other words
if<00:03:11.349> the<00:03:11.650> knife<00:03:11.829> has<00:03:12.099> got<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.340> liner<00:03:12.579> work<00:03:12.849> for

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
if the knife has got a liner work for

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.689 
if the knife has got a liner work for
example<00:03:13.540> but<00:03:14.109> can<00:03:14.379> only<00:03:14.560> be<00:03:14.769> opened<00:03:15.129> with<00:03:15.280> two

very controversial issue because with

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.819 
very controversial issue because with

was designed to be opened with two hands
a<00:03:33.449> good<00:03:34.449> example<00:03:34.810> is<00:03:35.049> this<00:03:35.290> one<00:03:35.349> here<00:03:36.239> the

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
a good example is this one here the

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.259 
a good example is this one here the
Excalibur<00:03:37.959> two<00:03:38.400> comes<00:03:39.400> with<00:03:39.669> an<00:03:39.790> alien<00:03:40.120> egg

Excalibur two comes with an alien egg

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.979 
Excalibur two comes with an alien egg
and<00:03:40.569> you<00:03:41.470> normally<00:03:41.709> would<00:03:42.099> open<00:03:42.459> it<00:03:42.549> like<00:03:42.729> this

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
and you normally would open it like this

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:49.530 
and you normally would open it like this
with<00:03:43.989> two<00:03:44.319> hands<00:03:44.709> right<00:03:46.439> but<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:49.180> could<00:03:49.359> also

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
with two hands right but you could also

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.949 
with two hands right but you could also
open<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.079> like<00:03:50.259> this<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:55.269> other<00:03:55.419> and<00:03:55.750> less

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
open it like this the other and less

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.699 
open it like this the other and less
controversial<00:03:56.859> option<00:03:57.430> is<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:59.049> knife<00:03:59.259> can<00:03:59.560> be

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
controversial option is the knife can be

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.729 
controversial option is the knife can be
opened<00:04:00.069> with<00:04:00.099> one<00:04:00.250> hand<00:04:00.729> but<00:04:01.720> doesn't<00:04:02.500> come

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689 
with the locking mechanism and this is

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.240 
with the locking mechanism and this is
where<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:04.989> Boca<00:04:05.229> knife<00:04:05.530> models<00:04:05.949> with<00:04:06.159> the
