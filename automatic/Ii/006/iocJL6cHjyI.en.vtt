00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.740
 we are dear 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.950
 by yves ollier this year the great 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.710
 take again 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.330
 on time 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.169
 who's going to come to the market this is the 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.660
 404 so this carbine presented and 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.030
 especially you will show the system 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.430
 for books all 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.980
 specificities of the carbine which is 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.699
 the ultimate evolution we will say beyond the 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.220
 range of flavors 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.550
 so he visually picks up a little 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.320
 little the principle of the 202 so with the 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.579
 curves a little bit but that brings 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.110
 a lot of news we will see in the 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.510
 detail all who has everything there is 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.640
 on it first thing very important 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.070
 she is endowed with a thanked by is 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.239
 so great for hunting for 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.519
 any security whatsoever for the 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.869
 beaten for the near what makes you 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.270
 wants to do close with a beautiful 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.520
 chambered and without the blow being 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.560
 from reminding the principle of 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.479
 to thank seemed that the spring of the 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.440
 striker is not energized so this 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.600
 which in case of a fall 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.070
 the cost can not or does not want 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.840
 leave so he sanctions very 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.610
 easily on the principle of what is 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.350
 done at other big brands very 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.869
 easily 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.450
 we can now tears without actuating 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.039
 punish him tears hour just in 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.049
 pressing a few millimeters 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.329
 we raise the breech and we can then 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.149
 get out the bullets second thing very 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.610
 important level security the head of 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.020
 breech of the 404 which is removable 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.000
 we will see that it presents a big 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.590
 interest afterwards is what allows 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.950
 out of the hunting season store 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.020
 his entire carbine so neutralize 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.490
 so we put the bolt head with its 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.390
 balls or in a corner we are on canvas 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.070
 to lose because that would be 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.479
 problematic but at least we can 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.430
 neutralize the remit that avoids that the 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.750
 children or people if there is a 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.750
 burglary for example one can get 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.939
 serve to re- serve it first thing 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.700
 very important the security aspect because 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.729
 that it's very important to hunting 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.380
 second thing the lock of the 404 which has 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.060
 was found in relation to that of the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.010
 descender which was certainly very good 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.630
 but here we really find the fluidity 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.299
 legendary mark that was on the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.750
 model 90 no very fluid lock that 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:25.150
 lets the pulls really repetitively a 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.930
 lock really find with a 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.120
 breech bolt that allows 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.370
 upper unit m so on the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.530
 chargers that come with the weapons 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.150
 serial so these three shots for the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.129
 middle cadets plus a shot in the 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.569
 room and for magnum cadets these 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.079
 two shots in the +5 loader or in 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.730
 bedroom 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.200
 after there are different versions of 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.239
 chargers that will be available with 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.230
 superior abilities to ride 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.540
 up to 5 + 1 in medium qualifications so 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.870
 this is a third very important point on 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.250
 the 404 this little universal tool that 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.180
 allow access to a lot of 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.819
 things on the rifle 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.980
 firstly we can very easily 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.510
 dismount the butt and the front so we 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.150
 can disassemble the butt we have access here 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.829
 we simply unscrew it allows to 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.269
 make the rifle much more compact 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.219
 if we want to wash in a backpack for 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.569
 go to the mountains good do a whole bunch 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.669
 of things to arrange in a briefcase 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.219
 is very easy and you can 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.840
 tinker with his rifle if I can say in 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.819
 hunting action in the trunk of his 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.709
 car really during the season 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.700
 what about a workshop with the gunsmith 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.590
 we can do it 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.700
 it really makes it accessible to everyone 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.650
 Hunters world 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.629
 disassembly of the rifle so we can 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.269
 remove the butt by unscrewing 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.510
 also dismount the front by doing 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.709
 just a quarter turn so that 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.030
 makes your rifle more 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.159
 compact but also we can go from one 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.470
 finish to each other with the same housing 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.879
 the same canet is people who have who 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.919
 are going to do pretty rough hunts 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.540
 if I can say that they will use 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.739
 synthetic and if they want to go in 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.329
 stilts more prestigious and we can 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.500
 to mount a very beautiful wood so in 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.810
 few seconds really a few 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.819
 seconds so this tool allows 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.379
 first to adjust the weight of 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.310
 start of the rifle very things 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:07.849
 important we can go from 550 which 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.439
 replaces expensive stadium 750 miles to the 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.790
 one thousand two hundred and fifty thousand two 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.919
 one hundred and fifty-one poc is enough 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.120
 important for the title beaten when by 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.070
 open example we have the fingers a little 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.889
 little numb not to make a swipe 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.239
 or blow all alone so we can 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.949
 simply adjust with the tool in 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.320
 turning one two three four big 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.150
 pumps at the start 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.650
 second thing this tool allows 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.990
 also to disassemble the cannon of the 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.430
 rifle so we can go from one 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.020
 gauge to another very easily 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.100
 as I said earlier in the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.990
 trunk of the car if we want to make 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.970
 the close in the morning and we're going to beat 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.730
 the day we can change cali 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.880
 go from a 243 to 1 962 in a few 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.010
 seconds we can find them in caliber 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.070
 there then a range of caliber that is 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.230
 quite important that goes from the 243 for the 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.910
 the mediums up to 375 in the 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.340
 magnum templates with all the great 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.740
 classics the 8,68 thesis lies its 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.480
 pace slipped ground and 338 for the 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.470
 qualum magnum and for all that is 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.150
 medium it's going to 243 him the 308 the 8 57 and 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.680
 a gauge to these demands and is out of 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.570
 common 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.340
 277 64 years 0.6 for all that glitters 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.170
 caciques and the 9-3 of course that means 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.570
 that someone who will hunt strengthened 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.160
 in europe to be able to use a template 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.470
 adapted and parallel go to africa 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.410
 also look Africa with the 3.75 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.850
 who is sturdy enough so just for 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.660
 show the disassembly one unlocks 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.180
 well on the breech 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.930
 that would really be really fast 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.600
 unlocks the three narrow no and one 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.910
 remove the barrel the barrel has a 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.880
 notch that allows to be positioned 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.460
 very easily in lax for the 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.500
 people who are not experts 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.970
 can mount the gun itself 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.290
 is locked and we go back into the barrel 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.010
 really in a few seconds without 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.010
 find all its simplicity 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.889
 I can ride any type 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:58.539
 optics on yes europe 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:01.449
 the case of the 404 and milling for 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:03.610
 come fit on a montage so I have 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.169
 a bezel right here with a montage 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.360
 which is available in rails 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.069
 so for all different brands and 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.870
 great races garros that for nice 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:16.750
 and in different diameters 30 34 36 with 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.729
 30 years old via met 30 up and down 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.159
 so we just position the assembly 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:25.090
 directly on the carcass on 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:27.639
 locks more of the mounting of the 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.039
 404 is that it is relatively low and 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.729
 that do not require to put a muscle 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.139
 on the rifle 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.509
 we are directly online is 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:36.759
 directly linked with last point 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:38.620
 important on the 404 that's the tail of 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:40.900
 relaxation that is adjustable 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:44.229
 we can move forward or backward more or 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.409
 least 8 mm tail of the rifle and 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:48.279
 5 degrees right or 5 degrees left 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:50.770
 so we can really 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:51.400
 perfectly fit the rifle at its 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.339
 morphology 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.349
 so we can make with all these 

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:58.529
 elements there rifle for the hunter 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:00.520
 each rifle for each shoe 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:02.940
 that means finally 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.680
 someone who is in the process of 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.229
 at 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:10.940
 company without a guitar full of shooting and 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:12.410
 in record time in record time 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.900
 so at four finishes for the moment 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.759
 classic synthetic like this one a 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.100
 synthetic version too much of an inch 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:21.280
 classic wood version in grade 2 a 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.870
 elegant wood version without grade 5 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.690
 so here I think next month 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.039
 we will discover this time the 404 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:32.289
 but in use 

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:32.289
 here after the boars thank you
