pushing<00:00:20.150> on<00:00:20.270> the<00:00:20.360> pedal<00:00:20.750> it's<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:21.619> chainstays

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
pushing on the pedal it's the chainstays

and the down tube to do most of the job

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.280 
and the down tube to do most of the job
of<00:00:24.890> preventing<00:00:25.520> any<00:00:25.910> sideways<00:00:26.599> swaying<00:00:27.020> of

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
of preventing any sideways swaying of

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.729 
of preventing any sideways swaying of
the<00:00:27.590> bottom<00:00:27.919> bracket<00:00:28.599> so<00:00:29.599> this<00:00:29.840> tube<00:00:30.200> has<00:00:30.529> to

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:30.739 
the bottom bracket so this tube has to

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.270 
the bottom bracket so this tube has to
perform<00:00:30.950> two<00:00:31.630> major<00:00:32.630> tasks<00:00:33.260> first<00:00:33.649> of<00:00:33.829> all<00:00:34.010> it

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
perform two major tasks first of all it

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.060 
perform two major tasks first of all it
has<00:00:34.730> to<00:00:34.760> withstand<00:00:35.059> torsion<00:00:35.960> which<00:00:36.140> it<00:00:36.830> does

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
has to withstand torsion which it does

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.520 
has to withstand torsion which it does
by<00:00:37.340> having<00:00:37.670> as<00:00:37.790> round<00:00:38.240> the<00:00:38.480> shape<00:00:38.750> as<00:00:38.960> possible

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
by having as round the shape as possible

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.100 
by having as round the shape as possible
at<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.220> same<00:00:40.460> time<00:00:40.730> for<00:00:41.480> this<00:00:41.570> sideways

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
at the same time for this sideways

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.770 
at the same time for this sideways
bending<00:00:42.740> you<00:00:43.190> need<00:00:43.340> a<00:00:43.370> lot<00:00:43.670> of<00:00:43.700> material<00:00:44.390> as

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
bending you need a lot of material as

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.140 
bending you need a lot of material as
far<00:00:45.410> away<00:00:45.590> from<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.340> center<00:00:46.730> plane<00:00:46.970> as

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
far away from the center plane as

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.570 
far away from the center plane as
possible<00:00:47.690> so<00:00:48.410> you<00:00:48.440> do<00:00:48.620> that<00:00:48.800> by<00:00:49.010> flattening

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
possible so you do that by flattening

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.850 
possible so you do that by flattening
the<00:00:49.730> sides<00:00:50.000> by<00:00:50.300> having<00:00:50.540> a<00:00:50.600> flat<00:00:50.870> side<00:00:51.170> rather

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
the sides by having a flat side rather

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.470 
the sides by having a flat side rather
than<00:00:52.040> having<00:00:52.340> these<00:00:52.520> edges<00:00:52.940> go<00:00:53.090> inward

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
than having these edges go inward

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.930 
than having these edges go inward
immediately<00:00:54.080> you<00:00:54.470> keep<00:00:54.710> more<00:00:54.920> material<00:00:55.490> far

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
immediately you keep more material far

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.240 
immediately you keep more material far
from<00:00:56.240> that<00:00:56.390> center<00:00:56.810> line<00:00:56.860> working<00:00:57.860> very<00:00:58.130> hard

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
from that center line working very hard

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.610 
from that center line working very hard
to<00:00:58.640> withstand<00:00:58.820> that<00:00:59.210> bending<00:00:59.660> another<00:01:00.410> thing

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
to withstand that bending another thing

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.500 
to withstand that bending another thing
that<00:01:00.650> the<00:01:00.890> flatness<00:01:01.370> does<00:01:01.579> is<00:01:01.790> it<00:01:02.120> gives<00:01:02.329> you<00:01:02.480> a

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
that the flatness does is it gives you a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.229 
that the flatness does is it gives you a
good<00:01:02.720> space<00:01:03.050> in<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:03.920> layup<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:04.850> put<00:01:05.030> some

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
good space in the layup to put some

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.960 
good space in the layup to put some
extra<00:01:05.360> layers<00:01:05.869> of<00:01:06.140> unidirectional<00:01:06.979> carbon<00:01:07.640> in

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
extra layers of unidirectional carbon in

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.999 
extra layers of unidirectional carbon in
this<00:01:08.210> direction<00:01:08.390> where<00:01:09.259> they're<00:01:09.439> working<00:01:09.890> the

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
this direction where they're working the

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.190 
this direction where they're working the
hardest<00:01:10.219> to<00:01:11.030> prevent<00:01:11.359> that<00:01:11.479> bending<00:01:11.929> so<00:01:12.109> you

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
hardest to prevent that bending so you

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.709 
hardest to prevent that bending so you
need<00:01:12.319> very<00:01:12.499> little<00:01:12.649> material<00:01:13.270> but<00:01:14.270> in<00:01:14.479> a

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
need very little material but in a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.679 
need very little material but in a
strategically<00:01:15.200> placed<00:01:15.579> spot<00:01:16.579> to<00:01:17.299> prevent

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
strategically placed spot to prevent

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.899 
strategically placed spot to prevent
that<00:01:17.840> bending<00:01:18.319> what<00:01:19.039> that<00:01:19.189> does<00:01:19.340> it<00:01:19.490> gives<00:01:19.759> you

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
that bending what that does it gives you

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.389 
that bending what that does it gives you
a<00:01:19.939> very<00:01:20.240> light<00:01:20.600> tube<00:01:20.929> with<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.740> ability<00:01:22.280> that

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
a very light tube with the ability that

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.730 
a very light tube with the ability that
withstand<00:01:22.789> the<00:01:23.030> bending<00:01:23.420> very<00:01:23.630> well<00:01:23.869> and<00:01:24.079> also

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
withstand the bending very well and also

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.919 
withstand the bending very well and also
the<00:01:25.100> torsion<00:01:25.609> because<00:01:26.149> most<00:01:26.450> of<00:01:26.569> the<00:01:26.659> tubes

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
the torsion because most of the tubes

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.800 
the torsion because most of the tubes
are<00:01:27.200> fairly<00:01:28.159> round<00:01:28.609> and<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:29.090> they're<00:01:29.240> able<00:01:29.450> to

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
are fairly round and so they're able to

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.649 
are fairly round and so they're able to
withstand<00:01:30.069> those<00:01:31.119> torsional<00:01:32.119> stresses<00:01:32.450> that

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
withstand those torsional stresses that

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.410 
withstand those torsional stresses that
go<00:01:32.959> through<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.409> two<00:01:33.619> you<00:01:34.579> also<00:01:34.909> notice<00:01:35.270> from

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
go through the two you also notice from

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.649 
go through the two you also notice from
the<00:01:35.569> side<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:36.109> the<00:01:36.920> exact<00:01:37.700> dimension<00:01:38.359> of<00:01:38.509> the

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
tape of the tube changes as we go from

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.289 
tape of the tube changes as we go from

the head tube to the bottom bracket and
that's<00:01:44.840> done<00:01:45.109> because<00:01:45.499> at<00:01:45.679> every<00:01:45.799> cross

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
that's done because at every cross

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.309 
that's done because at every cross
section<00:01:46.729> of<00:01:46.819> the<00:01:46.909> tube<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.659> stresses<00:01:48.139> are<00:01:48.289> a

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
section of the tube the stresses are a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.739 
section of the tube the stresses are a
little<00:01:48.649> bit<00:01:48.920> different<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:49.999> in<00:01:50.209> every<00:01:50.329> cross

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
little bit different so in every cross

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.649 
little bit different so in every cross
section<00:01:51.289> we<00:01:51.799> change<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.310> shape<00:01:52.520> slightly<00:01:52.939> to

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
section we change the shape slightly to

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.019 
section we change the shape slightly to
optimize<00:01:54.319> how<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.799> withstand<00:01:55.219> those<00:01:55.639> stresses

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:56.029 
optimize how to withstand those stresses

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:58.449 
optimize how to withstand those stresses
and<00:01:56.600> make<00:01:56.810> sure<00:01:57.049> that<00:01:57.350> we<00:01:57.469> get<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:58.219> lowest

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
and make sure that we get the lowest

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.239 
and make sure that we get the lowest
weight<00:01:58.850> with<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.630> highest<00:02:00.249> torsion
