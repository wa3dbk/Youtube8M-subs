00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:09.560
 super gt 4th game Fuji makeup was a hard weekend 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.370
 Among them the team is English 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:17.860
 Though we challenge on season and thought base 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:21.070
 Sekiguchi d Thank you very much for last week 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:25.420
 I had a slightly longer stint run a 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:33.310
 It was a tough race though I had Sugijima 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:36.320
 Just for us Qualifying swing warehouse building 2 and this time I can not have much ring 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:40.250
 You have taken 3 channel points so far 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.900
 This severe Fuji also managed to place Dahua really really more and more high to take a point 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.530
 I want to aim for 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:49.400
 Somehow dress figure with intention want to take 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:54.200
 It could be said that 10 inches point 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.150
 The first part is a start from last year, but the first part is a car from the car department 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.990
 a 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.980
 Somehow it gradually gradually, which had a hard time by various Toka is a matching of the tire 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.720
 Advance 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.720
 Sekiguchi's speed is 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:22.990
 Also it is booby route also really hard to enter while re staring at the rider color of 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.479
 Four 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:31.110
 The result was a tough race but I was able to race in my own 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.110
 Honest 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:45.550
 I feel like I can booze 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:48.280
 My own to Leh in his book that until a strong day red Anjuri tree and a 1 this 1 groups now 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.030
 I'm satisfied because I've slept 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.040
 But this run this time 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:58.940
 How can I get in the car until now that I want to do something like this for the next time 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.850
 I could not put it down, but it was terrific to say that it would be better to go ahead with five of these cars 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.960
 It was a race that started to feel 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:10.050
 While doing the race, it is a full true seat position or various places 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:14.520
 The team staff change until late and Ryuji players 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:18.210
 Seat position I'm going to be with you guys 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.380
 There is also advice of Ken terribly and do a lot of things 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.980
 Not just the palm of your hand 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.620
 It was a race that came to feel the behavior of the car on the back 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.920
 a 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:34.140
 The point we are aiming for is more than that 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:39.930
 I'm up for the second meeting in the bad this time and I raise the tension 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:43.409
 However, I think that being able to get in a car will be very positive for the future 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.560
 I think there are many elements that I still do not turn to myself 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.800
 In the up line of this year 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.239
 The team and I was good to use 11 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.260
 Let's watch the performance that seems to be Lexus Air Yokohama Tire 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.870
 I think I want 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.319
 a 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:04.170
 If I say something like that with all my mind today, I will say something 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:08.849
 And was able to say you Moso but that is what the was painful results was the weekend found 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:14.860
 That means it's so fortunate for me now and now for me 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:20.110
 To all of you who helped to find this hook 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.310
 Thank you and the impact of jumping sports or something when I'm running 300 people 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.930
 Me against the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:29.140
 Or what do I I feel like how to transfer it is just to say the extremely polite to Osawa 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.120

 In Kataoka of Hatsune Miku when was about to be overtaken by 30 people of Shuka 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:47.730
