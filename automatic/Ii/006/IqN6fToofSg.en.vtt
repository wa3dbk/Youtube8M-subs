slow I had to start a rebuild for 125
dollars<00:02:39.050> in<00:02:39.170> one<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.380> those<00:02:39.470> places<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.980> they

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
dollars in one of those places that they

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.220 
dollars in one of those places that they

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
rebuild starters and alternators so

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.140 
rebuild starters and alternators so
anyway<00:02:42.950> just<00:02:43.190> an<00:02:43.280> idea<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.670> save<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:43.970> some

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
anyway just an idea to save you some

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.270 
anyway just an idea to save you some
money<00:02:44.270> but<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.410> just<00:02:45.560> doesn't<00:02:45.770> get<00:02:46.010> any<00:02:46.070> more

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
money but it just doesn't get any more

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.350 
money but it just doesn't get any more
simplistic<00:02:46.880> than<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.930> uh<00:02:49.150> your<00:02:50.150> oil

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
simplistic than that and uh your oil

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.530 
simplistic than that and uh your oil
filter<00:02:51.459> here<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.489> that's<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.060> course<00:02:53.090> we<00:02:53.390> put

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
filter here and that's of course we put

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.680 
filter here and that's of course we put
old<00:02:53.840> in<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:55.070> breather<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.730> mean<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.360> know<00:02:56.450> it's

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
old in the breather I mean you know it's

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.100 
old in the breather I mean you know it's
very<00:02:56.750> accessible<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:58.330> this<00:02:59.330> is<00:02:59.840> an<00:02:59.959> old

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
tractor that's that's been used now it

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.449 
tractor that's that's been used now it
works<00:03:02.930> really<00:03:03.440> good<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.739> it's<00:03:04.070> tough<00:03:04.280> as

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
works really good and it's tough as

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.729 
works really good and it's tough as
nails<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.239> if<00:03:05.300> I<00:03:05.420> run<00:03:05.690> into<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.019> tree<00:03:06.350> with<00:03:06.560> it

or you know something like that I mean

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.650 
or you know something like that I mean
that's<00:03:10.220> what<00:03:10.430> it's<00:03:10.550> made<00:03:10.670> for<00:03:10.940> that's<00:03:11.450> what<00:03:11.630> I

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
that's what it's made for that's what I

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.140 
that's what it's made for that's what I
use<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:12.050> for<00:03:12.880> now

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
use it for now

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.210 
use it for now

this is the injector pump and you see
how<00:03:20.030> easy<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:20.780> get<00:03:20.930> too<00:03:22.600> simplistic

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
how easy it is to get too simplistic

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.380 
how easy it is to get too simplistic
easy<00:03:25.450> rugged<00:03:27.040> anyway<00:03:28.040> so<00:03:28.519> that's<00:03:28.640> my<00:03:28.850> advice

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
easy rugged anyway so that's my advice
