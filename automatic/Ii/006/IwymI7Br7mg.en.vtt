start by talking about what's on the

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.150 
start by talking about what's on the
inside<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.910> your<00:00:09.240> alienware<00:00:09.870> steam<00:00:10.380> box<00:00:10.590> yeah

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
inside of your alienware steam box yeah

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.650 
inside of your alienware steam box yeah
so<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.700> other<00:00:11.880> words<00:00:12.030> steam<00:00:12.240> machine<00:00:12.509> will

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
so the other words steam machine will

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.780 
so the other words steam machine will
renounce<00:00:12.929> in<00:00:13.170> here<00:00:13.290> at<00:00:13.349> CES<00:00:13.500> said<00:00:14.400> i<00:00:14.429> will<00:00:14.610> have

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
renounce in here at CES said i will have

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.390 
renounce in here at CES said i will have
intel<00:00:15.269> processors<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.080> nvidia<00:00:16.410> graphics<00:00:16.859> so

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
intel processors and nvidia graphics so

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.680 
intel processors and nvidia graphics so
we're<00:00:17.550> not<00:00:17.640> met<00:00:17.880> we're<00:00:18.060> not<00:00:18.210> talking<00:00:18.660> about

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
we're not met we're not talking about

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.720 
we're not met we're not talking about
the<00:00:18.990> specific<00:00:19.470> components<00:00:19.949> we're<00:00:20.490> still<00:00:20.640> in

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the specific components we're still in

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.370 
the specific components we're still in
the<00:00:20.789> process<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:21.449> seeing<00:00:22.080> all<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.260> different

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the process of seeing all the different

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.840 
the process of seeing all the different
iterations<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:23.490> make<00:00:23.670> combinations

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
iterations that we can make combinations

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.029 
iterations that we can make combinations
of<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.869> come<00:00:25.019> out<00:00:25.140> with<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.380> right<00:00:25.529> solution

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
of to come out with the right solution

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.220 
of to come out with the right solution
but<00:00:26.490> we<00:00:26.609> do<00:00:26.760> know<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.180> intel<00:00:27.449> processor<00:00:28.050> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
but we do know the intel processor and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.099 
but we do know the intel processor and
nvidia<00:00:28.890> graphics<00:00:29.310> based<00:00:29.630> what<00:00:30.630> went<00:00:30.810> into<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
nvidia graphics based what went into the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.709 
nvidia graphics based what went into the
actual<00:00:31.380> design<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.800> your<00:00:32.040> box<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.480> really

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
actual design of your box so it really

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.360 
actual design of your box so it really
is<00:00:33.809> optimized<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.530> fit<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> living<00:00:35.219> room

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
is optimized to fit in the living room

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.190 
is optimized to fit in the living room
but<00:00:35.520> we<00:00:35.670> went<00:00:35.910> into<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.360> knowing<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.079> we

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
but we went into this knowing is that we

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.020 
but we went into this knowing is that we
want<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.489> fit<00:00:38.700> with<00:00:38.850> other

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
want it to be to fit with other

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.569 
want it to be to fit with other
components<00:00:39.660> whether<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.309> blu-ray<00:00:41.309> player

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
components whether it's blu-ray player

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.580 
components whether it's blu-ray player
whether<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.120> cable<00:00:42.450> box<00:00:42.480> even<00:00:43.140> another

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
whether it's a cable box even another

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.740 
whether it's a cable box even another
console<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.579> want<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.000> fit<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.450> kind

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
console we want this to fit in that kind

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.900 
console we want this to fit in that kind
of<00:00:45.870> setting<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.920> physical<00:00:47.340> design<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
of setting so the physical design of the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.729 
of setting so the physical design of the
product<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.629> actually<00:00:48.809> smaller<00:00:49.050> than<00:00:49.469> what

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
product is actually smaller than what

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.880 
product is actually smaller than what
you<00:00:49.829> see<00:00:49.980> today<00:00:50.010> from<00:00:50.399> an<00:00:50.550> xbox<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.090> or<00:00:51.120> ps4

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
you see today from an xbox one or ps4

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.979 
you see today from an xbox one or ps4
when<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:52.980> comes<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.670> current<00:00:54.180> ecosystem

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
when it comes to the current ecosystem

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.920 
when it comes to the current ecosystem
where<00:00:55.170> do<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.410> see<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.610> steam<00:00:56.850> machine

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
where do you see the steam machine

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.439 
where do you see the steam machine
fitting<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.649> hardcore<00:00:59.070> PC<00:00:59.250> gamer<00:00:59.579> so

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
fitting in with the hardcore PC gamer so

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.240 
fitting in with the hardcore PC gamer so
I<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.050> inward<00:01:01.379> steam<00:01:01.590> machine<00:01:01.890> fitting

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
I see the inward steam machine fitting

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.100 
I see the inward steam machine fitting
in<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:03.090> place<00:01:03.329> where<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.780> haven't<00:01:03.989> had<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
in in a place where we haven't had a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.840 
in in a place where we haven't had a
product<00:01:04.470> before<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.280> our<00:01:05.309> full<00:01:05.610> tower

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
product before so we have our full tower

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.940 
product before so we have our full tower
desktops<00:01:06.390> which<00:01:07.049> are<00:01:07.229> full<00:01:07.740> blown

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
desktops which are full blown

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.320 
desktops which are full blown
performance<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.700> anything<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.090> want

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
performance you can do anything you want

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.170 
performance you can do anything you want
with<00:01:09.390> them<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.810> small<00:01:10.350> form<00:01:10.619> factor<00:01:10.680> x<00:01:11.130> 51<00:01:11.640> that

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
with them a small form factor x 51 that

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.550 
with them a small form factor x 51 that
gives<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> lot<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.750> performance<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
gives you a lot of performance but in a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.320 
gives you a lot of performance but in a
smaller<00:01:13.680> box<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.340> then<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:14.970> our<00:01:15.090> steam

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
smaller box and then we have our steam

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.780 
smaller box and then we have our steam
machine<00:01:15.689> which<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.380> really<00:01:16.740> small<00:01:17.070> optimized

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
machine which is really small optimized

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.550 
machine which is really small optimized
to<00:01:18.150> fit<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> living<00:01:18.930> room<00:01:19.020> setting<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.470> if

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
to fit in a living room setting so if

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.260 
to fit in a living room setting so if
you're<00:01:19.680> looking<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:19.979> more<00:01:20.189> performance<00:01:20.729> you

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
you're looking for more performance you

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.910 
you're looking for more performance you
have<00:01:21.420> different<00:01:21.689> options<00:01:21.990> from<00:01:22.380> alienware

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
have different options from alienware

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.859 
have different options from alienware
and<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.430> will<00:01:23.580> be<00:01:23.729> installing<00:01:23.939> steam<00:01:24.390> OS<00:01:24.570> on

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
and we will be installing steam OS on

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.440 
and we will be installing steam OS on
our<00:01:25.320> desktops<00:01:25.740> moving<00:01:26.070> forward<00:01:26.369> how<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.299> you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
our desktops moving forward how do you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.010 
our desktops moving forward how do you
see<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.320> steam<00:01:29.100> box<00:01:29.329> impacting<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.630> current

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
see the steam box impacting the current

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.859 
see the steam box impacting the current
next-generation<00:01:31.380> console<00:01:32.159> systems<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.060> think

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
next-generation console systems I think

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.020 
next-generation console systems I think
it<00:01:33.960> gives<00:01:34.110> gamers<00:01:34.350> another<00:01:35.009> option<00:01:35.520> right<00:01:35.729> so

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
it gives gamers another option right so

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.090 
it gives gamers another option right so
from<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.630> pc<00:01:36.990> perspective<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.979> to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
from a pc perspective it's going to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.910 
from a pc perspective it's going to
enable<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:39.150> playing<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:40.320> their<00:01:40.650> entire
