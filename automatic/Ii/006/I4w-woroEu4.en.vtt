00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.489 

this<00:01:30.179> connection<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:30.990> sometimes

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:31.499 
this connection can be sometimes

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:33.139 
this connection can be sometimes
difficult<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:32.189> remove<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.909> take<00:01:33.119> a

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
difficult to remove but if you take a

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.940 
difficult to remove but if you take a
screwdriver<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.990> some<00:01:34.140> white<00:01:34.350> lithium<00:01:34.799> on

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
it and you just slide it into the boot

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.289 
it and you just slide it into the boot
work<00:01:37.590> your<00:01:38.340> way<00:01:38.460> around<00:01:38.609> it<00:01:38.939> I've<00:01:39.119> already

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
work your way around it I've already

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.120 
work your way around it I've already
done<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.810> before<00:01:40.289> when<00:01:40.649> I<00:01:40.679> was<00:01:40.829> playing

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130

around<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.450> vehicle<00:01:42.929> so<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.740> already

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
around with this vehicle so it's already

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.980 
around with this vehicle so it's already
got<00:01:44.130> some<00:01:44.340> grease<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.789> it<00:01:45.179> just<00:01:45.240> helps<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
got some grease on it it just helps to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.440 
got some grease on it it just helps to
work<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.069> plastic<00:01:47.609> piece<00:01:47.789> free<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.299> don't

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
work this plastic piece free you don't

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.090 
work this plastic piece free you don't
want<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> break<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.869> part<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:52.100> these

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
want to break that part there and these

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.020 
want to break that part there and these
clamps<00:01:53.520> are<00:01:53.789> eight<00:01:54.299> mil<00:01:54.539> we're<00:01:58.520> better<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.850> use

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
clamps are eight mil we're better to use

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.770 
clamps are eight mil we're better to use
a<00:02:00.590> wobble<00:02:01.590> tool<00:02:01.829> like<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:02.639> this<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> hazard

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
a wobble tool like this this is a hazard

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.870 
a wobble tool like this this is a hazard
tool<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.369> as<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> part<00:02:05.880> number<00:02:06.179> on<00:02:06.359> it<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.659> not

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
tool of it as a part number on it or not

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.380 
tool of it as a part number on it or not
now<00:02:08.880> let's<00:02:09.179> see<00:02:09.330> what<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.509> wear<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.080> wore<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.619> off

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
now let's see what I wear I wore it off

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
now let's see what I wear I wore it off
over<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.690> years<00:02:12.720> I've<00:02:13.080> had<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:13.470> tool<00:02:13.850> and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
over the years I've had this tool and

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.380 
over the years I've had this tool and
basically<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.620> can<00:02:16.800> get<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> wobble<00:02:17.430> extension

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
basically you can get a wobble extension

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.309 
basically you can get a wobble extension
that<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.740> can<00:02:20.160> put<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> quarter<00:02:21.150> inch<00:02:21.360> socket

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
that you can put a quarter inch socket

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.100 
that you can put a quarter inch socket
on<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:22.950> one's<00:02:23.220> all<00:02:23.400> one<00:02:23.580> piece<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.840> don't

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
on this one's all one piece so I don't

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.190 
on this one's all one piece so I don't
have<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.290> worry<00:02:25.470> about<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.830> ends<00:02:26.070> falling<00:02:26.430> off

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
have to worry about the ends falling off

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.800 
have to worry about the ends falling off
and<00:02:27.349> it<00:02:28.099> fits<00:02:28.370> perfectly<00:02:28.879> onto<00:02:29.150> these<00:02:29.420> clamps

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
and it fits perfectly onto these clamps

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.990 
and it fits perfectly onto these clamps
I<00:02:30.970> believe<00:02:31.970> that's<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:33.250> sari<00:02:34.250> that's<00:02:34.519> actually

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
I believe that's a sari that's actually

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.970 
I believe that's a sari that's actually
a<00:02:35.030> six<00:02:35.720> millimeter<00:02:35.959> not<00:02:36.440> an<00:02:36.590> eight<00:02:36.739> millimeter

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
a six millimeter not an eight millimeter

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.600 
a six millimeter not an eight millimeter
on<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.819> end<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:38.769> these<00:02:39.769> clamps<00:02:40.040> are<00:02:40.250> actually

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
on this end so these clamps are actually

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.040 
on this end so these clamps are actually
six<00:02:40.849> millimeter<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:44.480> next<00:02:44.750> step<00:02:44.930> would

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
six millimeter and the next step would

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.050 
six millimeter and the next step would
be<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.230> take<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.650> clamp<00:02:45.920> off<00:02:46.099> the<00:02:46.160> back<00:02:46.489> -<00:02:46.790> that

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
be to take the clamp off the back - that

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.080 
be to take the clamp off the back - that
makes<00:02:47.300> this<00:02:47.900> tool<00:02:48.140> makes<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.440> easy<00:02:48.880> just<00:02:49.880> have

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
makes this tool makes it easy just have

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
makes this tool makes it easy just have
to<00:02:50.239> loosen<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.690> up

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
to loosen that up

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.259 
to loosen that up
sometimes<00:02:51.530> these<00:02:51.680> clamps<00:02:52.010> are<00:02:52.220> facing<00:02:52.670> ways

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
sometimes these clamps are facing ways

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.180 
sometimes these clamps are facing ways
where<00:02:53.660> it's<00:02:53.780> difficult<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.290> get<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.500> that's

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
where it's difficult to get to that's

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.559 
where it's difficult to get to that's
why<00:02:55.400> these<00:02:55.459> wobble<00:02:55.970> tools<00:02:56.180> are<00:02:56.360> nice

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
why these wobble tools are nice

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.620 
why these wobble tools are nice
especially<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:58.610> one<00:02:58.790> down<00:02:58.970> for<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.330> throttle

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
especially the one down for the throttle

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.449 
especially the one down for the throttle
that<00:03:00.019> way<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.230> can<00:03:00.440> sneak<00:03:00.709> in<00:03:00.920> here<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.250> and

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
that way you can sneak in here and and

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.750 
that way you can sneak in here and and
actually<00:03:02.209> get<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.480> good<00:03:02.780> angle<00:03:03.019> when<00:03:03.500> you're

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
actually get a good angle when you're

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.890 
actually get a good angle when you're
taking<00:03:04.760> those<00:03:04.849> off<00:03:05.290> so<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:06.950> should<00:03:07.160> be<00:03:07.190> loose

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
taking those off so this should be loose

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.089 
taking those off so this should be loose
basically<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:08.989> just<00:03:09.019> have<00:03:09.349> to<00:03:09.500> work<00:03:09.680> afraid

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
basically you just have to work afraid

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.550 
basically you just have to work afraid
there's<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.760> plastic<00:03:11.239> retaining<00:03:11.840> ring<00:03:12.170> between

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
there's a plastic retaining ring between

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.759 
there's a plastic retaining ring between
this<00:03:13.310> boot<00:03:13.579> and<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.329> next<00:03:14.810> rata<00:03:15.079> loop<00:03:15.349> which

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
this boot and the next rata loop which

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.130 
this boot and the next rata loop which
goes<00:03:15.980> down<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.519> throttle<00:03:16.849> itself<00:03:17.180> so<00:03:17.959> it

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
goes down to the throttle itself so it

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.110 
goes down to the throttle itself so it
just<00:03:18.349> have<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.739> work<00:03:19.069> this<00:03:19.250> free<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.880> lot<00:03:20.000> of

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
just have to work this free a lot of

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.690 
just have to work this free a lot of
times<00:03:20.329> they'll<00:03:20.599> just<00:03:20.900> pop<00:03:21.170> off<00:03:21.549> sometimes<00:03:22.549> you

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
times they'll just pop off sometimes you

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.160 
times they'll just pop off sometimes you
have<00:03:22.849> to<00:03:22.970> get<00:03:23.120> in<00:03:23.269> there<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.510> persuade<00:03:23.959> them<00:03:24.110> a

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
have to get in there and persuade them a

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.940 
have to get in there and persuade them a
little<00:03:24.410> bit<00:03:24.560> but<00:03:25.450> okay<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:27.349> that's<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.769> right

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
little bit but okay so that's it right

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.699 
little bit but okay so that's it right
there

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
there

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.420 
there
and<00:03:31.750> this<00:03:32.750> is<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.139> plastic<00:03:33.680> ring<00:03:33.920> now<00:03:34.400> I

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
and this is that plastic ring now I

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.970 
and this is that plastic ring now I
didn't<00:03:34.790> touch<00:03:34.970> this<00:03:35.209> clamp<00:03:35.569> here<00:03:35.870> this<00:03:36.650> clamp

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
didn't touch this clamp here this clamp

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.900 
didn't touch this clamp here this clamp
is<00:03:37.190> only<00:03:37.459> holding<00:03:37.970> on<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.269> plastic<00:03:38.810> ring

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
is only holding on this plastic ring

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.750 
is only holding on this plastic ring
which<00:03:40.910> I<00:03:41.209> don't<00:03:41.359> even<00:03:41.540> have<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:41.989> touch<00:03:42.609> so<00:03:43.609> I'm

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
which I don't even have to touch so I'm

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.460 
which I don't even have to touch so I'm
not<00:03:43.880> going<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.090> loosen<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:44.630> second<00:03:45.260> clamp

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
not going to loosen that second clamp

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.800 
not going to loosen that second clamp
you<00:03:45.650> actually<00:03:45.920> have<00:03:46.040> two<00:03:46.250> clamps<00:03:46.730> right<00:03:47.480> next

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
you actually have two clamps right next

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.360 
you actually have two clamps right next
to<00:03:47.900> each<00:03:48.019> other<00:03:48.200> that's<00:03:48.530> probably<00:03:48.980> still<00:03:49.220> in

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
to each other that's probably still in

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.979 
to each other that's probably still in
the<00:03:49.459> original<00:03:49.850> factory<00:03:50.060> position<00:03:50.780> because

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
the original factory position because

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:57.629 
the original factory position because
there's<00:03:51.139> no<00:03:51.400> reason<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.430> replace<00:03:52.850> that<00:03:56.290> so

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
there's no reason to replace that so

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:09.010 
there's no reason to replace that so
here's<00:03:58.639> my<00:03:58.850> new<00:03:59.000> part<00:04:00.519> swap<00:04:01.519> my<00:04:01.670> clamp<00:04:01.940> over

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.600 

it's<00:04:09.530> amazing<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.040> difference<00:04:10.400> in

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
it's amazing the difference in

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.240 
it's amazing the difference in
suppleness<00:04:11.240> between<00:04:11.810> this<00:04:12.590> one<00:04:12.830> here<00:04:13.070> which

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
suppleness between this one here which

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.670 
suppleness between this one here which
is<00:04:13.360> probably<00:04:14.360> original<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:16.370> new<00:04:16.400> one

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
is probably original and the new one

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.500 
is probably original and the new one
make<00:04:18.680> sure<00:04:18.830> your<00:04:18.980> clamps<00:04:19.310> are<00:04:19.430> facing<00:04:19.910> in<00:04:20.060> a

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
make sure your clamps are facing in a

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.650 
make sure your clamps are facing in a
direction<00:04:21.080> that<00:04:21.230> you<00:04:21.410> have<00:04:21.620> easy<00:04:22.070> access<00:04:22.660> to

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
direction that you have easy access to

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.290 
direction that you have easy access to
go<00:04:23.840> ahead<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:24.200> tighten<00:04:24.380> those<00:04:24.620> up<00:04:25.030> you<00:04:26.030> can

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
go ahead and tighten those up you can

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.820 
go ahead and tighten those up you can
put<00:04:26.600> a<00:04:26.630> little<00:04:26.870> bit<00:04:26.990> of<00:04:27.110> white<00:04:27.260> lithium<00:04:27.680> on

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
put a little bit of white lithium on

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.820 
put a little bit of white lithium on
this<00:04:28.010> if<00:04:28.130> you<00:04:28.250> want<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:31.840> push<00:04:32.840> that<00:04:33.020> in<00:04:33.200> place

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
this if you want to push that in place

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.150 
this if you want to push that in place
shoots<00:04:34.100> light<00:04:34.400> right<00:04:34.610> over<00:04:38.350> okay<00:04:39.350> and<00:04:40.010> you

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
shoots light right over okay and you

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.830 
shoots light right over okay and you
want<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.430> make<00:04:40.580> sure<00:04:40.610> that<00:04:40.880> you<00:04:41.000> turn<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:41.570> so

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
want to make sure that you turn it so

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.470 
want to make sure that you turn it so
that<00:04:42.670> this<00:04:43.670> is<00:04:44.600> going<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:44.930> fit<00:04:45.230> with<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:47.270> air

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
that this is going to fit with the air

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.860 
that this is going to fit with the air
filter<00:04:47.900> box<00:04:48.310> now<00:04:49.310> you<00:04:49.400> could<00:04:49.810> install<00:04:50.810> it

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
filter box now you could install it

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.480 
filter box now you could install it
really<00:04:51.260> any<00:04:51.440> direction<00:04:51.830> you<00:04:51.980> want

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
really any direction you want

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.400 
really any direction you want
so<00:04:52.880> just<00:04:53.120> eyeball<00:04:53.510> it<00:04:53.540> so<00:04:53.720> that<00:04:54.050> it's<00:04:54.200> nice<00:04:54.380> and

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
so just eyeball it so that it's nice and

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.190 
so just eyeball it so that it's nice and
straight<00:04:54.710> so<00:04:55.340> you<00:04:55.400> have<00:04:55.580> easy<00:04:55.880> fit<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.080> air
