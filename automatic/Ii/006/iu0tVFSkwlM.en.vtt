benefits<00:00:56.690> of<00:00:57.199> using<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:57.710> perspective<00:00:58.370> is

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
benefits of using the perspective is

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.340 
benefits of using the perspective is
that<00:00:58.760> it<00:00:59.000> cuts<00:00:59.330> the<00:00:59.570> dose<00:00:59.780> in<00:01:00.019> half

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
that it cuts the dose in half

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.079 
that it cuts the dose in half
she<00:01:00.739> actually<00:01:00.860> explained<00:01:01.519> that<00:01:01.699> this<00:01:01.850> was<00:01:02.059> a

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
she actually explained that this was a

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.990 
she actually explained that this was a
newer<00:01:02.390> CT<00:01:03.140> scanner<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:03.769> that<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:04.430> was<00:01:04.640> much

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
newer CT scanner and that it was much

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.180 
newer CT scanner and that it was much
more<00:01:05.239> efficient<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.049> that<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.799> radiation

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
more efficient and that the radiation

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.640 
more efficient and that the radiation
dose<00:01:07.549> was<00:01:07.850> less<00:01:08.180> than<00:01:08.510> what<00:01:08.720> CT<00:01:09.110> scanners<00:01:09.500> in

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
dose was less than what CT scanners in

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.289 
dose was less than what CT scanners in
the<00:01:09.740> past<00:01:09.979> had<00:01:10.220> been<00:01:10.430> she<00:01:10.790> said<00:01:10.820> it<00:01:11.060> would<00:01:11.180> be

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
the past had been she said it would be

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.750 
the past had been she said it would be
much<00:01:11.450> more<00:01:11.690> quick<00:01:11.960> than<00:01:12.380> other<00:01:12.770> types<00:01:13.190> of<00:01:13.370> CT

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
much more quick than other types of CT

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.640 
much more quick than other types of CT
scanners<00:01:14.240> that<00:01:14.479> made<00:01:14.810> me<00:01:14.930> feel<00:01:15.110> much<00:01:15.260> better

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
scanners that made me feel much better

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.450 
scanners that made me feel much better
my<00:01:16.100> concern<00:01:16.700> about<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:17.180> was<00:01:18.010> having<00:01:19.010> had<00:01:19.190> so

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
my concern about it was having had so

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.460 
my concern about it was having had so
many<00:01:19.580> scans<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.330> course<00:01:20.600> you<00:01:20.900> want<00:01:21.110> to<00:01:21.170> get<00:01:21.290> his

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
many scans of course you want to get his

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.830 
many scans of course you want to get his
little<00:01:21.680> dosage<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:22.430> radiation<00:01:22.490> as<00:01:23.180> possible

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
little dosage of radiation as possible

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.200 
little dosage of radiation as possible
so<00:01:24.110> that's<00:01:24.380> why<00:01:24.890> I<00:01:24.920> was<00:01:25.190> quite<00:01:25.490> pleased<00:01:25.850> with<00:01:26.180> a

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
so that's why I was quite pleased with a

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.080 
so that's why I was quite pleased with a
new<00:01:26.420> device<00:01:26.750> using<00:01:27.409> half<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.850> radiation<00:01:28.850> as

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
new device using half the radiation as

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.569 
new device using half the radiation as
the<00:01:29.299> old<00:01:29.479> ones<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:30.170> overall<00:01:30.590> look<00:01:30.920> of<00:01:31.189> the

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
the old ones the overall look of the

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.910 
the old ones the overall look of the
prospective<00:01:32.329> scanner<00:01:32.659> it<00:01:33.049> certainly<00:01:33.439> looks

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
prospective scanner it certainly looks

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.429 
prospective scanner it certainly looks
smaller<00:01:34.369> it's<00:01:34.850> more<00:01:34.939> contour<00:01:35.630> first<00:01:36.140> you<00:01:36.320> may

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
smaller it's more contour first you may

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.990 
smaller it's more contour first you may
not<00:01:36.590> think<00:01:36.619> that's<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.159> big<00:01:37.310> difference<00:01:37.490> but

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
not think that's a big difference but

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.849 
not think that's a big difference but
when<00:01:38.240> a<00:01:38.299> patient<00:01:38.750> is<00:01:38.780> very<00:01:38.960> nervous<00:01:39.289> about<00:01:39.590> the

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 
when a patient is very nervous about the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.010 
when a patient is very nervous about the
CT<00:01:40.219> exam<00:01:40.640> they're<00:01:41.000> gonna<00:01:41.090> have<00:01:41.390> when<00:01:41.929> they

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
CT exam they're gonna have when they

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.590 
CT exam they're gonna have when they
walk<00:01:42.289> into<00:01:42.560> that<00:01:42.829> room<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.390> see<00:01:44.390> the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
walk into that room and see the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.260 
walk into that room and see the
sleekness<00:01:45.020> of<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.710> scanner<00:01:46.070> you<00:01:46.549> can<00:01:46.579> see<00:01:47.060> the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
sleekness of the scanner you can see the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.929 
sleekness of the scanner you can see the
anxiety<00:01:47.929> you<00:01:48.049> kind<00:01:48.289> of<00:01:48.409> be<00:01:48.740> really<00:01:49.100> just<00:01:49.369> the

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
anxiety you kind of be really just the

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.880 
anxiety you kind of be really just the
way<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:50.420> Machine<00:01:50.780> looks<00:01:51.079> it<00:01:51.530> wasn't

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
way that the Machine looks it wasn't

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.730 
way that the Machine looks it wasn't
intimidating<00:01:52.549> it<00:01:52.640> wasn't<00:01:52.939> a<00:01:53.109> closed-in<00:01:54.109> kind

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
intimidating it wasn't a closed-in kind

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.830 
intimidating it wasn't a closed-in kind
of<00:01:54.859> closets<00:01:55.369> feel<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:56.119> know<00:01:56.240> like<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:56.630> was

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
of closets feel you know like I was

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.289 
of closets feel you know like I was
expecting<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.619> have<00:01:57.859> some<00:01:58.579> of<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.729> things<00:01:58.999> I

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
expecting to have some of the things I

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.630 
expecting to have some of the things I
remember<00:01:59.359> about<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.229> perspective<00:02:00.799> scan<00:02:01.100> that

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
remember about the perspective scan that

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.260 
remember about the perspective scan that
I<00:02:01.700> liked<00:02:02.119> was<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:02.929> brightness<00:02:03.649> of<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:03.979> room

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
I liked was the brightness of the room

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.300 
I liked was the brightness of the room
the<00:02:05.270> whiteness<00:02:05.749> of<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:05.929> Machine<00:02:06.439> and<00:02:06.799> the

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
the whiteness of the Machine and the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.580 
the whiteness of the Machine and the
fact<00:02:07.609> that<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:08.240> perspective<00:02:08.450> was<00:02:08.929> open

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
fact that the perspective was open

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.550

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
awesome it was with the new prospective

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.199

impacted in a positive manner I figured
that<00:03:06.669> if<00:03:06.819> it<00:03:06.969> was<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.209> RA<00:03:07.450> they<00:03:08.049> were<00:03:08.169> gonna<00:03:08.290> make

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
that if it was a RA they were gonna make

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.289 
that if it was a RA they were gonna make

sure that whatever information they were

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.420 
sure that whatever information they were
trying<00:03:10.659> to<00:03:10.750> obtain<00:03:11.290> for<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.650> doctors<00:03:12.129> they
