00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
it doesn't cover everything off but

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.890 
it doesn't cover everything off but
basically<00:02:49.290> that's<00:02:49.560> supposed<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.010> covered

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
basically that's supposed to be covered

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.780 
basically that's supposed to be covered
now<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.140> one<00:02:52.410> here<00:02:52.769> is<00:02:52.859> for<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.280> spindles

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
okay and what this does is closes off

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.069 
okay and what this does is closes off
the<00:02:56.870> rotations<00:02:57.870> from<00:02:58.079> CT<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:59.700> basically<00:03:00.450> holds

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
the rotations from CT it basically holds

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.039 
the rotations from CT it basically holds
the<00:03:01.590> guys<00:03:02.129> that<00:03:02.370> flowers<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:03.269> make<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.780> decision

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
to either run through the smoke or to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.869 
to either run through the smoke or to
just<00:03:06.450> wait<00:03:06.750> which<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:07.920> very<00:03:08.010> beneficial<00:03:08.400> if

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879

if you can kind of throw smokes in and

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.150 
if you can kind of throw smokes in and
separate<00:03:42.120> them<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.419> make<00:03:42.629> it<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:43.169> know<00:03:43.290> 1v1

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
separate them and make it a you know 1v1

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.059 
separate them and make it a you know 1v1
instead<00:03:44.879> of<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.090> 2v1<00:03:45.690> then<00:03:46.169> you<00:03:46.650> have<00:03:46.859> much

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
instead of a 2v1 then you have much

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.729 
instead of a 2v1 then you have much
easier<00:03:47.400> time<00:03:47.900> taking<00:03:48.900> bomb<00:03:49.079> sites<00:03:49.379> like<00:03:49.560> that

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
easier time taking bomb sites like that

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.210 
easier time taking bomb sites like that
so<00:03:50.010> something<00:03:50.849> to<00:03:50.940> think<00:03:51.000> about<00:03:51.949> next<00:03:52.949> up<00:03:53.069> is<00:03:53.190> a

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
so something to think about next up is a

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.430 
so something to think about next up is a
CT<00:03:54.030> sided<00:03:54.419> smoke<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:55.049> can<00:03:55.199> do<00:03:55.290> from

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
CT sided smoke that you can do from

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.750 
CT sided smoke that you can do from
small<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:55.949> it<00:03:56.040> actually<00:03:56.250> allows<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.970> to

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
small and it actually allows you to

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.009 
small and it actually allows you to
rebuy<00:03:59.760> another<00:04:00.090> smoke<00:04:01.280> okay<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:02.340> basically

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
rebuy another smoke okay so basically

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.240 
rebuy another smoke okay so basically
what<00:04:04.019> you're<00:04:04.049> trying<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.500> have<00:04:04.590> happen<00:04:05.040> here

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
what you're trying to have happen here

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.619 
what you're trying to have happen here
is<00:04:05.400> it's<00:04:05.639> going<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.790> bounce<00:04:05.940> off<00:04:06.180> this<00:04:06.359> wall

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
is it's going to bounce off this wall

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.599 
is it's going to bounce off this wall
back<00:04:06.660> here<00:04:07.109> and<00:04:07.319> the<00:04:07.949> whole<00:04:08.099> point<00:04:08.160> of<00:04:08.459> the

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
back here and the whole point of the

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.550 
back here and the whole point of the
smoke<00:04:08.940> is<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.299> be<00:04:09.389> able<00:04:09.449> to<00:04:09.629> come<00:04:09.870> down<00:04:10.169> banana

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
smoke is to be able to come down banana

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.670 
smoke is to be able to come down banana
and<00:04:10.829> get<00:04:11.699> control<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.419> for<00:04:13.019> your<00:04:13.139> team<00:04:13.169> so

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
and get control of it for your team so

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.470 
and get control of it for your team so
if<00:04:13.949> you<00:04:14.280> have<00:04:14.430> somebody<00:04:14.669> throw<00:04:15.030> that<00:04:15.209> smoke

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480
