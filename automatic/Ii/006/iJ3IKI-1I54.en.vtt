00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.430
 Hello 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.110
 for simple iphone 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.290
 we will proceed to unpack 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.490
 no mini that I 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.010
 party girl 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.320
 it is not possible there was no 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.610
 too many people 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.700
 it is available anyway for this 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.119
 this version this version 16 giga wifi 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.740
 that I took in black because black 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.570
 because everything is black at home I 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.540
 more black like iphone like 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.350
 ipad etc etc 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.579
 this is the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.280
 so here you have the ipad mini ipad 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.339
 mini especially make you a little 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.640
 comparison with above or below 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.839
 of the 9.7-inch ipad box including 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.820
 you see it's a lot smaller 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.019
 really impressed me when you leave 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.370
 when we put it back in hand I think and 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:02.280
 his little ones his ends and I was 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.460
 impressed so here I have 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.170
 I have not opened yet this ipad 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.630
 but I want to cons the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.500
 cellophane unfolding his fans it serves 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:18.390
 not very much so I thought about 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:23.700
 the opening and that's my new little 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:27.299
 ipad mini I take away employees there you 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.649
 take in hand it was not 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.640
 the impression is a cetain it is a 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:37.710
 ipad past it's a tablet it's 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:41.789
 it's light it's fine it's finally beautiful 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:48.149
 for me in any case here are the 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:49.560
 islands of protection and I find myself 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.270
 with my little bee in their good 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.940
 I do not have a special hand 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.300
 so see I take it quite easily 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.280
 to be quite easily in the hand 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.539
 this little tablet so what is this 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.720
 that we find is too obviously 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.880
 the button the home button 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.469
 I do not know if you can see if you 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.280
 there as on the other ipad and 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:18.060
 other iphone below the port 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:21.670
 the lightning dock Hooch rages pin 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.280
 on the left slice when we hold 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.830
 here is the left France there is nothing 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.550
 at all it's all smooth on the part 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:35.950
 aluminum on the back the apple logo is 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.520
 there the little camera on the slice of 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.110
 right 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.420
 what do we find and red bart do not 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.620
 wants the volume buttons to volume down the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:50.350
 quad is activated the little button of what 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.900
 disable the volume we will listen it's 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.850
 almost all of them sensible jack 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.190
 yes then this price this dragon sweeps not 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.860
 as the iphone was not going to locate and not 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.560
 supports she is located so on the 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.060
 upper part in water 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.890
 here is the front camera listen here 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.450
 what is for the tablet sees this 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.200
 that it is for the tablet at work 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.730
 pad with we see very very badly because 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.810
 it's really black on black like 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.680
 apple logo and black on black 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:24.500
 unlike the aluminum back 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.319
 from the ipad 2 9 7 inches there we distinguish 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.000
 well the ipad logo here is cork projects 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.000
 for our straw comparison policies 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:40.639
 I hope you see it well 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.829
 not obvious it's really small 1 it's 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.730
 not unpleasant 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.879
 so inside the box so what 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.450
 that we find and obviously the 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.010
 hold that would make me a cap 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.810
 extra for the iphone for 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.629
 iphone 5 is the new cable 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:58.220
 lightning here is the little documentation 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.510
 who goes with you obviously we go 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.099
 am also a good boss since this 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:06.099
 is not a cellular version 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:09.859
 that's classic and the adapter 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:11.169
 the AC adapter to charge this 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.489
 mini ipad 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.109
 so that's all and that's about all 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.459
 I have more than to try 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.280
 will offer you in another video 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.440
 games I'll be putting a movie somewhere 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.030
 thing on me to see how that 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.710
 then works yes there may be some 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.039
 little indications behind so when 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.260
 even 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:32.330
 it's stipulated bombshell to let him shiga 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:34.490
 make sense for this version and then minc 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.039
 it normally retains itunes will be at 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.120
 itunes bombs is not available that's 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.259
 is delayed it was planned for me 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.780
 of October but it will only be for me 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:44.060
 the November so itunes arises here in 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.259
 being 10.8 months costing is going to fuck 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.280
 scramble with it even though it should 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:46.810
 operate I think I would not have 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.250
 all 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.169
 this day a lack of display whatever 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.509
 something like that on itunes pretty much 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.389
 everything is next to this misfortune tablet 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.379
 perfect in a game not yet lit 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.960
 I do not unpack it in front of you 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:02.900
 but really nice to listen 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.979
 we end up later and therefore more 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.979
 late on simply food
