option when I first heard about

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.700 
option when I first heard about
laparoscopic<00:02:03.030> surgery<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.719> was<00:02:03.869> through<00:02:04.439> dr.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710

Ramsey<00:02:05.100> who<00:02:05.250> basically<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.759> said<00:02:06.060> he<00:02:06.149> was

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
Ramsey who basically just said he was

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.300 
Ramsey who basically just said he was
going<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.479> do<00:02:06.630> like<00:02:06.810> four<00:02:07.140> little<00:02:07.350> slits

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
going to do like four little slits

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.550 
going to do like four little slits
around<00:02:08.489> my<00:02:08.729> belly<00:02:08.970> button<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.629> small<00:02:09.929> slit

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
around my belly button in a small slit

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.370 
around my belly button in a small slit
right<00:02:10.920> beside<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.640> by<00:02:12.239> keeping<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.750> incision

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
right beside it by keeping the incision

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.840 
right beside it by keeping the incision
it<00:02:13.620> helps<00:02:13.950> us<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.280> patient<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.730> recover

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
it helps us the patient to recover

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.940 
it helps us the patient to recover
earlier<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.750> gets<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.260> patients<00:02:16.650> out<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
earlier it gets the patients out of the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.310 
earlier it gets the patients out of the
bed<00:02:17.190> much<00:02:17.370> quicker<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:18.000> after<00:02:18.720> they<00:02:18.870> go<00:02:19.050> home

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
bed much quicker and after they go home

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.660
