to<00:02:51.590> come<00:02:52.209> first<00:02:53.209> we're<00:02:53.389> gonna<00:02:53.450> estimate<00:02:53.989> how

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
to come first we're gonna estimate how

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.339 
to come first we're gonna estimate how

many outs we think he has - from the
flop<00:02:57.590> graph<00:02:57.889> we're<00:02:58.159> gonna<00:02:58.250> find<00:02:58.579> out<00:02:58.730> his

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
flop graph we're gonna find out his

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.000 
flop graph we're gonna find out his
probability<00:02:59.389> of<00:02:59.599> catching<00:02:59.840> based<00:03:00.650> on<00:03:00.859> your

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
probability of catching based on your

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.500

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
estimate of how many outs you think he

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.929 
estimate of how many outs you think he
has<00:03:02.689> three<00:03:03.349> we're<00:03:04.099> gonna<00:03:04.189> calculate<00:03:04.489> its

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
has three we're gonna calculate its

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.610 
has three we're gonna calculate its
probability<00:03:05.419> of<00:03:05.659> not<00:03:05.810> catching<00:03:05.989> number<00:03:06.319> four

probability of not catching number four

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.899 
probability of not catching number four
we're<00:03:06.829> gonna<00:03:06.919> take<00:03:07.129> a<00:03:07.159> look<00:03:07.340> at<00:03:07.430> how<00:03:07.639> much<00:03:07.730> is

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
we're gonna take a look at how much is

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.210 
we're gonna take a look at how much is
in<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.090> pot<00:03:08.139> number<00:03:09.139> five<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.799> this<00:03:09.859> is<00:03:09.919> where

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
in the pot number five and this is where

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.309 
in the pot number five and this is where
it<00:03:10.310> gets<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.669> be<00:03:10.700> tough<00:03:11.000> mentally<00:03:11.689> we're<00:03:12.200> gonna

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
it gets to be tough mentally we're gonna

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.770 
it gets to be tough mentally we're gonna
better<00:03:12.680> them<00:03:12.889> out<00:03:13.099> which<00:03:13.700> we<00:03:13.939> think<00:03:14.389> is<00:03:14.599> going

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
better them out which we think is going

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.589 
better them out which we think is going
to<00:03:14.870> give<00:03:15.019> him<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.319> negative<00:03:15.709> expected<00:03:16.220> value

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
to give him a negative expected value

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.119 
to give him a negative expected value
then<00:03:17.599> we<00:03:17.780> have<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.139> keep<00:03:18.319> increasing<00:03:18.590> the

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
then we have to keep increasing the

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.129 
then we have to keep increasing the
mental<00:03:19.370> bet<00:03:19.639> until<00:03:20.090> we're<00:03:20.299> sure<00:03:20.329> he's<00:03:21.109> a

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
mental bet until we're sure he's a

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.890 
mental bet until we're sure he's a
negative<00:03:21.709> expected<00:03:22.250> value<00:03:22.609> then<00:03:23.359> we<00:03:23.569> have<00:03:23.750> to

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
negative expected value then we have to

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.689 
negative expected value then we have to
add<00:03:24.049> a<00:03:24.079> sufficient<00:03:24.739> amount<00:03:24.829> to<00:03:25.190> try<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.489> make

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:25.699 
add a sufficient amount to try to make

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.050 
add a sufficient amount to try to make
him<00:03:25.849> fold<00:03:26.379> okay<00:03:27.379> an<00:03:27.699> example<00:03:28.699> and<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:28.879> is<00:03:28.940> a

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
him fold okay an example and this is a

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.339 
him fold okay an example and this is a
little<00:03:29.389> bit<00:03:29.510> more<00:03:29.659> difficult<00:03:30.139> than<00:03:30.199> the

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
little bit more difficult than the

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.240 
little bit more difficult than the

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
with two cards to go we have to look at
