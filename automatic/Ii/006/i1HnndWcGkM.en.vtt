backlight is made with LED so like

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.649 
backlight is made with LED so like
that's<00:01:22.470> why<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.220> all<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.729> words<00:01:24.360> or

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
that's why you can see all the words or

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.630 
that's why you can see all the words or
super<00:01:25.290> precision<00:01:25.830> cut<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.220> everything<00:01:26.549> like

super precision cut and everything like

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.550 
super precision cut and everything like
that<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:26.970> because<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.240> backlight<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.170> is

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
that it's because the backlight is is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.069 
that it's because the backlight is is
only<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.040> blue<00:01:29.549> light<00:01:29.790> hurts<00:01:30.270> your<00:01:30.509> eyes<00:01:30.540> it
