00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.170
 david like espresso here today 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.410
 but I'll show you how to 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.820
 can make Vietnamese coffee 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.550
 Coffee is slightly different than the normal one 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.340
 cafÃ© de knows 2 took that that they 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.410
 the coffee pot it's just it 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.150
 a metal filter in which the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.590
 coffee purely get the mood from above 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.800
 hot water on it all on the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.630
 glass and also it is sweetened 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.300
 Consumable sugar condensed milk 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.769
 we made milk girls take it 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.900
 There are also those who are cruising 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.850
 analytical or Chinese like sweeter 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.630
 condensed milk and there are 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.090
 Vietnamese coffee like to get around 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.420
 that 's something like starbucks just better 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.780
 and from Vietnam the special the throne 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.210
 blindeste that we here the kuli coffee 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.680
 have the stop if the coffee is not 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.480
 two stages or the coffee cherries 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.789
 not two but only one bean 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.590
 training that goes then everything taken 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.690
 is then ground together and then has 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.719
 because the intact one is there a bit 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.430
 expensive but very tasty so we start 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.979
 we just take for the 0 6 oz 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:16.049
 about one and a half spoonful of genetic 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:18.619
 kpt for that is how the whole thing 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.030
 if you shake that up, that's right 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.490
 just that it is evenly distributed 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.159
 a little knock then you have already 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.049
 then that comes on top of it that is 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.280
 a variant to screw that is 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.040
 I screw it firmly once so not to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.299
 I'll solve it again because 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.110
 otherwise the coffee ever need until he 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.759
 goes through so next comes the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.890
 sweetened or sweetened condensed milk 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.140
 and about two of them 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.940
 Teaspoons finally have too sweet 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.830
 depending on how she wants it 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.200
 of course you can vary her now 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.270
 can more or less take that 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.520
 the important thing is just that you vegetables 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.580
 Condensed milk take me was said one 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.720
 since also take cream with the sugar 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.790
 I have not tried it yet 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.750
 I still had to do it 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.040
 I stay with the sweet ones too 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.289
 condensed milk that I know since I enter 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.810
 I am a little kid and I think so 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.560
 Tasty even if that in the industrial 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.820
 So, about two were made 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.820
 teaspoon in there 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.080
 the most important is, of course, for 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.520
 is the tel 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.019
 that may drip a bit that they still 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.700
 not have and run once 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.530
 What most of the children are headed for 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.090
 and also I had in mine 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.190
 childhood was about to drop that spoonbill 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.690
 allowed 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.190
 I met people who got that 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.510
 even smear on the bread that me 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:49.870
 a little too much but otherwise 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.940
 write off once if you have that 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.880
 now comes this filter above 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.709
 on the glass up and then comes 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.049
 shot water really only a small one 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.760
 shot hot water for only come in 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.790
 to swell the whole of the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.650
 coffee so a bit on sources 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.200
 thus it is also Omar characterized comes and 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.930
 after about 20 seconds or so now 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.560
 so you can just do everything 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.280
 fill up 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:20.519
 yes, really give it up to 10 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.290
 I have the lid here that comes on it 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.350
 and now we can just wait 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.700
 go through it 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.860
 Interestingly, Vietnam 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.490
 second largest export country for coffee was 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.590
 few know and 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.330
 the nice thing is that you are not there only 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.950
 the one who gets the robusta coffee but 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.630
 just the arabica coffee that 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.580
 of course the best coffee in 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.350
 quotes is because he has a lot 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.620
 less caffeine contains less acid 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.910
 but also contains expensive 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.100
 planting is because he is a lot of pest 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.410
 more vulnerable and because he is also ahead 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.970
 All is less profitable than robusta 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.490
 coffee robusta coffee is just like that 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.590
 name says it can be relatively sturdy 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.940
 are grown lower heights was 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.230
 and is not that climate and 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.050
 pest vulnerable again arabica 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.250
 coffee in the whole time we have 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.340
 Here, almost once the coffee 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.750
 run through 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.520
 I can build on it then you can 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.380
 see that runs through in the cut 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.850
 takes about three to seven minutes 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.520
 depending on how big that finds the 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.320
 filter is and what you should remember 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.100
 is a filter is for a glass or 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.230
 a cup 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.440
 So if you have several Vietnamese 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.140
 then to make cafes at the same time 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.490
 you should get several filters 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.170
 and look how it looks like this 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.510
 looks very good i take that once 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.460
 down the beautiful is those but 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:43.580
 turn around and there you can do that 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:43.580
 put it like that 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.170
 here we have our coffee is 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.100
 at the moment still nice two phases moderately 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:55.160
 separated so you get the most 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.190
 it is enough and the beautiful is now 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.290
 Hot when it's a hot summer day 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.840
 So just pack ice cream that has 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:08.450
 the perfect eiscafe kruger now 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:12.140
 once around gets a wonderful one 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.730
 caramel and actually tastes 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.530
 the coffee also slightly after caramel that 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.420
 quite interesting is probably one 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.400
 sweetened condensed milk and the 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.650
 intrinsic taste of the Vietnamese cafe 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.300
 that there is a live ticker may not be there 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.310
 comes in Vietnamese coffee 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.800
 that was for the espresso wiechs 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.870
 and I would say if it is you 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.310
 liked to comment you liked it 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.950
 imitated and tried it himself 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.540
 is like you commented on you too 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.790
 Please subscribe to our videos once 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.260
 and you get all the art videos 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.730
 at least 1 in the week if I have more 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.730
 on the day a nice day yet
