 nissan opened or whether the person through it 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:16.619
 three minutes after the start, I realized that 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.030
 need to brush the fingers of the ocean 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.340

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.620

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:13.760
 I have already invented a lot of Halloween 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:18.230
 different characters so two products 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.110
 were opened 1 it was such a lacquer I summer 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.920
 I realized that I do not like to wear bright varnishes 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.430
 on my fingernails because i don't 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.860
 I know I like to wear some more 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.150
 neutral colors and in the summer I don't know 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.650
 why in spring and summer I adore wearing 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.770
 some cream pastel colors 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.959
 nude and I saw this lacquer and me 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.470
 loved him from loreal by 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.470

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:13.610
 very happy and I decided to try oh oh 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.700
 the felt tip she only very much draws 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.040
 the truth is like this 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.489
 finely draws she is really black 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.130
 because there are teenagers who 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.500

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.310
