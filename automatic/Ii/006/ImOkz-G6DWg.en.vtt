00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.129 
setup first video today is about the new
DJ<00:00:11.580> system<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:12.000> I've<00:00:12.120> built<00:00:12.330> out<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.660> Archaea

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
DJ system that I've built out of Archaea

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.350 
DJ system that I've built out of Archaea
parts<00:00:13.580> basically<00:00:14.580> what<00:00:14.880> you're<00:00:15.030> looking<00:00:15.269> at

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
parts basically what you're looking at

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.250 
parts basically what you're looking at
there<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:16.049> an<00:00:16.770> expedient<00:00:17.160> bookshelf<00:00:17.880> on

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
there is an expedient bookshelf on

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.900 
there is an expedient bookshelf on
expedite<00:00:19.260> wheels<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.699> wheels

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
expedite wheels and in the wheels

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.210 
expedite wheels and in the wheels
actually<00:00:21.390> gets<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.750> right<00:00:21.990> height<00:00:22.260> so

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
actually gets it to the right height so

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.620 
actually gets it to the right height so
you're<00:00:23.460> not<00:00:23.820> bending<00:00:23.970> your<00:00:24.150> back<00:00:24.300> or<00:00:24.480> anything

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
you're not bending your back or anything

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.810 
you're not bending your back or anything
I<00:00:24.869> think<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.170> works<00:00:25.350> out<00:00:25.529> about<00:00:25.800> 95<00:00:26.369> 96

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
I think it works out about 95 96

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.890 
I think it works out about 95 96
centimeters<00:00:27.180> tall<00:00:27.800> the<00:00:28.800> wheels<00:00:29.010> themselves

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
centimeters tall the wheels themselves

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.330 
centimeters tall the wheels themselves
i've<00:00:30.900> actually<00:00:31.080> are<00:00:31.320> barbering<00:00:31.830> across<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
i've actually are barbering across the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.850 
i've actually are barbering across the
bottom<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:34.110> does<00:00:34.260> actually<00:00:34.380> had<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> little

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
bottom so it does actually had a little

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.709 
bottom so it does actually had a little
bit<00:00:34.950> more<00:00:35.100> stability<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> stand

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
bit more stability to the to the stand

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.930 
bit more stability to the to the stand
itself<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:38.010> they're<00:00:38.160> really<00:00:38.370> strong<00:00:38.670> wheels

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
itself and they're really strong wheels

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.630 
itself and they're really strong wheels
so<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:40.680> know<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.890> can<00:00:41.129> get<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.309> lot<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.489> weight

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
so you know you can get a lot of weight

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.549 
so you know you can get a lot of weight
on<00:00:41.879> there<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> top<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> X<00:00:43.320> ability

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
on there on the top of the X ability

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.180 
on there on the top of the X ability
bookshelf<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.309> an<00:00:44.579> Ikea<00:00:45.059> table<00:00:45.450> top<00:00:46.039> what<00:00:47.039> that

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
bookshelf is an Ikea table top what that

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.470 
bookshelf is an Ikea table top what that
does<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> adds<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.700> little<00:00:47.820> bit<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.090> depth<00:00:48.329> to

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
does it adds a little bit of depth to

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900 
does it adds a little bit of depth to
the<00:00:49.469> stand<00:00:49.770> itself<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.579> little<00:00:50.789> bit

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the stand itself and just a little bit

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.630 
the stand itself and just a little bit
more<00:00:51.090> height<00:00:51.680> I'm<00:00:52.680> quite<00:00:52.949> tall<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.610> we

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
more height I'm quite tall so we

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.790 
more height I'm quite tall so we
actually<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.570> helps<00:00:54.989> me<00:00:55.140> perfectly<00:00:55.680> so

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
I'm not bending my back at all but if we

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.049 
I'm not bending my back at all but if we
take<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.140> little<00:00:58.320> closer<00:00:58.590> look<00:00:59.000> you'll<00:01:00.000> see

that<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.570> web<00:01:01.230> shear<00:01:01.500> fluke<00:01:01.859> actually<00:01:02.570> I've

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
that a web shear fluke actually I've

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.810 
that a web shear fluke actually I've
managed<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.409> get<00:01:04.530> my<00:01:04.710> vinyl<00:01:04.890> decks<00:01:05.250> mid

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.740 
do a review on the new mock for track
there<00:01:27.439> in<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.560> later<00:01:28.770> video<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.939> after<00:01:30.509> you've

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
there in a later video so after you've

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.240 
there in a later video so after you've
seen<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.140> maybe<00:01:31.409> check<00:01:31.650> out<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.070> well

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
seen this maybe check out that as well

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.160 
seen this maybe check out that as well
something<00:01:32.610> quite<00:01:32.729> interesting<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:33.990> yet

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
something quite interesting and but yet

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.310 
something quite interesting and but yet
the<00:01:34.380> tabletop<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> expedient<00:01:36.320> bookcase

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the tabletop on the expedient bookcase

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.740 
the tabletop on the expedient bookcase
there<00:01:37.350> gives<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.159> 75<00:01:38.610> centimeters<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.479> depth

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
there gives you 75 centimeters of depth

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.710 
there gives you 75 centimeters of depth
so<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.439> got<00:01:40.680> literally<00:01:41.210> enormous<00:01:42.210> amounts<00:01:42.630> of

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
so you got literally enormous amounts of

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.350 
so you got literally enormous amounts of
room<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.560> put<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:43.770> your<00:01:43.860> stuff<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.549> I've

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
room to put all your stuff on there I've

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.719 
room to put all your stuff on there I've
seen<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> lot<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.049> IKEA<00:01:46.950> DJ<00:01:47.280> sometimes<00:01:47.460> they
