 Hello friends, do you fight? 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:29.619
 my YouTube channel today on ours 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:33.739
 motorcycle viper review at 250 mt this 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:36.710
 2014 Chinese motorcycle model alone 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.860
 of the freshest here are 250 cubes 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.200
 Well, these full-fledged up to 70 cubes without 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.690
 rounding down there like 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.949
 often interesting here 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.199
 the motor is for the Chinese motor industry too 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.309
 regarding 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:59.300
 new now i will take a flashlight 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:01.879
 Highlighted such information so on 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.680
 about the engine here is a single cylinder 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:08.780
 motor with four valves two 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.220
 camshaft valve 2 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.360
 intake two exhaust 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.549
 two camshafts as I said gives out 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.170
 This motor is quite cheerful and 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:25.610
 interesting for this class and it gives out 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.049
 25 horses or 26 I won't tell you for sure 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:33.649
 because different information from different 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:36.079
 from different resources but nonetheless very 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.259
 cheerful I already went on it very 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:42.469
 gaining fun then we'll talk already in 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.890
 dynamics let's see how it works what 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:48.560
 concerns engine cooling here 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.170
 liquid cooling that's ahead is worth 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:57.649
 large liquid cooling radiator 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:01.219
 here is the pump show now 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.460
 here is the pump and which pumps 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.259
 fluid is cooled in this engine 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.210
 6-speed gearbox too for 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.910
 China is very fun she is very 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.850
 competently 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.170
 distributed gear ratios we are very 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:19.680
 cheerfully behaves here 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.740
 there is an oil filter which 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.920
 allows you to increase 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.740
 service span approximately from replacement 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.320
 oil then replacing about a thousand two s 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.960
 half three 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:38.340
 on engines where there is no oil filter 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:41.660
 but simpler engines there is a replacement 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.580
 oils of course more often about a thousand 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.020
 one and a half thousand between replacements not more 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.400
