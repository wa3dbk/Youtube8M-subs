bottom<00:00:17.160> crosshair<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.660> top<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.230> tree

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
bottom crosshair on the top of that tree

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.450 
bottom crosshair on the top of that tree
this<00:00:20.490> one<00:00:20.670> should<00:00:20.850> be<00:00:20.910> pretty<00:00:21.449> easy<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:22.140> hit

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
this one should be pretty easy to hit

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.130 
this one should be pretty easy to hit
it's<00:00:23.460> also<00:00:23.640> really<00:00:23.970> nice<00:00:24.210> bouncy<00:00:24.660> not<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> tree

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
it's also really nice bouncy not a tree

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.689 
it's also really nice bouncy not a tree
and<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.529> truth<00:00:25.769> your<00:00:26.070> way<00:00:26.189> Brown<00:00:26.400> doesn't

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and in truth your way Brown doesn't

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.630 
and in truth your way Brown doesn't
bounce<00:00:26.970> off<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.359> tree<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.490> it'll<00:00:29.490> bounce

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
bounce off the tree and it'll bounce

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.580 
bounce off the tree and it'll bounce
around<00:00:30.029> there<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> couple<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.689> times<00:00:30.750> maybe<00:00:31.289> not

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
around there a couple of times maybe not

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.030 
around there a couple of times maybe not
necessarily<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.369> into<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> doorway<00:00:33.120> but

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
necessarily going into the doorway but

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.319 
necessarily going into the doorway but
either<00:00:35.040> way<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> lot<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.550> people<00:00:35.640> will<00:00:36.000> come<00:00:36.149> out

either way a lot of people will come out

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.819 
either way a lot of people will come out
of<00:00:36.480> there<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.899> should<00:00:37.140> get<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> nice<00:00:37.559> easy

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
of there so you should get a nice easy
