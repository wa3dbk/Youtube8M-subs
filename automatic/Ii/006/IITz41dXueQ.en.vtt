around<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:58.940> butterfly<00:01:59.270> like<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.800> and<00:02:01.960> do

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
around the butterfly like that and do

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.630 
around the butterfly like that and do
the<00:02:03.080> same<00:02:03.320> on<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:03.830> label<00:02:04.220> I'm<00:02:04.370> going<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.550> go

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
the same on the label I'm going to go

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.060 
the same on the label I'm going to go
out<00:02:04.700> just<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:05.030> little<00:02:05.060> more<00:02:05.330> so<00:02:05.480> we<00:02:05.600> almost

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
out just a little more so we almost

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.190 
out just a little more so we almost
reach<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.280> edge<00:02:07.400> of<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.640> label<00:02:07.970> now<00:02:08.720> next<00:02:08.989> up

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
reach the edge of the label now next up

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.320 
reach the edge of the label now next up
is<00:02:09.379> a<00:02:09.410> white<00:02:09.709> gel<00:02:09.979> pen<00:02:10.039> now<00:02:10.700> this<00:02:10.819> butterfly<00:02:11.239> is

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
is a white gel pen now this butterfly is

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.000 
is a white gel pen now this butterfly is
going<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.629> be<00:02:11.750> layered<00:02:11.989> three<00:02:12.319> times<00:02:12.590> this<00:02:12.860> is

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
going to be layered three times this is

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
the butterfly that we've colored the top

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.390 
the butterfly that we've colored the top
we're<00:03:01.430> actually<00:03:01.580> going<00:03:01.819> to<00:03:01.910> come<00:03:02.660> back<00:03:03.020> here

cut off his bottom wings but not his

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.440 
cut off his bottom wings but not his
body<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.860> now<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.310> magic<00:03:13.640> is<00:03:13.970> in<00:03:14.000> stampin

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
body and now the magic is in stampin

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.520 
body and now the magic is in stampin
dimensionals<00:03:16.480> in<00:03:17.480> order<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.840> get<00:03:17.990> them<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.290> fit

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
dimensionals in order to get them to fit

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.770 
dimensionals in order to get them to fit
in<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.520> couple<00:03:19.819> of<00:03:19.880> places<00:03:20.060> sometimes<00:03:20.420> you<00:03:20.690> need

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
in a couple of places sometimes you need

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.590 
in a couple of places sometimes you need
to<00:03:20.900> cut<00:03:21.110> them<00:03:21.940> so<00:03:22.940> we<00:03:23.030> have<00:03:23.180> our<00:03:23.209> stampin

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
to cut them so we have our stampin

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.180 
to cut them so we have our stampin
dimensionals<00:03:23.630> all<00:03:24.319> ready<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.620> go<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.069> then

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
dimensionals all ready to go and then

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:34.360 
dimensionals all ready to go and then
just<00:03:25.959> layer<00:03:26.959> him<00:03:30.160> like<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:31.520> wow<00:03:32.349> it<00:03:33.349> is<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:33.950> cool

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
just layer him like so wow it is so cool

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.690 
just layer him like so wow it is so cool
next<00:03:35.150> up<00:03:35.270> is<00:03:35.390> assembly<00:03:36.190> take<00:03:37.190> our<00:03:37.340> designer

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
dots I actually kind of eyeballed where

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.199 
dots I actually kind of eyeballed where
this<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.260> going<00:03:42.770> to<00:03:42.950> fit<00:03:43.340> on<00:03:43.610> there<00:03:43.849> to<00:03:44.030> line

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
this is going to fit on there to line

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.900 
this is going to fit on there to line
that<00:03:44.420> one<00:03:44.599> up<00:03:44.720> I<00:03:44.900> wanted<00:03:45.230> this<00:03:45.380> to<00:03:45.590> be<00:03:45.849> sort<00:03:46.849> of

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
that one up I wanted this to be sort of

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.690 
that one up I wanted this to be sort of
to<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.180> left<00:03:47.650> but<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:48.860> that<00:03:49.010> your<00:03:49.190> points<00:03:49.610> are

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
to the left but so that your points are

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.460 
to the left but so that your points are
in<00:03:49.819> the<00:03:49.910> middle<00:03:50.150> of<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.390> designer<00:03:50.870> paper<00:03:51.110> and

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
in the middle of the designer paper and

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.680 
in the middle of the designer paper and
then<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:51.950> stuck<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.310> down<00:03:52.580> and<00:03:53.360> mine's<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.660> little

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
then I stuck it down and mine's a little

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.940 
then I stuck it down and mine's a little
bit<00:03:53.959> longer<00:03:54.110> so<00:03:54.319> I'm<00:03:54.380> just<00:03:54.500> going<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:54.709> trim<00:03:54.830> off

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
bit longer so I'm just going to trim off

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.860 
bit longer so I'm just going to trim off
the<00:03:55.130> edges<00:03:55.250> just<00:03:55.670> use<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.240> snail<00:03:56.510> for<00:03:56.750> the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
the edges just use the snail for the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.740
