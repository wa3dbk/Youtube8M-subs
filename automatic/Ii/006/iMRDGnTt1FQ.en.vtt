00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
alright guys today I am here to talk to

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.450 
alright guys today I am here to talk to
you<00:00:05.240> about<00:00:06.240> wheels<00:00:06.720> said<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.230> have<00:00:07.830> been<00:00:08.010> riding

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
you about wheels said I have been riding

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.890 
you about wheels said I have been riding
for<00:00:09.110> probably<00:00:10.110> about<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.219> past<00:00:11.780> three<00:00:12.780> to

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
for probably about the past three to

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.939 
for probably about the past three to
four<00:00:13.110> months<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.269> sorry<00:00:15.269> for<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.540> video

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
four months and sorry for this video

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.130 
four months and sorry for this video
being<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.010> little<00:00:17.279> bit<00:00:17.400> lower<00:00:17.670> quality<00:00:18.300> than<00:00:18.330> my

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
being a little bit lower quality than my

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.019 
being a little bit lower quality than my
other<00:00:19.289> videos<00:00:19.680> because<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.310> camera<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.730> used

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
other videos because the camera I used

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.950 
other videos because the camera I used
to<00:00:21.180> use<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.800> missing<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.750> there<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.840> go

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
to use is missing so there you go

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.950 
to use is missing so there you go
alright<00:00:25.949> moving<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:27.029> are<00:00:27.420> going<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.840> be

alright moving on we are going to be

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.759 
alright moving on we are going to be
talking<00:00:28.349> about<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:29.150> 80<00:00:30.150> -<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> land<00:00:31.439> yachts

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
talking about the 80 - a land yachts

mini<00:00:32.520> zombie<00:00:32.820> hugs<00:00:34.160> go<00:00:35.160> over<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> specs<00:00:35.610> of

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
mini zombie hugs go over the specs of

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.700 
mini zombie hugs go over the specs of
the<00:00:35.850> wheel<00:00:36.000> real<00:00:36.239> quick<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.719> starts<00:00:37.050> off<00:00:37.170> at<00:00:37.320> 70

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the wheel real quick it starts off at 70

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.430 
the wheel real quick it starts off at 70
millimeters<00:00:38.219> you're<00:00:39.090> gonna<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> fairly

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
millimeters you're gonna have a fairly

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.850 
millimeters you're gonna have a fairly
good<00:00:40.620> sized<00:00:41.129> plastic<00:00:41.670> core<00:00:42.200> not<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.320> big<00:00:43.500> as<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
good sized plastic core not as big as a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.020 
good sized plastic core not as big as a
core<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.870> volutes<00:00:46.010> but<00:00:47.030> definitely

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
core of the volutes but definitely

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.639 
core of the volutes but definitely
bigger<00:00:48.210> than<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.450> normal<00:00:48.480> size<00:00:48.960> plastic<00:00:49.440> core

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
bigger than a normal size plastic core

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.689 
bigger than a normal size plastic core
and<00:00:50.329> they're<00:00:51.329> gonna<00:00:51.420> start<00:00:51.780> off<00:00:52.699> probably

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
and they're gonna start off probably

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.869 
and they're gonna start off probably
about<00:00:54.449> two<00:00:55.110> millimeters<00:00:55.890> away<00:00:56.070> from<00:00:56.219> being

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
about two millimeters away from being

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.260 
about two millimeters away from being
perfectly<00:00:57.480> flush<00:00:57.899> side<00:00:58.199> set<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.270> basically

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
perfectly flush side set so basically

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.670 
perfectly flush side set so basically
just<00:01:00.420> go<00:01:00.570> ahead<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.870> call<00:01:01.050> them<00:01:01.109> aside<00:01:01.440> set

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
just go ahead and call them aside set

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.910 
just go ahead and call them aside set
wheel<00:01:01.859> they<00:01:02.760> come<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:04.140> know<00:01:04.260> pretty<00:01:04.650> roughed

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
wheel they come you know pretty roughed

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.070 
wheel they come you know pretty roughed
up<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.640> slide<00:01:05.880> them<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
up so you can slide them or out of the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.560 
up so you can slide them or out of the
box<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> jazz<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:10.640> my<00:01:11.640> thoughts<00:01:12.180> on

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
box and all that jazz so my thoughts on

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.770 
box and all that jazz so my thoughts on
these<00:01:12.960> wheels<00:01:14.030> let's<00:01:15.030> go<00:01:15.180> into<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> slide

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
these wheels let's go into the slide

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.710 
these wheels let's go into the slide
first<00:01:16.290> because<00:01:16.830> that's<00:01:17.040> probably<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.299> most

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
first because that's probably the most

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.910 
first because that's probably the most
drawing<00:01:19.140> factor<00:01:19.770> towards<00:01:20.250> these<00:01:20.460> wheels<00:01:21.920> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
drawing factor towards these wheels the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.070 
drawing factor towards these wheels the
one<00:01:23.100> thing<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.430> would<00:01:23.580> have<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.939> say<00:01:24.180> about<00:01:24.600> them

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
one thing I would have to say about them

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.609 
one thing I would have to say about them
is<00:01:25.259> since<00:01:25.920> they<00:01:26.070> are<00:01:26.310> side<00:01:26.820> set<00:01:27.290> most<00:01:28.290> people

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
is since they are side set most people

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.380 
is since they are side set most people
would<00:01:28.799> believe<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.579> are<00:01:29.610> more<00:01:29.759> prone

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
would believe that they are more prone

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.210 
would believe that they are more prone
to<00:01:30.450> some<00:01:31.610> you<00:01:32.610> know<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:33.689> sort<00:01:33.990> coning<00:01:34.470> more

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
to some you know what sort coning more

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.920 
to some you know what sort coning more
coning<00:01:35.670> than<00:01:35.880> center<00:01:36.869> set<00:01:37.140> wheel<00:01:37.640> offset<00:01:38.640> will

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
coning than center set wheel offset will

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.690 
coning than center set wheel offset will
just<00:01:39.930> because<00:01:40.200> they<00:01:40.320> are<00:01:40.409> side<00:01:40.650> set<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.400> lot

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
just because they are side set so a lot

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.120 
just because they are side set so a lot
of<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> pressure<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.770> inside

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
of the pressure is going on the inside

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.240 
of the pressure is going on the inside
of<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> wheel<00:01:44.630> but<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:46.229> these<00:01:46.409> wheels<00:01:46.799> with

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
of the wheel but for these wheels with

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.719 
of the wheel but for these wheels with
my<00:01:47.460> experience<00:01:47.970> that's<00:01:48.570> not<00:01:48.840> true<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.729> here's

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
my experience that's not true and here's

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.800 
my experience that's not true and here's
why<00:01:51.110> something<00:01:52.110> about<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:53.130> thing<00:01:53.810> when

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
why something about this thing when

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.080 
why something about this thing when
ridden<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.290> an<00:01:55.590> asphalt<00:01:55.860> road<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.820> don't<00:01:56.850> know

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
ridden on an asphalt road I don't know

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.789 
ridden on an asphalt road I don't know
about<00:01:57.210> concrete<00:01:57.960> if<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.409> concrete

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
about concrete if you have concrete

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.609 
about concrete if you have concrete
roads<00:01:59.159> where<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.460> are<00:01:59.750> but<00:02:00.750> on<00:02:00.899> an<00:02:01.079> asphalt

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
roads where you are but on an asphalt

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.200 
roads where you are but on an asphalt
surface<00:02:02.130> they<00:02:03.000> literally<00:02:03.689> take<00:02:04.439> forever<00:02:05.210> to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
surface they literally take forever to

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.540 
surface they literally take forever to
get<00:02:06.869> something<00:02:07.380> off<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.890> these<00:02:08.039> if<00:02:08.399> you're

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
get something off of these if you're

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.830 
get something off of these if you're
looking<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> wheel<00:02:09.239> that's<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.720> to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
looking for a wheel that's going to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.100 
looking for a wheel that's going to
leave<00:02:10.110> big<00:02:10.410> lines<00:02:10.679> at<00:02:11.280> least<00:02:12.270> on

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
leave big lines at least on

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.890 
leave big lines at least on
the<00:02:13.350> kind<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.650> asphalt<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:15.240> have<00:02:15.750> down

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
the kind of asphalt that I have down

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.220 
the kind of asphalt that I have down
here<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.380> Dallas<00:02:16.740> Texas<00:02:16.920> area<00:02:18.170> they<00:02:19.170> do

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
here in the Dallas Texas area they do

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.920 
here in the Dallas Texas area they do
not<00:02:19.440> leave<00:02:20.280> thin<00:02:20.580> lines<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.060> do<00:02:21.210> not<00:02:21.240> wear

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
not leave thin lines that do not wear

not leave thin lines that do not wear
it's<00:02:22.290> taken<00:02:22.740> me<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.130> long<00:02:23.790> time<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:25.370> probably

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
it's taken me a long time of probably

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.670 
it's taken me a long time of probably
four<00:02:26.610> times<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.030> week<00:02:27.210> running<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:28.110> two<00:02:28.560> to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
four times a week running for two to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.290 
four times a week running for two to
three<00:02:28.890> hours<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:30.920> they<00:02:31.920> literally<00:02:32.910> they<00:02:33.120> just

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
three hours and they literally they just

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.440 
three hours and they literally they just
do<00:02:33.840> not<00:02:34.110> wear<00:02:34.590> which<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.520> really<00:02:36.060> good<00:02:36.210> thing

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
do not wear which is a really good thing

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.620 
do not wear which is a really good thing
and<00:02:36.660> they're<00:02:37.110> also<00:02:37.350> really<00:02:37.950> really<00:02:38.630> resilient

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
and they're also really really resilient

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.540

and<00:02:52.100> if<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.250> didn't<00:02:53.490> know<00:02:53.520> if<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.820> do<00:02:54.000> that

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
and if you didn't know if you do that

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.910 
and if you didn't know if you do that
your<00:02:54.780> wheels<00:02:54.960> are<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:55.170> gonna<00:02:55.380> flex<00:02:55.680> about<00:02:55.890> a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
your wheels are just gonna flex about a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.160 
your wheels are just gonna flex about a
whole<00:02:56.100> lot<00:02:56.280> easier<00:02:56.610> because<00:02:56.870> once<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.960> get<00:02:58.080> to

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
whole lot easier because once you get to

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.270 
whole lot easier because once you get to
ninety<00:02:58.410> degrees<00:02:58.710> your<00:02:58.890> wheels<00:02:59.070> aren't

ninety degrees your wheels aren't

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.010 
ninety degrees your wheels aren't
spinning<00:02:59.700> anymore<00:03:00.000> they're<00:03:00.150> just<00:03:00.180> pushing

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
spinning anymore they're just pushing

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.570 
spinning anymore they're just pushing
across<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.440> pavement<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.070> that's<00:03:02.370> how<00:03:02.520> a

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
across the pavement and that's how a

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.490 
across the pavement and that's how a
flood<00:03:02.850> spot<00:03:03.210> is<00:03:03.360> created<00:03:03.810> if<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.080> can<00:03:04.230> slide

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
flood spot is created if you can slide

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.740 
flood spot is created if you can slide
it<00:03:04.680> 80<00:03:05.370> degrees<00:03:05.850> something<00:03:06.270> like<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.570> you'll

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
it 80 degrees something like that you'll

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.360 
it 80 degrees something like that you'll
still<00:03:07.020> have<00:03:07.110> your<00:03:07.290> wheel<00:03:07.440> rotating<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.160> little

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
still have your wheel rotating a little

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.780 
still have your wheel rotating a little
bit<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:09.860> you<00:03:10.860> won't<00:03:11.040> get<00:03:11.130> those<00:03:11.310> flat<00:03:11.520> spots

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
bit and you won't get those flat spots

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.920 
bit and you won't get those flat spots
but<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.000> way<00:03:12.210> I<00:03:12.480> tend<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.470> slide<00:03:13.710> is<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.930> very

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
but the way I tend to slide is a very

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.840 
but the way I tend to slide is a very
prone<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.320> making<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.980> wheel<00:03:17.130> flat<00:03:17.400> spot<00:03:17.640> but

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
prone to making the wheel flat spot but

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.750 
prone to making the wheel flat spot but
with<00:03:18.000> these<00:03:18.180> wheels<00:03:18.480> not<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.410> case<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.310> don't

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
with these wheels not the case I I don't

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.190 
with these wheels not the case I I don't

know about the other durometer but with

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.530 
know about the other durometer but with

these particular ones the 82 a that's

these particular ones the 82 a that's

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
just not the case I will say when you

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.240 
just not the case I will say when you
slide<00:03:27.510> these<00:03:27.660> wheels<00:03:27.930> they<00:03:28.320> slow<00:03:28.770> you<00:03:28.830> down

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
slide these wheels they slow you down

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.770 
slide these wheels they slow you down
more<00:03:29.970> than<00:03:30.780> other<00:03:31.020> wheels<00:03:31.290> over<00:03:31.530> in<00:03:32.780> let's

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
more than other wheels over in let's

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.870 
more than other wheels over in let's
compare<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.590> let's<00:03:34.980> say<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.340> pink<00:03:35.640> power

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
tweakers something like that these are

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.660 
tweakers something like that these are
going<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.990> slow<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.230> down<00:03:43.350> more<00:03:43.770> even<00:03:44.459> though

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
going to slow you down more even though

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.640 
going to slow you down more even though
they<00:03:45.060> are<00:03:45.120> harder<00:03:45.600> durometer<00:03:46.080> I<00:03:46.290> don't<00:03:46.560> know

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
they are harder durometer I don't know

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.280 
they are harder durometer I don't know
how<00:03:47.490> that<00:03:47.610> really<00:03:47.730> makes<00:03:48.000> sense<00:03:48.330> but<00:03:48.630> that's

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
how that really makes sense but that's

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.810 
how that really makes sense but that's
just<00:03:49.440> how<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.709> works<00:03:49.860> with<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.280> kind<00:03:50.490> of<00:03:50.580> theme

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
just how it works with the kind of theme

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.750 
just how it works with the kind of theme
that<00:03:51.060> land<00:03:51.630> yonce<00:03:51.840> is<00:03:51.990> using<00:03:52.260> on<00:03:52.350> these<00:03:52.440> wheels

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
that land yonce is using on these wheels

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.470 
that land yonce is using on these wheels
so<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:54.690> type<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.260> slide<00:03:55.620> you're<00:03:55.860> gonna<00:03:55.980> get<00:03:56.220> is

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
so the type of slide you're gonna get is

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.430 
so the type of slide you're gonna get is
pretty<00:03:57.480> buttery<00:03:58.670> but<00:03:59.670> beware<00:04:00.420> once<00:04:01.260> you've

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
pretty buttery but beware once you've

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.520 
pretty buttery but beware once you've
run<00:04:02.100> them<00:04:02.310> down<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.490> couple<00:04:02.760> millimeters<00:04:03.530> your

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
run them down a couple millimeters your

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.830 
run them down a couple millimeters your
slides<00:04:04.800> will<00:04:04.980> start<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.420> kind<00:04:06.420> of<00:04:06.450> ice<00:04:06.630> out

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
slides will start to kind of ice out

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.910 
slides will start to kind of ice out
about<00:04:07.590> halfway<00:04:07.890> through<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.459> slide<00:04:08.700> which<00:04:09.330> I

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
about halfway through the slide which I

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.860 
about halfway through the slide which I
don't<00:04:10.920> think<00:04:11.640> is<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:11.910> good<00:04:12.120> thing<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:12.480> it's<00:04:12.630> a

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
don't think is a good thing and it's a

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.380 
don't think is a good thing and it's a
little<00:04:13.140> bit<00:04:13.320> unpredictable<00:04:14.060> because<00:04:15.060> you'll

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
little bit unpredictable because you'll

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.570 
little bit unpredictable because you'll
you'll<00:04:15.959> initiate<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.650> slide<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.250> you'll<00:04:17.459> be

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
you'll initiate the slide and you'll be

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.580 
you'll initiate the slide and you'll be
going<00:04:17.790> you<00:04:18.359> know<00:04:18.480> going<00:04:18.720> smooth<00:04:19.260> it's<00:04:19.380> going

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
going you know going smooth it's going

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.469 
going you know going smooth it's going
good<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.070> then<00:04:20.760> all<00:04:20.910> of<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:21.090> sudden<00:04:21.120> your

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
good and then all of a sudden your

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.379 
good and then all of a sudden your
wheels<00:04:21.660> just<00:04:21.930> said<00:04:22.140> too

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
wheels just said too

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.779 
wheels just said too
act<00:04:23.900> like<00:04:24.050> they're<00:04:24.379> on<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:25.220> ice<00:04:25.400> rink

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
act like they're on a ice rink

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.520 
act like they're on a ice rink
and<00:04:26.030> shoot<00:04:26.720> out<00:04:26.870> from<00:04:26.960> under<00:04:27.199> your<00:04:27.289> feet<00:04:27.349> and

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
and shoot out from under your feet and

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.200 
and shoot out from under your feet and
that's<00:04:27.800> how<00:04:27.979> you<00:04:28.039> end<00:04:28.159> up<00:04:28.340> in<00:04:28.460> your<00:04:28.580> ass<00:04:28.729> and

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
that's how you end up in your ass and

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.420 
that's how you end up in your ass and
you<00:04:30.050> cuts<00:04:30.379> on<00:04:30.530> your<00:04:30.560> arm<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.009> you<00:04:31.099> got<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.310> put

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
you cuts on your arm and you got to put

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.140 
you cuts on your arm and you got to put
band-aids<00:04:31.789> on<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.270> all<00:04:32.360> that<00:04:32.539> stuff<00:04:32.840> so<00:04:34.150> I'd

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
band-aids on and all that stuff so I'd

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.679 
band-aids on and all that stuff so I'd
say<00:04:35.449> that<00:04:36.199> these<00:04:36.379> wheels<00:04:36.710> are<00:04:37.419> any<00:04:38.419> more

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:38.689 
say that these wheels are any more

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:43.300 
say that these wheels are any more
buttery<00:04:39.080> esque<00:04:39.409> slide<00:04:39.919> than<00:04:40.219> sugary<00:04:41.620> but<00:04:42.620> you

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
buttery esque slide than sugary but you

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.969 
buttery esque slide than sugary but you
know<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:43.879> need<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.090> be<00:04:44.240> aware<00:04:44.479> of<00:04:44.889> icing<00:04:45.889> out

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
know you need to be aware of icing out

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.429 
know you need to be aware of icing out
depending<00:04:46.490> on<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.729> pavement<00:04:47.090> you're<00:04:47.210> on<00:04:47.439> so

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:48.439 
depending on the pavement you're on so

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.189 
depending on the pavement you're on so
these<00:04:49.310> are<00:04:49.490> durable<00:04:49.729> they<00:04:50.120> will<00:04:50.509> last<00:04:50.930> you<00:04:51.139> a

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
these are durable they will last you a

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.140 
these are durable they will last you a
long<00:04:51.349> time<00:04:51.409> and<00:04:52.009> that's<00:04:52.580> why<00:04:52.759> I'm<00:04:52.879> gonna<00:04:52.969> go

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
long time and that's why I'm gonna go

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.209 
long time and that's why I'm gonna go
ahead<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:53.629> recommend<00:04:54.110> them<00:04:54.409> to<00:04:54.469> you<00:04:54.620> guys<00:04:54.860> I

00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:55.219 
ahead and recommend them to you guys I

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:57.610 
ahead and recommend them to you guys I
I'm<00:04:55.909> not<00:04:56.180> gonna<00:04:56.360> say<00:04:56.599> anything<00:04:56.629> regarding<00:04:57.500> the

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
I'm not gonna say anything regarding the

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.020 
I'm not gonna say anything regarding the
other<00:04:57.770> durometer<00:04:58.280> so<00:04:58.520> I<00:04:58.580> can<00:04:58.729> only<00:04:58.819> imagine

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
other durometer so I can only imagine

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.360 
other durometer so I can only imagine
that<00:04:59.419> the<00:04:59.780> the<00:05:00.740> blue<00:05:00.949> ones

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
that the the blue ones

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.550 
that the the blue ones
steady<00:05:01.729> forays<00:05:02.210> are<00:05:02.419> probably<00:05:02.690> even<00:05:02.870> more<00:05:03.169> icy

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
steady forays are probably even more icy

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.860 
steady forays are probably even more icy
so<00:05:03.740> I<00:05:04.009> wouldn't<00:05:04.610> really<00:05:04.909> go<00:05:05.150> for<00:05:05.360> those<00:05:05.479> unless

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
so I wouldn't really go for those unless

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.839 
so I wouldn't really go for those unless
maybe<00:05:06.440> were<00:05:06.680> doing<00:05:06.919> freestyle<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.639> you<00:05:07.699> want

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
maybe were doing freestyle and you want

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.020 
maybe were doing freestyle and you want
a<00:05:07.909> super<00:05:08.210> easy<00:05:08.389> slide<00:05:08.810> and<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.979> 80s<00:05:10.580> are

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
a super easy slide and the 80s are

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.730 
a super easy slide and the 80s are
probably<00:05:11.900> I<00:05:12.400> don't<00:05:13.400> know<00:05:13.550> probably<00:05:13.819> maybe

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
probably I don't know probably maybe

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.140 
probably I don't know probably maybe
going<00:05:15.740> to<00:05:15.830> leave<00:05:15.979> same<00:05:16.250> for<00:05:16.490> you<00:05:16.580> guys<00:05:16.759> so<00:05:17.029> if

you<00:05:17.240> wanted<00:05:17.509> to<00:05:17.599> leave<00:05:17.719> something<00:05:17.990> maybe<00:05:18.620> go

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
you wanted to leave something maybe go

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.519 
you wanted to leave something maybe go
for<00:05:19.099> those<00:05:19.190> ones<00:05:19.520> I<00:05:19.699> don't<00:05:19.969> know<00:05:20.379> but<00:05:21.379> these

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:21.529 
for those ones I don't know but these

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.080 
for those ones I don't know but these
ones<00:05:21.710> here<00:05:22.009> they're<00:05:22.279> they're<00:05:22.610> pretty<00:05:22.909> good

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
ones here they're they're pretty good

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.629 
ones here they're they're pretty good
wheels<00:05:23.330> they'll<00:05:24.259> last<00:05:24.529> you<00:05:24.800> a<00:05:24.830> while<00:05:25.719> no<00:05:26.719> thing

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
wheels they'll last you a while no thing

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.399 
wheels they'll last you a while no thing
slides<00:05:28.639> can<00:05:28.849> be<00:05:28.969> a<00:05:29.000> little<00:05:29.389> bit<00:05:29.659> sketchy<00:05:30.020> but

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
slides can be a little bit sketchy but

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.559 
slides can be a little bit sketchy but
for<00:05:30.830> the<00:05:30.919> most<00:05:31.190> part<00:05:31.370> it's<00:05:31.819> a<00:05:32.029> it's<00:05:32.210> a<00:05:32.300> pretty

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:32.569 
for the most part it's a it's a pretty

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.740 
for the most part it's a it's a pretty
pretty<00:05:33.169> good<00:05:33.379> slide<00:05:33.699> so<00:05:34.699> I<00:05:34.729> think<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.539> price

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
pretty good slide so I think the price

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.540 
pretty good slide so I think the price
point<00:05:36.020> on<00:05:36.110> these<00:05:36.319> is<00:05:36.560> somewhere<00:05:37.099> around<00:05:37.190> forty

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
point on these is somewhere around forty

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.269 
point on these is somewhere around forty
five<00:05:37.699> to<00:05:37.849> fifty<00:05:38.120> dollars<00:05:38.150> which<00:05:38.659> is<00:05:38.839> you<00:05:39.139> know

five to fifty dollars which is you know

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:43.360 
five to fifty dollars which is you know
