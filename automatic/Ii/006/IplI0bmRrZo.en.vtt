defender can't get the ball from just

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.899 
defender can't get the ball from just
gets<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.650> bit<00:02:55.859> of<00:02:55.980> space<00:02:56.189> and<00:02:56.430> then<00:02:56.579> just<00:02:56.790> use

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
gets a bit of space and then just use

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.670

he<00:03:01.349> is<00:03:01.409> the<00:03:01.530> best<00:03:01.560> dribbling<00:03:02.099> of<00:03:02.220> any<00:03:02.519> player

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
he is the best dribbling of any player

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.929 
he is the best dribbling of any player
I've<00:03:03.030> ever<00:03:03.180> used<00:03:03.709> in<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.889> SNES<00:03:05.370> four-star

skills as well which is just a bonus um
so<00:03:10.560> yeah<00:03:10.829> another<00:03:11.400> positive<00:03:11.849> a<00:03:12.299> messy<00:03:12.689> is<00:03:12.870> his

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
so yeah another positive a messy is his

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.020 
so yeah another positive a messy is his
pace<00:03:13.290> he<00:03:13.500> does<00:03:13.680> feel<00:03:13.889> very<00:03:13.919> fast<00:03:14.519> i'm<00:03:14.730> not<00:03:14.849> sure

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
pace he does feel very fast i'm not sure

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.020 
pace he does feel very fast i'm not sure
if<00:03:15.150> he<00:03:15.239> feels<00:03:15.680> 96<00:03:16.680> pace<00:03:16.980> i<00:03:17.189> mean<00:03:17.340> cuz<00:03:17.549> its<00:03:17.760> high

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
if he feels 96 pace i mean cuz its high

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.849 
if he feels 96 pace i mean cuz its high
dribbling<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.629> agility<00:03:18.930> slow<00:03:19.560> him<00:03:19.680> down<00:03:19.739> a

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
dribbling and agility slow him down a

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.770 
dribbling and agility slow him down a
bit<00:03:20.129> but<00:03:20.489> he's<00:03:20.699> definitely<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.359> think<00:03:21.389> he's<00:03:21.659> are

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
bit but he's definitely I think he's are

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.289 
bit but he's definitely I think he's are
on<00:03:21.870> 90<00:03:22.440> pace<00:03:22.650> um<00:03:22.919> cuz<00:03:23.699> he's<00:03:23.849> really<00:03:24.120> really

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
on 90 pace um cuz he's really really

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.119 
on 90 pace um cuz he's really really
fast<00:03:24.510> as<00:03:24.659> hard<00:03:24.870> for<00:03:25.049> defenders<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.769> catch<00:03:25.919> up

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
fast as hard for defenders to catch up

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.920 
fast as hard for defenders to catch up
to<00:03:26.280> him<00:03:26.400> on<00:03:26.579> buddies<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.239> don't<00:03:27.419> think<00:03:27.479> he<00:03:27.750> feels

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
to him on buddies I don't think he feels

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.960 
to him on buddies I don't think he feels
around<00:03:28.139> 96<00:03:28.769> pace<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.190> think<00:03:29.370> he<00:03:29.430> might<00:03:29.579> be<00:03:29.699> a<00:03:29.729> bit

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
around 96 pace I think he might be a bit

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.330 
around 96 pace I think he might be a bit
slower<00:03:30.209> but<00:03:30.419> he's<00:03:30.540> still<00:03:30.720> very<00:03:31.349> very<00:03:31.530> fast<00:03:32.010> all

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
slower but he's still very very fast all

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.599 
slower but he's still very very fast all
right<00:03:33.180> another<00:03:33.569> positive<00:03:33.870> or<00:03:34.379> messy<00:03:34.739> is<00:03:34.919> that

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
right another positive or messy is that

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.689 
right another positive or messy is that
he<00:03:36.239> has<00:03:36.629> amazing<00:03:37.229> passes<00:03:37.709> like<00:03:37.979> he<00:03:38.220> picks<00:03:38.579> out

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
he has amazing passes like he picks out

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.069 
he has amazing passes like he picks out
really<00:03:39.060> good<00:03:39.150> through<00:03:39.419> balls<00:03:39.659> so<00:03:39.840> if<00:03:39.930> you're

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
really good through balls so if you're

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.920 
really good through balls so if you're
playing<00:03:40.590> him<00:03:40.769> with<00:03:40.889> another<00:03:41.190> striker<00:03:41.930> he'll

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
playing him with another striker he'll

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.330 
playing him with another striker he'll
definitely<00:03:43.169> be<00:03:43.379> really<00:03:43.739> good<00:03:43.889> for<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.099> those

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
definitely be really good for like those

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.550 
definitely be really good for like those
12<00:03:44.879> s<00:03:44.940> in<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.209> middle<00:03:45.479> to<00:03:45.599> send<00:03:46.229> your<00:03:46.379> other

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
12 s in the middle to send your other

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.000 
12 s in the middle to send your other
striker<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:48.239> yeah<00:03:48.840> his<00:03:49.019> Messi's<00:03:49.560> weak<00:03:49.799> foot

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
striker and yeah his Messi's weak foot

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.219 
striker and yeah his Messi's weak foot
all<00:03:50.129> those<00:03:50.280> three<00:03:50.760> stars<00:03:51.090> um<00:03:51.359> he's<00:03:52.019> still

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:52.229 
all those three stars um he's still

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:54.860 
all those three stars um he's still
really<00:03:52.440> able<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:53.010> do<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.250> he's<00:03:54.209> able<00:03:54.419> to<00:03:54.569> do

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
really able to do a he's able to do

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.539 
really able to do a he's able to do
really<00:03:55.290> nice<00:03:55.409> finesse<00:03:55.769> shots<00:03:56.010> with<00:03:56.220> his<00:03:56.370> weak

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
really nice finesse shots with his weak

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.860 
really nice finesse shots with his weak
foot<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:56.939> I<00:03:57.000> think<00:03:57.209> his<00:03:57.299> weak<00:03:57.479> foot<00:03:57.689> went

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
foot and I think his weak foot went

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.809 
foot and I think his weak foot went
unnoticed<00:03:58.019> which<00:03:58.919> is<00:03:59.069> I'm<00:03:59.400> not<00:03:59.549> sure<00:03:59.609> if

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
unnoticed which is I'm not sure if

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.939 
unnoticed which is I'm not sure if
that's<00:04:00.150> just<00:04:00.540> me<00:04:00.720> but<00:04:00.989> yeah<00:04:01.349> I<00:04:01.379> thought<00:04:01.620> his<00:04:01.769> we

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
that's just me but yeah I thought his we

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.849 
that's just me but yeah I thought his we
put<00:04:02.159> was<00:04:02.310> very<00:04:02.519> good<00:04:02.760> um<00:04:03.439> Messi's<00:04:04.439> negatives

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
put was very good um Messi's negatives

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.719 
put was very good um Messi's negatives
his<00:04:05.069> heading<00:04:05.459> is<00:04:05.870> not<00:04:06.870> good<00:04:07.169> I<00:04:07.349> mean<00:04:08.010> like<00:04:08.489> he's

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:08.729 
his heading is not good I mean like he's

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.689 
his heading is not good I mean like he's
too<00:04:08.939> short<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.599> do<00:04:09.720> headers<00:04:09.959> like<00:04:10.379> if<00:04:10.829> you<00:04:11.099> go

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
too short to do headers like if you go

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.520 
too short to do headers like if you go
if<00:04:11.970> you<00:04:12.419> match<00:04:12.750> them<00:04:12.870> up<00:04:12.989> with<00:04:13.049> the<00:04:13.169> legs<00:04:13.349> like

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
if you match them up with the legs like

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.589 
if you match them up with the legs like
Pepe<00:04:14.040> or<00:04:14.430> Java<00:04:14.699> Louise<00:04:15.030> which<00:04:15.269> you'll<00:04:15.479> know

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
Pepe or Java Louise which you'll know

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.539 
Pepe or Java Louise which you'll know
normally<00:04:16.259> get<00:04:16.409> they'll<00:04:16.590> just<00:04:16.739> tower<00:04:16.979> over<00:04:17.400> him

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
normally get they'll just tower over him

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.270 
normally get they'll just tower over him
and<00:04:17.780> he<00:04:18.780> won't<00:04:18.959> even<00:04:19.079> get<00:04:19.320> close<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.949> getting<00:04:20.220> a

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
and he won't even get close to getting a

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.640 
and he won't even get close to getting a
header<00:04:20.430> but<00:04:21.269> if<00:04:21.389> there's<00:04:21.750> nobody<00:04:22.169> marking<00:04:22.529> him

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
header but if there's nobody marking him

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.589 
header but if there's nobody marking him
then<00:04:22.919> obviously<00:04:23.250> he<00:04:23.520> will<00:04:23.849> head<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.479> ball

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
then obviously he will head the ball

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.379 
then obviously he will head the ball
