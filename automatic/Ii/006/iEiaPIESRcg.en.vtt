easiest way is to just go and search on
the<00:00:44.760> google<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> bio<00:00:45.420> edit<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.489> it<00:00:47.489> will<00:00:47.760> take

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the google the bio edit and it will take

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.680 
the google the bio edit and it will take
you<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:50.190> think<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.180> will<00:00:51.300> show<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
you to the I think it will show you the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.319 
you to the I think it will show you the
first<00:00:51.899> link<00:00:52.739> or<00:00:52.980> most<00:00:53.640> valid<00:00:53.820> second<00:00:54.180> link

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
first link or most valid second link

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.299 
first link or most valid second link
should<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.690> right<00:00:54.870> link<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.350> go<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
should be the right link to go to the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.209 
should be the right link to go to the
right<00:00:56.430> website<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.710> this<00:00:58.710> program<00:00:58.920> was

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
under the bio edit folder you will see a

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.949 
under the bio edit folder you will see a
link<00:02:09.569> for<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.840> program<00:02:10.379> as<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.459> see<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
link for the program as you can see the

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.850 
link for the program as you can see the
program<00:02:12.959> itself<00:02:13.500> is

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
program itself is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.640 
program itself is
very<00:02:13.980> simple<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.910> GUI<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.210> very<00:02:15.450> simple<00:02:15.900> right

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
very simple the GUI is very simple right

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.740 
very simple the GUI is very simple right
now<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.890> see<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.100> black<00:02:17.280> window<00:02:17.520> because<00:02:17.910> there

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
now you see a black window because there

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.810 
now you see a black window because there
is<00:02:18.810> no<00:02:19.050> sequence<00:02:19.410> open<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.100> that's<00:02:20.610> why<00:02:20.760> you

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
is no sequence open and that's why you

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.030 
is no sequence open and that's why you
only<00:02:20.970> see<00:02:21.270> seven<00:02:21.450> menu<00:02:22.080> items<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.770> top

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
only see seven menu items on the top

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.190 
only see seven menu items on the top
normally<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.790> has<00:02:23.850> more<00:02:24.270> accuracy<00:02:24.600> on<00:02:24.780> eleven

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
normally it has more accuracy on eleven

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.250 
normally it has more accuracy on eleven
options<00:02:25.940> once<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.090> have<00:02:27.270> any<00:02:27.420> sequence<00:02:27.870> open

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
options once you have any sequence open

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.350 
options once you have any sequence open
as<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.100> see<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.430> program<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:30.000> really

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
as you can see this program is really

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.050 
as you can see this program is really
really<00:02:30.600> simple<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:33.320> so<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:35.430> next<00:02:35.700> video<00:02:35.910> I

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
really simple and so the next video I

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.030 
really simple and so the next video I
will<00:02:36.330> talk<00:02:36.510> about<00:02:36.570> how<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.020> open<00:02:37.350> sequences

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
will talk about how to open sequences

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.580 
will talk about how to open sequences
into<00:02:38.220> by<00:02:38.460> origin<00:02:38.880> how<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.120> export<00:02:40.080> sequences

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
into by origin how to export sequences

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.470 
into by origin how to export sequences
out<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:40.920> by<00:02:41.070> edit<00:02:41.400> there<00:02:42.000> are<00:02:42.060> different<00:02:42.360> ways

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
out of by edit there are different ways

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.300 
out of by edit there are different ways
to<00:02:42.570> do<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.230> I'll<00:02:43.410> discuss<00:02:43.740> next<00:02:43.920> video

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
to do it and I'll discuss next video

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.450 
to do it and I'll discuss next video
thanks<00:02:44.970> for<00:02:45.120> watching
