00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.710
 very well then we start with the 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.270
 today's issues and we started 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.769
 talking about feeding if the 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.599
 feeding the babies more or less to 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.679
 six months the pediatrician everything indicates 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.969
 you start with the first meals 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.039
 semisolid it is true that your vessel for 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.230
 pellita this costs the baby 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.449
 start to get used to the flavors but 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.850
 it's interesting it 's very very funny 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.590
 start this process of course there's 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:32.529
 precise indications that we are going to 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:34.569
 give in the baby's first food is the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.499
 breast milk breastfeeding 

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:41.889
 exclusive this is adequate in nutrients 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:44.289
 in vitamins in calories in liquid 

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:46.600
 until six months of age is from 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.089
 from this moment we need 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.219
 incorporate what is called food 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.159
 complementary feeding 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.280
 complementary is a new stage of 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:00.160
 transition between what will be the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.050
 breastfeeding and adult feeding 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.910
 at this moment the boy starts to 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.010
 know the food why not 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.140
 it's just a stage to cover the 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.670
 requirements that milk no longer covers 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.479
 maternal but it is a stage 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.970
 exploratory where the guy stimulates his 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.030
 psychic or sensory development begins 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.450
 to know tastes textures food 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.750
 smells that's why it's important to leave it 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.910
 the explorer is going to get dirty is going to spit 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.399
 but it's normal because it's a way of 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.430
 know the food we need to go 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.950
 incorporating these foods one by one it 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.619
 does this incorporation one at a time and 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.770
 two or three days are waiting for 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.420
 incorporate a new food because of 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.240
 this way we can know if there is a 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.430
 intolerance to any of the foods 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.770
 that we are incorporating and if so, the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.899
 get it out of comment to mind from the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.580
 food on the other hand we are 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:04.440
 stimulating masticatory development 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.210
 jon let's think that the suction passes to 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.550
 start touching food and 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.830
 incorporate them by means of a spoon 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.620
 you have to have a lot of patience because 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.020
 something we must do is progressive 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.850
 is to begin to incorporate fruits first 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.250
 they can be mashed first well 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.340
 dissolved for the baby to start 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.380
 we know the then chokes 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.240
 begin to incorporate porridge purÃ©es 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.550
 carrot pumpkin potato sweet potato is 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.800
 You can add oil droplets on 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.780
 oil has a type of fat that helps 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.930
 to the development of the nervous system 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.660
 and it is not recommended to add sugars nis 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.050
 neither salt nor horn of sodium until the first 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.030
 year this first the sugars because a 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.990
 excess may predispose to obesity 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:59.560
 They can produce long decay apart 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.510
 yes if we had sugars there 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.010
 a high concentration of these hydrates 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.110
 of carbon in the intestine can 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.850
 produce diarrhea with respect to salt 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.220
 to sodium chloride 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.650
 it is not advisable to add it until the year 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.350
 At least avoid everything possible 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.930
 added sodium since the baby knows 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.150
 the sweet taste of mother's milk 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.360
 but he's not used to the taste 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.210
 salty and the less sodium 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.640
 incorporating him to the feeding is 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.790
 considers that in the long run and less risk 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.710
 of hypertension in the future 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.540
 it's also about not incorporating honey 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.420
 until the year and some pediatricians 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.750
 recommend up to three years because 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.120
 fresh unpasteurized honey can 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.620
 transmit the botulinum toxin that 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.050
 it produces a disease of the system 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.930
 nervous other foods that are treated 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.490
 to avoid until after three years 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.430
 are those that do not dissolve 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.980
 easily in the mouth that are difficult 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.680
 chewing that the baby can 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.500
 choke that from the seventh month 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.630
 that sixth month that incorporates 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.880
 food we are going to progress to 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.560
 seventh month you can incorporate meats 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.989
 well chopped 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.720
 and well cooked you also have to have 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.370
 Beware of poisonings and others 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.000
 foods that are incorporated in this 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.950
 stage are the desserts based on milk and 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.190
 well in this way we are progressing the 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:30.370
 feeding until a year can already 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:32.560
 eat a bit of everything directly we 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.600
 He was hungry, it made us want to see the 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.350
 report so here I stole from the 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.660
 refrigerator you know diego things like they come 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.100

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.050
 I want to have another baby to be able to use 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:51.100
 all this again we are going to have it 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:56.880
 that feeding directly give us 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.880
 want to have a baby in general look at this 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.560
 but one keeps marveling because 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.840
 many times this fails can happen to us 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.700
 but that's the way things are here 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.200
 something that kids can eat 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.850

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.380
