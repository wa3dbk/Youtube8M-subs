the<00:00:49.379> field<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.920> consistently<00:00:50.670> then

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the field on you consistently then

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.580 
the field on you consistently then
you're<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> run<00:00:51.780> into<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.110> problem<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
running out of time and that is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.939 
running out of time and that is
something<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.600> don't<00:00:54.870> want<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.590> mean

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
strategy so they go ahead and give me a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.160 
strategy so they go ahead and give me a
negative<00:03:15.600> five<00:03:16.080> thousand<00:03:16.680> points<00:03:17.870> I'll<00:03:18.870> know

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
negative five thousand points I'll know

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.420

if any of y'all have ever got a negative
score<00:03:20.760> but<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.150> think<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.750> reason<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.110> got<00:03:22.230> a

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
score but I think the reason I got a

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.740 
score but I think the reason I got a
negative<00:03:22.470> scores<00:03:22.920> because<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.730> really<00:03:24.480> didn't

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.590 
one that i found a lot more difficult
not<00:03:52.620> because<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.670> know<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.940> packers<00:03:54.330> are<00:03:54.360> so

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
not because you know the packers are so

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.420 
not because you know the packers are so
tough<00:03:54.870> for<00:03:54.900> whatever<00:03:55.320> but<00:03:55.560> mainly<00:03:56.250> because

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
tough for whatever but mainly because

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.660 
tough for whatever but mainly because
they<00:03:57.390> start<00:03:57.750> with<00:03:57.960> the<00:03:58.080> ball<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.670> you're

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
they start with the ball and you're

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.060 
they start with the ball and you're
working<00:03:59.820> against<00:04:00.270> a<00:04:00.510> lot<00:04:00.960> less<00:04:01.260> time<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.920> it's

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
working against a lot less time and it's

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.710 
working against a lot less time and it's
still<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.370> three-possession<00:04:02.940> game<00:04:02.970> at<00:04:03.510> being

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
still a three-possession game at being

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.500 
still a three-possession game at being
17<00:04:04.230> points<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:04.740> you<00:04:04.800> really<00:04:05.460> really<00:04:06.180> have<00:04:06.330> to

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
17 points so you really really have to

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.080 
17 points so you really really have to

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
pressure on their quarterbacks because

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.010 
pressure on their quarterbacks because
if<00:05:35.610> you<00:05:35.700> do<00:05:35.820> get<00:05:35.970> in<00:05:36.090> time<00:05:36.330> they're<00:05:36.840> going<00:05:36.960> to

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
make some plays and that is again what

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.120 
make some plays and that is again what
we<00:05:39.660> want<00:05:39.870> to<00:05:39.960> avoid<00:05:40.110> doing<00:05:40.440> so<00:05:40.620> you<00:05:40.860> want<00:05:41.070> to

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
we want to avoid doing so you want to

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.440 
we want to avoid doing so you want to
play<00:05:41.160> a<00:05:41.310> lot<00:05:41.550> of<00:05:41.669> high-risk<00:05:42.030> high-reward

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
play a lot of high-risk high-reward

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.680 
play a lot of high-risk high-reward
defenses<00:05:43.290> because<00:05:44.160> often<00:05:44.820> that's<00:05:45.360> the<00:05:45.510> best

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
defenses because often that's the best

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.930 
defenses because often that's the best
way<00:05:45.840> to<00:05:45.900> get<00:05:46.050> stops<00:05:46.350> and<00:05:46.680> you<00:05:47.370> know<00:05:47.490> that<00:05:47.640> holds

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
way to get stops and you know that holds

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.240 
way to get stops and you know that holds
true<00:05:47.970> against<00:05:48.330> users<00:05:48.690> as<00:05:48.840> well<00:05:48.870> so<00:05:49.380> pressure

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
true against users as well so pressure

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.480 
true against users as well so pressure
is<00:05:50.520> the<00:05:50.669> key<00:05:51.140> always<00:05:52.140> pressure<00:05:52.979> pressure

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
is the key always pressure pressure

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.659 
is the key always pressure pressure
pressure<00:05:54.000> it<00:05:54.960> causes<00:05:55.260> you<00:05:55.740> know<00:05:55.860> turnovers<00:05:56.490> it

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
pressure it causes you know turnovers it

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.360 
pressure it causes you know turnovers it
