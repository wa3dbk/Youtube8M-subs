00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 today we will do for the quota in a 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.510
 This is a very traditional dessert. 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.250
 very easy to do and I think 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.099
 Until I make no promises. 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.230
 know how to make this dessert put a 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.680
 Fresh cream pan has to be 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.510
 the fresh and a little sugar and the people 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.580
 It's going to heat up here but we do not 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.099
 it will boil as it gives a mixture 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.869
 And we're going to leave this mix 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.449
 very hot when you start to form the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.340
 balls around it is because it is 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.989
 There you can explain it. 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.250
 Meanwhile while heating up 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.410
 here I have a package here gelatin 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.110
 unflavored gelatin 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.239
 I 'll put it over mine 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.590
 milk here to give a moisturizing 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.699
 leave it here quietly for some 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.770
 to treat this gelatin I 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.449
 I'm going to use a vanilla bean for this 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.100
 recipe or put additional on my 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.439
 Shoulder on my cream with knife tip 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.689
 had the shot the seedlings that goes 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.700
 put everything in the truth but the seed 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.950
 that will give more flavor 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.750
 if you do not have a vanilla only 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.820
 put a little bit of essence 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.710
 Vanilla in the end, let's put it 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.950
 always in the end by essence not to 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.950
 cry 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.450

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.200

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.850

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.520
 be able to make a way to escape by 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.320
