would have been better but six is good
we<00:00:38.820> happy<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:40.460> let's<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.550> see<00:00:41.850> how

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
we happy with it and let's just see how

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.549 
we happy with it and let's just see how
it<00:00:41.969> goes<00:00:42.210> from<00:00:42.390> now<00:00:42.629> there's<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> bit<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.260> speed

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
it goes from now there's a bit of speed

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.950 
it goes from now there's a bit of speed
on<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.920> inside<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.480> someone<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.600> outside

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
on the inside and someone in the outside

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.510 
on the inside and someone in the outside
so<00:00:46.200> i<00:00:46.230> think<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.649> know<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.950> speeds<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.460> to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
so i think you know the speeds going to

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.319 
so i think you know the speeds going to
be<00:00:47.670> there<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.890> drawers<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.190> yeah<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.210> think

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
be there on the drawers so yeah I think

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.110 
be there on the drawers so yeah I think
we<00:00:51.719> got<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> reasonable<00:00:53.219> drive<00:00:53.370> idiot<00:00:53.610> with<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
we got a reasonable drive idiot with a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.270 
we got a reasonable drive idiot with a
problem<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:55.410> looks<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:55.739> plenty<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.010> speed

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
problem it looks to be plenty of speed

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.799 
problem it looks to be plenty of speed
both<00:00:56.550> outside<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.360> also<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.600> little<00:00:57.719> bit

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
both outside you and also a little bit

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.900 
both outside you and also a little bit
inside<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:58.920> are<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.039> envisage<00:00:59.250> happening

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
inside what are you envisage happening

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.970 
inside what are you envisage happening
in<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.059> race<00:01:00.230> exactly<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.500> mean<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.949> think

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
in the race exactly and I mean I think

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.189 
in the race exactly and I mean I think
dim<00:01:02.399> sums<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.000> come<00:01:03.480> over<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:03.870> go

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
dim sums going to come over and go

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.010 
dim sums going to come over and go
pretty<00:01:04.409> fast<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.040> ultra<00:01:05.580> fantasy<00:01:06.119> he<00:01:06.689> sees

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
pretty fast and ultra fantasy he sees

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.590 
pretty fast and ultra fantasy he sees
the<00:01:07.140> natural<00:01:07.500> speed<00:01:07.740> horse<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.210> should

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the natural speed horse so it should

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.530 
the natural speed horse so it should
stretch<00:01:09.900> them<00:01:10.140> out<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.210> you<00:01:12.210> know<00:01:12.270> with

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
stretch them out of it and you know with

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.660

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
very happy with it obviously this is the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
very happy with it obviously this is the
some<00:01:35.520> speed<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.060> inside<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.659> there's

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
some speed on it inside and there's

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.440 
some speed on it inside and there's
quite<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> bit<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.250> speed<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> outside<00:01:39.119> so

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
quite a bit of speed on the outside so

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.710 
quite a bit of speed on the outside so
they'll<00:01:40.049> guard<00:01:40.350> us<00:01:40.500> around<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.509> if<00:01:42.509> there's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
they'll guard us around and if there's

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.240 
they'll guard us around and if there's
no<00:01:42.869> speed<00:01:43.200> will<00:01:43.409> then<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.740> left<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.159> our

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
no speed will then you left to do our

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
no speed will then you left to do our
own<00:01:44.310> thing<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:44.610> they<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:45.000> leave<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:45.240> to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
own thing but they don't leave up to

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.060 
own thing but they don't leave up to
phoenix<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:46.439> only<00:01:46.530> been<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.740> few<00:01:46.770> minutes

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
phoenix it's only been a few minutes

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.710 
phoenix it's only been a few minutes
since<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.700> barrier<00:01:48.060> draw<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.509> you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
since the the barrier draw but if you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.690 
since the the barrier draw but if you
had<00:01:48.899> time<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.290> assess<00:01:49.590> who<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.130> main<00:01:50.280> dangers

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
had time to assess who the main dangers

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.630 
had time to assess who the main dangers
might<00:01:50.880> might<00:01:51.450> be<00:01:51.600> look<00:01:52.350> sacred<00:01:53.070> kingdom<00:01:53.430> me

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
might might be look sacred kingdom me

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.460 
might might be look sacred kingdom me
too<00:01:53.970> i<00:01:54.270> think<00:01:54.979> looking<00:01:55.979> at<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.250> race

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470
