00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
doing damage much but here we've got so

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.750 
doing damage much but here we've got so
many<00:02:54.750> they<00:02:55.260> actually<00:02:55.830> are<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.370> looks<00:02:56.610> like

they're all really low health but I

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.900 
they're all really low health but I
guess<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:58.950> doesn't<00:02:59.130> matter<00:02:59.430> because<00:02:59.640> there's

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
guess it doesn't matter because there's

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.270 
guess it doesn't matter because there's
so<00:03:00.150> many<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.660> them<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.959> golems<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.799> a<00:03:01.830> lot<00:03:02.130> of

so many of them and golems have a lot of

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.710 
so many of them and golems have a lot of
health<00:03:02.459> even<00:03:02.790> if<00:03:02.880> they're<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.299> red<00:03:03.510> that's

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
with this we've got our last jump spell

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.789 
with this we've got our last jump spell
on<00:03:29.609> the<00:03:29.760> top<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.420> it's<00:03:31.079> going<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.230> allow<00:03:31.590> those

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
on the top and it's going to allow those

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.949 
on the top and it's going to allow those
golems<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.280> jump<00:03:32.670> out<00:03:32.850> into<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.239> final<00:03:33.750> layer

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
golems to jump out into that final layer

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.410 
golems to jump out into that final layer
there<00:03:34.319> Wow<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.220> there<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.489> lot<00:03:35.910> of<00:03:35.940> golems

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
there Wow and there is a lot of golems

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.509 
there Wow and there is a lot of golems
left<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:36.930> had<00:03:37.200> no<00:03:37.440> idea<00:03:37.590> we<00:03:37.920> had<00:03:37.950> this<00:03:38.250> many

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
left I had no idea we had this many

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.759 
left I had no idea we had this many
golems<00:03:38.970> left<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:39.569> is<00:03:39.720> intense<00:03:40.230> we<00:03:40.680> are

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
golems left this is intense we are

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.190 
golems left this is intense we are
almost<00:03:40.950> at<00:03:41.250> 90%<00:03:41.700> I<00:03:42.269> can't<00:03:42.480> believe<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.049> I

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
almost at 90% I can't believe it I

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.440 
almost at 90% I can't believe it I
really<00:03:43.769> did<00:03:44.010> not<00:03:44.190> think<00:03:44.250> this<00:03:44.670> would<00:03:44.850> work<00:03:45.120> I

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
really did not think this would work I

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.270 
really did not think this would work I
thought<00:03:45.989> even<00:03:46.230> with<00:03:46.380> all<00:03:46.620> these<00:03:46.709> jump<00:03:47.040> spells

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
thought even with all these jump spells

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.940 
thought even with all these jump spells
the<00:03:47.549> golems<00:03:47.910> would<00:03:48.150> get<00:03:48.299> stuck<00:03:48.600> on<00:03:48.780> something

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
the golems would get stuck on something

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.530 
the golems would get stuck on something
then<00:03:49.950> they<00:03:50.040> don't<00:03:50.220> do<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.609> much<00:03:50.850> damage<00:03:51.329> so<00:03:51.359> I

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
then they don't do that much damage so I

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.970 
then they don't do that much damage so I
just<00:03:51.810> didn't<00:03:52.139> think<00:03:52.170> they<00:03:52.530> would<00:03:52.650> get<00:03:52.859> this

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
just didn't think they would get this

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.970 
just didn't think they would get this
far<00:03:53.280> we're<00:03:53.700> at<00:03:53.790> 97%<00:03:54.630> we<00:03:55.019> got<00:03:55.170> one<00:03:55.410> defense<00:03:55.739> left

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
far we're at 97% we got one defense left

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.460 
far we're at 97% we got one defense left
it<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.370> basically<00:03:56.790> a<00:03:56.880> wrap<00:03:57.389> we've<00:03:57.900> got<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:58.319> much

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
it is basically a wrap we've got so much

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.580 
it is basically a wrap we've got so much
time<00:03:58.739> left<00:03:58.799> time<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.880> kill<00:04:00.269> man<00:04:00.959> we've<00:04:01.380> got

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
time left time to kill man we've got

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.490 
time left time to kill man we've got
serious<00:04:02.579> time<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.910> kill<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.299> this<00:04:04.049> does<00:04:04.350> in

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
serious time to kill and this does in

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.680 
serious time to kill and this does in
fact<00:04:04.769> prove<00:04:05.190> that<00:04:05.609> we<00:04:05.790> are<00:04:05.940> too<00:04:06.180> cool<00:04:06.420> for
