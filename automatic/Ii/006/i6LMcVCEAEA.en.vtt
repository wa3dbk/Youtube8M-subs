00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
okay so I got a piece of fabric here if

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.340 
okay so I got a piece of fabric here if
we<00:00:16.740> are<00:00:18.050> going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.199> interface<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.680> okay<00:00:21.350> so

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
we are going to interface it okay so

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:42.799 
we are going to interface it okay so
this<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:23.160> going<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.609> show<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:41.809> fabric

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
this is going to show you fabric

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.830 
this is going to show you fabric
scissors<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.539> square

scissors and this is just a square
stammers<00:00:47.300> so<00:00:48.300> I'm<00:00:48.510> going<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> cut<00:00:49.110> something

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
stammers so I'm going to cut something

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:59.840 
stammers so I'm going to cut something
not<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:57.590> crossed<00:00:58.590> at<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.309> little<00:00:59.520> string

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
not to be crossed at this little string

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.009 
not to be crossed at this little string
off<00:01:00.059> with<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> rest<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.620> up<00:01:02.570> then<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.840> need

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
off with the rest of this up then I need

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.350 
off with the rest of this up then I need
to<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.739> piece<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.430> fan<00:01:05.670> or<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> piece<00:01:06.330> of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
to get a piece of fan or a piece of

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.840 
to get a piece of fan or a piece of
interfacing<00:01:06.780> that's<00:01:07.290> about<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.979> big<00:01:08.310> okay

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
interfacing that's about this big okay

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.600 
interfacing that's about this big okay
so<00:01:09.780> I'm<00:01:09.840> gonna<00:01:09.960> come<00:01:10.110> over<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:11.630> tonight<00:01:13.610> we

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
so I'm gonna come over here tonight we

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.429 
so I'm gonna come over here tonight we
whole<00:01:14.790> piece<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> interfacing<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:16.200> this

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
whole piece of interfacing or this

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.130 
whole piece of interfacing or this
bigger<00:01:16.710> thing<00:01:17.659> interfacing<00:01:20.479> now<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.990> how

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
bigger thing interfacing now this is how

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.580 
bigger thing interfacing now this is how
I<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.530> kind<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.799> guesstimate<00:01:23.340> how<00:01:24.590> much

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
I just kind of guesstimate how much

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.679 
I just kind of guesstimate how much
interface<00:01:26.040> vanity<00:01:26.549> I'll<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.270> put<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.570> up

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
interface vanity I'll just put it up

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.840 
interface vanity I'll just put it up
like<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.080> they<00:01:28.740> actually<00:01:28.920> there's<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.520> piece

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
like this they actually there's a piece

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.390 
like this they actually there's a piece
near<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.240> bottom<00:01:30.680> that's<00:01:31.680> about<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.220> size

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
near the bottom that's about the size

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.600 
near the bottom that's about the size
that<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.729> need<00:01:33.409> so<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.470> don't<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.040> cut<00:01:35.280> into

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
that I need so I don't have to cut into

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.950 
that I need so I don't have to cut into
it<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.000> make<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.960> big<00:01:37.229> ugly<00:01:37.409> shape

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:49.440 

better<00:01:41.960> getting<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:42.800> for<00:01:43.280> what<00:01:43.460> we're<00:01:43.760> doing

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.060 

now<00:01:50.020> remember<00:01:50.500> from<00:01:50.650> one<00:01:50.830> of<00:01:50.920> our<00:01:51.009> other

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
now remember from one of our other

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.130 
now remember from one of our other
videos<00:01:51.580> one<00:01:52.119> of<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.299> videos<00:01:52.600> in<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.900> past

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140

videos one of the videos in the past
where<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:53.560> learn<00:01:53.830> that<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:57.850> you're<00:01:58.210> doing

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
where you learn that if you're doing

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.190 
where you learn that if you're doing
your<00:01:59.409> interfacing<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.220> needs<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.670> be

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
your interfacing it needs to be

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.830 
your interfacing it needs to be
lightening<00:02:02.200> taller<00:02:02.560> than<00:02:03.310> your<00:02:03.520> piece

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
lightening taller than your piece

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.639 
lightening taller than your piece

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
to be a little bit smaller that way it

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.900 
to be a little bit smaller that way it
will<00:02:19.630> hold<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.470> fabric<00:02:20.860> better<00:02:21.099> don't

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
will hold to the fabric better don't

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.910 
will hold to the fabric better don't
know<00:02:22.060> really<00:02:22.269> why<00:02:22.660> this<00:02:22.720> is<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:25.420> business

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
know really why this is the the business

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.100 
know really why this is the the business
explanation<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.100> can<00:02:27.160> give<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.910> I'm<00:02:28.870> just

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
explanation I can give you I'm just

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.039 
explanation I can give you I'm just
going<00:02:29.319> to<00:02:29.380> cut<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.620> piece<00:02:29.709> into<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.430> big<00:02:30.840> okay

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
going to cut a piece into this big okay

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.020 
going to cut a piece into this big okay
the<00:02:32.470> best<00:02:32.680> explanation<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.549> I<00:02:33.580> can<00:02:33.670> give<00:02:33.910> you

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
the best explanation that I can give you

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.660 
the best explanation that I can give you
for<00:02:34.269> why<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.569> because<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.680> seems<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.160> hold<00:02:36.340> on

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
for why is because it seems to hold on

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.960 
for why is because it seems to hold on
to<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.989> fabric<00:02:38.230> better<00:02:38.709> when<00:02:39.130> it's<00:02:39.280> slightly

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
to the fabric better when it's slightly

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.650 
to the fabric better when it's slightly
smaller<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:42.580> I<00:02:42.970> can<00:02:43.959> see<00:02:44.230> through<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.680> fabric

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
smaller so I can see through this fabric

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.210 
smaller so I can see through this fabric
or<00:02:46.860> through<00:02:47.860> this<00:02:48.540> interfacing<00:02:49.799> so<00:02:50.799> I<00:02:50.830> kind<00:02:51.160> of

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
or through this interfacing so I kind of

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.330 
or through this interfacing so I kind of
know<00:02:51.340> where<00:02:51.549> to<00:02:51.700> cut<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:53.040> okay<00:02:54.040> most

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
know where to cut it okay most

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.819 
know where to cut it okay most
interfacing<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.120> can't<00:02:55.359> see<00:02:55.570> and<00:02:56.290> remember

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
interfacing you can't see and remember

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.370 
interfacing you can't see and remember
as<00:02:56.950> far<00:02:57.250> as<00:02:57.400> grain<00:02:57.730> lines<00:02:58.120> this<00:02:59.079> is<00:02:59.140> the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
as far as grain lines this is the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.440 
as far as grain lines this is the
straight<00:02:59.920> grain<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.549> this<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:00.910> actually<00:03:01.299> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
straight grain and this is actually the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.190 
straight grain and this is actually the
salvage<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:02.019> this<00:03:02.230> piece<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.880> interfacing<00:03:04.200> so

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
salvage of this piece of interfacing so

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.780 
salvage of this piece of interfacing so
in<00:03:05.530> knowing<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.609> still<00:03:07.030> needs<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.480> go

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
in knowing that it still needs to go

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.759 
in knowing that it still needs to go
grain<00:03:09.790> line<00:03:10.000> wise<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.750> same<00:03:10.989> direction<00:03:11.290> as<00:03:11.590> my

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
grain line wise the same direction as my

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.509 
grain line wise the same direction as my
family<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.400> have<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:12.820> gun<00:03:13.829> my<00:03:14.829> iron<00:03:15.040> is<00:03:15.280> hot

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
family so I have that gun my iron is hot

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.819 
family so I have that gun my iron is hot
now<00:03:16.980> I'm<00:03:17.980> going<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.489> do<00:03:18.609> a<00:03:18.640> very<00:03:19.000> small<00:03:19.829> amount

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
now I'm going to do a very small amount

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.970 
now I'm going to do a very small amount
of<00:03:20.950> steam<00:03:21.630> sometimes<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:23.019> steam<00:03:23.290> helps<00:03:23.560> set

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
of steam sometimes the steam helps set

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.319 
of steam sometimes the steam helps set
in<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.470> set<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.340> interfacing<00:03:27.940> I'm<00:03:28.030> doing

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
in and set the interfacing I'm doing

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.910 
in and set the interfacing I'm doing
pretty<00:03:28.570> high<00:03:29.040> amount<00:03:30.040> of<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:32.230> heat<00:03:32.620> I'm

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
pretty high amount of a of heat I'm

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.590 
pretty high amount of a of heat I'm
doing<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.400> all<00:03:33.579> the<00:03:33.700> way<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.060> top<00:03:34.299> where

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
doing it all the way to the top where

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.099 
doing it all the way to the top where
the<00:03:34.630> cotton<00:03:35.310> setting<00:03:36.310> is<00:03:36.579> now<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.660> best<00:03:37.870> thing

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
the cotton setting is now the best thing

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.559 
the cotton setting is now the best thing
that<00:03:38.140> you<00:03:38.319> could<00:03:38.709> do<00:03:38.890> is<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:40.120> take<00:03:40.299> another

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
that you could do is to take another

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.280 
that you could do is to take another
piece<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:40.870> muslin<00:03:41.260> or<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.799> piece<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.190> fabric

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
piece of muslin or a piece of fabric

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.260 
piece of muslin or a piece of fabric
preferably<00:03:44.290> muslin<00:03:44.920> so<00:03:45.489> you<00:03:45.549> don't

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
preferably muslin so you don't

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.750 
preferably muslin so you don't
anything<00:03:46.600> and<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.500> use<00:03:47.770> it<00:03:47.980> as<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.310> pressing

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
anything and to use it as a pressing

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.970 
anything and to use it as a pressing
cloth<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.960> will<00:03:50.110> help<00:03:50.260> if<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.590> having

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
cloth and it will help if you having

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.010 
cloth and it will help if you having
large<00:03:51.250> piece<00:03:51.520> of<00:03:51.700> muslin<00:03:51.910> or<00:03:52.330> maybe<00:03:52.600> even<00:03:52.690> a

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
large piece of muslin or maybe even a

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.560 
large piece of muslin or maybe even a
large<00:03:53.230> piece<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.800> a<00:03:54.010> smaller<00:03:54.310> piece<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:55.390> you

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
large piece and a smaller piece that you

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.520 
large piece and a smaller piece that you
could<00:03:55.750> use<00:03:55.960> just<00:03:55.990> for<00:03:56.880> pressing<00:03:57.880> call<00:03:58.200> okay<00:03:59.230> so

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
could use just for pressing call okay so

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.740 
could use just for pressing call okay so
I'm<00:03:59.590> going<00:03:59.770> to<00:03:59.830> do<00:03:59.980> that<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.400> show<00:04:00.610> you<00:04:00.750> this

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
I'm going to do that to show you this

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
I'm going to do that to show you this
way<00:04:02.020> to<00:04:02.080> do<00:04:02.320> that<00:04:02.730> now<00:04:03.730> set<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.150> down<00:04:04.740> put<00:04:05.740> a

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
way to do that now set it down put a

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.380 
way to do that now set it down put a
little<00:04:05.980> steam<00:04:06.190> on<00:04:06.460> it<00:04:06.640> running<00:04:07.060> back<00:04:07.210> and

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
little steam on it running back and

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.290 
little steam on it running back and
forth<00:04:07.480> to<00:04:07.900> try<00:04:08.050> to<00:04:08.170> make<00:04:08.380> sure<00:04:08.410> it's<00:04:08.860> sticking

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.690 

when<00:04:13.300> you<00:04:13.420> may<00:04:13.600> be<00:04:13.660> able<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:14.020> hear<00:04:14.260> this<00:04:14.700> and

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
when you may be able to hear this and

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.979 
when you may be able to hear this and
the<00:04:15.760> most<00:04:15.970> slowly<00:04:16.330> slide<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:18.070> do<00:04:18.250> some<00:04:18.489> steam

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
the most slowly slide and do some steam

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.900 
the most slowly slide and do some steam
that<00:04:19.989> has<00:04:20.290> like<00:04:20.620> I<00:04:20.770> said<00:04:20.980> a<00:04:21.010> small<00:04:21.310> amount<00:04:21.730> of

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
that has like I said a small amount of

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.500 
that has like I said a small amount of
steam<00:04:22.210> coming<00:04:22.240> out<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:23.050> it<00:04:24.030> but<00:04:25.030> you<00:04:25.150> need<00:04:25.300> to

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
steam coming out of it but you need to

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:34.350 
steam coming out of it but you need to
move<00:04:25.720> slowly<00:04:31.170> and<00:04:32.170> go<00:04:32.350> over<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:33.910> we've<00:04:34.120> done

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
move slowly and go over so we've done

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.090 
move slowly and go over so we've done
this<00:04:34.570> side<00:04:34.810> you<00:04:35.110> can<00:04:35.170> see<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.590> part<00:04:35.860> where<00:04:36.010> we

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
this side you can see the part where we

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.640 
this side you can see the part where we
did<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.520> where<00:04:36.670> we<00:04:36.790> didn't<00:04:37.090> do<00:04:37.500> so<00:04:38.500> we're

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
did and where we didn't do so we're

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.230 
did and where we didn't do so we're
going<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:38.860> go<00:04:39.070> from<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.400> other<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:39.880> other

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
going to go from the other to the other

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.960 
going to go from the other to the other
side<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:44.680> sometimes<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.340> do<00:04:45.430> have<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.790> give

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
side and sometimes you do have to give

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.340 
side and sometimes you do have to give
it<00:04:46.090> a<00:04:46.180> couple<00:04:46.420> passes<00:04:47.220> just<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.340> make<00:04:48.580> sure<00:04:49.350> it

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
it a couple passes just to make sure it

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.280 
it a couple passes just to make sure it
is<00:04:50.740> as<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.220> interface<00:04:51.610> as<00:04:51.910> possible<00:04:52.480> just<00:04:55.290> go

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
is as the interface as possible just go

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:03.770 
is as the interface as possible just go
over<00:04:56.470> it

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.600

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.080 
it is up and got all this thread on her
but<00:05:41.110> yeah<00:05:41.320> so<00:05:41.680> this<00:05:41.860> is<00:05:41.920> interface<00:05:42.610> well<00:05:42.880> now

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
but yeah so this is interface well now

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.610 
but yeah so this is interface well now
you<00:05:43.150> can<00:05:43.510> turn<00:05:43.720> onto<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.170> front<00:05:44.410> of<00:05:44.530> the

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
you can turn onto the front of the

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.610 
you can turn onto the front of the
fabric<00:05:45.510> you<00:05:46.510> can<00:05:46.630> kind<00:05:46.840> of<00:05:46.900> press<00:05:47.140> it<00:05:47.170> a<00:05:47.440> little

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
fabric you can kind of press it a little

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.330 
fabric you can kind of press it a little
bit<00:05:47.830> more<00:05:48.780> if<00:05:49.780> you<00:05:49.840> mess<00:05:50.350> up<00:05:50.380> and<00:05:50.890> you<00:05:51.160> need<00:05:51.280> to

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
bit more if you mess up and you need to

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.270 
bit more if you mess up and you need to
pull<00:05:51.670> the<00:05:51.700> interfacing<00:05:52.420> off<00:05:52.890> go<00:05:53.890> through<00:05:54.130> this

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
pull the interfacing off go through this

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.170 
pull the interfacing off go through this
process<00:05:54.610> and<00:05:55.770> steam<00:05:56.770> it<00:05:57.040> and<00:05:57.300> it<00:05:58.300> should

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
process and steam it and it should

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.850 
process and steam it and it should
Muhsin<00:06:01.180> the<00:06:01.540> interfacing<00:06:02.170> just<00:06:02.380> well<00:06:02.590> enough

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
Muhsin the interfacing just well enough

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.940 
Muhsin the interfacing just well enough
for<00:06:03.070> you<00:06:03.160> to<00:06:03.280> be<00:06:03.400> able<00:06:03.550> to<00:06:03.730> pull<00:06:04.000> it<00:06:04.150> off<00:06:04.950> and

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
for you to be able to pull it off and

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.770 
for you to be able to pull it off and
you<00:06:06.010> can<00:06:06.130> pull<00:06:06.460> it<00:06:06.580> off<00:06:06.700> slowly<00:06:07.770> okay<00:06:09.330> but<00:06:10.330> if

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
you can pull it off slowly okay but if

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.480 
you can pull it off slowly okay but if
you<00:06:11.170> don't<00:06:11.380> need<00:06:11.530> to<00:06:11.590> do<00:06:11.830> that<00:06:12.040> don't<00:06:12.340> do<00:06:12.460> that

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
you don't need to do that don't do that

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.960 
you don't need to do that don't do that
because<00:06:13.530> the<00:06:14.530> more<00:06:14.770> you<00:06:14.950> go<00:06:15.130> keep<00:06:15.490> going<00:06:15.790> back

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
because the more you go keep going back

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.490 
because the more you go keep going back
and<00:06:16.000> forth<00:06:16.270> the<00:06:16.990> harder<00:06:17.380> it<00:06:17.440> is<00:06:17.530> to<00:06:17.590> reify<00:06:18.280> it

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
and forth the harder it is to reify it

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.320 
and forth the harder it is to reify it
because<00:06:20.500> you're<00:06:20.680> kind<00:06:20.980> of<00:06:21.070> like<00:06:21.310> messing<00:06:22.210> up

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
because you're kind of like messing up

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.720 
because you're kind of like messing up
the<00:06:22.480> glue<00:06:22.690> okay<00:06:25.890> there's<00:06:26.890> that<00:06:27.220> and<00:06:27.460> like<00:06:27.610> I

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.730 
the glue okay there's that and like I

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.320 
the glue okay there's that and like I
said<00:06:27.790> make<00:06:28.180> sure<00:06:29.340> there's<00:06:30.340> like<00:06:30.730> a<00:06:31.060> little

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
said make sure there's like a little

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.780 
said make sure there's like a little
halo<00:06:31.660> effect<00:06:32.050> going<00:06:32.680> around<00:06:33.010> it<00:06:33.310> doesn't<00:06:33.670> need

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
halo effect going around it doesn't need

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.820 
halo effect going around it doesn't need
to<00:06:33.880> go<00:06:33.970> all<00:06:34.090> the<00:06:34.210> way<00:06:34.270> to<00:06:34.360> the<00:06:34.600> edge<00:06:34.750> and<00:06:35.140> then

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
to go all the way to the edge and then

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.710 
to go all the way to the edge and then
you'll<00:06:36.040> do<00:06:36.220> your<00:06:36.430> best<00:06:36.490> interfacing<00:06:37.390> that<00:06:37.420> way

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
you'll do your best interfacing that way

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.860 
you'll do your best interfacing that way
okay<00:06:38.490> now<00:06:39.490> I'm<00:06:39.580> not<00:06:39.730> going<00:06:39.910> to<00:06:40.000> show<00:06:40.150> you<00:06:40.210> the

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
okay now I'm not going to show you the

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.960 
okay now I'm not going to show you the
sew<00:06:41.080> on<00:06:41.290> interfacing<00:06:42.040> because<00:06:42.550> that<00:06:42.790> one's

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
sew on interfacing because that one's

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.990 
sew on interfacing because that one's
pretty<00:06:43.150> self-explanatory<00:06:44.130> it's<00:06:45.130> just<00:06:45.820> like

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
pretty self-explanatory it's just like

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.350 
pretty self-explanatory it's just like
if<00:06:46.180> we<00:06:46.210> took<00:06:46.510> this<00:06:46.840> and<00:06:47.740> you<00:06:47.920> layer<00:06:48.160> it<00:06:48.190> so<00:06:49.150> your

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
if we took this and you layer it so your

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.630 
if we took this and you layer it so your
layers<00:06:49.540> together<00:06:50.250> inside<00:06:51.250> the<00:06:51.430> seam

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:51.640 
layers together inside the seam

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.120 
layers together inside the seam
allowance<00:06:52.090> not<00:06:52.360> on<00:06:52.630> the<00:06:52.780> seam<00:06:53.020> line<00:06:53.230> inside

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 
allowance not on the seam line inside

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.870 
allowance not on the seam line inside
the<00:06:54.160> seam<00:06:54.490> allowance<00:06:55.230> and<00:06:56.230> then<00:06:56.770> you<00:06:57.520> saw<00:06:57.700> your

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
the seam allowance and then you saw your

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.260 
the seam allowance and then you saw your
actual<00:06:58.300> garment<00:06:58.750> teacher<00:06:59.200> so<00:07:00.160> it<00:07:00.310> acts<00:07:00.670> like<00:07:00.880> a

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270 
actual garment teacher so it acts like a

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.450 
actual garment teacher so it acts like a
double<00:07:01.780> layer<00:07:01.960> you<00:07:02.560> can<00:07:02.680> do<00:07:02.800> the<00:07:02.920> same<00:07:03.130> thing

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460 
double layer you can do the same thing

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.620 
double layer you can do the same thing
using<00:07:04.360> just<00:07:04.750> another<00:07:05.080> layer<00:07:05.530> of<00:07:05.890> fabric<00:07:06.630> now

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:07.630 
using just another layer of fabric now

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.960 
using just another layer of fabric now
if<00:07:08.260> we<00:07:08.470> wanted<00:07:08.680> to<00:07:08.740> cut<00:07:09.010> something<00:07:09.250> out<00:07:09.550> which

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
if we wanted to cut something out which

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.100 
if we wanted to cut something out which
I'll<00:07:10.120> show<00:07:10.300> you<00:07:10.360> next<00:07:10.770> this<00:07:11.770> is<00:07:11.920> how
