00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
what I dislike about my other residences

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.830 
what I dislike about my other residences
where<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.639> these<00:01:59.759> huge<00:02:00.029> bathrooms<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
where I have these huge bathrooms and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.569 
where I have these huge bathrooms and
all<00:02:00.929> these<00:02:01.049> cabinets<00:02:01.559> is<00:02:01.709> that<00:02:01.829> these<00:02:02.009> drawers

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
all these cabinets is that these drawers

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.879 
all these cabinets is that these drawers
are<00:02:02.880> all<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.450> low<00:02:03.779> and<00:02:04.169> these<00:02:04.259> cabinets<00:02:04.799> are

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:04.889 
are all so low and these cabinets are

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:06.919 
are all so low and these cabinets are
low<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.969> every<00:02:06.209> time<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:06.539> to<00:02:06.569> use<00:02:06.899> a

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
low and so every time I have to use a

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.959 
low and so every time I have to use a
daily<00:02:07.349> item<00:02:07.919> like<00:02:08.160> creme<00:02:08.429> or<00:02:08.580> something<00:02:08.879> I'm

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:08.969 
daily item like creme or something I'm

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:10.830 
daily item like creme or something I'm
bending<00:02:09.420> down<00:02:09.689> to<00:02:09.929> get<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.469> it's<00:02:10.560> very

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
bending down to get it and it's very

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.720 
bending down to get it and it's very
inconvenient<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.099> then<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.310> don't<00:02:12.519> reach<00:02:12.700> for

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
inconvenient so then I don't reach for

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.610 
inconvenient so then I don't reach for
them<00:02:13.060> as<00:02:13.239> much<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.750> then<00:02:13.840> they<00:02:13.930> tend<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.410> go

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
them as much and then they tend to go

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.979 
them as much and then they tend to go
bad<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.610> it's<00:02:15.760> good<00:02:15.940> about<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:16.330> system<00:02:16.780> as<00:02:16.900> I

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
bad so it's good about this system as I

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.990 
bad so it's good about this system as I
have<00:02:17.260> all<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.620> my<00:02:17.800> daily<00:02:18.129> things<00:02:18.519> I<00:02:18.670> use<00:02:18.970> in
