excellence<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.270> concrete<00:00:06.629> construction

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
excellence and concrete construction

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.690 
excellence and concrete construction
word<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.500> different<00:00:07.890> in<00:00:08.010> that<00:00:08.040> it<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.670> a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
word is different in that it is a

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.090 
word is different in that it is a
project-based<00:00:09.420> award<00:00:09.900> system<00:00:10.350> versus<00:00:10.769> a

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100 
project-based award system versus a

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.030 
project-based award system versus a
personal<00:00:11.760> award<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:12.990> will<00:00:13.080> be<00:00:13.259> awarded<00:00:14.009> to

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
personal award so it will be awarded to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.280 
personal award so it will be awarded to
a<00:00:14.190> group<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.059> people<00:00:15.599> but<00:00:15.900> it's<00:00:16.049> actually

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 
a group of people but it's actually

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.130 
a group of people but it's actually
projects<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.130> showing<00:00:17.580> what<00:00:18.330> we've<00:00:18.480> done<00:00:18.689> what

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
projects is showing what we've done what

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.740 
projects is showing what we've done what
concrete<00:00:19.590> can<00:00:19.830> actually<00:00:20.130> do<00:00:20.340> there's<00:00:20.910> many

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
concrete can actually do there's many

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.560 
concrete can actually do there's many
chapters<00:00:22.320> at<00:00:22.650> both<00:00:22.830> local<00:00:23.279> awards<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.510> we

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
chapters at both local awards and we

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.320 
chapters at both local awards and we
were<00:00:24.689> trying<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.140> come<00:00:25.560> up<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:25.680> an<00:00:25.890> idea<00:00:26.010> of

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
were trying to come up with an idea of

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.179 
were trying to come up with an idea of
how<00:00:27.330> everyone<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:27.869> sort<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.439> join<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
how everyone can sort of join in and

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.380 
how everyone can sort of join in and
create<00:00:29.490> one<00:00:29.699> big<00:00:30.289> awards<00:00:31.289> program<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
create one big awards program the

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.360 
create one big awards program the
excellence<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.480> concrete<00:00:33.930> Awards<00:00:34.530> become

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
excellence of concrete Awards become

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.520 
excellence of concrete Awards become
again<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.150> next<00:00:36.510> step<00:00:36.600> for<00:00:37.080> the<00:00:37.170> chapter

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
again that next step for the chapter

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.470 
again that next step for the chapter
winners<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.160> they're<00:00:38.579> winners<00:00:38.820> become<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
winners so they're winners become the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.440 
winners so they're winners become the

the awards will help benefit chapters by

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.380 
the awards will help benefit chapters by
providing<00:01:26.070> more<00:01:26.370> exposure<00:01:26.730> for<00:01:27.060> local

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
projects it will give new incentive for

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.010 
projects it will give new incentive for
local<00:01:31.800> our<00:01:32.070> architects<00:01:33.030> engineering<00:01:33.720> firms

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
local our architects engineering firms

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.290 
local our architects engineering firms
to<00:01:34.740> go<00:01:34.950> ahead<00:01:35.190> and<00:01:35.340> submit<00:01:35.520> projects<00:01:36.090> for

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.850 
to go ahead and submit projects for
awards<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.780> will<00:01:36.930> not<00:01:37.080> only<00:01:37.230> be<00:01:37.440> local<00:01:37.830> but

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
awards that will not only be local but

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.830 
awards that will not only be local but
then<00:01:38.220> will<00:01:38.400> be<00:01:38.430> elevated<00:01:39.090> potentially<00:01:39.660> up<00:01:39.810> to

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
a nationally and internationally

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.570 
a nationally and internationally
recognized<00:01:42.420> level<00:01:42.810> therefore<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.950> expect<00:01:44.100> a

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
recognized level therefore we expect a

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.610 
recognized level therefore we expect a
maybe<00:01:44.940> a<00:01:45.240> membership<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.870> increase<00:01:46.410> in

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
maybe a membership to increase in

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.469 
maybe a membership to increase in
chapters<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.520> grow<00:01:47.729> they'll<00:01:48.030> benefit

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
chapters that to grow they'll benefit

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.730 
chapters that to grow they'll benefit
chapters<00:01:48.979> by<00:01:49.979> adding<00:01:50.490> prestige<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.990> chapter

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
chapters by adding prestige to chapter
