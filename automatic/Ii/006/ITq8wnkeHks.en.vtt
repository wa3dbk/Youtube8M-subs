in maple woods so yeah I mean it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.270 
in maple woods so yeah I mean it
hopefully<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.180> close<00:00:57.989> enough<00:00:58.050> spawns<00:00:59.010> right

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
hopefully it's close enough spawns right

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.520 
hopefully it's close enough spawns right
over<00:00:59.460> there<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.539> know<00:01:00.629> 200<00:01:01.079> blocks

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
over there this is you know 200 blocks

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.780 
over there this is you know 200 blocks
away<00:01:02.149> and<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.300> not<00:01:03.480> completely<00:01:04.229> within<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
away and it's not completely within the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.640 
away and it's not completely within the
maple<00:01:06.119> woods<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.600> maple<00:01:06.869> woods<00:01:07.049> as<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.530> can

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
maple woods the maple woods as you can

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.750 
maple woods the maple woods as you can
see<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.400> darker<00:01:08.760> green<00:01:09.000> grass<00:01:09.930> there<00:01:10.760> it

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
see the the darker green grass there it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.850 
see the the darker green grass there it
goes<00:01:11.970> around<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.740> not

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
goes around like that so it's not

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.810 
goes around like that so it's not
completely<00:01:14.490> within<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:16.259> maple<00:01:16.650> woods<00:01:16.860> but

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
completely within the maple woods but

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.149 
completely within the maple woods but
hopefully<00:01:18.390> um<00:01:19.040> this<00:01:20.040> will<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.460> good<00:01:21.060> enough<00:01:21.210> I

hopefully um this will be good enough I

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.210 
hopefully um this will be good enough I
guess<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.930> mean<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.200> good<00:01:25.409> village<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.100> a

a nice village um if you make the seed
your<00:01:33.000> village<00:01:33.329> will<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> little<00:01:33.840> different

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
your village will be a little different

your village will be a little different
like<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:35.189> thing<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:38.060> yeah<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
like that thing the yeah that the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.230 
like that thing the yeah that the
graveyard<00:01:40.890> might<00:01:41.100> be<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.729> know<00:01:41.850> somewhere

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
graveyard might be you know somewhere

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.210 
graveyard might be you know somewhere
else<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.840> something<00:01:43.110> else<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.470> its<00:01:43.590> place<00:01:43.649> or

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
else and something else in its place or

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.130 
else and something else in its place or
I<00:01:44.399> noticed<00:01:45.149> those<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.659> switch<00:01:45.869> places

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
I noticed those like to switch places

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.310 
I noticed those like to switch places
with<00:01:46.470> farms<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:48.180> know<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.659> may<00:01:48.899> be<00:01:48.960> that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
with farms so you know it may be that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.770 
with farms so you know it may be that
there's<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.799> farm<00:01:50.100> there<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:53.780> graveyards

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
there's a farm there and the graveyards

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.139 
there's a farm there and the graveyards
over<00:01:54.960> there<00:01:56.750> down<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.079> little<00:01:58.770> hole<00:01:59.670> here

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
over there down in this little hole here

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.569 
over there down in this little hole here
just<00:02:00.450> remember<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.829> if<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
just remember that you know if the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.920 
just remember that you know if the
graveyard<00:02:02.969> does<00:02:03.149> move<00:02:03.420> there's<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.719> chance

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
graveyard does move there's a chance

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.920 
graveyard does move there's a chance
this<00:02:04.079> hole<00:02:04.290> won't<00:02:04.590> actually<00:02:04.829> be<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.930> but

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
this hole won't actually be here but

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.469 
this hole won't actually be here but
there<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.140> diamonds<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.979> course<00:02:08.479> because

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
there is diamonds of course because

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.869 
there is diamonds of course because
diamonds<00:02:09.720> are<00:02:10.080> quite<00:02:10.770> abundant<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.550> attack

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
diamonds are quite abundant and attack

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.280 
diamonds are quite abundant and attack
of<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.090> b-team

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
of the b-team

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.199 
of the b-team
you<00:02:14.290> can<00:02:14.470> see<00:02:14.590> it's<00:02:14.709> it's<00:02:15.099> a<00:02:15.250> decent<00:02:15.670> vein<00:02:15.879> of

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
you can see it's it's a decent vein of

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.509 
you can see it's it's a decent vein of
diamonds<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:16.900> mean<00:02:17.739> it's<00:02:17.890> not<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.159> greatest

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
diamonds I mean it's not the greatest

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.930 
diamonds I mean it's not the greatest
but<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:19.239> get<00:02:19.390> what<00:02:19.569> four<00:02:19.989> diamonds<00:02:20.349> are<00:02:20.500> five

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
but you get what four diamonds are five

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:31.520 
but you get what four diamonds are five
five<00:02:21.940> diamonds<00:02:22.420> six<00:02:23.019> seven<00:02:25.530> eight<00:02:26.530> nine<00:02:28.829> ten

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
five diamonds six seven eight nine ten

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.130 
five diamonds six seven eight nine ten
so<00:02:32.530> ten<00:02:32.860> eleven<00:02:33.760> twelve<00:02:36.000> yeah<00:02:37.000> that's<00:02:37.360> that's

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
so ten eleven twelve yeah that's that's

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.380 
so ten eleven twelve yeah that's that's
actually<00:02:38.409> a<00:02:38.650> really<00:02:39.190> big<00:02:39.459> vein<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.150> think

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
actually a really big vein that I think
