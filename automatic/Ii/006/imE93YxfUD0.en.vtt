00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
look if you've been shopping for brush

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.290 
look if you've been shopping for brush
if<00:00:35.980> you're<00:00:36.100> probably<00:00:36.309> seen<00:00:36.640> a<00:00:36.670> flat<00:00:37.030> brush

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
if you're probably seen a flat brush

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.079 
if you're probably seen a flat brush
like<00:00:37.570> this<00:00:37.780> that's<00:00:38.079> how<00:00:38.289> that<00:00:38.949> has<00:00:39.190> a<00:00:39.550> handle

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
like this that's how that has a handle

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:41.819 
like this that's how that has a handle
that<00:00:40.149> looks<00:00:40.570> like<00:00:40.719> this<00:00:41.109> with<00:00:41.350> this<00:00:41.469> little

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
that looks like this with this little

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.619 
that looks like this with this little
slash<00:00:42.449> or<00:00:43.449> cut<00:00:44.320> angled<00:00:44.800> cut<00:00:45.100> on<00:00:45.309> the<00:00:45.489> end

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
slash or cut angled cut on the end

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.720 
slash or cut angled cut on the end
that's<00:00:46.629> actually<00:00:47.109> a<00:00:47.140> pretty<00:00:47.589> useful<00:00:48.249> tool<00:00:48.460> for

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
that's actually a pretty useful tool for

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.270 
that's actually a pretty useful tool for
watercolors<00:00:49.499> let<00:00:50.499> me<00:00:50.620> show<00:00:50.769> you<00:00:50.829> how<00:00:51.039> it<00:00:51.129> works

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
watercolors let me show you how it works

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.899 
watercolors let me show you how it works
okay<00:00:51.609> if<00:00:51.969> I'm<00:00:52.149> doing<00:00:52.449> a<00:00:52.539> wash<00:00:53.219> maybe<00:00:54.219> it<00:00:54.760> could

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
okay if I'm doing a wash maybe it could

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.989 
okay if I'm doing a wash maybe it could
be<00:00:55.030> a<00:00:55.059> tree<00:00:55.420> line<00:00:55.690> or<00:00:55.719> foreground<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.789> works

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:57.999 
be a tree line or foreground it works

00:00:57.999 --> 00:00:59.849 
be a tree line or foreground it works
best<00:00:58.329> if<00:00:58.600> your<00:00:58.749> paper<00:00:58.960> is<00:00:59.199> really<00:00:59.499> good<00:00:59.710> and

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
best if your paper is really good and

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.590 
best if your paper is really good and
wet<00:01:00.039> I<00:01:00.339> have<00:01:00.729> this<00:01:00.850> on<00:01:01.059> an<00:01:01.179> angle<00:01:01.569> so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
wet I have this on an angle so

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.869 
wet I have this on an angle so
everything's<00:01:02.109> kind<00:01:02.350> of<00:01:02.379> running<00:01:02.739> down<00:01:02.949> so

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
everything's kind of running down so

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.020 
everything's kind of running down so
hopefully<00:01:04.239> I<00:01:04.300> can<00:01:04.420> demonstrate<00:01:05.079> this<00:01:06.030> pull

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
hopefully I can demonstrate this pull

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.730 
hopefully I can demonstrate this pull
this<00:01:07.210> up<00:01:07.479> but<00:01:07.810> your<00:01:07.990> paper<00:01:08.170> needs<00:01:08.469> to<00:01:08.590> be

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
this up but your paper needs to be

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.330 
this up but your paper needs to be
really<00:01:09.009> good<00:01:09.159> and<00:01:09.280> wet<00:01:10.649> so<00:01:11.649> that<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.950> fibers

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
really good and wet so that the fibers

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:21.960 
really good and wet so that the fibers
are<00:01:12.520> softened<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.880> use<00:01:16.119> this<00:01:16.299> to<00:01:16.539> scrape

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.250 

into<00:01:22.970> it<00:01:23.120> if<00:01:23.270> you're<00:01:23.450> if<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:23.720> using<00:01:24.020> it<00:01:24.140> on

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
into it if you're if you using it on

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.470 
into it if you're if you using it on
edge<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:25.310> get<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.520> very<00:01:25.760> fine<00:01:26.000> line<00:01:26.240> if<00:01:26.360> you

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
edge you get a very fine line if you

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.010 
edge you get a very fine line if you
turn<00:01:26.780> it<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:27.770> more<00:01:27.980> broad<00:01:28.280> like<00:01:28.670> this<00:01:29.020> you

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
turn it so this more broad like this you

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.660 
turn it so this more broad like this you
get<00:01:30.110> a<00:01:30.200> broader<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:30.980> actually<00:01:31.130> start

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
get a broader and you actually start

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.060 
get a broader and you actually start
scraping<00:01:32.030> out<00:01:32.410> some<00:01:33.410> of<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.590> paint<00:01:33.830> you<00:01:33.950> can

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
scraping out some of the paint you can

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.040 
scraping out some of the paint you can
go<00:01:34.220> down<00:01:34.430> where<00:01:34.640> there's<00:01:34.850> heavy<00:01:35.660> paint

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
go down where there's heavy paint

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:48.970 
go down where there's heavy paint
actually<00:01:36.320> pull<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:47.560> essentially<00:01:48.560> it's<00:01:48.680> just<00:01:48.740> a

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
actually pull it essentially it's just a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.900 
actually pull it essentially it's just a
kind<00:01:49.490> of<00:01:49.550> a<00:01:49.670> mover<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:53.030> pigment<00:01:54.760> when<00:01:55.760> you're

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
kind of a mover of pigment when you're

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.300 
kind of a mover of pigment when you're
scraping<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:57.170> can<00:01:57.350> kind<00:01:57.830> of<00:01:57.890> make<00:01:58.100> these

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
scraping and you can kind of make these

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.340 
scraping and you can kind of make these
branchy<00:01:58.970> kind<00:01:59.480> of<00:01:59.600> shapes<00:01:59.840> when<00:02:00.140> you're

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
branchy kind of shapes when you're

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.590 
branchy kind of shapes when you're
scraping<00:02:00.560> you're<00:02:00.920> actually<00:02:01.370> scratching<00:02:02.240> the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
scraping you're actually scratching the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.020 
scraping you're actually scratching the
surface<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.140> paper<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.340> water<00:02:04.580> flows

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
surface of the paper and the water flows

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.190 
surface of the paper and the water flows
into<00:02:05.450> those<00:02:05.600> scratches<00:02:07.690> this<00:02:08.690> is<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:08.869> great

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
into those scratches this is a great

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.930 
into those scratches this is a great
little<00:02:09.500> landscape<00:02:10.010> painting<00:02:10.550> thing<00:02:10.729> and

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
little landscape painting thing and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.910 
little landscape painting thing and
floral<00:02:11.270> painters<00:02:11.630> use<00:02:11.840> it<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.170> floral<00:02:12.740> and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
floral painters use it to floral and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.230 
floral painters use it to floral and
botanical<00:02:13.490> painters<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:16.670> kind<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:16.910> angle

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
botanical painters this kind of angle

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.570 
botanical painters this kind of angle
handles<00:02:17.660> come<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.140> all<00:02:18.560> different<00:02:19.220> sized

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
handles come on all different sized

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.280 
handles come on all different sized
brushes<00:02:19.880> now<00:02:20.240> used<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.570> be<00:02:20.630> only<00:02:20.870> on<00:02:21.110> these

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
brushes now used to be only on these
