because she's been out since beta as
farmers<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:25.650> aware<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.279> she's<00:00:26.310> quite<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.699> old

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
champion and so now she's kind of up to

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.669 
champion and so now she's kind of up to
par<00:00:29.099> visually<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.640> some<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> new<00:00:30.029> ones

so Katherine is Q spell remains as

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.919 
so Katherine is Q spell remains as
bouncing<00:01:33.729> blades<00:01:33.939> it's<00:01:34.329> essentially<00:01:34.869> the

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
bouncing blades it's essentially the

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.559 
bouncing blades it's essentially the
same<00:01:35.140> skill<00:01:35.469> with<00:01:35.679> a<00:01:35.709> bit<00:01:35.920> of<00:01:36.039> tweaked<00:01:36.819> so<00:01:37.420> it's

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
same skill with a bit of tweaked so it's

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:38.669 
same skill with a bit of tweaked so it's
actually<00:01:37.659> quite<00:01:37.899> interesting<00:01:38.259> what<00:01:38.530> they've

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
actually quite interesting what they've

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.679 
actually quite interesting what they've
done<00:01:38.829> and<00:01:39.009> previously<00:01:39.700> teachers<00:01:40.119> with<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.390> flat

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
done and previously teachers with a flat

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.080 
done and previously teachers with a flat
amount<00:01:40.929> of<00:01:41.049> damage<00:01:41.439> magic<00:01:41.829> damage<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.280> at

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
amount of damage magic damage and at

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.910 
amount of damage magic damage and at
right<00:01:43.270> one<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:43.659> bounced<00:01:43.840> twice<00:01:44.079> and<00:01:44.500> you<00:01:44.770> got

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
right one it bounced twice and you got

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.589 
right one it bounced twice and you got
one<00:01:45.069> additional<00:01:45.459> bounce<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.939> the<00:01:45.969> blade<00:01:46.239> every

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:46.599 
one additional bounce of the blade every

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.690 
one additional bounce of the blade every
time<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:46.899> pranked<00:01:47.170> at<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.379> skill<00:01:47.709> for<00:01:48.429> a<00:01:48.459> new

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
time you pranked at the skill for a new

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.149 
time you pranked at the skill for a new
Katherine<00:01:49.149> it<00:01:49.299> ranked<00:01:50.079> 1<00:01:50.349> V<00:01:50.590> blade<00:01:50.799> will

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
Katherine it ranked 1 V blade will

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.830 
Katherine it ranked 1 V blade will
bounce<00:01:51.399> four<00:01:51.849> times<00:01:52.149> and<00:01:52.509> it<00:01:52.629> stays<00:01:52.810> a

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
bounce four times and it stays a

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.619 
bounce four times and it stays a
four-time<00:01:53.229> rank<00:01:54.009> so<00:01:54.789> that<00:01:55.209> doesn't<00:01:55.509> actually

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:55.629 
four-time rank so that doesn't actually

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:58.469 
four-time rank so that doesn't actually
change<00:01:55.840> as<00:01:56.500> far<00:01:56.649> as<00:01:56.799> I'm<00:01:56.890> aware<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.340> also<00:01:58.270> the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
change as far as I'm aware and also the

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.300 
change as far as I'm aware and also the
Q<00:01:58.750> applies<00:01:59.079> a<00:01:59.110> marker<00:01:59.590> very<00:01:59.799> similar<00:02:00.189> to<00:02:00.219> a

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
Q applies a marker very similar to a

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.729 
Q applies a marker very similar to a
Carly<00:02:00.670> in<00:02:00.759> fact<00:02:00.969> so<00:02:01.539> once<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.200> amount<00:02:02.530> has

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:02.739 
Carly in fact so once the amount has

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:06.149 
Carly in fact so once the amount has
been<00:02:02.770> applied<00:02:03.369> you<00:02:03.939> can<00:02:04.119> then<00:02:04.739> have<00:02:05.739> a<00:02:05.799> basic

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
been applied you can then have a basic

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.830 
been applied you can then have a basic
attack<00:02:06.369> so<00:02:06.640> right-click<00:02:06.879> on<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.239> enemy<00:02:07.450> to

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
attack so right-click on the enemy to

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.809 
attack so right-click on the enemy to
consume<00:02:08.200> our<00:02:08.410> annual<00:02:08.799> deal<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.129> additional

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
consume our annual deal and additional

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.400 
consume our annual deal and additional
piece<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:09.970> damage<00:02:10.329> so<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.840> base<00:02:10.959> damage<00:02:11.170> the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
piece of damage so the base damage the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.020 
piece of damage so the base damage the
skill<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.739> actually<00:02:12.069> decreased<00:02:12.549> but<00:02:12.879> the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
skill is actually decreased but the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.210 
skill is actually decreased but the
overall<00:02:13.390> dps<00:02:13.629> if<00:02:14.079> you<00:02:14.230> can<00:02:14.380> land<00:02:14.560> amarte<00:02:15.010> or

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
overall dps if you can land amarte or

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.129 
overall dps if you can land amarte or
concealer<00:02:15.790> marseille<00:02:16.359> and<00:02:16.630> will<00:02:17.019> be

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:17.139 
concealer marseille and will be

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:19.170 
concealer marseille and will be
increased<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:17.709> if<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:18.340> have<00:02:18.519> these<00:02:18.670> skills<00:02:18.819> i

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
increased so if you have these skills i

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.780 
increased so if you have these skills i
guess<00:02:19.359> to<00:02:20.019> get<00:02:20.500> in<00:02:20.620> there<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:20.799> consistently

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
guess to get in there and consistently

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.069 
guess to get in there and consistently
break<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.209> mark<00:02:22.420> rather<00:02:22.720> than<00:02:22.840> just

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
break that mark rather than just

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.780 
break that mark rather than just
launching<00:02:23.889> out<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.040> q<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.310> leaving<00:02:24.549> it<00:02:24.670> you

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
launching out the q and leaving it you

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.849 
launching out the q and leaving it you
will<00:02:24.970> have<00:02:25.209> an<00:02:25.329> overall<00:02:25.569> dps<00:02:25.750> increase<00:02:26.260> but<00:02:26.470> i

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
will have an overall dps increase but i

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.979 
will have an overall dps increase but i
guess<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.760> are<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:28.090> bit<00:02:28.299> more<00:02:28.450> vulnerable<00:02:28.840> when

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
guess you are a bit more vulnerable when

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:29.830 
guess you are a bit more vulnerable when
you're<00:02:29.109> down

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
you're down

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.350 
you're down
so<00:02:30.500> as<00:02:30.830> for<00:02:30.950> Catherine<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.370> w<00:02:31.760> spell<00:02:32.000> it's<00:02:32.239> a

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
so as for Catherine is w spell it's a

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.089 
so as for Catherine is w spell it's a
completely<00:02:32.780> new<00:02:33.019> skill<00:02:33.260> this<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.680> one

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
completely new skill this is the one

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.280 
completely new skill this is the one
skill<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.370> they<00:02:34.550> completely<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.450> change<00:02:35.989> so

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
skill that they completely and change so

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.890 
skill that they completely and change so
previously<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.800> was<00:02:36.830> more<00:02:37.250> like<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.629> you<00:02:38.629> got<00:02:38.780> to

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
previously it was more like a you got to

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.570 
previously it was more like a you got to
really<00:02:39.019> give<00:02:39.379> you<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.530> passive<00:02:40.129> affect<00:02:40.400> your

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
abilities which I've actually shift lead

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.229 
abilities which I've actually shift lead
to<00:02:42.200> other<00:02:42.470> abilities<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.220> which<00:02:43.879> I'll<00:02:44.030> get

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
to other abilities and which I'll get

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.900 
to other abilities and which I'll get
into<00:02:44.300> in<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.870> short<00:02:45.319> while<00:02:45.410> but<00:02:46.010> now<00:02:46.489> it's<00:02:46.760> a

ultimate<00:03:18.410> death<00:03:18.860> Lotus<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:19.819> it<00:03:20.329> has<00:03:20.510> been

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
ultimate death Lotus and it has been

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.720 
ultimate death Lotus and it has been
changed<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.260> small<00:03:21.590> amount<00:03:22.040> but<00:03:22.280> not<00:03:22.489> really

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
changed a small amount but not really

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.309 
changed a small amount but not really
that<00:03:22.849> much<00:03:22.910> it's<00:03:23.299> not<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.690> completely<00:03:24.110> new

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
that much it's not a completely new

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.130 
that much it's not a completely new
skill<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.829> so<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:25.549> still<00:03:25.849> channel<00:03:26.239> it<00:03:26.329> ms<00:03:26.959> you

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
skill and so you still channel it ms you

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.089 
skill and so you still channel it ms you
press<00:03:27.349> it<00:03:27.379> and<00:03:27.470> then<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.680> start<00:03:27.890> journaling

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
press it and then you start journaling

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.979 
press it and then you start journaling
but<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.489> channel<00:03:28.790> time<00:03:28.940> has<00:03:29.180> been<00:03:29.390> reduced<00:03:29.720> so

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
but the channel time has been reduced so

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.650 
but the channel time has been reduced so
um<00:03:30.459> overall<00:03:31.459> I<00:03:31.489> think<00:03:31.670> it's<00:03:31.879> the<00:03:31.970> same<00:03:32.150> damages

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
um overall I think it's the same damages

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.789 
um overall I think it's the same damages
for<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.840> short<00:03:33.049> channel<00:03:33.290> time<00:03:33.530> which<00:03:33.769> is

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
for the short channel time which is

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.710 
for the short channel time which is
obviously<00:03:34.400> a<00:03:34.519> good<00:03:34.819> thing<00:03:35.060> so<00:03:35.269> you<00:03:35.359> get<00:03:35.569> enough

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
obviously a good thing so you get enough

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.110 
obviously a good thing so you get enough
more<00:03:35.900> damage<00:03:36.230> per<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.250> second<00:03:38.030> you're

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
more damage per the second you're

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.000 
more damage per the second you're
spinning<00:03:38.420> they're<00:03:38.660> vulnerable<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.650> that's<00:03:39.859> a

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
spinning they're vulnerable so that's a

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.590 
spinning they're vulnerable so that's a
good<00:03:40.160> change<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:40.609> they've<00:03:40.790> also<00:03:41.000> added<00:03:41.299> the

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
good change and they've also added the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.990 
good change and they've also added the
bonus<00:03:41.959> effect<00:03:42.109> that<00:03:42.530> Catherine<00:03:43.519> a<00:03:43.579> previously

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
bonus effect that Catherine a previously

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.300 
bonus effect that Catherine a previously
got<00:03:44.150> from<00:03:44.329> her<00:03:44.450> w<00:03:44.780> skill<00:03:44.989> killer<00:03:45.230> instincts<00:03:45.709> so

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
got from her w skill killer instincts so

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.949 
got from her w skill killer instincts so
now<00:03:46.579> her<00:03:46.760> ultimate<00:03:47.090> will<00:03:47.239> apply<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.660> small

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
now her ultimate will apply a small

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.150 
now her ultimate will apply a small
healing<00:03:48.349> we've<00:03:48.440> got<00:03:48.560> in<00:03:48.650> fact<00:03:48.829> I<00:03:48.889> think<00:03:48.950> it's

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
healing we've got in fact I think it's

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.440 
healing we've got in fact I think it's
fifty<00:03:49.459> percent<00:03:49.730> so<00:03:49.910> it's<00:03:50.060> not<00:03:50.150> even<00:03:50.359> that

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
fifty percent so it's not even that

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.420 
fifty percent so it's not even that
small<00:03:50.569> burn<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:51.200> fifty<00:03:51.920> percent<00:03:52.099> of<00:03:52.220> healing

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
small burn a fifty percent of healing

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.920 
small burn a fifty percent of healing
reduction<00:03:52.880> through<00:03:53.000> all<00:03:53.150> enemies<00:03:53.540> which<00:03:53.750> may

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
reduction through all enemies which may

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.420 
reduction through all enemies which may
or<00:03:53.959> may<00:03:54.200> not<00:03:54.230> increase<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.739> Frank<00:03:54.980> I<00:03:55.160> haven't

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
or may not increase the Frank I haven't

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.759 
or may not increase the Frank I haven't
checked<00:03:55.579> I<00:03:55.790> apologize<00:03:56.239> for<00:03:56.269> that<00:03:56.480> but<00:03:57.260> then<00:03:57.500> so

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
checked I apologize for that but then so

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.650 
checked I apologize for that but then so
you<00:03:57.859> can<00:03:58.010> apply<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.790> healing<00:03:59.209> reduction<00:03:59.540> to

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
you can apply a healing reduction to

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.819 
you can apply a healing reduction to
everyone<00:04:00.079> in<00:04:00.169> team<00:04:00.319> which<00:04:00.500> could<00:04:00.709> be<00:04:00.799> good

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
everyone in team which could be good

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.979 
everyone in team which could be good
against<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.220> rocker<00:04:01.489> I<00:04:01.639> guess<00:04:01.880> and<00:04:02.150> complete

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
against the rocker I guess and complete

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.990 
against the rocker I guess and complete
healing<00:04:03.139> which<00:04:03.440> is<00:04:03.590> our<00:04:03.709> ultimate<00:04:03.859> one<00:04:04.760> thing

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
healing which is our ultimate one thing

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.690 
healing which is our ultimate one thing
to<00:04:05.120> think<00:04:05.299> about<00:04:05.799> so<00:04:06.799> those<00:04:07.010> are<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.280> changes

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
to think about so those are the changes

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.099 
to think about so those are the changes
let's<00:04:08.209> go<00:04:08.359> over<00:04:08.540> what<00:04:08.569> I<00:04:08.720> think<00:04:08.959> about

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
let's go over what I think about

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.379 
let's go over what I think about
Catherine<00:04:09.500> is<00:04:09.620> new<00:04:09.739> gameplay<00:04:10.389> ultimately

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
Catherine is new gameplay ultimately

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.599 
Catherine is new gameplay ultimately
Katarina<00:04:12.019> is<00:04:12.079> the<00:04:12.530> same<00:04:12.799> champion<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:13.430> when

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
Katarina is the same champion so when

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.099 
Katarina is the same champion so when
you<00:04:13.669> play<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.910> champion<00:04:14.299> it<00:04:14.510> does<00:04:15.079> feel

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
you play the champion it does feel

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.420 
you play the champion it does feel
practically<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.739> same<00:04:15.919> I<00:04:16.070> mean<00:04:16.190> you're<00:04:16.310> still

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
practically the same I mean you're still

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.159 
practically the same I mean you're still
going<00:04:16.789> to<00:04:16.849> be<00:04:16.910> using<00:04:17.060> your<00:04:17.209> PG<00:04:17.510> about<00:04:17.660> raising

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
going to be using your PG about raising

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.680 
going to be using your PG about raising
your<00:04:18.320> jumper<00:04:18.680> whatever<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.609> farm<00:04:19.849> and<00:04:20.120> inching

your jumper whatever to farm and inching

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.060 
your jumper whatever to farm and inching

that's<00:04:28.630> an<00:04:28.750> additional<00:04:28.870> thing<00:04:29.230> to<00:04:29.350> do<00:04:29.740> in

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
that's an additional thing to do in

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.880 
that's an additional thing to do in
teamfights<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:31.170> one<00:04:32.170> big<00:04:32.500> thing<00:04:32.530> I've

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.350 
teamfights and one big thing I've
noticed<00:04:33.040> is<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.580> fact<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:33.820> early<00:04:34.180> game

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
noticed is the fact that early game

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.120 
noticed is the fact that early game
she's<00:04:34.750> significantly<00:04:35.620> weaker<00:04:35.950> and

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
she's significantly weaker and

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.400 
she's significantly weaker and
especially<00:04:37.120> our<00:04:37.300> autumn<00:04:37.660> I<00:04:37.720> mean<00:04:37.960> it's<00:04:38.200> just

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
especially our autumn I mean it's just

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.800 
especially our autumn I mean it's just
completely<00:04:39.190> negligible<00:04:39.610> damage<00:04:39.880> it's<00:04:40.390> very

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
completely negligible damage it's very

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.350 
completely negligible damage it's very
weak<00:04:41.170> Elyon<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.800> because<00:04:42.790> previously<00:04:43.180> had

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
weak Elyon and because previously had

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.120 
weak Elyon and because previously had
base<00:04:43.540> acts<00:04:43.840> were<00:04:44.050> quite<00:04:44.470> lives<00:04:44.710> they<00:04:44.920> must

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
base acts were quite lives they must

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.430 
base acts were quite lives they must
mean<00:04:45.280> like<00:04:45.400> someone<00:04:45.670> 80<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.240> 100<00:04:46.630> whereas<00:04:47.290> now

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
mean like someone 80 to 100 whereas now

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.800 
mean like someone 80 to 100 whereas now
they're<00:04:47.590> all<00:04:47.620> 14<00:04:48.160> as<00:04:48.460> far<00:04:49.390> as<00:04:49.420> i<00:04:49.510> can<00:04:49.600> tell<00:04:49.660> i

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
they're all 14 as far as i can tell i

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.270 
they're all 14 as far as i can tell i
think<00:04:50.080> they've<00:04:50.170> increased<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.710> AP<00:04:51.070> ratio

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
think they've increased the AP ratio

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.190 
think they've increased the AP ratio
because<00:04:51.670> what<00:04:52.120> I<00:04:52.150> have<00:04:52.300> found<00:04:52.630> when<00:04:52.960> playing

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
because what I have found when playing

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.870 
because what I have found when playing
Katherine<00:04:53.620> in<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.860> brief<00:04:54.160> time<00:04:54.190> I've<00:04:54.610> had<00:04:54.820> to

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
Katherine in the brief time I've had to

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.210 
Katherine in the brief time I've had to
play<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.810> champion<00:04:56.200> and<00:04:56.410> early<00:04:56.680> on<00:04:56.830> i<00:04:57.040> did

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
play the champion and early on i did

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.760 
play the champion and early on i did
feel<00:04:57.370> a<00:04:57.430> lot<00:04:57.790> weaker<00:04:57.970> compared<00:04:58.480> to<00:04:58.600> in<00:04:59.500> the

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
feel a lot weaker compared to in the

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.280 
feel a lot weaker compared to in the
current<00:05:00.130> or<00:05:00.310> previous<00:05:00.760> old<00:05:01.180> build<00:05:01.630> of

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
current or previous old build of

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.830 
current or previous old build of
catalina<00:05:02.950> and<00:05:03.100> so<00:05:03.430> then<00:05:03.610> i<00:05:03.880> think<00:05:04.330> they've

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
catalina and so then i think they've

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.870 
catalina and so then i think they've
increased<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.410> ratios<00:05:05.800> for<00:05:06.280> her<00:05:06.430> skills<00:05:06.700> and

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
increased the ratios for her skills and

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.550 
increased the ratios for her skills and
they've<00:05:07.690> definitely<00:05:07.930> reduced<00:05:08.350> the<00:05:08.440> base

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
they've definitely reduced the base

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.320 
they've definitely reduced the base
damage<00:05:08.770> they've<00:05:09.550> really<00:05:09.850> gone<00:05:09.940> for<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.180> end

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
damage they've really gone for the end

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.850 
damage they've really gone for the end
more<00:05:10.570> legging<00:05:10.990> approach<00:05:11.260> for<00:05:11.410> this<00:05:11.500> champion

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
more legging approach for this champion

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.200 
more legging approach for this champion
because<00:05:11.950> she<00:05:12.190> was<00:05:12.370> a<00:05:12.400> risk<00:05:12.700> if<00:05:12.910> she<00:05:13.030> was

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
because she was a risk if she was

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.030 
because she was a risk if she was
practically<00:05:13.810> not<00:05:13.960> viable<00:05:14.170> just<00:05:14.500> because<00:05:14.770> as

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
practically not viable just because as

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.370 
practically not viable just because as
soon<00:05:15.220> as<00:05:15.340> she's<00:05:15.490> been<00:05:15.670> offered<00:05:16.050> know<00:05:17.050> as<00:05:17.260> soon

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
soon as she's been offered know as soon

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.080 
soon as she's been offered know as soon
as<00:05:17.500> her<00:05:17.650> ulti<00:05:17.920> has<00:05:18.010> been<00:05:18.130> counseled<00:05:18.490> by<00:05:18.580> any<00:05:18.790> in

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
as her ulti has been counseled by any in

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.580 
as her ulti has been counseled by any in
amaneciste<00:05:19.480> even<00:05:19.960> she's<00:05:20.110> out<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.410> fight

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
amaneciste even she's out the fight

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.460 
amaneciste even she's out the fight
basically<00:05:21.010> and<00:05:21.720> and<00:05:22.720> she<00:05:22.840> doesn't<00:05:23.169> really<00:05:23.320> do

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
basically and and she doesn't really do

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.990 
basically and and she doesn't really do
much<00:05:23.500> damage<00:05:23.770> late<00:05:24.100> oh<00:05:24.220> she<00:05:24.280> does<00:05:24.550> he<00:05:24.669> damaged

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
much damage late oh she does he damaged

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.330 
much damage late oh she does he damaged
but<00:05:25.180> she's<00:05:25.720> very<00:05:25.780> unreliable<00:05:26.470> and<00:05:26.830> she<00:05:27.190> does

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
but she's very unreliable and she does

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.830 
but she's very unreliable and she does
fall<00:05:27.550> off<00:05:27.700> late<00:05:27.850> game<00:05:28.060> which<00:05:28.360> I<00:05:28.510> think<00:05:28.690> most

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
fall off late game which I think most

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.170 
fall off late game which I think most
people<00:05:29.110> agree<00:05:29.410> sir<00:05:29.620> they've<00:05:30.310> really

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
people agree sir they've really

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.690 
people agree sir they've really
originated<00:05:31.540> from<00:05:31.720> a<00:05:32.280> early<00:05:33.280> to<00:05:33.400> mid<00:05:33.580> game

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
originated from a early to mid game

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.460 
originated from a early to mid game
champion<00:05:34.180> to<00:05:34.300> a<00:05:34.330> mid<00:05:34.540> to<00:05:34.630> late<00:05:34.810> game<00:05:35.020> which<00:05:35.290> I

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
champion to a mid to late game which I

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.020 
champion to a mid to late game which I
kind<00:05:35.740> of<00:05:35.800> like<00:05:35.980> who<00:05:36.160> she's<00:05:36.310> actually<00:05:36.460> very<00:05:36.640> fun

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
kind of like who she's actually very fun

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.520 
kind of like who she's actually very fun
and<00:05:37.060> very<00:05:37.240> strong<00:05:37.810> during<00:05:38.140> the<00:05:38.200> late<00:05:38.350> game

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
and very strong during the late game

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.470 
and very strong during the late game
just<00:05:38.740> because<00:05:38.830> she<00:05:39.520> basically<00:05:39.760> has<00:05:39.970> an<00:05:40.090> extra

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
just because she basically has an extra

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.970 
just because she basically has an extra
miniature<00:05:40.990> ultimate<00:05:41.350> on<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:41.500> short<00:05:41.800> cooldown

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
miniature ultimate on a short cooldown

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.980 
miniature ultimate on a short cooldown
which<00:05:42.610> was<00:05:42.790> obviously<00:05:43.030> refreshed<00:05:43.630> to<00:05:43.810> tell

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
which was obviously refreshed to tell

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.380 
which was obviously refreshed to tell
ultimate<00:05:44.410> so<00:05:44.620> on<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:44.979> know<00:05:45.940> you<00:05:46.000> can<00:05:46.180> have<00:05:46.270> to

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
ultimate so on I know you can have to

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.850 
ultimate so on I know you can have to
give<00:05:46.510> her<00:05:46.570> a<00:05:46.630> go<00:05:46.780> I<00:05:47.020> think<00:05:47.229> they've<00:05:47.470> done<00:05:47.620> quite

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
give her a go I think they've done quite

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.500 
give her a go I think they've done quite
a<00:05:47.890> nice<00:05:48.070> change<00:05:48.280> we'll<00:05:48.550> see<00:05:48.669> how<00:05:48.760> people<00:05:48.970> think

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
a nice change we'll see how people think

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.700 
a nice change we'll see how people think
she'll<00:05:49.750> play<00:05:49.870> out<00:05:50.020> she<00:05:50.229> made<00:05:50.410> me<00:05:50.620> over

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
she'll play out she made me over

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.440 
she'll play out she made me over
powerful<00:05:51.220> I<00:05:51.250> know<00:05:51.430> I<00:05:51.580> mean<00:05:51.790> you<00:05:51.970> get<00:05:52.210> you<00:05:52.330> got

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
powerful I know I mean you get you got

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.440 
powerful I know I mean you get you got
to<00:05:52.510> be<00:05:52.570> building<00:05:52.750> the<00:05:52.870> same<00:05:53.110> items<00:05:53.560> but<00:05:54.419> like<00:05:55.419> I

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
to be building the same items but like I

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.570 
to be building the same items but like I
said<00:05:55.630> it's<00:05:55.900> a<00:05:55.960> late-game<00:05:56.140> approach<00:05:56.620> and<00:05:56.979> that

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
said it's a late-game approach and that

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.030 
said it's a late-game approach and that
is<00:05:57.850> my<00:05:58.690> thoughts<00:05:58.990> and<00:05:59.110> opinions<00:05:59.590> on<00:05:59.740> the<00:05:59.890> new

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
is my thoughts and opinions on the new

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.040 
is my thoughts and opinions on the new
Kathryn<00:06:00.490> a<00:06:00.580> remake<00:06:00.850> as<00:06:01.419> for<00:06:01.690> skilling

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
Kathryn a remake as for skilling

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.750 
Kathryn a remake as for skilling
priorities<00:06:02.560> I<00:06:02.680> think<00:06:02.919> for<00:06:03.160> the<00:06:03.190> new<00:06:03.340> Kathryn

priorities I think for the new Kathryn

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.700 
priorities I think for the new Kathryn
people<00:06:04.150> will<00:06:04.360> be<00:06:04.450> maxing<00:06:04.870> be<00:06:05.020> bouncing<00:06:05.500> blades

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
people will be maxing be bouncing blades

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.790 
people will be maxing be bouncing blades
as<00:06:06.040> opposed<00:06:06.400> to<00:06:06.610> be<00:06:06.760> shunpo<00:06:07.320> for<00:06:08.320> a<00:06:08.350> few

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
as opposed to be shunpo for a few

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.520 
as opposed to be shunpo for a few
reasons<00:06:08.830> really<00:06:09.580> because<00:06:10.050> null<00:06:11.050> nisha<00:06:11.260> more

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
reasons really because null nisha more

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.500 
reasons really because null nisha more
late-game<00:06:12.100> oriented<00:06:12.700> so<00:06:12.970> she's<00:06:13.150> a<00:06:13.180> lot<00:06:13.360> weaker

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
late-game oriented so she's a lot weaker

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.780 
late-game oriented so she's a lot weaker
I've<00:06:13.750> again<00:06:14.020> and<00:06:14.310> previously<00:06:15.310> when<00:06:15.490> people

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
I've again and previously when people

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.640 
I've again and previously when people
max<00:06:15.940> Rumple<00:06:16.330> they<00:06:16.540> would<00:06:16.750> go<00:06:16.990> for<00:06:17.140> the<00:06:17.200> super

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
max Rumple they would go for the super

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.500 
max Rumple they would go for the super
high<00:06:17.740> damage<00:06:17.979> where<00:06:18.220> you<00:06:18.310> jump<00:06:18.490> in<00:06:18.669> and<00:06:18.880> then

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
high damage where you jump in and then

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.909 
high damage where you jump in and then
Oh<00:06:19.660> teen<00:06:19.840> hopefully<00:06:20.229> that<00:06:20.380> just<00:06:20.620> completely

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
Oh teen hopefully that just completely

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:22.650 
Oh teen hopefully that just completely
full<00:06:21.280> of<00:06:21.310> them<00:06:21.580> but<00:06:22.150> you<00:06:22.330> can't<00:06:22.510> do<00:06:22.600> that

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
full of them but you can't do that

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.450 
full of them but you can't do that
anymore<00:06:22.780> early<00:06:23.380> game<00:06:23.530> so<00:06:23.740> there's<00:06:23.950> really<00:06:24.190> no

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
anymore early game so there's really no

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.190 
anymore early game so there's really no

blades<00:06:26.460> you<00:06:27.460> much<00:06:27.640> better<00:06:27.790> off<00:06:27.970> with<00:06:28.150> the<00:06:28.240> M

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
blades you much better off with the M

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.630 
blades you much better off with the M
the<00:06:29.140> additional<00:06:29.560> damage<00:06:29.860> for<00:06:30.070> harassing<00:06:30.310> with

the additional damage for harassing with
the<00:06:30.729> queue<00:06:30.940> as<00:06:31.150> well<00:06:31.900> as<00:06:31.990> begins<00:06:32.290> consummation

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
the queue as well as begins consummation

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.800 
the queue as well as begins consummation
if<00:06:33.280> that's<00:06:33.520> a<00:06:33.610> word<00:06:33.760> Byam

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
if that's a word Byam

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.140 
if that's a word Byam
seemingly<00:06:35.139> mark<00:06:35.440> when<00:06:36.070> you<00:06:36.100> pie<00:06:36.340> the<00:06:36.400> QM<00:06:36.880> so

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
seemingly mark when you pie the QM so

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.520 
seemingly mark when you pie the QM so
that's<00:06:37.570> just<00:06:37.810> from<00:06:37.930> what<00:06:38.020> I<00:06:38.080> can<00:06:38.169> tell<00:06:38.230> so<00:06:38.500> far

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
that's just from what I can tell so far

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.680 
that's just from what I can tell so far
I<00:06:39.160> think<00:06:39.730> people<00:06:39.850> actually<00:06:39.970> going<00:06:40.210> to<00:06:40.300> Mexico

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
I think people actually going to Mexico

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.300 
I think people actually going to Mexico
beasts<00:06:40.840> in<00:06:40.990> this<00:06:41.110> to<00:06:41.260> seal<00:06:41.440> over<00:06:41.889> shampoo<00:06:42.070> as

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
beasts in this to seal over shampoo as

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.770 
beasts in this to seal over shampoo as
well<00:06:42.490> I<00:06:42.520> think<00:06:42.639> shambles<00:06:43.360> more<00:06:43.570> from<00:06:43.750> a

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
well I think shambles more from a

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.080 
well I think shambles more from a
mobility<00:06:44.260> thing<00:06:44.680> early<00:06:44.950> on<00:06:45.040> because<00:06:45.610> I'm<00:06:45.940> like

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
mobility thing early on because I'm like

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.580 
mobility thing early on because I'm like
I<00:06:46.150> said<00:06:46.419> she<00:06:46.570> is<00:06:46.690> a<00:06:46.720> lot<00:06:46.930> weaker<00:06:47.080> early<00:06:47.470> on

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
I said she is a lot weaker early on

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.440 
I said she is a lot weaker early on
compared<00:06:48.430> to<00:06:48.460> before<00:06:48.610> her<00:06:48.940> ultimate<00:06:49.300> is<00:06:49.419> a

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 
compared to before her ultimate is a

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.260 
compared to before her ultimate is a
very<00:06:49.780> small<00:06:50.260> damage<00:06:50.470> so<00:06:50.800> I<00:06:50.980> mean<00:06:51.850> don't<00:06:52.090> take

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
very small damage so I mean don't take

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.550 
very small damage so I mean don't take
this<00:06:52.389> as<00:06:52.540> fact<00:06:52.720> I<00:06:52.840> mean<00:06:52.990> this<00:06:53.080> is<00:06:53.139> just<00:06:53.290> my

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
this as fact I mean this is just my

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.170 
this as fact I mean this is just my
thoughts<00:06:53.800> after<00:06:53.980> like<00:06:54.250> literally<00:06:54.669> two<00:06:54.790> games

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
thoughts after like literally two games

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.840 
thoughts after like literally two games
and<00:06:55.450> but<00:06:56.350> I've<00:06:56.889> got<00:06:57.100> a<00:06:57.130> bit<00:06:57.310> of<00:06:57.370> an<00:06:57.430> idea<00:06:57.580> of

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
and but I've got a bit of an idea of

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.940 
and but I've got a bit of an idea of
what<00:06:58.120> might<00:06:58.270> happen<00:06:58.530> but<00:06:59.530> apart<00:06:59.800> from<00:06:59.830> that

00:06:59.940 --> 00:06:59.950 
what might happen but apart from that

what might happen but apart from that
