00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.500
 be the boss giampa '. letters of presentation of the total master class. 3 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.820
 for 3ds max 2012 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.489
 in which we will conclude the analysis of stand maps status 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:16.029
 and we will use is a distance maps 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.180
 i'm projects like the one we see represented 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.569
 directly inside this scene wind it 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:24.460
 in a project 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.460
 --external where to use maps substances 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.579
 with different 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.430
 problems to deal with together 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.430
 composite astroclass film 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.329
 in 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.950
 three different moments 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.970
 one of the moments will be an analysis 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.670
 that will compete 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.850
 t42 sap remaining rooms 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.020
 in relation 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.860
 aki tem playtech and have already been made available 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.130
 peroni chat rooms we will analyze situations then etnapolis 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.640
 assistance we will use these 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.180
 social sphere external renderings 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.509
 some of us will use for other situations that we will see 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.460
 in the course of this description we have 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.320
 a map with simple hit me including the map of all previous hits 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.500
 so every time you have to choose only one room, he gave the name 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.290
 it will be enough to make a click to already have an idea of ​​what this proposes 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.500
 effect of substances with 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.630
 the effects of bamp little the effects of display off 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.050
 inside the available folder 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.640
 of the files 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.280
 to have because it is called so because they are 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.060
 many files are these selected god which we will have 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.570
 different situations 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.010
 any 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.530
 examples such as kevlar lava 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.770
 lawn the classic skin 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.609
 for 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.370
 to analyze 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.400
 that status transmits provisions provided maps 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.340
 for example we take one at random 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.490
 classic leather 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.170
 open file 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.359
 here we have a situation 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.959
 different taxation of use enough applied a sofa so we will see how 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.670
 behaves 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.259
 maps is enough in this 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.479
 what situation they are 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:18.519
 more convenient methodologies to create more or less glossy materials more or less 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:19.129
 ruby of 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.639
 in all situations 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.259
 have a folder 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.699
 named 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:25.189
 such as 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.630
 test take in two 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.170
 sanitary tests take in two we own these tests then hotel temple 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.529
 ahead 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.000
 shoot one if the test to show you 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.959
 such as 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.830
 the substance map 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.339
 attached to the file analyzed neville 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:45.479
 suuu and various settings can be used to create 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:46.529
 these 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.049
 these types of variants 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.429
 this too is a variation of the staff stats maps 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:54.010
 oni 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.449
 example we will have a type d wait we will go for example 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:00.500
 baby failla 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.759
 to create roads 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:03.790
 with a party 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.279
 to 'for example 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:06.479
 cracked 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:07.380
 to create 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.689
 a typical 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.299
 asphalt 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.700
 like all green methodologies in relation to this type of asphalt 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:20.479
 together we will analyze the new maps for the first time 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.449
 interface of a sudden 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:23.759
 pump for 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:26.759
 wii will be used to understand 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:29.049
 have 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.799
 the maps how to manage them 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.699
 use some of the tools quickly 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.729
 inside amber 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.889
 certain masterclass dedicated high leg usage 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.719
 we will observe what they are 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.640
 new fast welding fast inscription tools 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.640
 ladder 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.529
 within the new interfaces of a sudden 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:56.529
 to cancel the coordinates of a mav 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:01.939
 map locations below the other stats maps may represent 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:06.430
 even in environments in this case we have a spatial environment with 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.209
 a starry background 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.889
 we will observe how the map is set which I am 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:16.129
 two variables to create a background 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.979
 applied by orb giometria 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.400
 oh how to apply this background 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.150
 halley by name what are the warlock management solutions we wake up 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.879
 because in this case we will have to face 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.780
 a wound and gamma solution 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.849
 to create render it you have 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.279
 consistently set 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:39.699
 therefore as a gamma effect 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:40.820
 that they don't have 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.840
 an ostrich art too faded so to speak 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.840
 this type is known as attacks tube 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.510
 rowing persano state are very interesting 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.740
 for the affection of the display turned off 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.330
 and for the variety of situations they can generate 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.930
 we will study how the room map can generate typologies 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.319
 different dtt 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:03.490
 i'm flounces 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.710
 a 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.120
 layout of its parameters here too we will have to take some problems for 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.599
 regarding 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.529
 the speech of amber 8 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:15.110
 and the assignment speech 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.490
 gpl polygon properties 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.430
 pin in generating 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.430
 baby you notice that the geometry of the corners is broken 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.829
 in fact we usually have this problem when we have a geometry 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.180
 linear i this title display turned off very strong 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:34.430
 think stanstead 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.699
 are used 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.389
 in many situations one of these is also the creation of 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.259
 and together we will observe how they are set up 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.539
 and how different types of materials can be represented 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.919
 i in different types of rendering in this means that this image has been 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.919
 created to wish you always on the subject of mencarelli 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:56.389
 urmet 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.020
 remember 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.520
 typology 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.560
 here was set 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.659
 to work directly inside aircraft so we'll see 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:08.219
 the two behaviors 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:09.969
 thanks to the statist map 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:11.849
 blade passat room 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.849
 star license variants than even 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:20.709
 wood for example so we can introduce particularities such as 

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:22.460
 naked on my own 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.999
 all related to the type of map 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:26.139
 what we want 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.800
 use 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.860
 We will retain 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.139
 all possible variants 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.169
 in this masterclass we will also use 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.889
 the bt y generetor 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:38.199
 we will see where you are 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:39.860
 find this program 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.900
 how to install it 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.960
 what kind of kext snores 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.960
 insert for generation 

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:52.199
 vegetables to be included in our final scene so we'll see 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:54.960
 analysis 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.969
 three of its settings 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:57.690
 such as 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.629
 it works 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:00.089
 this type 

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:04.930
 program very useful as export 3ds max import health care 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:07.729
 3ds max 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:08.710
 generate 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.710
 this type of structure 

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:14.399
 to insert 

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:16.180
 within our 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.740
 band 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.070
 and making final will consist of an image like the one we see in 

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:23.219
 this moment 

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:24.190
 porn 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.779
 the elements that have been 

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.369
 escort acts 

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:30.460
 and with elevated is enough have also been 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.610
 included 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.870
 inside the pool 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.180
 we will observe how, for example, we manage spresiano 3 height maps as yes 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.039
 can 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:41.139
 generate 

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:44.430
 very surfaces your with the effect of substance 

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:49.469
 and how you can generate composite materials always with the sap maps 

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.080
 stats 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.460
 the ultimate goal will be your praise 

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.909
 use a dinner with a light 

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:57.710
 meow colors 3 

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:58.680
 to create 

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.610
 some variants like the kerimov ones I'm showing right now 

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.860
 conema for the room 

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.919
 composite material variants like the one we see 

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:09.139
 here right now 

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:12.550
 I have variants with pepole materials 

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.469
 I thank you and look forward to this master class 

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:16.459
