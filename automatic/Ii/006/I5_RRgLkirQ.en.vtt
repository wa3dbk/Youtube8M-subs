 Thank you for the numerous feedback 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.730
 The last episode there was about 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.770
 the topic whether twitter offer on the ps3 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.480
 and xbox 360 is to come out 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.949
 and because the stake was so big 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.989
 there are a few statistics and 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.430
 comments in the endart so you have to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.290
 stay tuned until the end to see if 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.450
 Her comment is in this episode 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.250
 but has now come from the old 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.520
 theme of the week on the new topic of 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.229
 week 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.119
 because in this episode of world of 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.270
 racing games we deal with it 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.680
 who on the cover of the abu dhabi 215 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.630
 should we have a look 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.810
 on the cover of the last three wm games 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.770
 on the cover of the b 12 was randy 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.810
 to see orton 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.549
 at the successor there as was finished 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.680
 it then at the punk and while still 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.979
 current part here is the betty ford 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.930
 it pressure or danny bryant on the turn 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.970
 body and as always there was the theme 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.829
 the week as poll at wrestling 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.020
 games DE I repeat that again 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.170
 ask and who should cover on 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.909
 the beat hefti in total have 17 users 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.700
 one could participate for several 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.750
 people vote and a whole eleven people vote that 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.820
 are 64 71 percent have opted for cesaro 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.860
 decided on place two was her 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.020
 one with eight votes or in third place 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.049
 comes then already brock lesnar with five 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.049
 votes or 29 41 percent 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.610
 For example, 350 predicts rank 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.360
 as a possibility but you would have 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.340
 really great 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.470
 But you have to look what the topic of 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.030
 250 is I would not be surprised 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.010
 when we cover the page at the end 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.220
 get because it nxp as special feature 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.420
 bring the user games ok one tells me 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.010
 would be glad if it again 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.090
 wendecover is because then you could 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.530
 pack it intel 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.140
 if he ends his career and 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.980
 antonius cesaro since he is from the wwe 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.190
 pushed 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.540
 and last but not least must have owen the tsv 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.000
 to say the following 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.740
 I would like to ask why, of course 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.120
 a wendecover was either brian 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.040
 or much to see 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.990
 I think it's more realistic 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.330
 Bryan will be on the other side 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.130
 then please, or the sign right there 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.200
 brian now over the year a huge 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.430
 played important role yes it was 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.740
 again a few opinions from the 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.480
 wrestling games de / forum and now is 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.500
 of course the question to you dear again 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.320
 youtube community 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.680
 who would you like to see on the cover of 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.180
 david w 15 sinks writes the name in 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.980
 the comments and best of all 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.870
 a reason and do not forget her 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.970
 can already do it on wrestling games de 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.709
 go and there your opinion to the next 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.510
 post the topic of the week so that you have the 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.160
 chance has in the next episode of 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.810
 world of riesling games to come 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.340
 so that was the topic of the week and 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.670
 Let's get to the riesling games 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.739
 news 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.420
 the makers of pfizer have wrestling 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.340
 Asked on facebook to ask 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.080
 In total, eight questions were asked 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.550
 selected which were then answered 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.140
 under it there were some questions already 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.640
 have often been asked how to 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.720
 Example when the game will come out 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.610
 and whether it is synonymous for other platforms 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.060
 be available as the playstation 3 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.950
 becomes 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.200
 but there were still questions to these two questions 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.730
 no concrete answers only 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.739
 it was said that the game feature 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.140
 is complete and she is in the final 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.910
 The question is whether there is a 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.920
 demo would be with no 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.390
 answered there was also the question 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.360
 after the average match duration 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.040
 and answered this with that 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.200
 One aims a match between 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.269
 five and eight minutes if you have 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.799
 but it will also be against them 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.860
 said that it is possible that one 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.239
 have over 20 minutes epic battle 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.190
 if the enemy times especially 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.200
 such persistent becomes for example one 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.970
 hit the johnny marr I hope that 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.620
 pronounce it right now as one 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.560
 As these characters 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.419
 Ronny Meyer is the parody of rock 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.669
 Of course, then it was asked how 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.229
 often one intends to bring out dlcs 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.330
 for all these did not know wrong 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.460
 Wrestling constantly wants new expansion 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.290
 in the form of dlcs 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.169
 as an answer to this question was said 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.970
 that you have a number of eight dlcs in the 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.440
 year for a good number holds the 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.389
 last question was already in 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.100
 But earlier statements answered 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.720
 Nevertheless, they have taken with them 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.220
 and that was the question if you have the 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.840
 Opponent on the legs very strong 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.400
 he does not work at all 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.949
 possibility more has any 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.030
 highlights actions to show as already 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.400
 was mentioned that already in 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.320
 it answers earlier statements 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.870
 is so that the whole one interaction 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.180
 is between the health moments and 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.229
 condition if all these three things are very much 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.870
 low is the probability 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.520
 from the low that you lift this 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.930
 maneuver somehow master 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.970
 in that the health is after 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.470
 regenerates a while and that one the 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.180
 possibility for a moment in spring 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.880
 it is still possible 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.350
 Despite battered legs an opponent 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.490
 to lift up and accordingly 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.050
 perform actions 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.940
 popstar sting will probably still be 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.800
 come out this year and appear 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.780
 Exclusively for the playstation 3 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.180
 there is once again a sign of life from 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.130
 apple pro championship wrestling this 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.740
 Dove into the wrestling game for PC 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.720
 completely surprising in late summer 2013 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.310
 and now there were some 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.560
 Months finally break again 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.000
 sign of life or a statement on 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.740
 In it, the developer writes 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.340
 that he is ready to play again 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.630
 potter about 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.880
 after he has some money 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.050
 has invested the game is the currently 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.070
 unable to do a project 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.720
 continue working 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.760
 the problem is he wants to have one 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.080
 new engine work with it 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.210
 Compatibility in the future 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.729
 is guaranteed or so he 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.039
 offer the game on linux or merck 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.120
 can and this engine costs as he says 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.440
 800 dollars 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.660
 so now look for people in the 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.789
 he supports or asks the community 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.560
 what about a click of the campaign 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.449
 would keep in a subordinate 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.820
 By the way, also mentioned that if that 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:11.430
 Get someone out there to get it guaranteed 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.750
 But a free version will be in 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.400
 which way that will be is 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.960
 of course not yet known that 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.970
 Complete statement can be found below 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.590
 the video description grepl percent 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.960
 Wrestling is like I said in independence 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.280
 Wrestling game for the pc and has to 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.550

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.800
 release date 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.170

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.700
 message from mtv so proclaimed the 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.500
 independent wrestling game developer 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.200

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.240

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.830
 million downloads 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.650
 There was also a little video again 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.580

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.200
 mobile devices 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.390
 so it will be possible in the game 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.100
 perform springboard actions 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.530
