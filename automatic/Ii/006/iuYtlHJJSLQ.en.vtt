00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
bit which is also when I tend to catch

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.490 
bit which is also when I tend to catch
up<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.729> my<00:01:20.850> YouTube<00:01:21.179> videos<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.350> just

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
up on my YouTube videos and so it just

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.840 
up on my YouTube videos and so it just
kind<00:01:22.649> of<00:01:22.710> makes<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.189> chore<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> little<00:01:23.759> bit

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
kind of makes that chore a little bit

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.410 
kind of makes that chore a little bit
more<00:01:24.000> fun<00:01:24.359> you<00:01:24.689> know<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.950> once<00:01:32.549> that's<00:01:32.850> done<00:01:33.090> I

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
more fun you know and once that's done I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.999 
more fun you know and once that's done I
will<00:01:33.479> go<00:01:33.719> and<00:01:33.840> get<00:01:33.990> myself<00:01:34.140> all<00:01:34.469> ready<00:01:34.649> for<00:01:34.859> bed

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
will go and get myself all ready for bed

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.649 
will go and get myself all ready for bed
and<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.399> first<00:01:35.579> thing<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.149> take<00:01:36.390> off<00:01:36.539> my

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
and the first thing I do is take off my

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.480 
and the first thing I do is take off my
makeup<00:01:36.780> obviously<00:01:37.679> what<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> usually<00:01:38.130> do<00:01:38.399> is

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
makeup obviously what I usually do is

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.590 
makeup obviously what I usually do is
shower<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> night<00:01:38.909> before<00:01:39.060> because<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.509> is

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
shower the night before because it is

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.209 
shower the night before because it is
way<00:01:39.840> more<00:01:39.869> efficient<00:01:40.499> with<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> toddler<00:01:41.039> I
