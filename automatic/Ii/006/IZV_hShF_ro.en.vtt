automatic<00:01:00.600> I'm<00:01:00.780> gonna<00:01:01.199> split<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.680> analysis

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
automatic I'm gonna split the analysis

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.000 
automatic I'm gonna split the analysis

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
see by yourself it spreads the left and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.179 
see by yourself it spreads the left and
right<00:01:42.060> instead<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> upwards<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.740> makes<00:01:44.009> it

right instead of upwards that makes it

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.310 
right instead of upwards that makes it
ideal<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.729> people<00:01:45.299> who<00:01:45.479> don't<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:45.869> high

remember the side-to-side recoil is a

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.210 
remember the side-to-side recoil is a
problem<00:03:09.510> not<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.870> accuracy<00:03:10.350> or<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.800> vertical

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220
