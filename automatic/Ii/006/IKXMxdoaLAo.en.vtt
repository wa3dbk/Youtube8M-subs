whatman lack performance by David Price
he<00:00:09.750> didn't<00:00:10.200> take<00:00:10.320> any<00:00:10.530> risks<00:00:11.010> he<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:12.090> stuck

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
he didn't take any risks he just stuck

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.509 
he didn't take any risks he just stuck
to<00:00:12.509> his<00:00:12.630> jabya<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.139> shorter<00:00:13.799> opponent<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.340> front

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
to his jabya a shorter opponent in front

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.129 
to his jabya a shorter opponent in front
of<00:00:14.610> him<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.820> slower<00:00:15.089> opponent<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:15.719> front<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.020> him

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
of him a slower opponent in front of him

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.290 
of him a slower opponent in front of him
so<00:00:16.890> he<00:00:17.070> didn't<00:00:17.340> want<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.520> rush<00:00:17.670> out<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.090> try

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
so he didn't want to rush out and try

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.210 
so he didn't want to rush out and try
and<00:00:18.359> look<00:00:18.480> for<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.720> knockout<00:00:19.080> he<00:00:19.289> just<00:00:19.529> stuck

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
and look for the knockout he just stuck

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.070 
and look for the knockout he just stuck
to<00:00:20.369> his<00:00:20.520> guns<00:00:20.550> kept<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> guy<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.810> end<00:00:21.930> of

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
to his guns kept the guy on the end of

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.429 
to his guns kept the guy on the end of
the<00:00:22.170> jab<00:00:22.439> kept<00:00:23.130> his<00:00:23.310> defense<00:00:24.140> where<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.260> needed

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the jab kept his defense where it needed

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.410 
the jab kept his defense where it needed
to<00:00:25.560> be<00:00:25.680> he<00:00:26.340> was<00:00:26.460> anticipating<00:00:26.730> everything

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
to be he was anticipating everything

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.359 
to be he was anticipating everything
Costa<00:00:27.779> was<00:00:27.930> doing<00:00:28.199> yes<00:00:28.590> he<00:00:28.740> did<00:00:28.859> have<00:00:29.010> his<00:00:29.039> left

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
Costa was doing yes he did have his left

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.749 
Costa was doing yes he did have his left
hand<00:00:29.550> down<00:00:29.760> well<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.720> think<00:00:31.189> given<00:00:32.189> how<00:00:32.340> slow

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
hand down well I think given how slow

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.389 
hand down well I think given how slow
his<00:00:32.940> opponent<00:00:33.420> was<00:00:33.600> he<00:00:34.410> didn't<00:00:34.739> feel<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
his opponent was he didn't feel the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.400 
his opponent was he didn't feel the
threat<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.730> any<00:00:36.000> imminent<00:00:36.690> danger<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> think

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
threat of any imminent danger I think

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.990 
threat of any imminent danger I think
that's<00:00:37.559> why<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> had<00:00:37.860> his<00:00:37.980> left<00:00:38.160> hand<00:00:38.309> down<00:00:38.520> as

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
that's why I had his left hand down as

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.790 
that's why I had his left hand down as
much<00:00:39.180> as<00:00:39.239> he<00:00:39.420> did<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.840> obviously<00:00:40.110> he<00:00:40.680> was

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
much as he did and obviously he was

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.459 
much as he did and obviously he was
trying<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> relax<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.850> enjoy<00:00:42.059> himself<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
trying to relax and enjoy himself in the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.150 
trying to relax and enjoy himself in the
ring<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.300> I<00:00:45.300> thought<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.440> fairly

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
ring and I thought it was a fairly

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.770 
ring and I thought it was a fairly
decent<00:00:47.280> performance<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.149> wasn't<00:00:48.450> as<00:00:48.539> dynamic

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
decent performance it wasn't as dynamic

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.709 
decent performance it wasn't as dynamic
or<00:00:49.350> dramatic<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.300> Joseph<00:00:51.300> Parker's

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
or dramatic as Joseph Parker's

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.959 
or dramatic as Joseph Parker's
performance<00:00:52.260> against<00:00:52.890> cost<00:00:53.100> off<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.550> example

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
performance against cost off for example

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.029 
performance against cost off for example
Park<00:00:54.270> knocked<00:00:54.809> out<00:00:54.960> Custer<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.469> four<00:00:55.649> rounds

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
Park knocked out Custer in four rounds

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.209 
Park knocked out Custer in four rounds
and<00:00:56.239> did<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.809> very<00:00:57.870> explosive<00:00:58.559> fashion

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
and did it in a very explosive fashion

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.330 
and did it in a very explosive fashion
and<00:00:59.480> prior<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.510> landing<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.530> knockout<00:01:01.829> blow<00:01:02.100> he

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and prior to landing a knockout blow he

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.369 
and prior to landing a knockout blow he
was<00:01:02.520> lighting<00:01:03.239> costs<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.780> rot<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.049> all<00:01:04.199> types

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
was lighting costs to rot with all types

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.429 
was lighting costs to rot with all types
of<00:01:04.530> combinations<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.309> he<00:01:05.369> was<00:01:05.489> very<00:01:05.519> exciting

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
of combinations and he was very exciting

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.109 
of combinations and he was very exciting
prices<00:01:07.439> performance<00:01:07.950> wasn't<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> he

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
prices performance wasn't like that he

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.000 
prices performance wasn't like that he
took<00:01:09.299> two<00:01:09.540> rounds<00:01:10.020> longer<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.500> get<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> job

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
took two rounds longer to get the job

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.460 
took two rounds longer to get the job
done<00:01:11.180> but<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.450> don't<00:01:13.020> think<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.350> necessarily

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
done but I don't think it necessarily

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.030 
done but I don't think it necessarily
means<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.760> was<00:01:14.880> less<00:01:15.119> impressive<00:01:15.540> than

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
means that it was less impressive than

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.100 
means that it was less impressive than
Park<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.280> because<00:01:17.610> Parker<00:01:18.420> was<00:01:18.570> taking<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.960> lot

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
Park up because Parker was taking a lot

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.590 
Park up because Parker was taking a lot
more<00:01:19.229> risks<00:01:19.619> than<00:01:19.680> price<00:01:20.210> defensive<00:01:21.210> risks

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
more risks than price defensive risks

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.740 
more risks than price defensive risks
were<00:01:21.720> his<00:01:21.869> price<00:01:22.140> was<00:01:22.170> really<00:01:22.710> keeping<00:01:23.070> it

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
were his price was really keeping it

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.010 
were his price was really keeping it
apart<00:01:24.750> from<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> left<00:01:25.170> hand<00:01:25.380> down<00:01:25.580> he<00:01:27.020> wasn't

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
apart from the left hand down he wasn't

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.749 
apart from the left hand down he wasn't
leaving<00:01:28.140> himself<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.890> position<00:01:29.430> let's<00:01:29.610> just

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
leaving himself out position let's just

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.950 
leaving himself out position let's just
put<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.030> way<00:01:30.180> when<00:01:30.540> he<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:30.720> throwing

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
put it that way when he was throwing

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.929 
put it that way when he was throwing
shots<00:01:31.259> he<00:01:31.890> always<00:01:32.040> had<00:01:32.310> his<00:01:32.340> opponent<00:01:32.850> where

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
shots he always had his opponent where

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.910 
shots he always had his opponent where
he<00:01:33.000> wanted<00:01:33.240> him<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.380> wasn't<00:01:34.710> getting

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
he wanted him to be it wasn't getting

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.590 
he wanted him to be it wasn't getting
our<00:01:35.040> position<00:01:35.549> he<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:35.790> sticking<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.210> jab<00:01:36.420> on

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600

our position he was sticking a jab on
him<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.189> he<00:01:38.189> was<00:01:38.310> gradually<00:01:38.939> gradually

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
him and he was gradually gradually

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.270 
him and he was gradually gradually
wearing<00:01:39.689> him<00:01:39.810> down<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.380> waiting<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.130> his

wearing him down and waiting for his

wearing him down and waiting for his
opportunity<00:01:41.420> very<00:01:42.420> very<00:01:42.630> patient

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
opportunity very very patient

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.630 
opportunity very very patient
performance<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.710> saw<00:01:44.340> as<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:45.119> say<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> saw

performance I saw as I say I saw

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.660 
performance I saw as I say I saw
improvements<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.880> price<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.689> terms<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.439> his

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
improvements in price in terms of his

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.819 
improvements in price in terms of his
have<00:01:50.670> been<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> bit<00:01:51.090> more<00:01:51.210> relaxed<00:01:51.829> his

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
have been a bit more relaxed his

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.499 
have been a bit more relaxed his
technique<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.490> defensive<00:01:53.970> technique<00:01:54.329> and

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
technique is defensive technique and

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.910 
technique is defensive technique and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920

stuff like that I think has improved
over<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.460> past<00:01:56.700> few<00:01:56.880> fights<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.270> one<00:01:57.390> thing

don't have the greatest chin I'm not
gonna<00:03:03.120> get<00:03:03.299> into<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.599> debate<00:03:03.750> with<00:03:04.019> people

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
gonna get into the debate with people

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.050 
gonna get into the debate with people
who<00:03:04.379> ever<00:03:04.500> he's<00:03:04.680> got<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:05.099> glass<00:03:05.459> chin<00:03:05.760> or<00:03:05.879> not

who ever he's got a glass chin or not

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.400 
who ever he's got a glass chin or not
but<00:03:06.420> he<00:03:06.510> knows<00:03:06.660> he<00:03:06.810> don't<00:03:06.959> have<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.200> greatest

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
but he knows he don't have the greatest

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.770 
but he knows he don't have the greatest
chin<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:08.549> therefore<00:03:08.790> he's<00:03:09.180> not<00:03:09.209> gonna<00:03:09.540> be

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
chin so therefore he's not gonna be

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.619 
chin so therefore he's not gonna be
particularly<00:03:10.769> so<00:03:10.980> soon<00:03:11.190> after<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.640> Thompson

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
particularly so soon after the Thompson

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:13.970 
particularly so soon after the Thompson
defeats<00:03:12.930> he's<00:03:13.079> not<00:03:13.230> gonna<00:03:13.349> be<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.560> guy<00:03:13.769> that's

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
defeats he's not gonna be a guy that's

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.069 
defeats he's not gonna be a guy that's
going<00:03:14.160> out<00:03:14.370> there<00:03:14.609> to<00:03:14.819> try<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.060> take<00:03:15.359> every

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
going out there to try and take every

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.259 
going out there to try and take every
risk<00:03:16.319> in<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.010> book<00:03:17.190> just<00:03:17.579> to<00:03:17.670> get<00:03:17.819> a<00:03:17.849> knockout

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
risk in the book just to get a knockout

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.819 
risk in the book just to get a knockout
you<00:03:18.599> know<00:03:18.720> he's<00:03:18.840> not<00:03:18.959> gonna<00:03:19.109> be<00:03:19.290> as<00:03:19.380> Cavalier

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
you know he's not gonna be as Cavalier

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.849 
you know he's not gonna be as Cavalier
as<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.010> guy<00:03:20.190> like<00:03:20.370> Joseph<00:03:20.730> Parker<00:03:21.120> for<00:03:21.329> example

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
as a guy like Joseph Parker for example

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.259 
as a guy like Joseph Parker for example
so<00:03:22.859> yeah<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.459> thought<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.849> was<00:03:23.910> an<00:03:24.030> ok

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
improving still a bit cumbersome I guess

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.409
