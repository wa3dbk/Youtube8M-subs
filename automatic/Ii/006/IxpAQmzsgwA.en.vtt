we're<00:00:17.000> working<00:00:17.150> on<00:00:17.330> today<00:00:17.450> is<00:00:17.840> a<00:00:17.869> Malibu<00:00:18.349> that

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
we're working on today is a Malibu that

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.070 
we're working on today is a Malibu that
has<00:00:18.619> the<00:00:18.830> cast<00:00:19.099> tower<00:00:19.400> on<00:00:19.700> it<00:00:19.849> so<00:00:20.210> built<00:00:20.810> into

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
has the cast tower on it so built into

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.810 
has the cast tower on it so built into
our<00:00:21.110> clamp<00:00:21.680> on<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.009> bottom<00:00:22.340> of<00:00:22.460> it<00:00:22.610> if<00:00:22.700> you

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
our clamp on the bottom of it if you

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.190 
our clamp on the bottom of it if you
look<00:00:23.000> there's<00:00:23.210> a<00:00:23.270> separate<00:00:23.660> piece<00:00:23.840> here<00:00:24.020> this

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
look there's a separate piece here this

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.380 
look there's a separate piece here this
is<00:00:24.290> actually<00:00:24.650> a<00:00:24.860> bracket<00:00:25.699> that<00:00:25.730> allows<00:00:25.939> you<00:00:26.270> to

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
is actually a bracket that allows you to

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.910 
is actually a bracket that allows you to
directly<00:00:26.689> mount<00:00:26.990> the<00:00:27.140> speaker<00:00:27.230> to<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:27.619> cast

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
directly mount the speaker to the cast

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.950 
directly mount the speaker to the cast
power<00:00:28.189> it's<00:00:29.000> pretty<00:00:29.269> easy<00:00:29.420> we're<00:00:29.810> going

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
power it's pretty easy we're going

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.450 
power it's pretty easy we're going
through<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.170> process<00:00:30.320> of<00:00:30.680> how<00:00:30.769> to<00:00:30.800> mount<00:00:31.070> to<00:00:31.430> a

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
through the process of how to mount to a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.840 
through the process of how to mount to a
Malibu<00:00:32.379> cast<00:00:33.379> power<00:00:33.650> basically<00:00:34.489> there's<00:00:34.790> two

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
Malibu cast power basically there's two

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.820 
Malibu cast power basically there's two
hex<00:00:35.540> bolts<00:00:35.840> in<00:00:35.960> the<00:00:36.019> bottom<00:00:36.320> we're<00:00:36.590> just<00:00:36.710> going

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
hex bolts in the bottom we're just going

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.880 
hex bolts in the bottom we're just going
to<00:00:36.860> undo<00:00:37.129> both<00:00:37.370> of<00:00:37.550> these<00:00:37.989> by<00:00:38.989> doing<00:00:39.230> that<00:00:39.350> and

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
to undo both of these by doing that and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.799 
to undo both of these by doing that and
pull<00:00:41.949> out<00:00:42.949> there<00:00:43.269> this<00:00:44.269> is<00:00:44.330> what<00:00:44.540> we'll<00:00:44.690> be

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
pull out there this is what we'll be

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.710 
pull out there this is what we'll be
using<00:00:45.010> we'll<00:00:46.010> have<00:00:46.190> our<00:00:46.370> post<00:00:46.760> gives<00:00:47.330> you<00:00:47.479> the

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
using we'll have our post gives you the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.020 
using we'll have our post gives you the
quick<00:00:48.470> disconnect<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:48.979> the<00:00:49.070> speaker<00:00:49.400> and<00:00:49.879> then

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
quick disconnect to the speaker and then

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.450 
quick disconnect to the speaker and then
we've<00:00:50.239> got<00:00:50.390> a<00:00:50.420> bracket<00:00:50.870> here<00:00:51.040> that<00:00:52.040> allows<00:00:52.250> you

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
we've got a bracket here that allows you

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.250 
we've got a bracket here that allows you
to<00:00:52.549> directly<00:00:52.940> mount<00:00:53.239> to<00:00:53.600> cast<00:00:53.930> hours<00:00:54.400> on<00:00:55.400> the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
to directly mount to cast hours on the

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.410 
to directly mount to cast hours on the
so<00:00:57.260> we<00:00:58.100> go<00:00:58.220> your<00:00:58.460> cast<00:00:58.699> locations<00:00:59.239> on<00:00:59.330> the

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
so we go your cast locations on the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.509 
so we go your cast locations on the
Malibu<00:00:59.809> bow<00:00:59.989> there's<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.559> plug<00:01:01.339> right<00:01:01.460> here

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
Malibu bow there's a plug right here

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.430 
Malibu bow there's a plug right here
that<00:01:01.790> covers<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.330> where<00:01:02.659> the<00:01:02.809> speaker<00:01:03.229> wires

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
that covers the where the speaker wires

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.859 
that covers the where the speaker wires
you<00:01:03.710> just<00:01:03.890> simply<00:01:04.129> remove<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.400> plug<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:05.780> then

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
you just simply remove the plug and then

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:14.000 
you just simply remove the plug and then
you<00:01:05.960> have<00:01:06.049> to<00:01:06.140> dig<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.470> speaker<00:01:06.799> wire

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:26.910 

they're<00:01:14.580> nice<00:01:14.790> tight

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.050 

then<00:01:27.189> this<00:01:27.340> can<00:01:27.490> be<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.640> little<00:01:27.729> bit<00:01:27.939> of<00:01:28.000> a

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
then this can be a little bit of a

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.550 
then this can be a little bit of a
challenge<00:01:28.509> you<00:01:28.570> got<00:01:28.659> to<00:01:28.780> fish<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.110> wire<00:01:29.229> back

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
challenge you got to fish the wire back

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.280 
challenge you got to fish the wire back
up<00:01:29.770> into<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.220> tower

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.580 

in<00:01:35.350> this<00:01:35.530> space<00:01:35.860> for<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:36.220> wire<00:01:36.580> hi<00:01:36.970> denim

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
in this space for a wire hi denim

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.200 
in this space for a wire hi denim
and<00:01:38.740> this<00:01:38.950> hole<00:01:39.189> here<00:01:39.430> is<00:01:39.549> off-center<00:01:39.909> from

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
and this hole here is off-center from

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.969 
and this hole here is off-center from
the<00:01:40.299> two<00:01:40.509> wires<00:01:41.020> so<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:41.409> have<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.680> kind<00:01:41.890> of

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
the two wires so you have to kind of

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.530 
the two wires so you have to kind of
push<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.549> wire<00:01:42.700> down<00:01:42.970> where<00:01:43.119> you<00:01:43.240> want<00:01:43.329> it<00:01:43.450> to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
push the wire down where you want it to

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.330 
push the wire down where you want it to
go<00:01:43.659> we've<00:01:43.899> given<00:01:44.259> plenty<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:44.649> relief<00:01:44.920> inside

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
go we've given plenty of relief inside

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.370 
go we've given plenty of relief inside
of<00:01:45.460> there<00:01:45.579> before<00:01:45.729> come<00:01:46.149> out<00:01:46.299> over<00:01:47.200> on<00:01:47.289> the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.820 

that's<00:02:05.360> pretty<00:02:05.600> straight<00:02:05.930> and<00:02:06.260> then<00:02:06.590> just

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
that's pretty straight and then just

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.270 
that's pretty straight and then just
