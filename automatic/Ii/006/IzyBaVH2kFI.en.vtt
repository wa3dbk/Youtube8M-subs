00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.230
 nice modals are welcome in this 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.629
 spot light 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.360
 today we talk about a mod recommended by 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:14.820
 you are really very interesting 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.460
 I'm talking about the elementary rivers 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.520
 this fashion adds lots of kleber 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.560
 minecraft first time burst vi 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.630
 leave different things 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.110
 for example we have the clipper file that 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.240
 releases fire on the earth weather 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.300
 clipper instead leaves a large waterfall 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.120
 water is here to release a monument 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.510
 shaped like an earth made of dirt ice 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.159
 clipper instead fizzes or ice 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.609
 all the water and lava we have 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:47.120
 around her so far for instead adds 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:51.329
 the light then illuminates the place 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.909
 physique creeper instead balance in the air 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.819
 once blew mag macrÃ¬ for 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:00.329
 instead I leave them a cascade of gas lava 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:04.350
 here instead he kills the animals he kills 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.960
 and steve but does not destroy anything friendly 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.869
 for instead it does nothing 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.490
 the clipper friendly so it's one that doesn't 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.340
 we say not bad if we so wish 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.810
 call it cook and clipper instead one 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.500
 once blown up leaves gods 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.189
 cookies illusion here for this one 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.710
 once placed let's say five come out 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.289
 clip instead of one and we have to find out 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.140
 we what is the original one 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.880
 or what breaks out while 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.990
 others also bursting do not 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.829
 nothing 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.990
 then we have the light here for similar to 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.600
 the art here only for the release of 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.159
 glaston therefore also illuminates this the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.770
 place from here to destroy that instead 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.880
 that we have around the reverse clipper 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.840
 instead it turns everything we have 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.340
 below we do it go above only e 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.749
 what 's on no one makes it go 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.759
 in what sense 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:07.799
 if we have trees, it only goes beyond 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.780
 these go down and all that 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.040
 we had just given an example 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.739
 mining in various stuff goes up 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.780
 in the shape of an earth this mode as mentioned 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.629
 first it's really very interesting 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.659
 of course we also have eggs like 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.920
 you saw in the video and I recommend it 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:29.620
 yes, because I really like it a lot 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.150
 bari clipper that marry a lot 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.430
 frequently as friendly 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.040
 write it found this many times 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.900
 however it does not take away the hearts and between 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.349
 the other if you blow them both up 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.349
 neighbors do nothing as an example 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:47.109
 you will now see example as you see here 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.639
 instead it does not burst even while it is now 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:52.900
 however, nothing was done 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:56.139
 however as you see this not 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.099
 never bursts I must say that this thing me 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.689
 like it 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.189
 See you at the next video 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.919

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:05.019

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:08.620
