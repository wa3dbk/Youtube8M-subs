00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.630
 after having shown you the materials that 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.430
 we use you I'll mention that this 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.820
 box is already a bit advanced by 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.380
 effects of time in this case the box 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.890
 It was already decorated with a ribbon 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.500
 what was that 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.250
 if you can see a small box of color 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.040
 cream and some plates in gold 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.350
 old man who says at our wedding in another 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.180
 on another occasion we could show 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.130
 how to perform this task 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.350
 that although we already 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.090
 we buy made also are easy to 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.090
 do 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.939
 from this side 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.799
 we have put down you already juan 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.659
 we teach that it is the green brick the 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.850
 green like this 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.070
 in which you can exploit it 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.810
 you can go 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.240
 in which you can cut it the way 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.240
 you want and embed it in a small box 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.060
 then we put foam and the only thing 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.430
 what we did is with a scissors we cut 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.130
 all the excesses of the edges in order 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.380
 to have free what is the edge of the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.430
 street after this we will perform 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.200
 what is an arrangement on this side for 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.509
 that is taking shape 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.430
 as I showed you the bouquets of flowers 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.740
 can come in long designs 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.550
 and what we are going to do is adapt it 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.560
 as well 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.320
 in this case, ours will be very 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.000
 little boy because we do not want him to call 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:16.230
 Unlike much attention 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.230
 star in this case 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.080
 and reduce 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.200
 you could save it 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.740
 miss 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.440
 all right 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.930
 these flowers all the piles are accommodated 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.550
 move right and you give it the right 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.310
 way you want to start saving 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.000
 in this case you can remove the last 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.400
 sheet and at the end the used 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.620
 place 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.620
 in this part we are going to make them 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.020
 you place in this part what is the 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.050
 twig pressing 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.210
 if you see that the leaves are left aside as 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.880
 in this case the only thing you will have to 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.520
 to do is to rearrange the flowers 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.130
 That 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.580
 do not worry, you can return them to 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.580
 accommodate 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.360
 you can rearrange them in a way 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.870
 simple in which it will not bother you in what 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.940
 absolute 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.080
 they are the occupations of the office of flowers 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.410
 artificial 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.380
 Now this is how it is at first sight. 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.750
 be fine but let's do it that is 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.870
 a bouquet with flowers that already 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.540
 previously we cut 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.860
 the bouquet that comes by pompoms the only thing 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.860
 what we are going to do is upload them 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.000
 we see 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.530
 we cut like the previous one always 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.530
 trying that the stem that of boy 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.660
 that is important 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.769
 we place 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.790
 we place a down 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.620
 and we started between the eyes 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.230
 with the help of a drop say 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.230
 we can paste it from the back 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.850
 in such a way 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.100
 that the back of the rule is 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.810
 very well decorated 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:37.639
 well they are only a guide for the 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:41.490
 as we already have three you are wands 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:44.610
 We can cut them long in this case 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.010
 I used 3 wands but if you notice 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.620
 these are too long for 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.190
 our work so we will proceed 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.190
 shorten 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.620
 now that it has been a little lower 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:01.680
 we will only look for an entry 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.610
 and the 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.610
 nails 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.020
 the communes 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.570
 and we already have basically the first step 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.910
 It is important to mention that for 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.700
 Effects of colors being lost 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.700
 you can exchange flowers in the 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.510
 others now comes the simplest and most 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.540
 interested 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:31.840
 now we have prepared another candle that 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.120
 we just put a tape that you already 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.400
 had mentioned around for effects 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.130
 from birth this candle we put a 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.470
 little white silicone down here and the 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.890
 we stick 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:48.830
 once stuck we grabbed the little 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.830
 white gravel and we empty it 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.409
 as all the fifths decrease 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:57.389
 as long as you buy in quantity 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:06:00.590
 you are told they left five pesos in 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:03.130
 the purchase of more than twelve sachets 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.130
 okay 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.449
 we put the gravel 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.760
 we accommodate 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.790
 with a bag is enough 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.420
 okay 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.420
 However 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.530
 a little bag of gmt 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.540
 we press 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:48.990
 the four points of the candle 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.990
 I believe that with stress 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.210
 to end 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.520
 He speaks 

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:00.270
 1500 grams only we have to do 

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:03.530
 is to cut it 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.530
 and more 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.340
 as final decoration 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:10.510
 we can make hairlines 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:14.040
 use it 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.040
 and the rake 

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:19.269
 or just put a stone 

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:21.249
 decorative in this case that will be a 

00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:24.869
 wedding we have chosen to put a stone 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:24.869
 true simple white 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:33.020
 and so would be the final project 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:43.689
 what do you think?
