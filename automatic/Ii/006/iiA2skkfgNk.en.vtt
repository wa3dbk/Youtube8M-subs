00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 red star belgrade was the first name 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.640
 test opponents of our team 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.069
 during the training camp in bad 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.990
 Radkersburg on Tuesday evening for ours 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.690
 crew in the approximately 40 kilometer 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.969
 distant Slovenian tui and of course 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.590
 There were also some 96 fans on the spot 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.359
 the team to Austria in the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.279
 accompanied by this year's training camp 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.920
 and of course to this 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.390
 test game chefrainer tayfun korkut has 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.880
 it already indicated during the week 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.769
 Some players should now over 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.109
 the complete 90 minutes go 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.940
 and who that was against belgrade today was that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.950
 Let's look at each other now in the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.140
 tor launched our new entry robert 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.770
 Almer in his first game in the new 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 shirt 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.950
 The rookies ak started on his right 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.079
 defensive side 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.850
 the central defense was marcelo 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.250
 and stefan teska of the ailing 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.140
 christian schulz contract left began 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.239
 standard specialist christian pander 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.579
 Over 90 minutes, the two went 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.649
 Sixth leon andreasen and moritz deer 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.140
 the also battered manuel 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.660
 Schmiedebach represented Leo Begcourt 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.149
 right the prib on the left rossel im 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.949
 Storm and capitano lars stindl of course 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.720
 again today with the number 10 on 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.310
 the back on his position in the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.530
 offensive midfield 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.840
 purely in the part and belgrade occurred 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.299
 right to less against the ball 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.460
 rather than against our players here 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.570
 had to plug in lars stindl and only 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.520
 rose a little later 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.310
 There were not even two minutes 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.259
 played but belgrade should be too 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.570
 a little later hit the round leather 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.159
 led another minute ball from robert 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.140
 Almer and then the ball sailed 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.820
 straightway to sabine witt 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.860
 alba was able to do that for a moment 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.829
 Shiny respond to the margin 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.610
 neda fritsch was alba but then 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.500
 powerless 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.420
 the zero to one after only four 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.370
 played minutes 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.770
 and it got even thicker that was the 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.290
 belgrade captain niedermaids with the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.330
 ball on darko lazovic the past 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.910
 Christian Pander and then there again 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.729
 even fritsch the perfect 96 start 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:05.660
 made the 0 2 after twelve played 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:08.479
 minutes but 96 showed moral and 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.520
 reacted in the meanwhile warburg in 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.040
 the lot came in christian 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.959
 pander and he can throw far 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.940
 somehow the ball came through to stindl 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.489
 shot from the turn and then there was 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.709
 so snail was exactly where a 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.600
 Striker must stand the connecting goal 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.160
 for our team in the 25 minute 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.790
 and what followed was just 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.739
 wonderful to watch 38 minutes played 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.600
 intervene belgrade ball intercepted by 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.390
 car so burk went a few steps 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.280
 and then just pulled off a glorious 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.959
 hit our striker from the almost 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.720
 six months was injured 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.880
 Now he is back and like one 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.370
 Hut absolutely the brand gate of the month 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.510
 and we can sympathize with that 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.510
 but charcoal from the heart 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.910
 just before the break showed our 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.010
 new entrant stefan tester how fast he is 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.239
 when he is in the highest distress against the 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.760
 lazovic returned 96 came 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.150
 unchanged from the break and it took 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.310
 up to 64 minutes he gives this good free kick 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.989
 position for 96 jumped out 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.209
 the edgar prib just passed by 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.190
 shortly thereafter in the 67 minute there was 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.220
 Two debuts are ours 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.950
 new entries gÃ¼lselam and hiroshi petacchi 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.610
 came for stefan tester and edgar prib in 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.709
 the game 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.780
 It should also be another change 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.209
 still give for leo begcourt the 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.230
 really had to plug in a lot 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.940
 in the 72 minute kenan karaman one 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.950
 fifteen minutes before the end 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.900
 our keeper robert almer that he 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.920
 He was wide awake when he got that wide ball 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.510
 cleared on djordje rakic in full sprint 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.660
 a bit of bad luck in the next scene 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.300
 had our new 28 kilo days than he did 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.100
 actually 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.440
 But then it worked well 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.930
 Reacting belgrader Schlussmann and 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.930
 at the post failed a pity but in 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.090
 this 79 minutes of play since you have seen 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.820
 what a potential in the young 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.550
 it works better then it should only work 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.440
 three minutes later than artur bugger who 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.540
 otherwise his third as well 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.450
 achieve remarkable hits of the day 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.730
 could and the 3 2 endstand established 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.120
 the exactly timed preparatory work came along 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.610
 by captain lars stindl first test in 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.140
 training camp first victory and the against 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.540
 all attention to the Serbian master 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.340
 trainer tayfun korkut analyzed in the 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.700
 press session after the game that really 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.710
 very hard partie seen that 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.440
 It was a very difficult game 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.150
 simply against a team 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.970
 especially in the 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:50.850
 always a tick was too late in the beginning phase 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.920
 and then not this tick too late 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.900
 tried to solve differently 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.100
 So we tried most over 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.550
 to bring the 90 minutes 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.660
 yes, too 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.580
 battered andreas still in the square 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.500
 So some players had stayed 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.570
 the goods were really on the limit 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.070
 but we wanted today , yes I have 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.760
 before that really said this 90th 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.830
 minutes to go 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.900
 that 's your son's tough game too 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.180
 such a body-oriented game will be 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.310
 Of course we have already planned 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.780
 on Wednesday afternoon at 16 o'clock 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.330
 the second test game on the program 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.979
 then in the therme marina here with us 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.240
 in Bad Radkersburg against the Hungarian 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:31.250
 second division aqua tk and 96 tv will be 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.250
 of course, be for you on the spot
