00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 I was coughing hammer times I'm going to you 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.570
 show a little way of working with 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.130
 this rustic and functional tool for 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.980
 make you little read man warmers 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.289
 or even cardio workout or 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.240
 power drive then already 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.949
 before you start choose your 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.990
 weapon so there are masses of different 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.429
 weight in the stores in general it's okay 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.920
 of self it is 3 4 kg 5 kg it can be 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.559
 view in France we do not see much more 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.180
 must know that I saw up to 10 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.960
 kg of masses so after that is enough 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.820
 can not be found good with one with a 4 5 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.030
 pounds already you have what's good 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.590
 bossed is not bad so it's ok 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.969
 be 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.739
 endurance power and where after that is 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.270
 true that if you have more you go 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.090
 start to work as well eventually 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.050
 in muscular strength all that so that's 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.789
 can be nice to see 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.890
 muscularily what is solicited 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.739
 especially it's going to be the body you're going 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.229
 work a lot the abs all the way 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.299
 Corsican lumbar abdominal belt and 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.369
 it's mostly that you have used to 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.909
 hit after you go work a little 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.290
 just as the EPEC all for this 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.790
 for the lowering movement of the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.560
 mass now what is really 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.810
 interesting on it is all 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.840
 support stability and work 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.159
 the whole belt at the vote level of 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.729
 your heart from your point of gravity 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.100
 exercise level so in fact I I 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.070
 especially make a move with that 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 with the catch as you see with a 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.439
 hand one hand at the end of the mass and a 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.140
 another which is going to be rather close to the 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.940
 hammer before coming to slip at the moment 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.720
 of 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.910
 of lowering when you hit and 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.550
 here after there is the other the other way 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.020
 that you will see is with both 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.040
 hands that always stay at the end 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.980
 so there you do rather a movement 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.160
 from new line and relieved - now 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.200
 it's also a way of working that 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.000
 can do it me in general I bump 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.460
 that first because it's really 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.980
 like that we are going to hit the same 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.240
 on a building site here in my 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.729
 youth on the building sites I got 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.580
 a lot of fun to the masses to demolish 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.800
 concrete block walls or rocks here 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.080
 it was a bit my little pleasure in the 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.760
 workday is low and with 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.800
 this strike where we have the most 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.750
 power in general and is also a 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.450
 better control so there you have a 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.820
 functional movement you can do 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.560
 series a little bit long we're going 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.250
 say one of the series 10 20 30 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.990
 in the end it rips if you have a 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.540
 Heart put on it that 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.980
 can be fun to observe the data that 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.930
 you harvest when you rock like that 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.849
 and 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.829
 and what else yeah after that bah it can 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.569
 to be as good power there you do 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.980
 small series and you are looking for 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.890
 to hit the strongest possible that that 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.629
 will increase your technique and that's it 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.670
 so me in general that I use it 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.159
 to do little warm-ups when 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.560
 I will make 50 on each side 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.450
 maximum because you have to work 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.650
 two sides also after con when we did not 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.239
 not used it can do a little 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.620
 weird 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.150
 this is me by dint I become a little 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.480
 little ambidextrous that's it too who is 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.639
 interesting and that's so I'm using it 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.769
 especially for warm ups before 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.709
 work it's really warming up 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.840
 fun it allows you to stimulate yourself 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.310
 without you without bother you know it's 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.129
 just a specific warm to 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.349
 6.1 according to what you are going to do and good 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.030
 here I invite you to do that so good 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.400
 I have all the panoply you see 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.409
 I have glp 1 e to type it 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.939
 rebound to that which also encourages 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.340
 increase accuracy 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:39.769
 it's true that if you finally tap on 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.760
 directly on a floor or something 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.680
 which is pretty stable how are you doing 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.120
 do a little bit there on the tire must I 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.889
 like you in the right place if after 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.419
 it'll make me rebounds that can 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.769
 to become a little bit out of control 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:54.440
 be careful also to take 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.710
 in the mouth that's all that's all 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.840
 have fun with that if you have 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.930
 other ideas to work with the mass 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.510
 where are you or other media or 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.700
 tools or you know where to find 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.840
 masses of more than 5 kilos it is 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.690
 interesting then I believe they in 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.760
 world is safe on amazon role also in 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.150
 sold we looked good after that 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.040
 express to work out the workout what 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.680
 so it's really specific 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.960
 after in construction equipment 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.230
 frankly I've never seen so here's so 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.680
 you know that's what we say it will be 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.050
 interesting 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.950
 good fun with that I wanted 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.950
 that more for the next
