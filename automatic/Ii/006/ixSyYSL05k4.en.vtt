game<00:03:47.650> mechanism<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:48.310> say<00:03:48.520> ok<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.940> game<00:03:49.120> is

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
game mechanism that say ok the game is

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.229 
game mechanism that say ok the game is
so<00:03:49.510> good<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:49.900> it's<00:03:50.050> not<00:03:50.680> really<00:03:51.010> fun<00:03:51.550> to<00:03:51.940> make

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
so good and it's not really fun to make

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.330 
so good and it's not really fun to make
more<00:03:52.570> expansion<00:03:53.140> because<00:03:53.230> maybe<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.100> rules

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
more expansion because maybe the rules

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.970 
more expansion because maybe the rules
get<00:03:54.580> too<00:03:54.790> complex<00:03:55.330> or<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.900> game<00:03:56.110> too<00:03:56.590> tight

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
get too complex or the game too tight

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.800 
get too complex or the game too tight
which<00:03:57.160> I've<00:03:57.370> too<00:03:57.580> long<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:58.030> think<00:03:58.209> that<00:03:58.690> the

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
which I've too long I think that the

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.540 
which I've too long I think that the
game<00:03:58.959> worlds<00:03:59.350> and<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.590> magic<00:04:00.130> of<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.280> game

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
game worlds and the magic of the game

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.880 
game worlds and the magic of the game
exists<00:04:00.970> just<00:04:01.209> 15<00:04:01.660> cards<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.140> some<00:04:02.320> tokens<00:04:02.709> so

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
exists just 15 cards and some tokens so

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.250 
exists just 15 cards and some tokens so
I'm<00:04:03.070> not<00:04:03.250> sure<00:04:03.489> I'm<00:04:04.150> not<00:04:04.630> sure<00:04:04.780> I<00:04:04.810> can<00:04:05.050> come

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
I'm not sure I'm not sure I can come

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.320 
I'm not sure I'm not sure I can come
with<00:04:05.320> an<00:04:05.620> interesting<00:04:06.310> expansion<00:04:06.850> view<00:04:07.090> I

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
with an interesting expansion view I

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.760 
with an interesting expansion view I
don't<00:04:07.390> want<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.780> make<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.050> expansion<00:04:08.440> just<00:04:08.680> to

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
don't want to make it expansion just to

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.920 
don't want to make it expansion just to
make<00:04:08.920> an<00:04:09.040> expansion<00:04:09.280> because<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.660> have

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
make an expansion because the to have

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.810 
make an expansion because the to have
sells<00:04:11.230> for<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.530> game<00:04:11.709> I<00:04:11.890> think<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.340> game<00:04:12.550> just

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
sells for the game I think the game just

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.780 
sells for the game I think the game just
worked<00:04:13.060> well<00:04:13.330> with<00:04:13.750> small<00:04:14.470> bugs<00:04:14.739> 50<00:04:15.550> cards

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
worked well with small bugs 50 cards

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.810 
worked well with small bugs 50 cards
some<00:04:16.359> tokens<00:04:16.780> and<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.500> think<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.430> want<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.669> keep

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
some tokens and I think I want to keep

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.539 
some tokens and I think I want to keep
it<00:04:18.970> that<00:04:19.120> way<00:04:19.150> but<00:04:19.539> we<00:04:19.960> see<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:21.160> want<00:04:21.370> with

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
it that way but we see you want with

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.010

seven<00:04:22.330> wonders<00:04:22.660> you<00:04:22.810> want<00:04:23.050> with

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
seven wonders you want with

seven wonders you want with
what's<00:04:24.500> your<00:04:24.770> next<00:04:25.190> game<00:04:25.400> trying<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.270> attempt

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
what's your next game trying to attempt

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.520 
what's your next game trying to attempt
the<00:04:26.810> pick<00:04:26.990> of<00:04:27.139> odd<00:04:28.479> yeah<00:04:29.479> just<00:04:30.110> don't<00:04:30.259> think

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
the pick of odd yeah just don't think

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.749 
the pick of odd yeah just don't think
about<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.889> world<00:04:31.069> when<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.310> designed<00:04:31.639> the

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
about the world when you designed the

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.570 
about the world when you designed the
game<00:04:31.880> I<00:04:32.060> have<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.330> young<00:04:32.599> kid<00:04:32.870> now<00:04:33.199> so<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:34.069> know<00:04:34.400> in

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
starting to design children game for my

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.159 
starting to design children game for my
kid<00:04:39.080> so<00:04:39.319> maybe<00:04:39.560> maybe<00:04:40.250> I<00:04:40.340> come<00:04:40.610> with<00:04:41.449> kids

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
we're surprised that the Hanafi was such

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
your own convention and I have some

your own convention and I have some
friend<00:05:55.940> of<00:05:56.030> mine<00:05:56.210> who<00:05:56.389> played<00:05:56.599> a<00:05:56.630> lot<00:05:56.810> maybe

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
friend of mine who played a lot maybe

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.659 
friend of mine who played a lot maybe
two<00:05:57.500> 300<00:05:58.190> games<00:05:58.460> and<00:05:59.229> now<00:06:00.229> they<00:06:00.620> can<00:06:00.860> say<00:06:01.250> shift

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
two 300 games and now they can say shift

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.640 
two 300 games and now they can say shift
to<00:06:01.819> make<00:06:01.940> the<00:06:02.120> 25<00:06:03.639> 19<00:06:04.639> out<00:06:04.880> out<00:06:05.090> of<00:06:05.300> 10<00:06:05.539> so<00:06:05.840> so<00:06:06.560> it

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
to make the 25 19 out out of 10 so so it

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.680 
to make the 25 19 out out of 10 so so it
just<00:06:06.860> practiced<00:06:07.280> but<00:06:07.460> if<00:06:07.819> they<00:06:08.090> play<00:06:08.419> with<00:06:08.659> a

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
just practiced but if they play with a

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.950 
just practiced but if they play with a
new<00:06:08.990> player<00:06:09.909> it's<00:06:10.909> completely<00:06:11.630> different

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
new player it's completely different

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.570 
new player it's completely different
because<00:06:12.169> all<00:06:12.229> the<00:06:12.349> conventions<00:06:13.039> are<00:06:13.219> to<00:06:13.430> be

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
because all the conventions are to be

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.930 
because all the conventions are to be
rebuilt<00:06:14.120> and<00:06:14.389> everything<00:06:14.870> so<00:06:15.080> I<00:06:15.729> like<00:06:16.729> this

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
rebuilt and everything so I like this

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.149 
rebuilt and everything so I like this
about<00:06:17.300> the<00:06:17.419> an<00:06:17.509> a<00:06:17.539> basic<00:06:18.020> you<00:06:18.319> can<00:06:18.500> you<00:06:19.009> have<00:06:19.130> to

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
about the an a basic you can you have to

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.610 
about the an a basic you can you have to
learn<00:06:19.460> the<00:06:19.639> game<00:06:19.819> with<00:06:20.330> one<00:06:20.360> group<00:06:20.780> and<00:06:21.050> if<00:06:21.500> you

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
learn the game with one group and if you

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.290 
learn the game with one group and if you
play<00:06:21.830> with<00:06:22.009> another<00:06:22.490> gaming<00:06:22.729> rooms<00:06:23.060> you<00:06:23.240> have

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
play with another gaming rooms you have

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.180 
play with another gaming rooms you have
to<00:06:23.479> learn<00:06:23.599> it<00:06:23.780> again<00:06:23.960> from<00:06:24.380> the<00:06:24.530> start<00:06:24.800> and<00:06:24.979> I

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
to learn it again from the start and I

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.610 
to learn it again from the start and I
like<00:06:25.370> that<00:06:25.550> but<00:06:26.000> nevertheless<00:06:26.270> is<00:06:26.719> a<00:06:26.870> chip<00:06:27.259> or

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
like that but nevertheless is a chip or

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.370 
like that but nevertheless is a chip or
the<00:06:27.650> futures<00:06:28.340> that<00:06:28.610> all<00:06:29.180> groups<00:06:29.960> should

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
the futures that all groups should

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.709 
the futures that all groups should
follow<00:06:30.710> they<00:06:31.460> then<00:06:31.639> make<00:06:31.849> easier<00:06:32.270> to<00:06:32.539> reach

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:32.719 
follow they then make easier to reach

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:34.390 
follow they then make easier to reach
the<00:06:32.900> big<00:06:33.080> goal

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
the big goal

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.560 
the big goal
I'm<00:06:35.210> not<00:06:35.449> sure<00:06:35.690> I<00:06:35.889> can<00:06:36.889> tell<00:06:37.100> it<00:06:37.389> depends<00:06:38.389> on

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
I'm not sure I can tell it depends on

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.020 
I'm not sure I can tell it depends on
every<00:06:39.470> group<00:06:39.680> has<00:06:39.710> his<00:06:40.010> own<00:06:40.220> convention<00:06:40.820> and

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
every group has his own convention and

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.629 
every group has his own convention and
on<00:06:41.150> rules<00:06:41.449> so<00:06:41.750> you<00:06:41.810> have<00:06:42.080> to<00:06:42.290> try<00:06:42.710> them<00:06:43.010> and<00:06:43.340> if

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 
on rules so you have to try them and if

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.170 
on rules so you have to try them and if
I<00:06:43.760> give<00:06:43.940> you<00:06:44.120> if<00:06:44.389> you<00:06:44.419> give<00:06:44.810> you<00:06:44.960> one<00:06:45.620> rule<00:06:45.860> I

just ruin the game for you because the
part<00:06:49.400> of<00:06:49.520> the<00:06:49.639> magic<00:06:49.940> is<00:06:50.120> to<00:06:50.300> find<00:06:50.600> the

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
part of the magic is to find the

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.960 
part of the magic is to find the
convention<00:06:51.650> and<00:06:51.889> it's<00:06:52.160> what<00:06:52.430> I<00:06:52.460> want<00:06:52.790> when

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970

convention and it's what I want when
people<00:06:53.389> play<00:06:53.510> and<00:06:53.690> maybe<00:06:53.840> I<00:06:54.110> don't<00:06:54.410> want<00:06:54.710> to

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
people play and maybe I don't want to

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.409 
people play and maybe I don't want to
say<00:06:54.889> hey<00:06:55.040> you<00:06:55.100> should<00:06:55.490> play<00:06:55.699> they<00:06:55.880> like<00:06:56.240> that

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.610 
to win it's not interesting you have to
discover<00:06:58.850> the<00:06:59.120> game<00:06:59.270> and<00:06:59.510> say<00:06:59.630> hey<00:06:59.780> if<00:07:00.169> we<00:07:00.380> play

discover the game and say hey if we play
like<00:07:00.830> that<00:07:01.070> maybe<00:07:01.340> we<00:07:01.610> can<00:07:01.790> do<00:07:01.940> better<00:07:02.090> and
