00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 good as many of you already know 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.870
 for very but very little they are 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.970
 spreading photographs about what 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.480
 is going to be this new update of the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.980
 operating system ios 8 where it is said 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.560
 that will come fully improved 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.600
 including new applications and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.270
 functionality according to the page 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.730
 notifight mac as I have it here 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.980
 on the screen these photos have spread 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.410
 by a company called 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.080
 weibo just as it is here and well if 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.630
 you can see it 's really have not 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.130
 changed exactly a lot everything looks 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.610
 very similar to what currently 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.739
 we have although obviously this 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.200
 not exactly going to be the concept 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.260
 final many we know that when you 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.120
 about the time that apple has to 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.760
 speak to the public about this new 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.559
 update regularly they make 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.980
 changes between new applications 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.829
 that we are going to find we have this that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.170
 says health book as you see it here 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.690
 This application aims to work with 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.550
 a device known as the la uach 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.200
 or like the clock 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.630
 where it's supposed to go to 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.640
 monitor different things here 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.070
 marked with a different color each 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.960
 of them among the information that you go 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.940
 to get when doing 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.060
 exercise is going to tell you the calories 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.820
 burned the heartbeat how it 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.430
 find your hydration and also how 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.260
 your glucose levels are found 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.270
 same way this other one is presented 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.070
 application that is called preview there is no 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.170
 a lot of information about it because 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.150
 obviously these are photographs that 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.430
 have recently been exposed to 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.920
 public as many of you know to 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.320
 poe does not like that nobody finds out 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.240
 before they obviously 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.550
 inform but I want to assume that this 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.620
 application is going to be something about 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.030
 how the pictures are showing 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.740
 for those people who have a 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.230
 Mac computer know perfectly 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.240
 this preview application that has 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.070
 several functionalities regarding the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.590
 photos but in the same way we find 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.750
 what is the text edit I think one of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.120
 the primary concerns of 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.000
 people that we use the cell phone or the 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.979
 iphone regularly for everything is the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.349
 way or the possibility of how 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.750
 Edit documents in text really not 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.120
 we have an application I think in this 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.340
 moment has put the batteries as soon as 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.220
 to that and has created an application in 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.080
 where are you going to be able to obviously edit this 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.400
 type of documents but the most 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.879
 important is that you will be able to 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.280
 synchronize with icloud or in the cloud to 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.560
 that all your devices that same 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.170
 information is updated so 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.480
 fast we also have what is this 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.310
 application of tips I want to assume that 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.010
 this application is going to give you tips 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.260
 regarding any type of information 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.540
 I do not know if it's going to be relevant only 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.400
 to the iphone or any other topic but 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.709
 I want to believe that it's going to be a kind 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.079
 as a community or applications where 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.109
 you will find relevant information 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:01.709
 about topics of interest this is with 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:05.310
 respect to ios 8 here below we have 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.099
 some more pictures on this side are 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.870
 is proving that it is version 8.0 for 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.120
 those people who do not believe that you are 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.530
 photos are original and well on this side 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.840
 we have 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.510
 big icon of what is the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.130
 gel book app then tell me what 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.959
 you think about this 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.760
 update that you would really like 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.770
 What will you change? 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.810
 applications are going to serve us something 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.510
 and do you think you would be missing 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.150
 apple add to this new system 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.550
 operative if you liked this video leave you 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.800
