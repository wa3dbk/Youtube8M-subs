00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.350
 desk sorry for the slowness d 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.200
 of the computer and why do you see those 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.200
 things that I recorded and that 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.229
 the artist xy pretty much this 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.920
 I think sometimes an extra week 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.090
 wait wait wait until this one 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.840
 it is known 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.850
 I'm fed up with this antivirus that 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.710
 of this release does not make us live 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.560
 this folder is going to be this 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.470
 rap file that weighs very little 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.950
 to extract here and in fact I managed to say 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:53.030
 which game will weigh a little 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.030
 [Music] 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.910
 for what I did so that I did not think 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.889
 so much the game 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.889
 [Music] 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.480
 I made it a little lighter 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.840
 lighter everything 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.890
 well once this folder is extracted that 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.890
 will navigate 2.5 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.620
 the rare can be extracted wherever they want 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:42.200
 and here is going to be this folder that goes to 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:46.660
 be the executant without icon 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.660
 here is the audio the folder with audio 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.180
 the audio configuration the fx reads 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.389
 It was 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.389
 [Music] 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:04.099
 well I tried this game it worked for me 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.730
 wonderful pity that when he recorded it goes 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:10.870
 super super too slow and I 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.870
 it is an error 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.819
 he did not try to record with too many things 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.819
 for example him 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.570
 here is the bean folder 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.260
 what does this bring 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.260
 nothing 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.669
 because it was not necessary to actually boil 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.990
 the good weighed too much and not worried 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.620
 because he 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.930
 I removed the wine and it worked super 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.569
 this configuration worked 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.179
 is the control configuration 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:50.300
 here are the controls I'm going to 

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:50.300
 teach 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.979
 the controls when you want to see 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:00.289
 is to know the controls of the game are going to 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.289
 have to go here to this folder 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:08.280
 and here is that xbox controls 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.850
 and this side is the one we 're going to use 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.850
 here 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.070
 it is correct super correct 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.120
 [Music] 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:27.419
 where are these arrows 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.950
 and they are hidden one of them was you can 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.410
 open the phone 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.390
 I do not think with what arrow but with the 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:41.170
 down already with a peace 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:41.170
 This joystick is Joystick 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.750
 presents here is by the controls 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:56.410
 down the X between the X 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:59.160
 the joystick control laws and that is 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.160
 the left 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.979
 of pause is this is that here is 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.780
 bach 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.090
 that is below 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:20.960
 the fact down right top left 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:23.249
 and here and the same is the same nothing more than 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.360
 now with the arrows on the keyboard 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:29.400
 this is the one that is the space 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.229
 this at the same time 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.229
 mouse and mouse 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:39.100
 we have good here is everything 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.860
 I did well was because I did not 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:46.710
 processed from iu or if they take it from him 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:48.169
 is to prove an error to you 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.999
 [Music] 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:51.390
 you could see the cut of the 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:53.790
 video 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.740
 and if they cut me too she does not want 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:07:00.090
 cut I hope it worked for them 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:03.409
 that they subscribe to Milan and share well 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:06.220

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.890
 worked that you liked the game 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.450
 the graphs that have the same 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:23.380
 graphs of big points 5 but for 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:26.740
 xbox 360 exactly the bad part of the game 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:29.409
 is that you can not play online 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:33.309
 I pro it better online and 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:37.110

00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:37.110
 session in xbox live 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.880
