first pinch tools I acquired about 20

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.010 
first pinch tools I acquired about 20
years<00:01:19.290> ago<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.820> used<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.479> numerous

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
occasions here in the past you put the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.440 
occasions here in the past you put the
hose<00:01:25.770> between<00:01:26.220> these<00:01:27.860> jaws<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.310> clamp<00:01:30.180> down

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
hose between these jaws and clamp down

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.990 
hose between these jaws and clamp down
tight<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.590> you're<00:01:31.799> fortunate<00:01:32.369> enough<00:01:32.579> you

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
tight and if you're fortunate enough you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.940 
tight and if you're fortunate enough you
can<00:01:33.180> get<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> but<00:01:33.689> look<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.049> I'm<00:01:34.229> bottoming<00:01:34.770> out

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
can get it but look at I'm bottoming out

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.190 
can get it but look at I'm bottoming out
down<00:01:35.280> here<00:01:35.640> before<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.180> even<00:01:36.479> completely

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
down here before it even completely

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.280 
down here before it even completely
pinches<00:01:37.799> off<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.159> hose<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.900> clamp

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
pinches off the hose so this clamp

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.260 
pinches off the hose so this clamp
worked<00:01:40.560> okay<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.400> never<00:01:41.729> completely

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
worked okay but it never completely

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.510 
worked okay but it never completely
stopped<00:01:42.780> every<00:01:43.350> last<00:01:43.560> drip<00:01:43.950> from<00:01:44.100> coming<00:01:44.430> out

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
stopped every last drip from coming out

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.030 
stopped every last drip from coming out
of<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.759> hose<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.750> also<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.229> little<00:01:46.380> clumsy<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
of the hose it's also a little clumsy to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.530 
of the hose it's also a little clumsy to
release<00:01:47.369> you've<00:01:47.610> got<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> get<00:01:47.939> your<00:01:48.119> hand<00:01:48.390> in

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
here and push on this lever to release

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.499 
here and push on this lever to release
the<00:01:51.840> clamp<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.790> that's<00:01:53.790> okay<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> workbench

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the clamp and that's okay on a workbench

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.270 
the clamp and that's okay on a workbench

an<00:01:56.369> engine<00:01:56.640> compartment<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.329> be<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
an engine compartment that can be a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.929 
an engine compartment that can be a
problem<00:01:57.860> then<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.890> moved<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.640> tool

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
problem then I moved on to this tool

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.030 
problem then I moved on to this tool
here<00:02:00.360> actually<00:02:01.049> ended<00:02:01.229> up<00:02:01.320> modifying<00:02:01.530> it

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
here actually ended up modifying it

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.580 
here actually ended up modifying it
putting<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.460> longer<00:02:02.880> jaws<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:04.049> tool<00:02:04.320> works

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
putting on longer jaws this tool works

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.340 
putting on longer jaws this tool works
great<00:02:04.890> for<00:02:05.130> smaller<00:02:05.670> hoses<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.930> get<00:02:07.170> on

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
great for smaller hoses so I can get on

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.559 
great for smaller hoses so I can get on
the<00:02:07.619> hose<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.129> do<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.390> kind

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
the hose like this do you have to kind

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.839 
the hose like this do you have to kind
of<00:02:09.629> work<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.379> then<00:02:11.069> squeeze<00:02:11.520> down<00:02:11.790> on

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
of work it in and then squeeze down on

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.430 
of work it in and then squeeze down on
it<00:02:12.090> now<00:02:12.180> this<00:02:12.330> one<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.780> really<00:02:12.989> squeeze

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
it now this one I can really squeeze

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.200 
it now this one I can really squeeze
these<00:02:13.530> on<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:14.010> get<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.310> completely<00:02:14.760> pinched

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
these on and get it completely pinched

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.120 
these on and get it completely pinched
off<00:02:15.390> but<00:02:15.930> note<00:02:16.110> I've<00:02:16.260> got<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.560> slide<00:02:16.890> this

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
off but note I've got to slide this

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.730 
off but note I've got to slide this
little<00:02:17.400> thing<00:02:17.730> up<00:02:17.850> there<00:02:18.060> oh<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:19.350> went<00:02:19.530> way

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
little thing up there oh it went way

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.650 
little thing up there oh it went way
past<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.250> serrations<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:20.970> even<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.420> one's

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
past the serrations so even that one's

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.840 
past the serrations so even that one's
not<00:02:21.870> not<00:02:22.620> going<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.010> hold<00:02:23.130> tightly<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.730> it

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
not not going to hold tightly and it

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.190 
not not going to hold tightly and it
could<00:02:24.030> slip<00:02:24.270> forward<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.810> release

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
could slip forward and release

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.130 
could slip forward and release
accidentally<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:27.180> had<00:02:27.480> limited<00:02:27.870> success

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
accidentally so I had limited success

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.290 
accidentally so I had limited success
with<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.560> then<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.430> found<00:02:29.730> one<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.060> bigger

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
with that then I found one of the bigger

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.890 
with that then I found one of the bigger
ones<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:32.580> have<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:32.970> release<00:02:33.300> mechanism

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
ones that have this release mechanism

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.200 
ones that have this release mechanism
and<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.320> too<00:02:34.650> also<00:02:35.370> created<00:02:35.790> problems

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
and that too also created problems

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.420 
and that too also created problems
because<00:02:36.660> sometimes<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.590> would<00:02:37.710> accidentally

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
because sometimes you would accidentally

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.660 
because sometimes you would accidentally
hit<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:39.090> lever<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:40.040> release<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.370> clap

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
hit this lever and release the clap

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.220 
hit this lever and release the clap
right<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.390> middle<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.660> job<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.080> can

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
right in the middle of job you can

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.290 
right in the middle of job you can
imagine<00:02:43.500> fuel<00:02:44.130> all<00:02:44.400> over<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.790> floor<00:02:45.060> or

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
imagine fuel all over the floor or

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.480 
imagine fuel all over the floor or
coolant<00:02:45.690> all<00:02:45.810> over<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.170> floor<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.220> wasn't

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
coolant all over the floor so I wasn't

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.480 
coolant all over the floor so I wasn't
very<00:02:47.700> happy<00:02:47.970> with<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.510> clamp<00:02:48.840> tool<00:02:49.080> either

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
very happy with that clamp tool either

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.120 
very happy with that clamp tool either
then<00:02:50.490> I<00:02:50.520> found<00:02:50.910> these<00:02:51.470> threaded<00:02:52.470> clamp<00:02:52.860> tools

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
then I found these threaded clamp tools

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.090 
then I found these threaded clamp tools
now<00:02:53.880> these<00:02:54.060> work<00:02:54.420> very<00:02:54.450> well<00:02:55.140> because<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.800> can

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
now these work very well because you can

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.870 
now these work very well because you can
put<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.120> hose<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:58.170> clamp<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.710> tighten

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
put the hose in the clamp and tighten

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.640 
put the hose in the clamp and tighten
this<00:02:59.880> down<00:02:59.940> until<00:03:00.930> it's<00:03:01.140> completely

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
this down until it's completely

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.360 
this down until it's completely
collapsed<00:03:02.460> and<00:03:03.380> totally<00:03:04.380> sealed<00:03:04.710> off<00:03:04.980> now

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
collapsed and totally sealed off now

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.060 
collapsed and totally sealed off now
that<00:03:05.730> cannot<00:03:06.180> be<00:03:06.240> released<00:03:06.780> accidentally<00:03:07.710> but

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
that cannot be released accidentally but

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.730 
that cannot be released accidentally but
it's<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.970> little<00:03:09.270> hard<00:03:09.540> using<00:03:09.900> these<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.500> tight

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
it's a little hard using these in tight

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.560 
it's a little hard using these in tight
places<00:03:10.950> imagine<00:03:11.730> trying<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.120> get<00:03:12.270> into<00:03:12.420> a

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
places imagine trying to get into a

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.060 
places imagine trying to get into a
tight<00:03:12.870> place<00:03:12.900> down<00:03:13.380> in<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.620> bottom<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:14.010> the

ago I discovered what I consider the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.590 
ago I discovered what I consider the
ultimate<00:03:36.170> hose<00:03:37.170> clamp<00:03:37.680> or<00:03:37.920> pinch<00:03:38.160> tool<00:03:38.600> this

one<00:04:02.550> of<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.760> only<00:04:02.910> clamps<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.660> found<00:04:04.260> that

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
one of the only clamps I found that

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.250 
one of the only clamps I found that
actually<00:04:04.890> can<00:04:05.400> prevent<00:04:05.820> all<00:04:06.120> drips<00:04:07.110> from

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
actually can prevent all drips from

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
on one end of the hose and then you're

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.260 
on one end of the hose and then you're
working<00:04:29.099> in<00:04:29.189> another<00:04:29.460> area<00:04:29.819> where<00:04:29.939> you<00:04:30.000> want

other side of the heater hose and that's

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.510 
other side of the heater hose and that's
going<00:05:19.169> to<00:05:19.259> prevent<00:05:19.529> coolant<00:05:20.009> loss<00:05:20.159> while<00:05:20.460> I

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
going to prevent coolant loss while I

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.059 
going to prevent coolant loss while I

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
one's very hard to get to and you can

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.790 
one's very hard to get to and you can
imagine<00:05:33.569> using<00:05:34.139> some<00:05:34.349> other<00:05:34.469> type<00:05:34.740> of
