00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.320
 In this case parried with these areas not always well with 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.420
 the most incredible credentials after this race they were in this 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.629
 relaxed other eyes see 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:16.960
 the heat of the dust 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.269
 the wear the material is the accidents all that lies in the rally 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.359
 Dakar heavy on the machines 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.439
 when the machine stops in the middle of the desert, of course, it is far and wide 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.230
 not to find a workshop with the right spare part around this again 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.469
 Sometimes you have to reach and repair the vehicle properly 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.469
 a lot of ingenuity have a few examples here 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.160
 you have turned over 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.100
 3 times 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.390
 With live bands, you can bring his body back on track 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.390
 not nice but effective 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.750
 even a bivouac the right spare part is not to be found you have with the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.750
 work 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.050
 Some real musicians serve to repair an exhaust pipe 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.660
 the Japanese sea are laid 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.640
 every fourth car in his own personal way 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.020
 So when they died over a clinic, the mosquitoes are the ones 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.390
 break through 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.900
 now we do not have to do anything the internet just in their favor 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.900
 do in the light of the Normans also do it in their own way 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.910
 that is for me 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.369
 long live the cheese 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:12.299
 he was 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.299
 Ulrich Gersau 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:19.429
 the 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.179
 is this common with you through the crisis? 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:28.379
 Germany, especially in France in Normandy, is repairing Germany 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.689
 it could be around 2 percent 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.749
 it always worked 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.170
 we look at all three points
