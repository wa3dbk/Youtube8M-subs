okay i'm going to come back whenever it
loads<00:00:55.130> the<00:00:55.309> terrain<00:00:55.910> so<00:00:56.510> far<00:00:57.460> bachelor<00:00:58.460> gaming

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
loads the terrain so far bachelor gaming

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.239 
loads the terrain so far bachelor gaming
i'm<00:00:58.879> back<00:00:59.059> on<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.930> terrain<00:01:00.290> loaded<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:03.249> the

i'm back on the terrain loaded and the

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:06.249 
i'm back on the terrain loaded and the
reason<00:01:04.670> this<00:01:04.819> is<00:01:05.149> really<00:01:05.449> good<00:01:05.749> is<00:01:06.020> because

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
reason this is really good is because

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.459 
reason this is really good is because
you<00:01:07.249> spawn<00:01:07.639> like<00:01:08.060> next<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.479> really<00:01:08.810> flat<00:01:09.079> area

you spawn like next to really flat area

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.919 
you spawn like next to really flat area
so<00:01:09.709> it's<00:01:09.859> really<00:01:10.039> good<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.670> there's<00:01:11.630> lots<00:01:11.780> of

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:11.929 
so it's really good and there's lots of

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:15.879 
so it's really good and there's lots of
trees<00:01:12.259> to<00:01:12.560> get<00:01:12.950> resources<00:01:13.840> if<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:15.619> want<00:01:15.829> to
