00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
year was a few factors kind of came into

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.970 
year was a few factors kind of came into
play<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:33.600> trust<00:01:33.840> me<00:01:34.050> remix<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.620> I<00:01:34.740> did

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
play like the trust me remix that I did

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.590 
play like the trust me remix that I did
was<00:01:35.820> huge

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
was huge

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.780 
was huge
it<00:01:36.930> still<00:01:37.260> is<00:01:37.409> huge<00:01:37.770> probably<00:01:38.370> the<00:01:38.580> biggest

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
it still is huge probably the biggest

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.390 
it still is huge probably the biggest
track<00:01:39.090> I've<00:01:39.270> done<00:01:39.480> I<00:01:39.750> would<00:01:39.960> say<00:01:40.400> that's

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
track I've done I would say that's

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.950 
track I've done I would say that's
definitely<00:01:41.610> helped<00:01:42.090> an<00:01:42.210> artist<00:01:42.510> I<00:01:42.659> think<00:01:42.840> it's

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
definitely helped an artist I think it's

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.750

many<00:02:06.250> artists<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:06.970> so<00:02:07.090> many<00:02:07.300> producers<00:02:08.670> DJ's

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
many artists and so many producers DJ's

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.440 
many artists and so many producers DJ's
that<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:10.570> know<00:02:10.720> at<00:02:10.929> some<00:02:11.110> point<00:02:11.380> it's<00:02:11.620> just

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
that you know at some point it's just

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.600 
that you know at some point it's just
stop<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.959> go<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.260> get<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.380> normal<00:02:15.040> job<00:02:15.160> and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
stop and go and get a normal job and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.550 
stop and go and get a normal job and
just<00:02:15.730> make<00:02:15.910> music<00:02:16.060> but<00:02:16.510> then<00:02:16.660> what<00:02:16.810> what<00:02:17.290> keeps

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
just make music but then what what keeps

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.199 
just make music but then what what keeps
you<00:02:17.740> just<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.040> go

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.940 

I<00:02:21.239> think<00:02:21.629> it's<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.840> sheer<00:02:22.080> determination<00:02:22.319> I

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
I think it's just sheer determination I

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.350 
I think it's just sheer determination I
think<00:02:23.129> you<00:02:23.220> start<00:02:23.489> with<00:02:23.519> anything<00:02:23.909> in<00:02:24.030> life<00:02:24.060> if

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
think you start with anything in life if

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.670 
think you start with anything in life if
there's<00:02:24.540> something<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.409> want

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
there's something that you really want

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.100 
there's something that you really want
to<00:02:25.739> do<00:02:26.030> then<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.239> have<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.450> just<00:02:27.659> go<00:02:27.810> for<00:02:28.080> it

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
to do then you have to just go for it

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.170 
to do then you have to just go for it
doing<00:02:28.890> something<00:02:29.220> else<00:02:29.370> feels<00:02:29.730> really<00:02:30.030> weird

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
doing something else feels really weird

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.899 
doing something else feels really weird
because<00:02:30.989> all<00:02:31.440> I've<00:02:32.129> ever<00:02:32.159> wanted<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.580> do<00:02:32.760> is

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
because all I've ever wanted to do is

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.490 
because all I've ever wanted to do is
make<00:02:32.940> music<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.540> play<00:02:33.690> music<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.349> be

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
make music and play music and just be
