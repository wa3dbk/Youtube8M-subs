00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.710 
through that verse one more time because
that's<00:05:14.280> how<00:05:14.430> it<00:05:14.550> ends<00:05:14.790> right<00:05:14.910> there<00:05:14.970> at<00:05:15.570> the

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
that's how it ends right there at the

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.160 
that's how it ends right there at the
end<00:05:15.840> Annette<00:05:16.110> G<00:05:17.150> so<00:05:18.150> I'm<00:05:18.480> sorry<00:05:18.780> I'll<00:05:18.990> play

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:46.100 

playing<00:05:26.780> it<00:05:26.930> slow

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.360 

now<00:05:47.110> I'll<00:05:47.320> play<00:05:47.500> through<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.830> whole<00:05:47.860> chorus

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370

00:05:48.370 --> 00:06:29.839 
now I'll play through the whole chorus
one<00:05:49.060> more<00:05:49.270> time<00:05:49.510> very<00:05:49.780> slow<00:05:50.290> for<00:05:50.560> you

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:33.300 

all<00:06:30.849> right<00:06:31.000> so<00:06:31.180> that's<00:06:31.300> it<00:06:31.740> the<00:06:32.740> only

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
all right so that's it the only

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.129 
all right so that's it the only
difference<00:06:33.639> is<00:06:33.970> the<00:06:34.300> ending

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:35.139 
difference is the ending

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:37.680 
difference is the ending
well<00:06:35.590> the<00:06:35.770> ending<00:06:36.099> actually<00:06:36.250> yeah<00:06:37.210> it<00:06:37.419> ends

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
well the ending actually yeah it ends

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.839 
well the ending actually yeah it ends
the<00:06:37.840> same<00:06:38.080> as<00:06:38.289> that<00:06:38.440> chorus<00:06:38.860> does<00:06:39.129> it<00:06:39.580> just

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849 
the same as that chorus does it just

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:42.450 
the same as that chorus does it just
repeats<00:06:40.270> that<00:06:40.509> little<00:06:40.780> G<00:06:40.990> lick<00:06:41.199> twice<00:06:41.530> so<00:06:42.159> it

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
repeats that little G lick twice so it

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.140 
repeats that little G lick twice so it
goes

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.460 

yeah<00:06:46.150> the<00:06:46.330> G<00:06:46.509> lick<00:06:46.690> right<00:06:46.900> here<00:06:47.110> that<00:06:49.409> that<00:06:50.409> I

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
yeah the G lick right here that that I

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.379 
yeah the G lick right here that that I
just<00:06:50.560> taught<00:06:50.889> you<00:06:51.099> it<00:06:51.310> does<00:06:51.490> that<00:06:51.669> twice<00:06:51.970> so<00:06:52.330> it

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:52.389 
just taught you it does that twice so it

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:54.969 
just taught you it does that twice so it
goes<00:06:52.509> like<00:06:52.599> this

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:54.979 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:59.600 

does<00:06:55.979> it<00:06:56.099> again

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.330 

and<00:06:59.699> then<00:07:00.449> it<00:07:00.689> ends<00:07:01.139> with<00:07:01.289> that<00:07:01.379> little<00:07:01.590> C<00:07:02.039> lick

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
and then it ends with that little C lick

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.540 
and then it ends with that little C lick
that<00:07:02.909> usually<00:07:03.300> happens<00:07:03.629> before<00:07:04.110> the<00:07:04.289> G<00:07:04.500> so<00:07:05.460> it

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
that usually happens before the G so it

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:11.909 
that usually happens before the G so it
ends<00:07:05.819> on<00:07:05.909> this

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:14.409 

so<00:07:12.919> that's<00:07:13.099> that's<00:07:13.610> how<00:07:13.729> it<00:07:13.819> ends<00:07:14.060> so<00:07:14.150> the<00:07:14.240> song

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:14.419 
so that's that's how it ends so the song

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:19.850 
so that's that's how it ends so the song
ends<00:07:14.780> like<00:07:14.930> this<00:07:17.110> G<00:07:18.110> lik

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 
ends like this G lik

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:26.860 
ends like this G lik
and<00:07:20.640> it<00:07:20.850> slowly<00:07:21.270> does<00:07:21.690> the<00:07:21.900> ceiling

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:26.870 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.629 

but<00:07:27.380> you<00:07:27.530> should<00:07:27.710> know<00:07:27.860> by<00:07:28.070> this<00:07:28.130> time<00:07:28.310> if

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 
but you should know by this time if

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.189 
but you should know by this time if
you've<00:07:28.760> made<00:07:28.940> it<00:07:29.000> all<00:07:29.240> the<00:07:29.360> way<00:07:29.389> the<00:07:29.900> end<00:07:30.110> of

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 
you've made it all the way the end of

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.530 
you've made it all the way the end of
this<00:07:30.320> tutorial
