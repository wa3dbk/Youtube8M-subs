00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.460
 they are going to see 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.290

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.689
 the information the Jaen species 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.480
 tennis 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:04.430
 that is group pig cave 5 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.640
 I imagine it is a group of reproducers 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.519
 was born on February 21, 2014 and 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.400
 feeds ricketts and rains 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:16.299
 crickets and rains cockroaches is 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.519
 tiny one is the size of a gecko 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.129
 leopard newborn now yes we are going to 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.889
 proceed to good here they have something is 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.719
 incredible I tell you it 's very small 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.790
 fact is I did not expect it so small and 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.989
 I think I'm going to change the house where 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.900
 I was going to put the art I'm going to show you 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.299
 where is where I was going to put it 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.239
 because it is very small it is the size 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.799
 of an old leopard newborn by 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.930
 here the video I will show you the house 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.120
 that you have prepared and well there is 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.970
 when I was going to have it is a box of 16 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.769
 quarters two hiding coconut fiber and 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.960
 these things but I do not know how to say in 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.780
 Spanish 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.180
 because they need moisture before 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.510
 these holes in back that's why 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.030
 has this substrate if it has no moisture 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.560
 high the gecko dies then why 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.330
 this substrate but I tell you I'm going to 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.500
 change for a smaller box and 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.450
 Now I'm going to show you how it is that 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.310
 it was ok and so good here is the 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.690
 little one in his new house like this is going to 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.200
 be pretty basic just one 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.200
 hiding place 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.700
 the terrarium with its coconut fiber and nothing 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.320
 more now I'm not going to offer it food 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.350
 until within three days these 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.820
 animals are pretty shy much more 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.470
 timid than the old ones like the 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.140
 that with which far from collaborate 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.760
 and I hope I do well with one 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.760
 will proceed to remove him from his house 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.510

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.899

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.899

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.720
