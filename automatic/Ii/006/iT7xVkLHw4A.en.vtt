00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.440
 well let's defend the car 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.799
 this is the pioneer radio learned 3 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:22.500
 This model has for 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:27.780
 cd dvd but it is not commercialized in Spain 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.780
 Only in the USA will it be bought 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.040
 the options that you have then at the beginning 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.550
 they are very basic has radio has 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.500
 ipod connection and for connection with with 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.690
 Pandora, which is not a service 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.739
 available in europe 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.079
 right now in the part of up radio 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.570
 appears 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.400
 Synchronizing synchronization to blue 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.430
 tubes and others 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.780
 but in a matter of 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:07.460
 nothing about a few seconds 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.960
 Well, we are going to have the active system 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.680
 I can see it I can see a little bit and 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.680
 what he is doing 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.110
 this one fails the same ba ba 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.930
 start already appears in the video that he 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.930
 the android system 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.090
 and in a few seconds he will be ready 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.330
 right now you can not touch 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.440
 but 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.980
 and you can already 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.420
 and we already have the whole 'android' system 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:51.820
 fully operational 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.820
 well apart from any 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.299
 any let's say audio we can 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:05.840
 put with any mp3 has after the 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.300
 spotify if you have wifi connection or what 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.319
 obviously, you can also 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.700
 put the gps that you want 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.900
 initially the radio sends you the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:23.930
 radio sends the coordinates 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:27.370
 gps via bluetooth to android stick ok the 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.370
 Android stick I have it in the glove compartment 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:35.040
 apart from all because she who comes 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.040
 as the child explained that he is here 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:42.630
 ok everything works on the radio can go out 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.630
 that the application 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.050
 come out and also 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.500
 worked had the reverse gear with him with 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.500
 the camera 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.870
 also on this radio 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.740
 I can change again to the way I can 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.760
 put the radio 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:09.140
 and simultaneously hear yourself regulate today should 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.990
 happen in any the android too 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.360
 because I can put you here to have a 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.240
 mix of sounds with audio bluetooth 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.190
 or with the radio 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.730
 then at first it can be 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.620
 and using it simultaneously could 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.640
 be using the radio at the same time you hear 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.840
 the instructions of the gps or the dvd or what 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.410
 what do you want 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.410
 plus 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.240
 have to be able to see at all times 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.780
 in motion of the car the rear camera 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.780
 or 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.250
 observing and 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.250
 apart from the configuration and all this 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.680
 is a basic a very basic video that 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.910
 I wanted you to see how it worked apart 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.830
 to have the I have my phone 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:11.100
 samsung galaxy s3 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.310
 also paired for the bluetooth of 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.890
 phone 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.829
 of any call my phone would come out 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.420
 and besides being in tic networks also 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.360
 by bluetooth connect 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.640
 at the end is to have a system a system 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.640
 'android' completely autonomous 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.710
 completely autonomous 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.900
 in a car device 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:41.639
 specifically my android tv device 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:53.169
 mk 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:53.169
