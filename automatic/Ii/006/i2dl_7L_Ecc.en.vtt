00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.440
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.009
 This theme is 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.870
 Here is knuckle serve 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.241
 If you want to introduce you to the tips to stop 

00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:15.259
 I think knuckle serve 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.180
 It's easy to float when you stop 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.660
 I receive such consultation quite well 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.570
 When knuckle comes even though you are actually watching the game 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.590
 I'm going to stop the stop 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.510
 I'm floating, I'm floating 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:40.550
 You can see that the third game is being attacked 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.810
 It's about what you're going to float 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.090
 Stop in the same way as when the lower rotation serve came 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.620
 Naturally going to the bottom of the ball 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.399
 I'll take it up and float up 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.160
 Because there are a lot of things so always turn down 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.420
 When stopping and when stopping knuckles 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.950
 The way of the stop is properly 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.970
 If you don't change it, you can stop it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.509
 Can't stop well 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.960
 Of course if you can stop the attack of the opponent 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.540
 You can prevent it and then you 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.369
 I say that I attack myself by not hitting it 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.909
 Because stopping is also very effective in order to attack 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.850
 I can always stop for knuckles 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.960
 Practice to not float 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.840
 I think you need it, so please try it 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.470
 Then stop that knuckle serve right away 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.859
 I would like to introduce you some tips for stopping 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.459
 First point is the first point is the first point 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:47.759
 The angle of the racket The angle of the racket is 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.740
 Please try to stand as much as possible 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.109
 It's difficult to stop if you stand vertically 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.759
 About 45 degrees diagonally or a little more than that 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.520
 It is a racket that makes you stand up quite as conscious 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.669
 Please take an angle by standing firmly 

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:08.520
 Take out the angle of the racket so as not to float 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.030
 It is said that it is possible to be held down from above 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.989
 It will be a very important point 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.129
 Next is the second point The second point is the hitting point 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.549
 The hitting point is just after bouncing fast anyway 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:29.420
 It is a feeling that this image is Tatantatan 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.680
 Because it is very easy to stop when you get this sound conscious 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.469
 Soon after this hitting point is called Tatatantan 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:41.299
 Please try to be conscious of catching 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.110
 The third point is the swing speed 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.280
 The swing speed is a bit double 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.129
 I have a way of thinking but I stop by myself 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.019
 Fast swing speed when you want to cut 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.829
 Make it fast and firmly 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.030
 If you just want to keep it short 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.010
 Because the swing speed does not have to be fast 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.879
 Just move it a little more 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.290
 Rather than speeding up the swing speed 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.329
 Anyway, I feel like I'm going to match the bats 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.849
 If you force the swing speed and make it faster 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.599
 Because it sometimes flies from the extrusion with the pan 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.500
 Swing speed when going off 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.870
 Match the ball well even when you want to speed up 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.260
 As an image, according to the bound 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.620
 It's like a racket coming in together 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.599
 I think it is easy to get it swing 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.629
 When going to the match, this falling point 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.590
 A racket is waiting ahead of you 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.560
 There's a ball coming in there 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.390
 It is easy to stop when you get it done by image 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.749
 Let's clean the knuckle serve 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:48.650
 Three points to stop quickly 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.730
 After the angle of the racket is the hitting point 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.639
 Hit point is just fast and swing speed is this 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.620
 It depends on whether you want to cut it or not 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.519
 The three points are the three points 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.161
 Please try to be conscious and try your partner 

00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:11.280
 Because I tried to stop for knuckle serve 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.019
 Please watch
