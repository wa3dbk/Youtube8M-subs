hi<00:00:00.719> everyone<00:00:01.050> come<00:00:01.439> here<00:00:01.770> and<00:00:01.979> today<00:00:02.129> we're

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hi everyone come here and today we're

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.919 
hi everyone come here and today we're
going<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.429> be<00:00:02.520> doing<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:02.760> game<00:00:02.970> review<00:00:03.330> of<00:00:03.510> boson

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
going to be doing a game review of boson

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.889 
going to be doing a game review of boson
X<00:00:04.170> so<00:00:04.650> this<00:00:05.609> is<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.879> platform<00:00:06.420> runner<00:00:06.629> game

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
X so this is a platform runner game

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.570 
X so this is a platform runner game
there<00:00:07.350> are<00:00:07.470> three<00:00:07.770> unique<00:00:08.010> characters<00:00:08.460> you

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
there are three unique characters you

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.570 
there are three unique characters you
got<00:00:08.700> neva<00:00:08.940> Eric<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.690> kero<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.590> usually<00:00:11.190> choose

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
got neva Eric and kero I usually choose

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.030 
got neva Eric and kero I usually choose
Eric<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.240> there<00:00:12.990> are<00:00:13.080> also<00:00:13.200> three<00:00:13.679> unique

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
Eric and there are also three unique

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.029 
Eric and there are also three unique
sort<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.820> stages<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.780> these<00:00:15.929> go<00:00:16.320> from<00:00:16.619> standard

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
sort of stages so these go from standard

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.920 
sort of stages so these go from standard
model<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.640> dark<00:00:17.910> energy<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.270> finally<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
model to dark energy and finally the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.920 
model to dark energy and finally the
antisymmetry<00:00:19.380> positron<00:00:20.189> accumulator<00:00:20.930> in

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
antisymmetry positron accumulator in

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.800 
antisymmetry positron accumulator in
each<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.410> these<00:00:22.470> stages<00:00:22.769> there<00:00:23.340> are<00:00:23.810> six

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
each of these stages there are six

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.740 
each of these stages there are six
unique<00:00:25.140> levels<00:00:25.670> which<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.820> will<00:00:26.939> see<00:00:26.970> here

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
unique levels which you will see here

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.359 
unique levels which you will see here
just<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.230> second<00:00:28.560> there<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:28.710> go<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.250> got<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
just a second there we go so you got the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.849 
just a second there we go so you got the

Gion excel or on radeon Gravitron
graviton<00:00:32.489> boson<00:00:33.120> why<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.960> expose<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.670> as

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
graviton boson why and expose on so as

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.420 
graviton boson why and expose on so as
you<00:00:35.969> go<00:00:36.120> from<00:00:36.329> gyan<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:37.020> expose<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.010> levels

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
you go from gyan to expose on the levels

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.130 
you go from gyan to expose on the levels
do<00:00:38.550> become<00:00:38.879> progressively<00:00:39.059> harder<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.960> let's

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
do become progressively harder so let's

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.799 
do become progressively harder so let's
go<00:00:40.260> ahead<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.410> jump<00:00:40.649> into<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.390> level<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.660> we

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
go ahead and jump into a level and we

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.150 
go ahead and jump into a level and we
will<00:00:42.930> see<00:00:43.170> some<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.680> strengths<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
will see some of the strengths and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.479 
will see some of the strengths and
weaknesses<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.300> game<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:47.129> let's<00:00:47.340> get<00:00:47.430> on

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
weaknesses of this game so let's get on

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.160 
weaknesses of this game so let's get on
to<00:00:47.760> these<00:00:47.910> strengths<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.510> weaknesses<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
to these strengths and weaknesses of the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.709 
to these strengths and weaknesses of the
game<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.059> strengths<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.660> that

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
game so one of the strengths is that

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.470 
game so one of the strengths is that
boson<00:00:52.649> X<00:00:52.800> varies<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.430> greatly<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.940> difficulty

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
boson X varies is greatly in difficulty

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.860 
boson X varies is greatly in difficulty
I<00:00:55.140> will<00:00:55.649> say<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> hard<00:00:56.370> game<00:00:56.629> this<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.719> one

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
I will say it is a hard game this is one

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.639 
I will say it is a hard game this is one
of<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> easier<00:00:58.320> levels<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.890> instance<00:00:59.250> but<00:01:00.120> as

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
of the easier levels for instance but as

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.990 
of the easier levels for instance but as
you<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:01.949> i'm<00:01:02.100> sort<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.399> breezing<00:01:02.789> through

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you can see i'm sort of breezing through

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
you can see i'm sort of breezing through
this<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:03.390> as<00:01:04.080> one<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> easier<00:01:04.710> levels<00:01:04.979> but

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
this one as one of the easier levels but

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.410 
this one as one of the easier levels but
you'll<00:01:05.220> see<00:01:05.369> coming<00:01:05.610> up<00:01:05.729> there<00:01:05.880> are<00:01:06.000> some

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
you'll see coming up there are some

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.880 
you'll see coming up there are some
levels<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.840> are<00:01:06.900> much<00:01:07.200> much<00:01:07.439> more<00:01:07.680> difficult

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
levels that are much much more difficult

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.899 
levels that are much much more difficult
so<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.939> one<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.180> its<00:01:09.299> major<00:01:09.510> strengths

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
so that is one of its major strengths

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.640 
so that is one of its major strengths
the<00:01:11.909> next<00:01:12.330> major<00:01:12.450> strength<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> game<00:01:13.380> is

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
the next major strength of the game is

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.950 
the next major strength of the game is
that<00:01:13.830> obstacles<00:01:14.430> are<00:01:14.640> introduced<00:01:15.119> slowly<00:01:15.509> so

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
that obstacles are introduced slowly so

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.410 
that obstacles are introduced slowly so
this<00:01:16.890> sort<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.430> demonstrates<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
this sort of demonstrates this as you

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.700 
this sort of demonstrates this as you
can<00:01:18.540> see<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.689> was<00:01:18.869> kind<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.049> surprised<00:01:19.439> there

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
can see I was kind of surprised there

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
can see I was kind of surprised there
because<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.460> little<00:01:20.729> actually<00:01:21.210> introduces

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
because this little actually introduces

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.200 
because this little actually introduces
the<00:01:21.869> concept<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.590> flashing<00:01:23.340> moving<00:01:23.610> platforms

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
the concept of flashing moving platforms

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.840 
the concept of flashing moving platforms
that<00:01:24.330> don't<00:01:24.689> move<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.340> see<00:01:26.490> some<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.670> them

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that don't move so you see some of them

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.340 
that don't move so you see some of them
move<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.180> some<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.420> them<00:01:27.509> don't<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.049> that's

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
move and some of them don't and that's

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.340 
move and some of them don't and that's
that's<00:01:28.710> new<00:01:29.070> at<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.430> point<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.850> game<00:01:30.350> so

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that's new at this point in the game so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.080 
that's new at this point in the game so
they<00:01:31.470> introduce<00:01:31.799> new<00:01:31.979> concepts<00:01:32.490> slowly<00:01:32.820> which

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
they introduce new concepts slowly which

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.719 
they introduce new concepts slowly which
is<00:01:33.210> really<00:01:33.420> great<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.650> sort<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.009> forces<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
is really great it sort of forces you to

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.179 
is really great it sort of forces you to
learn<00:01:36.030> new<00:01:36.299> behaviors<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.140> speaking<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.070> new

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
learn new behaviors and speaking of new

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.429 
learn new behaviors and speaking of new
learning<00:01:38.700> new<00:01:38.790> behaviors<00:01:39.259> actually<00:01:40.259> coming

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
learning new behaviors actually coming

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.819 
learning new behaviors actually coming
up<00:01:40.619> right<00:01:40.829> here<00:01:42.079> yeah<00:01:43.079> you'll<00:01:43.229> see<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.680> to

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
up right here yeah you'll see I have to

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.149 
up right here yeah you'll see I have to
actually<00:01:43.979> learn<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.970> behavior<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.740> you

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
actually learn a behavior here and you

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.969 
actually learn a behavior here and you
basically<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.670> trust<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.149> game<00:01:48.979> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
basically have to trust the game to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.950 
basically have to trust the game to
bring<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.610> moving<00:01:50.880> platform<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.570> underneath

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
bring a moving platform and underneath

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.620 
bring a moving platform and underneath
of<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.430> sort<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.460> pyramid-shaped<00:01:53.939> block

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
of that sort of pyramid-shaped block

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.780 
of that sort of pyramid-shaped block
there<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.829> you'll<00:01:55.950> see<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.219> again<00:01:56.280> coming<00:01:56.700> up

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
there so you'll see it again coming up

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.260 
there so you'll see it again coming up
here<00:01:57.000> one<00:01:57.149> now<00:01:57.299> one<00:01:57.630> time<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:57.930> believe

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
here one now one time I believe

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.709 
here one now one time I believe
let's<00:02:00.140> see<00:02:00.350> here<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:02.000> yeah<00:02:02.119> you're<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.450> blue

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
let's see here and yeah you're the blue

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.749 
let's see here and yeah you're the blue
the<00:02:02.990> blue<00:02:03.170> squares<00:02:03.439> the<00:02:04.039> blue<00:02:04.340> blocks<00:02:04.579> give

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
the blue squares the blue blocks give

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.650 
the blue squares the blue blocks give
you<00:02:04.909> energy<00:02:05.200> yeah<00:02:06.200> here<00:02:06.380> right<00:02:06.560> there<00:02:07.660> I'm

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
you energy yeah here right there I'm

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.229 
you energy yeah here right there I'm
dumbfounded<00:02:09.019> but<00:02:09.679> later<00:02:10.009> on<00:02:10.099> here<00:02:10.700> now<00:02:11.000> this

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
dumbfounded but later on here now this

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.330 
dumbfounded but later on here now this
is<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.420> little<00:02:11.569> bit<00:02:11.720> later<00:02:11.870> on<00:02:12.040> you'll<00:02:13.040> see<00:02:13.099> that

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
is a little bit later on you'll see that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.220 
is a little bit later on you'll see that
I've<00:02:13.459> actually<00:02:13.640> learned<00:02:14.120> how<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.540> handle<00:02:15.050> that

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
I've actually learned how to handle that

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.220 
I've actually learned how to handle that
so<00:02:15.530> right<00:02:15.709> here<00:02:15.739> you'll<00:02:16.730> see<00:02:16.840> yep<00:02:17.840> got<00:02:18.140> the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
so right here you'll see yep got the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.570 
so right here you'll see yep got the
platform<00:02:19.239> zag<00:02:20.239> to<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.510> left<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.370> we<00:02:22.370> keep

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
platform zag to the left and we keep

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.500 
platform zag to the left and we keep
going<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.840> here<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.200> again<00:02:24.260> boom<00:02:24.980> left<00:02:25.510> so

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
going and here it is again boom left so

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.759 
going and here it is again boom left so
that's<00:02:26.690> one<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.049> cool<00:02:27.170> things<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.650> can

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
that's one of the cool things you can

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.009 
that's one of the cool things you can
actually<00:02:28.299> learn<00:02:29.299> what<00:02:29.599> you<00:02:29.690> can<00:02:29.750> feel

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
actually learn what you can feel

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.720 
actually learn what you can feel
yourself<00:02:30.170> learning<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.890> level<00:02:31.190> better<00:02:31.400> over

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
yourself learning the level better over

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.400 
yourself learning the level better over
time<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.390> then<00:02:32.660> eventually<00:02:32.750> as<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.230> see

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
time and then eventually as you see

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.130 
time and then eventually as you see
there<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.829> break<00:02:34.190> through<00:02:34.599> finish<00:02:35.599> the<00:02:35.870> level

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
there you break through finish the level

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.500 
there you break through finish the level
and<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.709> discover<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.220> particle<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.360> is

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
and you discover the particle so that is

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.110 
and you discover the particle so that is
really<00:02:38.540> cool<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:40.190> next<00:02:40.430> great<00:02:40.610> strength<00:02:40.940> this

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
really cool the next great strength this

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.630 
really cool the next great strength this
game<00:02:41.360> is<00:02:41.599> the<00:02:41.720> art<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.500> you'll<00:02:42.799> see<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.190> RT<00:02:43.610> r

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
game is the art so you'll see the RT r

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.890 
game is the art so you'll see the RT r
makes<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.120> sort<00:02:44.360> of<00:02:44.390> feel<00:02:44.540> like<00:02:44.599> you're

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
makes you sort of feel like you're

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.259 
makes you sort of feel like you're
running<00:02:45.019> down<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.739> tube<00:02:46.610> in<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.940> particle

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
running down the tube in a particle

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.050 
running down the tube in a particle
accelerator<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:49.010> is<00:02:49.190> intended<00:02:49.579> by<00:02:50.030> the

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
accelerator and that is intended by the

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.580 
accelerator and that is intended by the
developers<00:02:50.569> since<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.959> particle<00:02:51.200> physics

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
developers since is a particle physics

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.800 
developers since is a particle physics
game<00:02:51.829> and<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.849> works<00:02:53.030> together<00:02:53.269> quite<00:02:53.780> well

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
game and it works together quite well

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.470 
game and it works together quite well
with<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.230> music<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.709> feel<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.640> produce<00:02:56.090> a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
with the music I feel to produce a

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.720 
with the music I feel to produce a
unique<00:02:56.560> experience<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.980> you'll<00:02:58.430> see<00:02:58.549> there's

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
unique experience and you'll see there's

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.729 
unique experience and you'll see there's
some<00:02:58.790> variations<00:02:59.360> on<00:02:59.540> this<00:02:59.720> design<00:03:00.140> or<00:03:00.590> that

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
some variations on this design or that

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.819 
some variations on this design or that
design<00:03:01.040> here<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.959> like<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:03.049> said<00:03:03.110> there<00:03:03.410> is<00:03:03.560> a

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
design here and like I said there is a

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.129 
design here and like I said there is a
lot<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.040> variation<00:03:04.609> in<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.810> only<00:03:05.989> thing

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
lot of variation in this the only thing

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.569 
lot of variation in this the only thing
I<00:03:06.230> don't<00:03:06.290> really<00:03:06.590> like<00:03:06.709> too<00:03:07.100> much<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.549> that

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
I don't really like too much is that

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:08.890 
I don't really like too much is that
there<00:03:07.819> are<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:07.910> lot<00:03:08.030> of<00:03:08.060> flashing<00:03:08.540> lights<00:03:08.569> at

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
there are a lot of flashing lights at

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.140 
there are a lot of flashing lights at
some<00:03:09.049> points<00:03:09.410> but<00:03:09.700> still<00:03:10.700> everything<00:03:10.910> works

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
some points but still everything works

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.289 
some points but still everything works
together<00:03:11.329> to<00:03:11.750> make<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.230> good<00:03:12.470> experience<00:03:12.859> and

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
together to make a good experience and

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.699 
together to make a good experience and
then<00:03:14.299> finally<00:03:14.510> here<00:03:14.959> I'll<00:03:15.109> just<00:03:15.500> show<00:03:15.680> you

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
then finally here I'll just show you

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.309 
then finally here I'll just show you
this<00:03:15.859> last<00:03:16.160> clip<00:03:16.489> here<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:17.450> is<00:03:17.600> another<00:03:17.810> sort

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
this last clip here this is another sort

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.190 
this last clip here this is another sort
of<00:03:18.440> variation<00:03:18.950> as<00:03:19.100> well<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:20.329> yeah<00:03:20.989> basically

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
of variation as well and yeah basically

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.240 
of variation as well and yeah basically
this<00:03:21.620> sort<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.040> shows<00:03:23.590> yeah<00:03:24.590> basically<00:03:24.829> what

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
this sort of shows yeah basically what

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.270 
this sort of shows yeah basically what
is<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.880> possible<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.410> then<00:03:27.560> also<00:03:27.739> here<00:03:28.099> at<00:03:28.160> the

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
is is possible and then also here at the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.190 
is is possible and then also here at the
end<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.700> believe<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.269> break<00:03:29.599> through<00:03:29.870> here<00:03:30.079> and

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
end I believe I break through here and

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.920 
end I believe I break through here and
beat<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:30.950> level<00:03:31.190> yeah<00:03:31.310> there<00:03:31.459> we<00:03:31.519> go<00:03:31.630> so<00:03:32.630> yeah

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
beat the level yeah there we go so yeah

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.080 
beat the level yeah there we go so yeah
there's<00:03:33.380> also<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.709> cool<00:03:33.950> little<00:03:34.099> like<00:03:34.340> bonus

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
there's also a cool little like bonus

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.140 
there's also a cool little like bonus
you<00:03:35.209> get<00:03:35.389> at<00:03:35.599> the<00:03:35.720> end<00:03:36.280> which<00:03:37.280> is<00:03:37.519> really<00:03:37.940> cool

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
you get at the end which is really cool

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.970 
you get at the end which is really cool
it<00:03:38.299> just<00:03:38.690> basically<00:03:38.870> changes<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.799> color

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
it just basically changes the color

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.740 
it just basically changes the color
scheme<00:03:40.160> little<00:03:40.579> bits<00:03:40.760> gives<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.599> a<00:03:41.630> little

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
scheme little bits gives you a little

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.930 
scheme little bits gives you a little
reward<00:03:42.200> for<00:03:42.290> beating<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.739> level<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.220> you<00:03:43.819> can

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
reward for beating a level and you can

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.670 
reward for beating a level and you can
continue<00:03:44.120> on<00:03:44.419> and<00:03:44.720> compete<00:03:45.139> against<00:03:45.380> others

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
continue on and compete against others

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.890 
continue on and compete against others
in<00:03:45.919> like<00:03:46.069> a<00:03:46.099> global<00:03:46.609> leader<00:03:47.000> board<00:03:47.329> that<00:03:47.810> is

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
in like a global leader board that is

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.900 
in like a global leader board that is
built<00:03:48.109> into<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.470> game<00:03:48.650> which<00:03:49.549> i<00:03:49.669> think<00:03:49.730> is

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
built into the game which i think is

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.680 
built into the game which i think is
really<00:03:50.150> cool<00:03:50.650> so<00:03:51.849> yeah<00:03:52.849> that<00:03:53.120> is<00:03:53.299> about<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.569> for

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
really cool so yeah that is about it for

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.890 
really cool so yeah that is about it for
boson<00:03:54.169> X<00:03:54.380> I<00:03:55.040> really<00:03:55.790> like<00:03:55.940> this<00:03:56.150> game<00:03:56.359> it<00:03:56.630> has<00:03:56.660> a

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
boson X I really like this game it has a

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.640 
boson X I really like this game it has a
really<00:03:57.169> cool<00:03:57.410> like<00:03:57.590> particle<00:03:58.040> physics<00:03:58.400> theme

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
really cool like particle physics theme

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.229 
really cool like particle physics theme
and<00:04:00.099> everything<00:04:00.489> sort<00:04:00.760> of<00:04:00.819> ties<00:04:01.000> together

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
and everything sort of ties together

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.500 
and everything sort of ties together
really<00:04:02.019> really<00:04:02.140> well<00:04:02.670> so<00:04:03.670> for<00:04:03.939> I<00:04:04.000> think<00:04:04.120> three

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
really really well so for I think three

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.910 
really really well so for I think three
dollars<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:05.049> think<00:04:05.230> this<00:04:05.349> is<00:04:05.470> a<00:04:05.500> great<00:04:05.739> game

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
dollars I think this is a great game

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.649 
dollars I think this is a great game
yeah<00:04:06.189> you'll<00:04:06.370> see<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:06.700> end<00:04:06.849> display<00:04:07.269> here<00:04:07.510> is

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
yeah you'll see the end display here is

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.699 
yeah you'll see the end display here is
fantastic<00:04:08.340> with<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.519> particle<00:04:10.470> spread<00:04:11.470> and

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
fantastic with the particle spread and

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.429 
fantastic with the particle spread and
yet<00:04:12.220> it<00:04:12.549> sort<00:04:13.180> of<00:04:13.239> graphs<00:04:13.480> your<00:04:13.689> progress<00:04:14.079> and

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 
yet it sort of graphs your progress and

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.170 
yet it sort of graphs your progress and
then<00:04:14.590> shows<00:04:14.980> your<00:04:15.159> rank<00:04:15.610> on<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.790> leaderboard

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
then shows your rank on the leaderboard

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.670 
then shows your rank on the leaderboard
this<00:04:16.269> is<00:04:16.389> the<00:04:17.070> 162nd<00:04:18.070> best<00:04:18.250> run<00:04:18.489> ever<00:04:19.530> on<00:04:20.530> this

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
this is the 162nd best run ever on this

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.950 
this is the 162nd best run ever on this
