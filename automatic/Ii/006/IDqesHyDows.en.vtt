that it was going to die anyway so the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.819 
that it was going to die anyway so the
whole<00:01:53.670> targeting<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.720> dying<00:01:55.170> effect<00:01:55.530> isn't

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
whole targeting and a dying effect isn't

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.889 
whole targeting and a dying effect isn't
really<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.250> bad<00:01:56.390> being<00:01:57.390> taken<00:01:57.780> from

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
that I think might be a bit antiquated

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.290 
that I think might be a bit antiquated
but<00:06:39.380> should<00:06:39.740> be<00:06:39.770> you<00:06:40.100> know<00:06:40.130> it's<00:06:40.910> worth<00:06:41.150> a

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
but should be you know it's worth a

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.380
