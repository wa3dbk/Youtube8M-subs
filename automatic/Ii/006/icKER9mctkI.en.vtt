00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.490 
asphalt in the road in fact the asphalt
are<00:02:48.250> quite<00:02:48.400> similar<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:49.629> it's<00:02:49.900> passing<00:02:50.349> that

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
are quite similar and it's passing that

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.470 
are quite similar and it's passing that
heat<00:02:50.709> through<00:02:50.920> into<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.340> attic<00:02:51.640> space<00:02:51.670> so

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
heat through into the attic space so

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.930 
heat through into the attic space so
let's<00:02:52.900> say<00:02:53.019> on<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.200> 95<00:02:53.620> degree<00:02:53.650> day<00:02:54.549> here<00:02:54.819> in

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
let's say on a 95 degree day here in

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.640 
let's say on a 95 degree day here in
Florida<00:02:55.420> those<00:02:55.989> shingles<00:02:56.260> are<00:02:56.470> going<00:02:56.590> to

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
Florida those shingles are going to

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.259 
Florida those shingles are going to

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
reach temperatures even a white shingle

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.270 
reach temperatures even a white shingle
is<00:02:58.420> going<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.720> get<00:02:58.840> somewhere<00:02:59.109> between<00:02:59.319> 155

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280

maintenance so a couple of things there
that<00:03:39.130> can<00:03:39.519> be<00:03:39.609> beneficial<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.480> also<00:03:40.690> you

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
that can be beneficial to you also you

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.830 
that can be beneficial to you also you
won't<00:03:41.769> be<00:03:41.919> replacing<00:03:42.489> that<00:03:42.609> system

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
won't be replacing that system

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.170 
won't be replacing that system
17<00:03:45.620> to<00:03:45.800> 20<00:03:46.100> years<00:03:46.310> like<00:03:46.580> you<00:03:46.760> would<00:03:46.940> with<00:03:47.090> an

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
17 to 20 years like you would with an

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.210 
17 to 20 years like you would with an
asphalt<00:03:47.330> system<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.320> I<00:03:48.350> think<00:03:48.470> it's<00:03:48.710> important

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
asphalt system so I think it's important

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.520 
asphalt system so I think it's important
to<00:03:49.340> consider<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:50.090> metal<00:03:50.720> roof<00:03:50.870> system<00:03:51.320> as<00:03:51.470> a

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
to consider a metal roof system as a

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.010 
to consider a metal roof system as a
long-term<00:03:52.280> value<00:03:52.970> solution<00:03:53.510> something<00:03:53.900> that

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
long-term value solution something that

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.260 
long-term value solution something that
pays<00:03:54.200> you<00:03:54.410> back<00:03:54.440> over<00:03:54.830> time<00:03:55.130> rather<00:03:55.820> than<00:03:56.120> an

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
pays you back over time rather than an

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.580 
pays you back over time rather than an
expense<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.900> you're<00:03:57.020> not<00:03:57.140> going<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.350> recoup

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
expense that you're not going to recoup

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.380 
expense that you're not going to recoup
anything<00:03:57.980> from<00:03:58.160> okay<00:03:58.700> I<00:03:58.730> hope<00:03:58.940> that<00:03:59.120> helps

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
anything from okay I hope that helps

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.720 
anything from okay I hope that helps
thank<00:03:59.630> you
