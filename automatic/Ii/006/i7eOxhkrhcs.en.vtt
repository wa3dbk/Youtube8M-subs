questions just comment those down but I

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.050 
questions just comment those down but I
think<00:02:33.410> it's<00:02:33.530> just<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.890> vers<00:02:34.160> versus<00:02:34.940> and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
think it's just the vers versus and

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.300 
think it's just the vers versus and
precursor<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.570> play<00:02:35.769> all<00:02:36.769> this<00:02:36.920> goes<00:02:37.070> in<00:02:37.190> one

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
precursor and play all this goes in one

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.400 
precursor and play all this goes in one
line<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:37.700> then<00:02:37.850> for<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.540> course<00:02:39.140> room<00:02:39.230> and

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
line and then for the course room and

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.040 
line and then for the course room and
play<00:02:39.560> always<00:02:40.220> call<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.519> chords<00:02:41.090> over<00:02:41.840> two

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
play always call it chords over two

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.229 
play always call it chords over two
lines<00:02:42.310> but<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.400> line<00:02:43.550> is<00:02:43.580> quite<00:02:43.850> short<00:02:44.030> for

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
lines but the line is quite short for

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.910 
lines but the line is quite short for
the<00:02:44.330> chorus<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:44.810> I'm<00:02:45.230> guessing<00:02:45.410> that's<00:02:45.650> why

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
the chorus so I'm guessing that's why

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.729 
the chorus so I'm guessing that's why
that's<00:02:46.730> what's<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.420> difference<00:02:47.750> there<00:02:48.050> so

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
that's what's the difference there so

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.380 
that's what's the difference there so
