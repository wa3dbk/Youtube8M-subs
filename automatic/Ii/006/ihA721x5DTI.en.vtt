I<00:05:30.110> didn't<00:05:30.470> have<00:05:30.650> I<00:05:30.889> didn't<00:05:31.280> actually<00:05:31.400> have<00:05:31.700> one

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
I didn't have I didn't actually have one

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.870 
I didn't have I didn't actually have one
of<00:05:32.090> them<00:05:32.270> so<00:05:32.630> I<00:05:32.930> just<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.340> head<00:05:34.550> isn't

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
of them so I just so the head isn't

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.620 
of them so I just so the head isn't
actually<00:05:35.180> Tyson<00:05:35.630> Kidd<00:05:35.870> he's<00:05:36.860> Randy<00:05:37.370> Orton<00:05:38.000> so

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
actually Tyson Kidd he's Randy Orton so

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.780 
actually Tyson Kidd he's Randy Orton so
it<00:05:38.750> doesn't<00:05:39.020> really<00:05:39.139> aren't<00:05:39.830> old<00:05:40.070> Randy<00:05:40.490> Orton

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
it doesn't really aren't old Randy Orton

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.820 
it doesn't really aren't old Randy Orton
so<00:05:40.970> it<00:05:41.030> doesn't<00:05:41.300> really<00:05:41.360> look<00:05:41.690> like<00:05:41.750> him<00:05:42.260> but<00:05:42.590> I

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
so it doesn't really look like him but I

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.190 
so it doesn't really look like him but I
used<00:05:43.580> some<00:05:43.940> clay<00:05:44.240> for<00:05:44.570> the<00:05:44.660> head<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:44.840> then

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
used some clay for the head and then

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.980
