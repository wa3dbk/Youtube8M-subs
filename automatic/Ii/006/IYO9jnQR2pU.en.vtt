this<00:00:00.840> is<00:00:01.020> 80s<00:00:01.500> car<00:00:01.770> guy<00:00:01.949> I'm<00:00:02.429> replacing<00:00:02.730> rear

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
this is 80s car guy I'm replacing rear

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.380 
this is 80s car guy I'm replacing rear
sway<00:00:04.049> bar<00:00:04.290> link<00:00:04.560> on<00:00:04.770> my<00:00:04.830> 2000<00:00:05.759> focus

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
sway bar link on my 2000 focus

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.730 
sway bar link on my 2000 focus
I<00:00:06.420> already<00:00:07.410> replaced<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.220> other<00:00:08.340> side<00:00:08.670> it<00:00:09.360> was

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
I already replaced the other side it was

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.140 
I already replaced the other side it was
so<00:00:10.740> rusty<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.540> snapped<00:00:12.540> off<00:00:12.809> while<00:00:13.590> driving

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
so rusty it snapped off while driving

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.470 
so rusty it snapped off while driving
but<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:16.310> expected<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.490> side<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:18.000> just<00:00:18.180> snap

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
but I expected this side to just snap

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.510 
but I expected this side to just snap
off<00:00:18.690> as<00:00:18.900> well<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.410> actually<00:00:19.949> unscrewing

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
off as well that is actually unscrewing

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.980 
off as well that is actually unscrewing
alloy<00:00:21.529> so<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:23.490> just<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.939> wrench<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.779> top

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
alloy so it's just a wrench on the top

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.750 
alloy so it's just a wrench on the top
and<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> bolt<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.740> they're<00:00:28.740> both<00:00:28.920> thirteen

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
and the a bolt is they're both thirteen

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.920 
and the a bolt is they're both thirteen
millimeter<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:31.520> did<00:00:32.520> only<00:00:32.820> get<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.300> far<00:00:33.600> with<00:00:33.870> it

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
millimeter I did only get so far with it

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.850 
millimeter I did only get so far with it
until<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.620> did<00:00:34.860> finally<00:00:35.340> snap<00:00:35.670> off<00:00:36.380> switch<00:00:37.380> in

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
until it did finally snap off switch in

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.119 
until it did finally snap off switch in
this<00:00:38.040> case<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.640> totally<00:00:39.120> fine<00:00:39.690> by<00:00:39.870> me<00:00:40.070> so<00:00:41.070> it

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
this case it's totally fine by me so it

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.840 
this case it's totally fine by me so it
just<00:00:41.309> gets<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.700> rest<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.989> out<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.200> there<00:00:43.469> so

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
just gets a rest of it out of there so

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.900 
just gets a rest of it out of there so
the<00:00:44.850> top<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:45.870> pulled<00:00:46.140> out<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.579> rest<00:00:47.730> of

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the top just pulled out but the rest of

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.459 
the top just pulled out but the rest of
it's<00:00:48.059> sandwiched<00:00:48.390> between<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.930> sway<00:00:49.230> bar<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
it's sandwiched between a sway bar and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:59.810 
it's sandwiched between a sway bar and
the<00:00:49.680> control<00:00:50.070> arm<00:00:53.059> control<00:00:54.059> arm<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:58.820> that

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the control arm control arm and that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:09.760 
the control arm control arm and that
will<00:01:00.000> give<00:01:00.149> enough<00:01:00.390> extra<00:01:00.750> space<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:06.140> get<00:01:07.140> this

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.330 

put<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.400> way<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:13.950> let's

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
put that out of the way and then let's

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.780 
put that out of the way and then let's
just<00:01:14.850> put<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> new<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.159> eight

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
just put the new one in this was eight

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.490 
just put the new one in this was eight
dollars<00:01:18.030> at<00:01:18.450> autozone<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.710> goes<00:01:19.890> in

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
dollars at autozone and it goes in

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.940 
dollars at autozone and it goes in
basically<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.860> uh<00:01:24.110> in<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.290> order<00:01:25.770> with

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
basically it in uh in this order with

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.370 
basically it in uh in this order with
the<00:01:26.130> sway<00:01:26.729> bar<00:01:26.970> sandwich<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the sway bar sandwich there and you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.350 
the sway bar sandwich there and you
control<00:01:31.890> iron<00:01:33.409> between<00:01:34.409> those<00:01:34.619> two<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:36.210> then

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
control iron between those two and then

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.130 
control iron between those two and then
nut<00:01:37.320> up<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.680> top<00:01:38.329> so<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:39.750> everything

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
through there it's not quite enough

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.139 
through there it's not quite enough
thread<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:45.560> put<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.680> nut<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:46.860> top<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.850> so

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
jack down and doing that gave me just

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.260 
jack down and doing that gave me just
enough<00:02:00.689> room<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.049> get<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.710> nut<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
enough room to get the nut on so the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.270 
enough room to get the nut on so the
new<00:02:04.930> one<00:02:05.140> is<00:02:05.350> both<00:02:05.729> 14<00:02:06.729> millimeters<00:02:07.270> just

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
new one is both 14 millimeters just

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.449 
new one is both 14 millimeters just
cranking<00:02:09.280> them<00:02:09.459> zoom<00:02:10.119> down<00:02:10.330> tight<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:11.459> that
