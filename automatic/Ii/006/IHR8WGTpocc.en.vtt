cups<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.409> I'm<00:01:49.619> using<00:01:49.889> and<00:01:50.279> I'm<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:50.909> pouring

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
cups like I'm using and I'm just pouring

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.749 
cups like I'm using and I'm just pouring
them<00:01:51.389> in<00:01:51.539> there<00:01:51.749> and<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.469> recipe<00:01:52.859> I<00:01:52.889> had<00:01:53.310> only

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
them in there and the recipe I had only

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.090 
them in there and the recipe I had only
had<00:01:53.939> enough<00:01:54.209> for<00:01:54.569> about<00:01:54.869> one<00:01:55.469> and<00:01:55.499> a<00:01:55.709> half<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
had enough for about one and a half of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.919 
had enough for about one and a half of
these<00:01:56.279> cups<00:01:56.639> so<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.179> had<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.389> do<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.600> over<00:01:57.749> again

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
these cups so I had to do it over again

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.039 
these cups so I had to do it over again
so<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.649> could<00:01:58.770> fill<00:01:59.069> up<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> other<00:01:59.429> cups<00:01:59.929> then<00:02:00.929> I

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
so I could fill up the other cups then I

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.080 
so I could fill up the other cups then I
just<00:02:01.259> put<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.590> popsicle<00:02:02.249> stick<00:02:02.279> in<00:02:02.700> each<00:02:02.819> one

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
just put a popsicle stick in each one

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.969 
just put a popsicle stick in each one
and<00:02:03.299> rest<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.599> up<00:02:03.749> against<00:02:04.229> another<00:02:04.349> popsicle

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
and rest it up against another popsicle

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.289 
and rest it up against another popsicle
stick<00:02:05.249> so<00:02:05.459> it<00:02:05.520> wouldn't<00:02:05.700> lean<00:02:06.029> to<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> side

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
stick so it wouldn't lean to the side

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.180 
stick so it wouldn't lean to the side
and<00:02:06.779> then<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.259> put<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.590> into<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> freezer

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
and then I just put it into the freezer

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.210 
and then I just put it into the freezer
and<00:02:08.340> left<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.149> overnight<00:02:10.039> so<00:02:11.039> that's

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
and left in there overnight so that's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.740 
and left in there overnight so that's
what<00:02:11.340> they<00:02:11.459> looked<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:11.760> when<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.150> took<00:02:12.270> them

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
what they looked like when I took them

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.350 
what they looked like when I took them
out<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.140> they<00:02:13.350> are<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.920> good<00:02:14.460> but<00:02:15.000> they<00:02:15.090> melt

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
out and they are so good but they melt

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.760 
out and they are so good but they melt

of<00:02:20.790> frozen<00:02:21.060> s'mores<00:02:21.840> I'm<00:02:22.320> just<00:02:22.710> going<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.980> be

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
of frozen s'mores I'm just going to be

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.930 
of frozen s'mores I'm just going to be
lining<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.060> pan<00:02:24.360> with<00:02:24.840> some<00:02:25.310> tinfoil<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.670> then

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
lining a pan with some tinfoil and then

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.400 
lining a pan with some tinfoil and then
I'm<00:02:27.120> just<00:02:27.270> going<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.570> grab<00:02:27.720> some<00:02:28.110> graham

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
I'm just going to grab some graham

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.010 
I'm just going to grab some graham
crackers<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:29.370> break<00:02:29.940> them<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.300> fourths

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
crackers and break them in fourths

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.140 
crackers and break them in fourths
then<00:02:31.560> I'm<00:02:31.710> just<00:02:31.890> going<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.160> line<00:02:32.430> them<00:02:32.700> on<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
then I'm just going to line them on the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.390 
then I'm just going to line them on the
pan<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:34.230> figured<00:02:34.500> out<00:02:34.620> later<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.160> may

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
pan and I figured out later that I may

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.220 
pan and I figured out later that I may
have<00:02:35.490> been<00:02:35.670> better<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.000> break<00:02:36.330> them<00:02:36.510> into<00:02:36.720> like

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
have been better to break them into like

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.040 
have been better to break them into like
halves<00:02:37.500> instead<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.520> fourths<00:02:38.910> because<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
halves instead of fourths because the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.000 
halves instead of fourths because the
marshmallows<00:02:40.620> kind<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.370> overflowed<00:02:42.980> then<00:02:43.980> I

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
marshmallows kind of overflowed then I

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.770 
marshmallows kind of overflowed then I
just<00:02:44.340> added<00:02:44.520> some<00:02:44.700> marshmallows<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.570> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
just added some marshmallows and the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.600 
just added some marshmallows and the
instructions<00:02:46.350> said<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.590> add<00:02:46.860> two<00:02:47.190> but<00:02:47.550> I

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
instructions said to add two but I

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.920 
instructions said to add two but I
thought<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.910> was<00:02:48.000> kind<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.210> a<00:02:48.300> lot<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:48.720> some

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
thought that was kind of a lot so some

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.510 
thought that was kind of a lot so some
of<00:02:48.960> them<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.200> put<00:02:49.230> one<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.830> someone<00:02:50.070> put<00:02:50.310> two

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
of them I put one and someone put two

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.400 
of them I put one and someone put two
and<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:51.180> figured<00:02:51.450> out<00:02:51.540> later<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.200> may<00:02:52.320> have

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
and I figured out later that it may have

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.930 
and I figured out later that it may have
been<00:02:52.440> better<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.800> put<00:02:53.130> them<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.640> side

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
been better to put them on the side

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.290 
been better to put them on the side
instead<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.540> straight<00:02:54.810> up<00:02:55.670> after<00:02:56.670> preheating

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
instead of straight up after preheating

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.670 
instead of straight up after preheating
the<00:02:57.330> broiler<00:02:57.990> in<00:02:58.170> my<00:02:58.290> oven

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
the broiler in my oven

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.250 
the broiler in my oven
I<00:02:58.860> put<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.340> tray<00:02:59.610> in<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:00.720> checked<00:03:00.990> on<00:03:01.140> it

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
I put the tray in and I checked on it

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.900 
I put the tray in and I checked on it
about<00:03:01.560> every<00:03:01.860> one<00:03:02.070> minute<00:03:02.280> but<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.730> probably

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
about every one minute but it probably

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.840 
about every one minute but it probably
took<00:03:03.360> about<00:03:03.420> five<00:03:03.930> minutes<00:03:04.170> for<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:05.040> turn<00:03:05.640> a

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
took about five minutes for it to turn a

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.660 
took about five minutes for it to turn a
golden<00:03:06.210> brown<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:07.590> now<00:03:07.740> I'm<00:03:07.890> taking<00:03:08.160> maybe

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
golden brown so now I'm taking maybe

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.940 
golden brown so now I'm taking maybe
about<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.210> cup<00:03:09.570> of<00:03:09.840> chocolate<00:03:10.230> chips<00:03:10.470> and

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
about a cup of chocolate chips and

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.650 
about a cup of chocolate chips and
putting<00:03:11.220> them<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.520> a<00:03:11.610> microwave-safe<00:03:12.060> bowl

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
putting them in a microwave-safe bowl

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.000 
putting them in a microwave-safe bowl
and<00:03:12.900> then<00:03:13.380> I'm<00:03:13.440> just<00:03:13.500> going<00:03:13.770> to<00:03:13.830> be

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
and then I'm just going to be

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.250 
and then I'm just going to be
microwaving<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.820> in<00:03:14.970> about<00:03:15.270> 25<00:03:15.780> second

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
microwaving it in about 25 second

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.800 
microwaving it in about 25 second
increments<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.850> did<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.150> about<00:03:18.510> two

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
increments and I did that about two

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.900 
increments and I did that about two
times<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.410> then<00:03:19.620> just<00:03:19.920> like<00:03:20.130> stirred<00:03:20.760> them

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
times and then just like stirred them

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.300 
times and then just like stirred them
around<00:03:21.209> every<00:03:21.510> time<00:03:21.720> until<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.620> became<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.070> very

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
around every time until it became a very

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.770 
around every time until it became a very
soft<00:03:23.850> liquidy<00:03:24.780> chocolate<00:03:25.380> paste<00:03:26.360> then<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.570> just

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
soft liquidy chocolate paste then I just

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.960 
soft liquidy chocolate paste then I just
took<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:28.080> little<00:03:28.260> bit<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:29.220> chocolate<00:03:29.730> put

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
took a little bit of the chocolate put

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.640 
took a little bit of the chocolate put
it<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.240> another<00:03:30.690> graham<00:03:31.020> cracker<00:03:31.350> and

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
it on the another graham cracker and

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.110 
it on the another graham cracker and
stuck<00:03:32.070> it<00:03:32.190> on<00:03:32.250> top<00:03:32.520> to<00:03:32.730> make<00:03:32.820> like<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> little

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
stuck it on top to make like a little

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.090 
stuck it on top to make like a little
sandwich<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:33.930> then<00:03:34.380> I'm<00:03:34.500> taking<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.890> little

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
sandwich and then I'm taking a little

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.010 
sandwich and then I'm taking a little
bit<00:03:35.250> more<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.730> chocolate<00:03:36.240> with<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.600> spoon

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
bit more of the chocolate with a spoon

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.600 
bit more of the chocolate with a spoon
and<00:03:37.320> just<00:03:37.440> kind<00:03:37.740> of<00:03:37.830> putting<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.250> all<00:03:38.370> around

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
and just kind of putting it all around

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.300 
and just kind of putting it all around
one<00:03:39.090> half<00:03:39.390> of<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.720> sandwich<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.350> I<00:03:40.890> realized

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
one half of the sandwich and I realized

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.580 
one half of the sandwich and I realized
after<00:03:41.520> I<00:03:41.700> did<00:03:41.940> this<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.480> ended<00:03:43.080> up<00:03:43.170> looking

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
after I did this this ended up looking

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.530 
after I did this this ended up looking
not<00:03:44.040> really<00:03:44.310> anything<00:03:44.550> like<00:03:44.730> how<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.090> picture

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
not really anything like how the picture

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.810 
not really anything like how the picture
did<00:03:45.690> on<00:03:45.810> Pinterest<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:47.220> just<00:03:47.520> ended<00:03:47.730> up

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
did on Pinterest and it just ended up

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.270 
did on Pinterest and it just ended up
being<00:03:47.880> really<00:03:48.480> really<00:03:48.600> messy<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.200> not<00:03:50.040> really

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
being really really messy and not really

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.060 
being really really messy and not really
cute<00:03:50.730> but<00:03:51.570> I<00:03:51.630> just<00:03:51.990> continue<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.440> do<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.830> with

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
cute but I just continue to do that with

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.600 
cute but I just continue to do that with
all<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.850> little<00:03:54.570> sandwiches<00:03:55.020> that<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.200> made

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
all of the little sandwiches that I made

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.520 
all of the little sandwiches that I made
so<00:03:56.610> basically<00:03:57.060> this<00:03:57.360> thumb<00:03:57.600> retreat<00:03:57.990> ended<00:03:58.440> up

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
so basically this thumb retreat ended up

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.560 
so basically this thumb retreat ended up
more<00:03:58.800> into<00:03:59.220> like<00:03:59.430> an<00:03:59.550> experiment<00:04:00.209> in<00:04:00.390> the

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
more into like an experiment in the

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.050 
more into like an experiment in the
tutorial<00:04:01.110> because<00:04:01.320> all<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.640> things<00:04:02.850> said

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
tutorial because all of the things said

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.030 
tutorial because all of the things said
on<00:04:03.090> Pinterest<00:04:03.600> weren't<00:04:04.020> really<00:04:04.290> exactly<00:04:04.920> what

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
on Pinterest weren't really exactly what

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.220 
on Pinterest weren't really exactly what
it<00:04:05.250> really<00:04:05.459> was<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:06.030> ended<00:04:06.570> up<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.810> lot<00:04:07.080> more

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
it really was and ended up a lot more

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.410 
it really was and ended up a lot more
messy<00:04:07.620> but<00:04:08.190> anyways<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.880> just<00:04:08.910> stuck<00:04:09.209> them<00:04:09.330> in

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
messy but anyways I just stuck them in

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.949 
messy but anyways I just stuck them in
the<00:04:09.540> freezer<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.110> way<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.830> day<00:04:11.720> so<00:04:12.720> this

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
the freezer and way to the day so this

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.180 
the freezer and way to the day so this
is<00:04:13.080> what<00:04:13.200> they<00:04:13.290> looked<00:04:13.530> like<00:04:13.620> when<00:04:13.770> I<00:04:14.040> took

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
is what they looked like when I took

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.610 
is what they looked like when I took
them<00:04:14.610> out<00:04:14.850> but<00:04:15.480> they<00:04:15.780> were<00:04:15.840> pretty<00:04:16.230> hard<00:04:16.500> to

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
them out but they were pretty hard to

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.140 
them out but they were pretty hard to
get<00:04:16.709> off<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.100> plate<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.580> once<00:04:17.760> I<00:04:17.880> started

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
get off the plate and once I started

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.640 
get off the plate and once I started
like<00:04:18.450> trying<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.840> get<00:04:18.989> them<00:04:19.140> off<00:04:19.320> they<00:04:19.620> all

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
like trying to get them off they all

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.490 
like trying to get them off they all
kind<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.130> broke<00:04:20.520> and<00:04:20.850> stuck<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.540> plate<00:04:21.780> so

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
kind of broke and stuck the plate so

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.710 
kind of broke and stuck the plate so
that<00:04:22.919> wasn't<00:04:23.040> a<00:04:23.220> very<00:04:23.370> good<00:04:23.490> method<00:04:24.000> but<00:04:24.690> I

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
that wasn't a very good method but I

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.780 
that wasn't a very good method but I
eventually<00:04:25.169> got<00:04:25.500> them<00:04:25.710> off<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:26.220> they<00:04:26.640> are

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
eventually got them off and they are

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.270 
eventually got them off and they are
super<00:04:27.120> delicious<00:04:27.600> despite<00:04:28.200> their<00:04:28.620> looks<00:04:29.010> but

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
super delicious despite their looks but

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.050 
super delicious despite their looks but
they<00:04:29.700> are

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
they are

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.580 
they are
definitely<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.690> little<00:04:31.110> bit<00:04:31.260> messy<00:04:31.830> so<00:04:33.590> this

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
definitely a little bit messy so this

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.230 
definitely a little bit messy so this
next<00:04:34.889> one<00:04:35.010> is<00:04:35.040> really<00:04:35.430> cool<00:04:35.639> because<00:04:35.850> they're

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
next one is really cool because they're

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.120 
next one is really cool because they're
just<00:04:36.360> basically<00:04:36.780> homemade<00:04:37.410> Slurpees<00:04:37.889> and

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
just basically homemade Slurpees and

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.400 
just basically homemade Slurpees and
they<00:04:38.580> taste<00:04:38.850> a<00:04:39.060> lot<00:04:39.210> like<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.570> 7-eleven<00:04:40.200> ones

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
they taste a lot like the 7-eleven ones

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.230 
they taste a lot like the 7-eleven ones
but<00:04:41.010> anyways<00:04:41.310> just<00:04:41.430> going<00:04:41.730> to<00:04:41.820> start<00:04:42.090> off<00:04:42.210> by

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
but anyways just going to start off by

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.690 
but anyways just going to start off by
pouring<00:04:43.139> a<00:04:43.230> packet<00:04:43.590> of<00:04:43.680> kool-aid<00:04:43.950> into<00:04:44.669> a

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
pouring a packet of kool-aid into a

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.379 
pouring a packet of kool-aid into a
blender<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.330> then<00:04:45.389> a<00:04:45.870> half<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.410> cup<00:04:46.560> of<00:04:46.620> sugar

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
blender and then a half a cup of sugar

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.390 
blender and then a half a cup of sugar
then<00:04:48.389> I'm<00:04:48.540> pouring<00:04:48.930> in<00:04:49.110> two<00:04:49.440> cups<00:04:49.800> of<00:04:50.010> sprite

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
then I'm pouring in two cups of sprite

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.370 
then I'm pouring in two cups of sprite
but<00:04:50.639> you<00:04:50.730> can<00:04:50.850> also<00:04:51.060> use<00:04:51.240> club<00:04:51.690> soda<00:04:51.990> because

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
but you can also use club soda because

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.100 
but you can also use club soda because
of<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.680> sit<00:04:52.830> on<00:04:52.919> the<00:04:53.010> recipe<00:04:53.780> next<00:04:54.780> I'm<00:04:54.900> going

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
of the sit on the recipe next I'm going

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.900 
of the sit on the recipe next I'm going
to<00:04:55.260> blend<00:04:55.500> all<00:04:55.680> that<00:04:55.860> together<00:04:56.070> until<00:04:56.550> the

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
to blend all that together until the

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.200 
to blend all that together until the
grains<00:04:57.150> dissolve<00:04:57.600> for<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:57.900> few<00:04:58.050> seconds<00:04:59.060> then<00:05:00.060> I

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
grains dissolve for a few seconds then I

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.120 
grains dissolve for a few seconds then I
just<00:05:00.419> added<00:05:00.660> about<00:05:01.050> two<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.470> half<00:05:01.620> cups<00:05:01.889> of

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
just added about two and a half cups of

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.280 
just added about two and a half cups of
ice<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.729> blended<00:05:03.360> them<00:05:03.510> all<00:05:03.720> together

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.140 

after<00:05:07.290> that<00:05:07.440> I<00:05:07.650> poured<00:05:07.980> them<00:05:08.130> into<00:05:08.160> a<00:05:08.520> few<00:05:08.790> cups

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
after that I poured them into a few cups

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.700 
after that I poured them into a few cups
and<00:05:09.450> then<00:05:09.660> just<00:05:09.930> stuck<00:05:10.110> them<00:05:10.260> in<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.500> freezer

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
and then just stuck them in the freezer

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.290 
and then just stuck them in the freezer
for<00:05:10.860> about<00:05:11.070> thirty<00:05:11.490> minutes<00:05:11.580> for<00:05:12.120> them<00:05:12.270> to

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
for about thirty minutes for them to

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.150 
for about thirty minutes for them to
thicken<00:05:12.780> a<00:05:12.930> little<00:05:12.960> bit<00:05:13.290> you<00:05:13.770> could<00:05:13.950> drink

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160

slushies a little bit thicker so this is
