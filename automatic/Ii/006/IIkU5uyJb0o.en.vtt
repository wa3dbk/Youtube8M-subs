00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
so here's how this works you take a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.499 
so here's how this works you take a
piece<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.009> paper<00:01:38.400> you're<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> cut<00:01:39.360> out<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
piece of paper you're going to cut out a

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.569 
piece of paper you're going to cut out a
piece<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.840> paper<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.470> fit<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.040> top<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.490> your

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
piece of paper to fit the top of your

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.160 
piece of paper to fit the top of your
notebook<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.030> actually<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> sizes

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
notebook I actually have the sizes

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.620 
notebook I actually have the sizes
posted<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.820> website<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.450> know

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
posted on the website so you know

and you put it in over here and it's a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.590 
and you put it in over here and it's a
little<00:01:54.329> machine<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.229> rolls<00:01:55.909> whoops<00:01:56.909> rolls

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
little machine and it rolls whoops rolls

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.690 
little machine and it rolls whoops rolls
right<00:01:58.049> out<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.820> like<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:01.310> okay<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.579> when

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
right out just like this okay and when

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.120 
right out just like this okay and when
it<00:02:02.790> comes<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.390> end<00:02:03.710> got<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> little<00:02:04.829> cutter

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
it comes out the end got a little cutter

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.410 
it comes out the end got a little cutter
on<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.060> comes<00:02:06.240> in

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
on it just like that it comes in

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.029 
on it just like that it comes in
different<00:02:06.479> sizes<00:02:06.719> by<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.259> way<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.770> 9

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
different sizes by the way this is a 9

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.040 
different sizes by the way this is a 9
inch<00:02:08.069> machine<00:02:08.489> they<00:02:09.060> have<00:02:09.239> smaller<00:02:09.569> ones<00:02:09.690> and

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
inch machine they have smaller ones and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.700 
inch machine they have smaller ones and
then<00:02:10.530> what<00:02:10.709> happens<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.520> just<00:02:11.760> peel<00:02:12.180> off

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
then what happens is you just peel off

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.860 
then what happens is you just peel off
this<00:02:14.070> top<00:02:14.430> layer<00:02:14.730> just<00:02:16.760> like<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.970> okay<00:02:18.540> now

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
this top layer just like that okay now

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.230 
this top layer just like that okay now
what's<00:02:19.110> gonna<00:02:19.230> happen<00:02:19.680> throw<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.070> away<00:02:20.240> this

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
what's gonna happen throw that away this

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.530 
what's gonna happen throw that away this
is<00:02:21.570> has<00:02:22.140> adhesive<00:02:22.770> stuck<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.030> back<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.240> it

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
is has adhesive stuck to the back of it

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.100 
is has adhesive stuck to the back of it
how<00:02:25.320> cool<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:26.310> know<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.970> know<00:02:27.120> ok<00:02:28.050> so

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
how cool is that I know I know ok so

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.020 
how cool is that I know I know ok so
here<00:02:28.410> I'm<00:02:28.470> gonna<00:02:28.620> track<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:28.890> way<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.790> here's

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
here I'm gonna track this way and here's

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.210 
here I'm gonna track this way and here's
how<00:02:30.150> i<00:02:30.180> get<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.540> sign<00:02:30.720> just<00:02:30.900> perfectly<00:02:31.380> i<00:02:31.620> roll

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
how i get to sign just perfectly i roll

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.150 
how i get to sign just perfectly i roll
back<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.730> first<00:02:33.030> little<00:02:33.900> corner<00:02:34.740> just<00:02:34.980> like

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
back the first little corner just like

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.140 
back the first little corner just like
this<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:37.080> then<00:02:37.200> i<00:02:37.230> measure<00:02:37.620> exactly<00:02:38.130> where<00:02:39.120> i

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
this and then i measure exactly where i

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.380 
this and then i measure exactly where i
want<00:02:39.600> this<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.170> go<00:02:40.500> right<00:02:41.070> about<00:02:41.610> there<00:02:42.150> and

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
want this to go right about there and

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.720 
want this to go right about there and
then<00:02:42.900> just<00:02:43.080> pull<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.440> out<00:02:43.560> whoops<00:02:44.460> I

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
then just pull it out whoops I

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.150 
then just pull it out whoops I
underneath<00:02:46.190> without<00:02:47.190> just<00:02:47.790> like<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.270> and

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
underneath without just like that and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.570 
underneath without just like that and
voila<00:02:50.160> it's<00:02:50.880> perfectly<00:02:51.920> adhered<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.310> top

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
voila it's perfectly adhered to the top

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.220 
voila it's perfectly adhered to the top
of<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.790> notebook<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.510> reason<00:02:54.690> why<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:54.930> cut

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
of the notebook and the reason why I cut

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.900 
of the notebook and the reason why I cut
inside<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.740> edges<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.100> little<00:02:56.190> bit<00:02:56.490> is<00:02:56.610> because

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
inside the edges a little bit is because

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.830 
inside the edges a little bit is because
you<00:02:57.000> know<00:02:57.090> what<00:02:57.210> you're<00:02:57.300> gonna<00:02:57.360> use<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.780> a

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
you know what you're gonna use this a

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.330 
you know what you're gonna use this a
lot<00:02:57.960> you're<00:02:58.230> gonna<00:02:58.290> be<00:02:58.500> flipping<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:58.950> open

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
lot you're gonna be flipping this open

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.120 
lot you're gonna be flipping this open
and<00:02:59.520> if<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.000> don't<00:03:00.240> get<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.690> just<00:03:00.990> right<00:03:01.170> the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
and if you don't get it just right the

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.350 
and if you don't get it just right the
edges<00:03:02.400> are<00:03:02.460> gonna<00:03:02.580> peel<00:03:02.820> off<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.030> it's<00:03:03.270> going

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
edges are gonna peel off and it's going

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.090 
edges are gonna peel off and it's going
to<00:03:03.420> ruin<00:03:03.540> your<00:03:03.750> design<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.320> cool<00:03:05.070> thing
