00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hey you guys and welcome this videos on

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.910 
hey you guys and welcome this videos on
the<00:00:03.210> plugin<00:00:03.540> world<00:00:03.780> guard<00:00:04.140> region<00:00:04.589> effects

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
the plugin world guard region effects

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.410 
the plugin world guard region effects
and<00:00:05.250> basically<00:00:05.549> what<00:00:05.730> it<00:00:05.850> does<00:00:05.879> inside<00:00:06.359> a

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
and basically what it does inside a

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.089 
and basically what it does inside a
region<00:00:06.899> when<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.140> player<00:00:07.379> walks<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:07.890> they'll

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
region when a player walks in they'll

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.680 
region when a player walks in they'll
get<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.370> effect<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.880> list<00:00:09.210> so<00:00:09.540> for

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
get the effect that you list so for

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.820 
get the effect that you list so for
instance<00:00:10.050> they<00:00:10.200> could<00:00:10.260> get<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> speed<00:00:10.800> boost

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
instance they could get a speed boost

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.860 
instance they could get a speed boost
and<00:00:11.400> you're<00:00:12.059> gonna<00:00:12.179> start<00:00:12.450> off<00:00:12.599> by<00:00:12.809> getting

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
and you're gonna start off by getting

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.259 
and you're gonna start off by getting
world<00:00:13.320> guard<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.040> then<00:00:14.460> select<00:00:14.820> with<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.089> one

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
world guard and then select with the one

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.090 
world guard and then select with the one
the<00:00:15.450> first<00:00:15.690> coordinate<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.470> then<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.740> second

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
the first coordinate and then the second

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.370 
the first coordinate and then the second
one<00:00:17.510> and<00:00:18.510> then<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:18.840> basically<00:00:18.990> make<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
one and then just basically make a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.630 
one and then just basically make a
region<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.880> faster<00:00:21.740> so<00:00:22.740> there<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:22.949> go<00:00:23.100> select

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
region and faster so there you go select

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.450 
region and faster so there you go select
it<00:00:23.760> will<00:00:24.080> selected<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.949> region<00:00:26.820> define

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
it will selected that so region define

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.560 
it will selected that so region define
and<00:00:29.460> then<00:00:29.490> whatever<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.000> want<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.359> I'll<00:00:30.449> just

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
and then whatever you want so I'll just

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.840 
and then whatever you want so I'll just
call<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.779> test<00:00:31.250> then<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.279> want<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.550> flag<00:00:32.820> it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
call this test then you want to flag it

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.680 
call this test then you want to flag it
so<00:00:33.420> region<00:00:33.930> flag<00:00:34.730> whatever<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.940> name<00:00:36.120> was<00:00:36.360> so

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
so region flag whatever the name was so

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.690 
so region flag whatever the name was so
test<00:00:37.550> effects<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:40.129> then<00:00:41.129> whatever<00:00:41.460> your

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
test effects and then whatever your

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.869 
test effects and then whatever your
effect<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.629> I'm<00:00:42.899> gonna<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.200> speed<00:00:43.620> ten<00:00:44.010> if

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
effect is so I'm gonna do speed ten if

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.160 
effect is so I'm gonna do speed ten if
you<00:00:44.940> put<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> comment<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.809> do<00:00:45.899> another<00:00:46.079> one

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
you put a comment you can do another one

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
you put a comment you can do another one
as<00:00:46.379> well<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.860> I'll<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.190> jump<00:00:47.719> ten<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.890> now<00:00:50.070> I've

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
as well so I'll do jump ten and now I've

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.220 
as well so I'll do jump ten and now I've
got<00:00:50.370> speed<00:00:50.670> ten<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.149> jump<00:00:51.390> ten<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.170> can

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
got speed ten and jump ten so as you can

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.689 
got speed ten and jump ten so as you can
see<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.739> run<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.100> fast

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
see I can run really fast

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.020 
see I can run really fast
I<00:00:54.050> can<00:00:55.050> also<00:00:55.170> jump<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:55.739> high<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:56.850> soon

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
I can also jump really high but as soon

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.020 
I can also jump really high but as soon
as<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.239> exit<00:00:57.629> speed<00:00:58.230> boost<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.770> stuffs<00:00:59.010> gone<00:00:59.280> so

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
as I exit speed boost and stuffs gone so

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.459 
as I exit speed boost and stuffs gone so
it's<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.270> when<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> enter<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.960> region<00:01:01.170> it

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
it's just when I enter this region it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.650 
it's just when I enter this region it
actually<00:01:01.770> affects<00:01:02.070> me<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:03.149> as<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.390> see<00:01:03.480> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
actually affects me so as you can see it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.840 
actually affects me so as you can see it
comes<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.100> basically<00:01:05.549> giving

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
comes on and it's just basically giving

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.399 
comes on and it's just basically giving
me<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> one<00:01:06.150> second<00:01:06.600> boost<00:01:06.780> over<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.229> over

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
me a one second boost over and over

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.429 
me a one second boost over and over
again<00:01:07.820> obviously<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.840> set<00:01:10.110> them<00:01:10.200> higher

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
again obviously you can set them higher

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.320 
again obviously you can set them higher
than<00:01:10.650> ten<00:01:10.860> as<00:01:11.040> well<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.760> instance<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:12.270> I

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
than ten as well so for instance if I

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.469 
than ten as well so for instance if I
gave<00:01:12.510> myself<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.990> speed<00:01:13.260> booster<00:01:13.740> fifty<00:01:14.479> jump

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
gave myself a speed booster fifty jump

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.230 
gave myself a speed booster fifty jump
boost<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.930> twenty<00:01:16.229> five<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:17.850> would<00:01:17.939> now<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
boost of twenty five it would now be a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.670 
boost of twenty five it would now be a
ridiculous<00:01:18.840> speed<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.409> will<00:01:19.500> jump

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
ridiculous speed and it will jump

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.240 
ridiculous speed and it will jump
stupidly<00:01:20.250> high<00:01:21.020> now<00:01:22.020> I've<00:01:22.170> lost<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.619> obviously

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
stupidly high now I've lost it obviously

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.010 
stupidly high now I've lost it obviously
it<00:01:23.580> would<00:01:23.790> take<00:01:24.000> full<00:01:24.210> damage<00:01:24.390> I've<00:01:24.689> got<00:01:24.840> god

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
it would take full damage I've got god

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.410 
it would take full damage I've got god
mode<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.369> also<00:01:26.490> set<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> flag<00:01:27.180> for

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
mode on but you can also set a flag for

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.749 
mode on but you can also set a flag for
the<00:01:27.479> full<00:01:27.659> damage<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.259> doesn't<00:01:28.470> matter<00:01:28.759> so

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the full damage so it doesn't matter so

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.920 
the full damage so it doesn't matter so
I<00:01:29.790> think<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> really<00:01:30.509> great<00:01:30.600> plugin

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
I think this is a really great plugin

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.300 
I think this is a really great plugin
there's<00:01:31.259> lots<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.740> different<00:01:32.009> ones<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.250> can

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
there's lots of different ones you can

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.880 
there's lots of different ones you can
actually<00:01:32.520> set<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.350> I'll<00:01:34.350> quickly<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.770> run

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
actually set and I'll quickly just run

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.920 
actually set and I'll quickly just run
for<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> list<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.400> them<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.000> ones<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.570> set

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
for a list of them the ones you can set

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.899 
for a list of them the ones you can set
you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.320> set<00:01:37.560> speed<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.340> set<00:01:38.549> slow<00:01:38.850> you

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
you can set speed you can set slow you

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.179 
you can set speed you can set slow you
can<00:01:39.240> set<00:01:39.479> fast<00:01:39.780> digging<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.650> set<00:01:40.890> slow

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
can set fast digging you can set slow

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.700 
can set fast digging you can set slow
digging<00:01:41.810> increase<00:01:42.810> damage<00:01:43.079> jump

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
digging increase damage jump

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.160 
digging increase damage jump
regeneration<00:01:44.520> damage<00:01:45.240> resistance<00:01:45.810> fire

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
