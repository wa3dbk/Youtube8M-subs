though<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.970> be<00:00:45.090> more<00:00:45.269> interesting<00:00:45.720> than<00:00:45.840> some

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
though can be more interesting than some

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.920 
though can be more interesting than some
people<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.760> this<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:47.970> on<00:00:48.269> my<00:00:48.480> left<00:00:48.660> is

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
people think this one on my left is

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.590 
people think this one on my left is
showing<00:00:49.290> you<00:00:49.500> one<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> large<00:00:50.760> boucle<00:00:51.269> yarn

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
showing you one with a large boucle yarn

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.030 
showing you one with a large boucle yarn
so<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.110> lot<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.320> texture<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.890> don't

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
so this is a lot of texture you don't

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.619 
so this is a lot of texture you don't
even<00:00:53.160> notice<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.089> garter<00:00:54.390> stitch

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
even notice that it's the garter stitch

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.200 
even notice that it's the garter stitch
so<00:00:55.320> that's<00:00:55.470> a<00:00:55.559> basic<00:00:55.739> garter<00:00:56.370> back<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.970> forth

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
so that's a basic garter back and forth

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.020 
so that's a basic garter back and forth
then<00:00:57.900> you<00:00:58.019> add<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.410> purl<00:00:58.620> stitch<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.339> you<00:00:59.850> can

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
then you add the purl stitch and you can

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.350 
then you add the purl stitch and you can
turn<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.769> camel<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.460> lovely<00:01:02.790> camel

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.090
