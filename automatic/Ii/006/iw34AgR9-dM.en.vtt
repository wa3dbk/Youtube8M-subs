before but we do get to the 3d print on
the<00:03:25.400> right-hand<00:03:25.670> side<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:26.450> Infinity<00:03:27.040> Pertwee

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
the right-hand side the Infinity Pertwee

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.789 
the right-hand side the Infinity Pertwee
can<00:03:28.190> pick<00:03:28.340> up<00:03:28.489> as<00:03:28.790> well<00:03:29.060> from<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.750> drop<00:03:30.200> there

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
can pick up as well from the drop there

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.110 
can pick up as well from the drop there
so<00:03:31.129> just<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.340> little<00:03:31.519> bit<00:03:31.610> of<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:31.760> sort<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.000> like

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
so just a little bit of a sort of like

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.790 
so just a little bit of a sort of like
idea<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.540> what<00:03:32.659> the<00:03:32.750> map<00:03:32.900> is<00:03:33.019> can<00:03:33.200> look

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
idea of what the map is can look

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.290 
idea of what the map is can look
like<00:03:33.920> so<00:03:34.130> we<00:03:34.250> can<00:03:34.280> expect<00:03:34.880> know<00:03:35.120> what<00:03:35.210> to

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
like so we can expect know what to

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.670 
like so we can expect know what to
expect<00:03:35.360> we<00:03:35.630> jump<00:03:35.900> into<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.320> math<00:03:36.470> for<00:03:36.620> the

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
expect we jump into the math for the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.490 
expect we jump into the math for the
first<00:03:36.920> time<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.430> then<00:03:37.970> on<00:03:38.210> top<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.840> that<00:03:38.960> we're

first time and then on top of that we're

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.050 
first time and then on top of that we're
going<00:03:39.740> to<00:03:39.830> also<00:03:40.310> be<00:03:40.430> getting<00:03:40.610> a<00:03:40.790> look<00:03:40.910> my
