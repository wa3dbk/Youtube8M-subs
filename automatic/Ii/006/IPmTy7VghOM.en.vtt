00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and some of them they're really meant to

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.479 
and some of them they're really meant to
make<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.760> as<00:00:36.410> gameboy<00:00:37.410> realistic<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.280> want

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
make it as gameboy realistic as you want

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.799 
make it as gameboy realistic as you want
you<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.760> choose<00:00:39.030> whether<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:39.960> an<00:00:40.020> SP<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:40.920> or

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
you can choose whether it's an SP or or

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.920 
you can choose whether it's an SP or or
whatever<00:00:43.760> so<00:00:44.760> here's<00:00:45.000> how<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.210> add<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
whatever so here's how you add a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.040 
whatever so here's how you add a
controller<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.520> go<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.700> nos<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.510> no

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
controller you have to go to nos a no

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.830 
controller you have to go to nos a no
cache<00:00:49.289> GBA<00:00:49.680> which<00:00:50.670> makes<00:00:50.969> perfect<00:00:51.270> sense

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
cache GBA which makes perfect sense

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.069 
cache GBA which makes perfect sense
because<00:00:52.260> options<00:00:53.100> would<00:00:53.190> work<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.699> well

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
because options would work just as well

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.930 
because options would work just as well
then<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.440> go<00:00:55.559> into<00:00:55.920> options<00:00:56.219> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
then you have to go into options and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.090 
then you have to go into options and
then<00:00:57.600> control<00:00:58.170> setup<00:00:58.620> here<00:01:00.109> then<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.890> do

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
then control setup here then you can do

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.359 
then control setup here then you can do
is<00:01:02.600> joysticks<00:01:03.600> gamepad<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.739> press

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
is joysticks gamepad you have to press

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.399 
is joysticks gamepad you have to press
enabled<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:07.850> then<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.510> select<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
enabled and then you just select the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:18.940 
enabled and then you just select the
buttons<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.220> your<00:01:11.250> gamepad<00:01:12.590> um<00:01:14.180> like<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:16.850> and

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
buttons on your gamepad um like so and

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.710 
buttons on your gamepad um like so and
then<00:01:19.950> I'm<00:01:20.369> pretty<00:01:20.939> sure<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.119> automatically

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
then I'm pretty sure it automatically

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.210 
then I'm pretty sure it automatically
maps<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.530> your<00:01:23.630> joystick<00:01:24.630> your<00:01:25.590> yeah<00:01:26.009> your
