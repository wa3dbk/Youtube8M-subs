 delegation rice 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.349
 recently visited recently visited 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.790
 in transdniestria 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.850
 there was a scientific conference 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.430
 the reste staff lectured at 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:25.470
 transdniestrian university and of course 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.170
 we had contacts and how with management 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.170
 countries with teaching professorial 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.740
 composition of the university so in with simple 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.570
 people on the streets there in the shops and 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.150
 of course we are very attentive 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.480
 peered into people's faces 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.270
 found out their mood interested 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.390
 details of what they feel and 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.280
 how do they assess the situation rushes in 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.320
 eyes that people with more understanding 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.720
 refers to what happens inside 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.210
 Republic and beyond 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.630
 despite the fact that certain 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.140
 tensions and feelings not even 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.830
 Uncertainty nor fear feeling such 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.410
 know fatigue definitely is and 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.960
 feelings of fear for the future of their children 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.350
 here are adults they kinda already 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.820
 accustomed to the difficulties and hardships and 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.050
 fears for children there but at the same time 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.260
 it's all 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.320
 not at all panicky or 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.440
 some kind of severe depression or 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.170
 frustrations 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.170
 or desire to leave the region 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.590
 it is not because the element 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.280
 certain rootedness living there 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.370
 people 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.010
 the realization that this is their homeland 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.500
 that they survived much more terrible 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.930
 and hard times and that they should 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.020
 survive these difficulties here it is 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.729
 the mood of the local population 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.560
 are present and us find it seems to me 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.479
 that in this respect certain such 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.590
 important psychological well and probably 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.170
 even such a moral element is 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.380
 strengthening contacts and relationships with 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.819
 Russia because now there 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.920
 there are several social programs 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:18.540
 quite active housing 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:22.769
 construction of erection of certain 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.349
 there are social objects and I 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.739
 repeatedly heard from locals 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.870
 about what is now 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.790
 Russia's presence is felt in the region 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.860
 much more than it used to be 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.590
 it was very nice to hear politics 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.739
 tiraspol politics small did small 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.720
 steps on interacting so sensible 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.849
 interact rationally with chisinau 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.620
 in order to make it easier 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.739
 economic life and exclusively 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.280
 the economic life of the self proclaimed 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:56.190
 Republic, but it seems to me that the potential 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.750
 and and largely exhausted because 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.230
 that chisinau does not make concessions chisinau 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.120
 is under very hard dictates 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.360
 European Union and the rules that 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.430
 the European Union dictates including in 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.650
 the framework of the signed agreement and speech 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.200
 how was and continues to go about 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.690
 to 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.910
 regard this territory as your own 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.620
 extending to her Moldavian 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.549
 jurisdiction and influence economic and 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.389
 political 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.760
 quite recently just the other day 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.440
 Tiraspol came out with another initiative 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.690
 Of course, given the heavy 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.560
 economic situation in the region 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.450
 there is an initiative to create a common area 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.069
 free trade between right and left 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.269
 banks of the Dniester need to say that 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.269
 friendly in quotes already 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.489
 trumpeted about this initiative how about 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.459
 that tiraspol changes its 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.680
 foreign policy vector and changes 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.660
 Eurasian integration to the European 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.489
 it certainly is nothing more than just such 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.590
 stacks 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.519
 informational or it is all about 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:18.260
 friend talking about trade liberalization 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:21.389
 economic regime between Chisinau and 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.419
 tiraspol them but how are these 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.780
 Negotiations will end and whether they will pour out 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:30.330
 in any particular policy this is for now 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.419
 not yet clear and there is reason to believe 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.760
 that chisinau will not go to any 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.699
 serious concessions in relation to 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.710
 transdniestria if they don't get 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:45.660
 relevant instructions from outside to 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:49.590
 transdniestria people have to put up with 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.050
 the fact that they have reduced decreases 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:56.520
 wage 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:05:00.300
 put up with what they are experiencing now 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.479
 a large shortage of their own financial resources 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.910
 they have reduced purchasing 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.370
 ability though if in transdniestria 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.190
 come with normal money then 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.620
 you can buy absolutely everything from 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.990
 black its own produce 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.460
 produced caviar and 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.150
 and ending with some other 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.060
 delicacies in this regard region 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.479
 looks so very wealthy and 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.330
 very much so even told me rich but 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:33.300
 you know there is one 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.940
 one such subtlety one feature 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.130
 which characterizes transnistria case 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.270
 is that people who live on this 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:44.910
 territories already accustomed to hardships 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.389
 political limitation to attempts 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.460
 isolation from the west and here in these 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:54.570
 essentially extreme conditions they 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:57.660
 learned to live decently and draws on 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:02.070
 yourself attention that with all 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:05.280
 how limited financial they are 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.380
 restore monuments in the beautiful 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.080
 condition is now Bendery 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.690
 sixteenth century fortress she 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.300
 It is already in itself a very 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.590
 real pearl 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:21.440
 Zane th regional museum value 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:24.710
 built temples and restored city 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.620
 tiraspol is in such know I would 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:31.039
 said very well maintained people 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.560
 watch him clean it contains in 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:37.099
 good order terrifying now 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:40.610
 the situation in the south-east of Ukraine and she 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:43.210
 Of course, I do not wish anyone 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.789
 so that someone in this situation 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:49.430
 it turned out and people are already very tired 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:53.599
 and suffer and do not understand when it's all 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:57.879
 will end but it seems to me that very 

00:06:53.599 --> 00:07:02.509
 many need to learn patience 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:06.190
 humility and the art of survival 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:06.190
 it is from Transnistrians
