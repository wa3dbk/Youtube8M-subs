seventy-five percent that's going to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.660 
seventy-five percent that's going to
happen<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.170> any<00:00:49.410> other<00:00:49.739> guitar<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
happen like any other guitar it is a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.610 
happen like any other guitar it is a
learning<00:00:51.030> curve<00:00:51.360> because<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> different

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
learning curve because it is a different

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.869 
learning curve because it is a different
way<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.550> play<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.210> game<00:00:54.710> so<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:56.070> closing<00:00:56.550> what

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
I think that you are Qatar I think that

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.410 
I think that you are Qatar I think that
you<00:00:58.590> are<00:00:58.739> Qatar<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.370> an<00:00:59.670> innovative<00:01:00.059> measure

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you are Qatar is an innovative measure

you are Qatar is an innovative measure
and<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.750> think<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.140> done<00:01:01.289> very<00:01:01.559> well<00:01:01.649> however

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
and I think it's done very well however

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.539 
and I think it's done very well however
i<00:01:02.789> think<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.449> gaming<00:01:03.930> purposes<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.519> a
