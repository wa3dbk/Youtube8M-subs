but<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:07.650> you're<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:07.890> trading<00:01:08.250> things<00:01:08.490> for

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
but if you're just trading things for

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.520 
but if you're just trading things for
other<00:01:08.820> things<00:01:08.939> why<00:01:09.689> add<00:01:09.840> an<00:01:09.990> intermediate

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
other things why add an intermediate

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.670 
other things why add an intermediate
step<00:01:11.060> here's<00:01:12.060> another<00:01:12.330> example<00:01:12.540> let's<00:01:13.530> say

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
step here's another example let's say

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.080 
step here's another example let's say
that<00:01:13.710> bananas<00:01:14.250> only<00:01:14.490> grow<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> warm

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
that bananas only grow in the warm

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.090 
that bananas only grow in the warm
months<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.780> fish<00:01:15.990> only<00:01:16.170> migrate<00:01:16.650> past<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
island in the cold months and that both

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.899 
island in the cold months and that both
of<00:01:19.229> these<00:01:19.380> foods<00:01:19.740> go<00:01:19.979> bad<00:01:20.250> at<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> end<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.820> the
