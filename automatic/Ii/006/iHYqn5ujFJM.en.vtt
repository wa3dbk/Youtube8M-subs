00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.979 
um a little container so here it is and
I<00:03:04.920> think<00:03:05.400> all<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.580> its<00:03:05.910> polymer<00:03:06.390> clay<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.810> can

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
I think all of its polymer clay I can

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.830 
I think all of its polymer clay I can
tell<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:11.310> like<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.940> strawberries<00:03:12.450> polymer

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
tell so like the strawberries polymer

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.319 
tell so like the strawberries polymer
clay<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.230> like<00:03:14.040> there's<00:03:14.250> no<00:03:14.370> chocolate<00:03:14.670> and

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
clay and like there's no chocolate and

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:23.910 
clay and like there's no chocolate and
it's<00:03:15.630> just<00:03:15.780> really<00:03:15.930> cool

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.210 

you

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.800 

is<00:03:28.220> everything<00:03:28.700> that<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.910> made<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.510> hope<00:03:29.690> you

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
is everything that I made and I hope you

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.470 
is everything that I made and I hope you
like<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:30.140> try
