another<00:01:29.280> example<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> doors<00:01:30.270> carrying

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
another example of the doors carrying

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.960 
another example of the doors carrying
the<00:01:31.079> materials<00:01:31.799> properties<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.759> glass

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the materials properties is the glass

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.960 
the materials properties is the glass
door<00:01:33.270> not<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> glass<00:01:33.780> door<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.310> will<00:01:35.310> be<00:01:35.490> very

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
door not a glass door is will be very

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.940 
door not a glass door is will be very
fragile<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.079> could<00:01:37.229> easily<00:01:37.409> break<00:01:37.770> it

these armed doors that have the levers

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.010 
these armed doors that have the levers
above<00:01:46.530> them<00:01:46.740> carry<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.939> properties<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.720> the

is that you'll need
to<00:01:53.250> actually<00:01:53.610> open<00:01:53.760> door<00:01:54.120> or<00:01:54.390> some<00:01:54.750> type<00:01:54.960> of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
to actually open door or some type of

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.130 
to actually open door or some type of
redstone<00:01:55.500> now<00:01:56.460> back<00:01:56.970> to<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.240> glass<00:01:57.390> door<00:01:57.659> all

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
redstone now back to the glass door all

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.330 
redstone now back to the glass door all
they<00:01:58.260> have<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.440> do<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.650> just<00:01:58.740> basically<00:01:58.979> just

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
they have to do is just basically just

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.469 
they have to do is just basically just
hit<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.550> door<00:01:59.729> ll<00:01:59.940> break<00:02:00.090> very<00:02:00.330> easily

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
hit the door ll break very easily

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.359 
hit the door ll break very easily
because<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.650> I<00:02:01.770> said<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.040> cares<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
because like I said it cares the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.760 
because like I said it cares the
properties<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.210> material<00:02:04.080> you<00:02:04.409> used<00:02:04.650> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
properties of the material you used to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.930 
properties of the material you used to
craft<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.190> and<00:02:05.690> thus<00:02:06.690> it's<00:02:07.050> very<00:02:07.440> fragile<00:02:08.100> now

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
craft it and thus it's very fragile now

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.430 
craft it and thus it's very fragile now
let's<00:02:09.209> move<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.600> some<00:02:09.750> crafting<00:02:10.080> recipes

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
let's move on to some crafting recipes

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.090 
let's move on to some crafting recipes

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
now basically what this model really

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.250 
now basically what this model really
does<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.520> just<00:02:14.730> all<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.660> need<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.870> do<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:16.140> use

does it just all you need to do is use

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.860 
does it just all you need to do is use
the<00:02:16.380> corresponding<00:02:17.100> material<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.820> craft<00:02:18.150> the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
the corresponding material to craft the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:30.890 
the corresponding material to craft the
doors<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:26.630> now<00:02:27.630> moving<00:02:27.989> on<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.320> a<00:02:28.530> more<00:02:29.900> well

doors and now moving on to a more well
not<00:02:31.019> more<00:02:31.140> complicated<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.709> different<00:02:32.100> sort

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
not more complicated of a different sort

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.370 
not more complicated of a different sort

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
same material everything moving on here

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.759 
same material everything moving on here
we<00:03:08.730> have<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.269> obsidian<00:03:09.870> house<00:03:10.019> now<00:03:10.260> like<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.620> said

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
we have a obsidian house now like I said

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.679 
we have a obsidian house now like I said
before<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.609> obsidian<00:03:12.060> door<00:03:12.269> is<00:03:12.480> actually

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
before the obsidian door is actually

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.089 
before the obsidian door is actually
blast<00:03:13.260> resistant<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.010> also<00:03:14.849> on<00:03:15.829> if<00:03:16.829> you<00:03:16.950> take

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
blast resistant and also on if you take

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.259 
blast resistant and also on if you take
it<00:03:17.189> down<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.430> pick<00:03:17.579> actually<00:03:17.790> will<00:03:18.000> actually

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
it down in pick actually will actually

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.110 
it down in pick actually will actually
take<00:03:18.389> you<00:03:18.540> awhile<00:03:18.659> to<00:03:18.780> UM<00:03:19.760> actually<00:03:20.760> take<00:03:20.969> this

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
take you awhile to UM actually take this

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.599 
take you awhile to UM actually take this
door<00:03:21.329> down<00:03:21.569> so<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:22.049> know<00:03:22.230> it's<00:03:22.469> very

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
door down so you know it's very

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.920 
door down so you know it's very
efficient<00:03:23.609> at<00:03:23.700> protecting<00:03:24.060> now<00:03:24.569> let's<00:03:24.750> test

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
efficient at protecting now let's test

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.790 
efficient at protecting now let's test
out<00:03:25.079> some<00:03:25.349> TNT

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.190 

okay<00:03:30.830> no<00:03:31.040> get<00:03:31.370> up<00:03:31.400> get<00:03:31.610> up<00:03:31.670> no<00:03:32.060> yes<00:03:32.660> just<00:03:33.110> in

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
okay no get up get up no yes just in

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.240 
okay no get up get up no yes just in
time<00:03:33.319> and<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.519> see<00:03:34.700> um<00:03:34.940> it's<00:03:35.330> totally

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
time and you see um it's totally

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.530 
time and you see um it's totally
blast-resistant<00:03:37.340> so<00:03:37.970> if<00:03:38.269> you<00:03:38.360> want<00:03:38.510> to

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
blast-resistant so if you want to

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.210 
blast-resistant so if you want to
contain<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.050> explosion<00:03:39.230> or<00:03:39.680> just<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:40.040> stay

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
contain the explosion or just to stay

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.440 
contain the explosion or just to stay
away<00:03:40.400> from<00:03:40.459> explosion<00:03:41.060> let<00:03:41.239> me<00:03:41.330> just

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
away from explosion let me just

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.630 
away from explosion let me just
demonstrate<00:03:42.019> that<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:43.010> place<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.250> bunch<00:03:43.550> of

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
demonstrate that this place a bunch of

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.940 
demonstrate that this place a bunch of
these<00:03:43.790> down<00:03:44.260> really<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:45.739> demonstrate

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
these down really to just demonstrate

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.589 
these down really to just demonstrate
well<00:03:46.519> everything<00:03:46.849> outside<00:03:47.060> can<00:03:47.420> get

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
well everything outside can get

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.339 
well everything outside can get
annihilated<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.580> just<00:03:49.580> do<00:03:49.700> that<00:03:49.849> and<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.840> can

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
annihilated so just do that and I can

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.949 
annihilated so just do that and I can
probably<00:03:51.739> get<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.160> button<00:03:52.459> yes<00:03:52.849> and<00:03:53.150> just

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
probably get that button yes and just

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.750 
probably get that button yes and just
just<00:03:54.260> back<00:03:54.530> away<00:03:54.800> a<00:03:54.830> little<00:03:55.010> bit<00:03:55.130> because<00:03:55.610> we
