00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.040
 FC Augsburg vs. Bayer Leverkusen Bundesliga Ninth September 2011 lower 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.830
 she strange Kenzie thinks Dirk win for Leverkusen Otter the weird she knows 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.090
 The first encounter of the fifth round of the Bundesliga will be the newcomer 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.740
 Augsburg is without a win so far and Bayer Leverkusen one of the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.619
 Candidates for the highest ranking 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.730
 who has not opened the new season just the expected 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.750
 interesting is that these rivals in the championship so far never 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.970
 met each other 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.470
 For Augsburg, this is the first season among the elite 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.510
 but they played in 2008 under the club and Leverkusen 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.030
 has celebrated on its own stadium with the safe 2 2 0 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.970
 the greatest merit for this victory was the players in this one 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.490
 Club no longer play the vital helmet or Gekas 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.770
 Ninth of September 2011 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.910
 8:30 pm Augsburg started the season like most of them did 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.760
 have seen before 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.870
 that's too strong a competition for a club that is in for the first time 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.870
 has placed history in the elite society 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.670
 they will celebrate and win every victory like a little holiday 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.940
 possible continuance of be so call that then there has been a real 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.870
 in the initial euphoria during the transition to the Bundesliga they are in 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.940
 The first two rounds remained undefeated 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.470
 they have played against Freiburg at home 2 to 2 and then a guest at 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.330
 Kaiserslautern 1 to 1 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.500
 but in the last two rounds they are even without points and goals scored 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.670
 remained 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.890
 Hoffenheim has dealt with 2 to 0 and Müllberg in the last round with 1 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.060
 2 0 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.389
 individually stands out only one name and indeed striker Sascha Mölders 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.340
 who came this summer from FSV Frankfurt and all three 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.680
 has scored recent goals for Augsburg 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.590
 if girls fail that's the case 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.980
 has been in the last two rounds and especially against Hoffenheim as he 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.860
 even missed the penalty then Augsburg is simply not dangerous 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:20.809
 The problem is that even three offensive players are injured 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.639
 these are the Angolan Rafael Nadal Dom Michael Thurk and the east approx 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.629
 Coach Luhukay kept trying with any changes most of the time 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.629
 in the defense and in midfield to improve the game 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.400
 because of injuries in Nuremberg also captain behave as well as 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.169
 not played 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:45.040
 for concentrates are down as z come a test which looked even better 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.829
 Has 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.230
 but against Leverkusen they will have and any hopes 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.709
 best game of need now 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.389

 Leverkusen has solid but not as expected the new season opened 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:22.429
 but you have to mention that in the first four rounds you have a very difficult one 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:23.510
 Program had 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.680
 that they among other things as opponents also the current champion Borussia 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.739
 Dortmund has brought 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.209
 that happened in the last round 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.589
 as it is apprenticed 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:37.799
 BayArena has given many surprises but no goals 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.470
 By the way, that's for the pharmacists 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.090
 an atypical feature as they have been a team for years 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.700
 offensive and with many goals plays have been known 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:54.809
 but so far they have only scored two goals and in this segment they are 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.679
 against Kaiserslautern the worst 

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:01.999
 At the salt they have only 2 cashed after which only Bavaria is better 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.659
 interesting is also the goalkeeper of Leverkusen 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:10.939
 they had big problems in the beginning when they made mistakes because of Torwart 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.260
 lost against Mainz and were also eliminated in the body 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:17.979
 the national goalkeeper René Adler is injured 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.870
 they have tried depth 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.550
 but it did not go well 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.030
 Yelldell which has been very bad and then is in front of goal Bernd Leno 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.150
 Leverkusen has not conceded for three rounds 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:37.389
 this 19-year-old goalkeeper has especially against Dortmund in the last round 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.860
 shines as he was also the player of the match 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.630
 All in all, the defeat against Mainz and, of course, is so bad 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:50.310
 the elimination from the cup while everything else is good and it is 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.169
 seems like it's going up 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.520
 Coach Dutt has had the same formation in the last two matches 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.650
 sent out and against Dortmund he had only a substitution 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.509
 Gameplay made 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.100
 now he is forced to make changes to García click for this 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.099
 Game is locked and that's a big handicap 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:16.099
 the replacement for this position Oczipka is injured and so will likely 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.729
 Jump in Schwab 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.339
 Everything else will not change 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.930
 expected line Bayer Leverkusen b 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.330

 Reinarz Schwaab Airbender Breuel feast Sam Renato Augusto School Kießling 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.309
 the quality difference is irritating and in our opinion 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:39.490
 Leverkusen in this encounter the big favorite 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.009
 the guests are in a series without defeat and went direction 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:45.930
 table top 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.520
 Augsburg can be difficult 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.090
 Although Kati plaintiff courses will be missing very much the new Erstligist on the 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.990
 first victory still have to wait and the point 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.990
 to look at the points in other games 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:02.819
 Zico Bayer Leverkusen raise stake 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:05.349
 five stroke 10 Quote

 1 Comarch zig with Hans Tapet 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.760
 Everything up to one point 70 can be played without any problems 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.470
 down here are just us in a game of Leverkusen you have two goals 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.620
 while there were even fewer in the remaining three matches 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.620
 at Augsburg you have a goal firmly seen only in the first round and later 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.930
 it has been at most two per game 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.650
 that's why 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.580
 could fulfill it now as well as spiritually and that relates above all 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.610
 on the guests
