00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:09.889

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.889
 hp small computer review em 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.889
 2017 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:23.810
 I loved it with fourth core i7 processor 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:28.740
 generation 4200 on nvidia geforce board 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.420
 computer with 17- inch screen is 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.640
 seeking information about him in the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.579
 I found nothing almost 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.460
 do not use counter 17 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.910
 even imported what mattered the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.149
 keyboard he has no thirst on the island has 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.440
 biometric reading on a computer up to 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.170
 very light 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.570
 by the size of it and 17 it has an f1 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.610
 also staff did not get to it as a 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.940
 ultrabook but it's actually a notebook 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.390
 you do not have a DVD player and recorder and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.409
 player and it has the system 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.900
 bits audio subwoofer time is fine 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.220
 built in aluminum has the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:22.229
 keyboard or to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:30.119
 work in aluminum logo hp in 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:33.270
 chrome here computer it is fast 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:42.140
 testoni his processor then we 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:42.140
 will see the mota experience of windows 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.040
 So 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.130
 the system 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:11.670
 to do windows 5,91 intel 4.700 2.4 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:15.160
 he has his record going up to 3.4 gigs 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:23.470
 in that overboost in it right? 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:34.320
 then he shows his experience in 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:34.320
 experience his performance 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:47.100
 performance calculations 7005 lowest note 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:51.970
 time to play an internal letter but it is 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:55.720
 5,400 quotes says it kills these 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:00.370
 computers but more bottle starts as 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:08.110
 fast as an ultrabook then is that 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:09.000
 some cool functions that turn off 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.840
 light 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.739
 you enter a dark environment a light 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.190
 on the keyboard you type in environments 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.780
 dark or if you need to turn on the 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.870
 light 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.550
 ready there fast computer approved 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.550
