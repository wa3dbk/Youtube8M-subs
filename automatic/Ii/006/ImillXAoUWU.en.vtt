00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.860 

so<00:02:19.220> it's<00:02:19.400> got<00:02:19.640> it's<00:02:20.090> got<00:02:20.210> quite<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.570> bit<00:02:20.750> of

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
so it's got it's got quite a bit of

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.830 
so it's got it's got quite a bit of
coding<00:02:21.110> on<00:02:21.890> there<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:22.610> I'll<00:02:23.300> let<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.510> fit<00:02:23.810> a

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
coding on there so I'll let it fit a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.860 
coding on there so I'll let it fit a
little<00:02:24.110> while<00:02:24.380> Linda<00:02:28.300> come<00:02:29.300> back<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.720> give<00:02:29.840> it

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
little while Linda come back and give it

00:02:29.870 --> 00:04:31.050 
little while Linda come back and give it
another<00:02:30.230> coat

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.950 

well<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.240> looks<00:04:32.390> like<00:04:32.480> it<00:04:32.600> got<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.750> good

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960

enough<00:04:33.170> coating<00:04:33.590> for<00:04:33.800> now<00:04:33.920> so<00:04:34.540> go<00:04:35.540> ahead<00:04:35.780> and

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
enough coating for now so go ahead and

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.050 
enough coating for now so go ahead and
put<00:04:36.050> it<00:04:36.140> in<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:36.290> Sun<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:36.800> let<00:04:36.920> it<00:04:37.130> sit<00:04:38.030> a

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
put it in the Sun and let it sit a

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:46.750 
put it in the Sun and let it sit a
little<00:04:38.300> bit<00:04:44.710> with<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.860> dark<00:04:46.130> color<00:04:46.370> kind<00:04:46.640> of

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
little bit with the dark color kind of

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.960 
little bit with the dark color kind of
gives<00:04:46.940> it<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.120> carbon<00:04:47.450> fiber<00:04:47.720> look<00:04:48.020> to<00:04:48.230> it<00:04:51.970> well

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
gives it a carbon fiber look to it well

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.140 
gives it a carbon fiber look to it well
there<00:04:53.150> it<00:04:53.240> is<00:04:53.300> Plasti<00:04:53.810> Dip<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:55.730> best<00:04:55.910> part

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
there it is Plasti Dip the best part

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.550 
there it is Plasti Dip the best part
about<00:04:56.210> this<00:04:56.540> stuff<00:04:56.780> is<00:04:56.960> that<00:04:57.140> if<00:04:57.290> you<00:04:57.410> don't

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560

like<00:04:57.800> it<00:04:57.980> you<00:04:58.070> can<00:04:58.220> go<00:04:58.370> ahead<00:04:58.430> and<00:04:58.580> fill<00:04:58.760> it

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
like it you can go ahead and fill it

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.210 
like it you can go ahead and fill it
right<00:04:58.970> off
