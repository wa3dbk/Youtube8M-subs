00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 raphael scaini because now 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.759
 it's up to him to work rafael you go 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.330
 present us what the invention of the day 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.460
 of the week 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.139
 we will talk about camping since camping 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.670
 has more than ever the wind in its sails 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.440
 be aware that every year just by 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.910
 belgium this is nearly two million 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.039
 eight hundred thousand overnight stays that are 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.420
 booked in campsites so the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.100
 Belgian is a camper and the stranger comes 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.220
 also camping with us that adds up 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.199
 nearly 9 3% of the European total of overnight stays 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.670
 annual camping I have near me at 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.710
 laurent lemay who comes from France to 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.210
 police still finished the eaters there 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.189
 is a consumer and he comes to us 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.200
 present your acquisition 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.450
 it's called the hussar at first sight 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.790
 it looks like a roof boxes 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.739
 but it's actually an aunt 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.329
 on the roof of the car so long 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.430
 yes it's a time we will show 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.079
 how does it unfold it lasts pretty much 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.850
 30 40 seconds we'll do a little 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.960
 quick demonstration we will leave 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.110
 sir who is a user 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.879
 the user therefore of this gear in total 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.640
 in europe in europe 27 ago 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.620
 twenty-six thousand campground is 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.180
 in the top 3 countries that are the most 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.210
 visited by campers have found at 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.610
 France in 2 Italy is a lot 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.290
 more surprising the research in number 3 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.880
 the united kingdom one could say that with 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.750
 the cold climate bombay people are fleeing 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.549
 a little bit we could have found 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.189
 spain 1-3 is not at all that's the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.130
 united kingdom so 70 you see that's 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.430
 puts a fairly easy way on the the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.130
 roof of the car and sÃ©bastien there a 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.729
 once these climbs in what 30 40 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.820
 seconds 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.840
 here you have your cozy little nest 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.280
 but I still have a big question 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.320
 is this something solid because 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.030
 that it's solid it can withstand more 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.860
 or less than 150 kilograms 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.100
 should adults three years a child 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.259
 okay and you use 70 when 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.100
 sir makes one to go on weekends 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.869
 end 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.670
 I 'm climbing or kitesurfing 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.710
 so in the middle of nature 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.850
 okay so that is not addressed 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.259
 especially not to campers 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.490
 casual who will go camping a 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.049
 times a year it's really for people 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.820
 who are used to leaving 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.229
 traveling trips you go in 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.549
 weekend to Normandy you can 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.470
 stop you more or less anywhere 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.600
 because the peculiarity of having a 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.399
 tent on the roof of his car it's 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.770
 we do not do wild camping 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.630
 we can stop everywhere it's forbidden 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.130
 no wild camping but precisely 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.720
 it's forbidden but thanks to this 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.430
 invention as you stay on the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.959
 car well it's not considered 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.140
 agree wild decor 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:20.670
 ok so we test with her in your 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.380
 Aunt we can not go back there is only one 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.970
 issue in fact there is only one issue 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.330
 actually the time we returned 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.739
 in the front at the back it costs in 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.569
 does yes all that too the bass drum 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.180
 the price is also that I answer 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.069
 around 1500 euros 1700 euros in 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.260
 function of the model you choose 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.819
 and she adapt see you walk in 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.360
 do you have drunkenness actually 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.360
 that it fits on six vehicles and 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:51.150
 it's perfect not precisely I was in 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.560
 train of I take the solidity with 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.090
 sir then what have you all so 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.190
 all types of vehicles on the tube of 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.380
 vehicles by you are enough two bars 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.910
 roof yes yes it also benefits 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.739
 of this type of editing is that if you 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.420
 buy a mobile home if it falls into 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.160
 breakdown but impossible to leave if you 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.930
 have a pickup truck with the roof that 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
 can open as volkswagen does very 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.799
 rule and chase people these patterns 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.480
 his models there too if it falls into 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.310
 breakdown can not read here the car 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.200
 breaks down you have to burst too 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.519
 what can happen since they may be 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.190
 arrived at sir and well you can 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.989
 change the christmas aunt with sir 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.880
 way choose this model in others 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.990
 finally why your speed 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.790
 opening and closing and 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.590
 everything is included in there is space 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.840
 to sleep and space to tidy up 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.180
 also his business of the non bull ship 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.890
 unfair because in the middle of the night 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.600
 wrong 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.730
 the author has more or less five years but 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.580
 it's not any more case bunk beds 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.930
 so for the children will leave in j 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.730
 a small storage box also for 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.790
 put the laundry in front of there is a math 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.140
 the interest very well play in bars 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.710
 to visit the hainaut that you 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:58.660
 propose we know well in the names it 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:00.610
 are a lot of wild animals in the 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.740
 pyrenees I wonder especially then 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.960
 your car consumes more 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.470
 of gasoline with all this not especially when 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.450
 it's like that and we roll the most 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.830
 dangerous and but no but otherwise 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.390
 does not consume a lot because it's at 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.239
 aerodynamic level it's like a 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.950
 roof box and more than no more than 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.820
 no malt ok but I think we did 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.870
 all the way 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.320
 yes I think that what we miss 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.850
 loose a little dessert our little ones 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.590
 cakes can eat in the tent on 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.270
 is well put then if you buy some 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.070
 of esther in supermarkets ask you 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.720
 maybe but where does it come from and by whom 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.210
 are they made by big 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.680
 industrial companies that makes these 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.270
 cakes but in what conditions 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.950
 guided tour with jean christophe 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.060
 willems who visited for us the 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.390
 Eastern company based at mouscron in late 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.390
 gourmet
