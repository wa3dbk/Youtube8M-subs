00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
that was sent to them of what supposedly

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.490 
that was sent to them of what supposedly
the<00:03:57.550> USB<00:03:58.030> cable<00:03:58.390> that<00:03:58.420> will<00:03:58.690> be<00:03:58.870> compatible

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
the USB cable that will be compatible

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.830 
the USB cable that will be compatible
with<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.739> next<00:04:00.220> generation<00:04:00.850> iphone<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:01.600> as

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
with the next generation iphone and as

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.030 
with the next generation iphone and as
you<00:04:01.989> can<00:04:02.110> see<00:04:02.140> from<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.530> picture<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:02.860> part

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
you can see from the picture the part

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.560 
you can see from the picture the part
that<00:04:03.190> would<00:04:03.280> actually<00:04:03.430> be<00:04:03.580> inserted<00:04:04.180> into<00:04:04.390> the

device<00:04:04.810> is<00:04:05.019> definitely<00:04:05.620> smaller<00:04:05.769> than<00:04:05.950> even

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
device is definitely smaller than even

device is definitely smaller than even
the<00:04:06.430> USB<00:04:06.910> side<00:04:07.180> which<00:04:07.660> right<00:04:07.959> now<00:04:07.989> is<00:04:08.140> most<00:04:08.530> of

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
the USB side which right now is most of

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.810 
the USB side which right now is most of
you<00:04:08.739> know<00:04:08.769> if<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.160> go<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.430> look<00:04:09.519> at<00:04:09.730> your

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
you know if you go and look at your

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.570 
you know if you go and look at your
standard<00:04:10.239> 30<00:04:10.540> pin<00:04:10.840> connector<00:04:10.870> USB<00:04:11.799> cable<00:04:12.220> the

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
standard 30 pin connector USB cable the

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.860 
standard 30 pin connector USB cable the
part<00:04:12.760> that<00:04:12.880> you<00:04:12.940> actually<00:04:13.090> insert<00:04:13.570> into<00:04:13.720> your

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
part that you actually insert into your

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.380 
part that you actually insert into your
iphone<00:04:14.230> ipod<00:04:14.680> or<00:04:14.890> ipad<00:04:15.100> is<00:04:15.519> definitely<00:04:16.180> bigger

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
iphone ipod or ipad is definitely bigger

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.360 
iphone ipod or ipad is definitely bigger
than<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.900> USB<00:04:17.320> side<00:04:17.530> so<00:04:17.680> this<00:04:17.799> just<00:04:18.070> kind<00:04:18.340> of

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
than the USB side so this just kind of

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.010 
than the USB side so this just kind of
gives<00:04:18.549> you<00:04:18.640> a<00:04:18.729> feel<00:04:18.970> for<00:04:19.359> how<00:04:19.510> small<00:04:19.840> we're

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
gives you a feel for how small we're

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.789 
gives you a feel for how small we're
looking<00:04:20.350> at<00:04:20.470> with
