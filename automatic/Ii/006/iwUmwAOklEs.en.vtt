00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.610
 I realize that many of the techniques 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.830
 that you apply in tournaments works 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.539
 with ruler with regular as they 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.670
 accompanies the logical reasoning of the 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.010
 plays how to identify these sports 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.010
 or do not get complicated tournament I do not fear 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.260
 we have a much lower also was the 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.570
 big question and a thread of antonin in the 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.800
 majority of them recreational players 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.280
 which does not follow the reasoning of a 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.980
 The hand you 're trying to represent is 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.079
 basically this question is I will 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.149
 Respond with playing with reg with play 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.499
 with a creative player is that I know 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.420
 tell you 

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:42.769
 before you sit at the table when you 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.289
 sit in the same thing you will see 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:48.050
 Who are the regular players? 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.019
 if the rest is regular and recreational 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.659
 It will arrive, and you? 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.879
 the regular and it will already do 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:59.089
 a profile of players was classified 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.969
 I'm talking I was sitting at his desk. 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.739
 You'll talk a little strange, you have this style. 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.200
 you talk how in the same move 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.299
 I can get a regular and I can get 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.790
 a creative player is clear that a 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.909
 regular player the game did not start there 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.340
 just the moment we play 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.110
 every day together we are all 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.840
 the days of each other making each other 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.570
 studying then game already enters the level 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.799
 well advanced by time we are playing the 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:31.189
 yoga 34 years sharing the same tables 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.049
 so that's why we always 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.960
 have to interpret each move as 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.909
 only one is very relative to finalizing 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.619
 a move simply for risk and 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.450
 by text format 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.000
 precisely because it has all this level of 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.390
 years and years may be exactly you 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.719
 find the same face you know the team 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.429
 that you are in your image of the game that 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.289
 you pass on to him this is the most 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.939
 important 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.149
 creative people we will consider a 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.890
 general as most of the players without 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.229
 a lot of information a player who plays 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.090
 plus the standard ie you knowing 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.310
 represent why most of the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.210
 irregular today play established 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.519
 in position 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.019
 simply because they will represent 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.300
 this hand of value 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.790
 they will always invent position and 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.440
 efe xaath the plug because they do this 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.600
 because most of the time you will not 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.210
 have a hand of good 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.490
 to be able to pay these three bets 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.470
 It's a game I totally with you. 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.130
 accompany who is playing all the 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.960
 days I'm a guy that I'm mine 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.730
 differential that the mix rather the line 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.990
 One day I'm going to play but then I 'm going to play. 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.500
 with a different line but has to 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.030
 to know your game's mix just to 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.920
 You do not give a hotel 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.110
 so you do not give hotel all the time I 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.520
 I'm doing the same with all the twists and 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.280
 I 'm not giving you all the opposition. 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.960
 Lachman position value condition tuttman 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.450
 one hour I 'm flirting value 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.940
 position looks I'm completing no value 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.420
 no opposition so you have to know 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.760
 to mix just to balance is what you 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.680
 give our image you pass like you 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.740
 plays precisely to make this reading difficult 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.480
 and with the players and creative you do not 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.060
 need to exaggerate and you do not need 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.830
 so deep down the game gets more basic 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.480
 but with irregular players with 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.910
 sure they have to know how much 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.950
 well because they will not put the night on 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.100
 on you day after day and you do not 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.650
 can precisely standardize your game 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.570
 because you know without problems and 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.440
 problems that will identify our 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.550
 pattern 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.489
 As I have here, there are several that 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.620
 your name because I do not use it even more if 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.480
 you start playing on top of the standard 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.730
 sure this is not just a game 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.590
 without knowing that they know what you are 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.840
 doing it is just when you 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.340
 you decorate the tibet you put the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.270
 villain I will not have every day that you are 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.090
 making 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:54.050
 only the great difficulty is that with 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.780
 You sure know all this without 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.739
 Express all the chips know to lose 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.340
 potter is how I told you you need to 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.470
 dedication the cetano there every day that is 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.209
 that dedication that will bring the answer 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.640
 I do not know what will bring Claire to 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.640
 clarity and you can see it
