we're<00:00:06.180> all<00:00:06.299> thinking<00:00:06.509> greener<00:00:06.839> these<00:00:07.080> days

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
we're all thinking greener these days

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.020 
we're all thinking greener these days
and<00:00:07.589> that<00:00:07.710> includes<00:00:08.069> equipment<00:00:08.580> we<00:00:08.670> use<00:00:08.849> to

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
and that includes equipment we use to

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.299 
and that includes equipment we use to
maintain<00:00:09.179> our<00:00:09.599> gardens<00:00:09.990> in<00:00:10.080> our<00:00:10.200> lawn<00:00:10.440> so<00:00:11.190> it's

maintain our gardens in our lawn so it's
no<00:00:11.429> surprise<00:00:11.610> real<00:00:12.120> mowers<00:00:12.420> are<00:00:12.509> coming<00:00:12.780> up<00:00:12.900> a

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
no surprise real mowers are coming up a

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.200 
no surprise real mowers are coming up a
lot<00:00:13.200> more<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.530> conversation<00:00:14.219> now<00:00:14.940> they're<00:00:15.089> not

anything new with the technology that

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.279 
anything new with the technology that

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
makes them run more efficiently is now

for everybody if you have a really big
lawn<00:00:23.279> or<00:00:23.519> when<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:23.820> hilly<00:00:24.060> or<00:00:24.269> requires<00:00:24.869> a

lot of maneuvering well it may not be
the<00:00:26.939> best<00:00:27.119> choice<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:28.050> real<00:00:28.260> mowers<00:00:28.590> are

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the best choice but real mowers are

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.560 
the best choice but real mowers are
ideally<00:00:29.369> suited<00:00:29.670> for<00:00:29.699> smaller<00:00:30.029> lawns<00:00:30.330> or

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
ideally suited for smaller lawns or

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.540 
ideally suited for smaller lawns or
where<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.289> get<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.619> long<00:00:31.920> straight<00:00:32.279> run

where you can get in a long straight run

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.250 
where you can get in a long straight run
so<00:00:33.030> let's<00:00:33.149> talk<00:00:33.360> about<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.750> reasons<00:00:34.050> real

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
so let's talk about the reasons real

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.780 
so let's talk about the reasons real
mowers<00:00:34.559> are<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.739> greenest<00:00:35.040> way<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> cut<00:00:35.670> your

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
mowers are the greenest way to cut your

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.340 
mowers are the greenest way to cut your
grass<00:00:35.850> well<00:00:36.570> first<00:00:36.809> they're<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> most

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
grass well first they're the most

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.709 
grass well first they're the most
eco-friendly<00:00:37.710> way<00:00:38.219> because<00:00:39.059> there's<00:00:39.239> no<00:00:39.420> gas

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719

that's going to allow you to blast right
through<00:03:24.900> those<00:03:25.020> twigs<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.500> those<00:03:25.620> weeds<00:03:25.920> and

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
through those twigs and those weeds and

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.100 
through those twigs and those weeds and
when<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.880> combine<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.480> added<00:03:27.810> cutting

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
when you combine that added cutting

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.050 
when you combine that added cutting
power<00:03:28.350> with<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.650> lack<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:29.070> friction<00:03:29.220> well<00:03:29.880> that

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
power with a lack of friction well that

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.610 
power with a lack of friction well that
makes<00:03:30.270> a<00:03:30.390> mower<00:03:30.600> that's<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.959> lot<00:03:31.170> easier<00:03:31.500> to

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
makes a mower that's a lot easier to

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.030 
makes a mower that's a lot easier to
push<00:03:31.850> especially<00:03:32.850> in<00:03:32.940> taller<00:03:33.150> grass<00:03:33.890> this<00:03:34.890> is

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
push especially in taller grass this is

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.770 
push especially in taller grass this is
a<00:03:35.070> great<00:03:35.340> feature<00:03:35.610> unlike<00:03:36.150> traditional<00:03:36.270> real

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
a great feature unlike traditional real

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.150 
a great feature unlike traditional real
mowers<00:03:37.140> where<00:03:37.320> they<00:03:37.440> position<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.950> blade

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
mowers where they position the blade

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.460 
mowers where they position the blade
between<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.700> wheels<00:03:38.910> that's<00:03:39.810> ok<00:03:40.170> but<00:03:40.380> it

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
between the wheels that's ok but it

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.690 
between the wheels that's ok but it
doesn't<00:03:40.740> let<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:40.950> cut<00:03:41.160> underneath<00:03:41.490> the

doesn't let you cut underneath the

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.130 
doesn't let you cut underneath the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
wheels so just imagine trying to get

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.080 
wheels so just imagine trying to get
that<00:03:43.290> even<00:03:43.560> cut<00:03:43.709> along<00:03:43.920> your<00:03:44.130> bed<00:03:44.370> edge<00:03:44.640> it

that even cut along your bed edge it

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.890 
that even cut along your bed edge it
isn't<00:03:45.270> going<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.450> happen

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
isn't going to happen
