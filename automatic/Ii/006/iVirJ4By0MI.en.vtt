all<00:00:00.810> right<00:00:00.930> so<00:00:01.170> who<00:00:01.469> are<00:00:01.560> inspector<00:00:01.979> workbench

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
all right so who are inspector workbench

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.560 
all right so who are inspector workbench
now<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:02.790> I'm<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.120> show<00:00:03.240> you<00:00:03.300> how<00:00:03.389> to<00:00:03.480> do

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
now and I'm going to show you how to do

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.510 
now and I'm going to show you how to do
a<00:00:03.600> calibration<00:00:03.929> so<00:00:04.710> there<00:00:05.250> are<00:00:05.310> different

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
a calibration so there are different

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.070 
a calibration so there are different
kinds<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.700> calibration<00:00:06.060> but<00:00:06.390> we're<00:00:06.629> gonna

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
kinds of calibration but we're gonna

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.120 
kinds of calibration but we're gonna
look<00:00:07.259> at<00:00:09.139> spectral<00:00:10.139> calibration<00:00:10.620> today<00:00:10.830> which

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
look at spectral calibration today which

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.749 
look at spectral calibration today which
means<00:00:11.420> whether<00:00:12.440> these<00:00:13.440> values<00:00:13.980> along<00:00:14.519> the

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
means whether these values along the

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.000 
means whether these values along the
x-axis<00:00:15.150> which<00:00:15.870> stand<00:00:16.109> for<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.350> wavelength<00:00:16.740> of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
x-axis which stand for the wavelength of

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.310 
x-axis which stand for the wavelength of
light<00:00:17.220> at<00:00:17.640> any<00:00:17.820> any<00:00:18.420> point<00:00:18.900> along<00:00:18.960> graph

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
light at any any point along graph

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.609 
light at any any point along graph
whether<00:00:19.949> those<00:00:20.189> are<00:00:20.369> correct<00:00:21.230> or<00:00:22.230> whether

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
whether those are correct or whether

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.370 
whether those are correct or whether
that's<00:00:23.039> shifted<00:00:23.490> left<00:00:23.640> or<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:23.939> me<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.570> I'm

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
that's shifted left or with me so I'm

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.500 
that's shifted left or with me so I'm
looking<00:00:25.680> at<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.800> xenon<00:00:26.039> lamp<00:00:26.310> right<00:00:26.490> now<00:00:26.609> but

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
looking at a xenon lamp right now but

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.050 
looking at a xenon lamp right now but
see<00:00:27.840> how<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.320> kind<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.650> very<00:00:28.830> big<00:00:29.070> shape

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
see how this is kind of a very big shape

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.010 
see how this is kind of a very big shape
we<00:00:30.330> can't<00:00:30.570> really<00:00:31.309> pinpoint<00:00:32.690> things<00:00:33.690> that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
we can't really pinpoint things that

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.080 
we can't really pinpoint things that
easily<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.530> what<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:35.340> calibration<00:00:35.940> is

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
easily so what we do for calibration is

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.170 
easily so what we do for calibration is
we<00:00:36.180> use<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> compact<00:00:36.960> fluorescent<00:00:37.500> light<00:00:37.620> and

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
we use a compact fluorescent light and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.310 
we use a compact fluorescent light and
fluorescent<00:00:39.180> lights<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.660> got<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.079> really

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
fluorescent lights have got a really

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.130 
fluorescent lights have got a really
discreet<00:00:40.920> spectrum<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.660> put<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:42.930> under

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
discreet spectrum so as I put this under

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.319 
discreet spectrum so as I put this under
here<00:00:43.260> you'll<00:00:43.410> see<00:00:43.620> these<00:00:44.129> very<00:00:44.460> distinct

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
here you'll see these very distinct

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.549 
here you'll see these very distinct
lines<00:00:45.570> showing<00:00:46.260> up<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.780> we<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.930> use<00:00:49.050> those<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
lines showing up and we can use those to

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.600 
lines showing up and we can use those to
counter<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.980> because<00:00:50.129> they're<00:00:50.250> extremely

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
counter it because they're extremely

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.260 
counter it because they're extremely
stable<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.860> I'm<00:00:53.610> gonna<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.879> ahead<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.059> hit

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
stable so I'm gonna go ahead and hit

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:02.360 
stable so I'm gonna go ahead and hit
save<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:56.180> then<00:00:58.550> I'll<00:00:59.550> type<00:00:59.910> CFL<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.370> I've

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
save and then I'll type CFL and I've

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.399 
save and then I'll type CFL and I've
done<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.609> before<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.180> got<00:01:03.359> these<00:01:03.480> queued

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
done this before so I got these queued

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.050 
done this before so I got these queued
up<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.489> here<00:01:05.790> where<00:01:05.970> it

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
up here and then down here where it

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.640 
up here and then down here where it
would<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.270> given<00:01:06.630> me<00:01:06.869> an<00:01:07.080> automatic

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
would have given me an automatic

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.740 
would have given me an automatic
calibration<00:01:07.890> from<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.700> previous<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.299> I'll

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
calibration from a previous one I'll

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.450 
calibration from a previous one I'll
just<00:01:09.930> say<00:01:10.080> new<00:01:10.549> go<00:01:11.549> ahead<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.850> save<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
just say new go ahead and save it and

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.370 
just say new go ahead and save it and
you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.080> lines<00:01:16.290> have

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
you can see here that the lines have

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320 
you can see here that the lines have
come<00:01:16.590> through<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.070> then<00:01:17.640> we're<00:01:17.970> gonna<00:01:18.060> try<00:01:18.299> to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
come through and then we're gonna try to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.820 
come through and then we're gonna try to
clean<00:01:18.570> out<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.780> interface<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.409> automate

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
clean out this interface and automate

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.560 
clean out this interface and automate
some<00:01:20.009> things<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.369> basically<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.909> got<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> you

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
some things but basically you got a you

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.179 
some things but basically you got a you
have<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.810> look<00:01:22.080> down<00:01:22.259> here<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.890> click

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
have to look down here it and click

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.679 
have to look down here it and click
calibrate<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:24.119> could<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.509> other<00:01:24.570> side

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
calibrate it could be on the other side

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.380 
calibrate it could be on the other side
actually<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.320> wrapping<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.490> it'll<00:01:27.240> tell

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
actually it's wrapping but it'll tell

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.700 
actually it's wrapping but it'll tell
you<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.720> look<00:01:27.840> for<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.140> middle<00:01:28.290> blue<00:01:28.500> band

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
you to look for the middle blue band

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.440 
you to look for the middle blue band
there's<00:01:29.009> three<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.340> them<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.180> I'll<00:01:30.270> click

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
there's three of them so I'll click

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.890 
there's three of them so I'll click
right<00:01:30.659> there

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
right there

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.289 
right there
and<00:01:31.079> then<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.770> great<00:01:31.950> bright<00:01:32.280> green<00:01:32.579> band<00:01:32.790> now

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
and then the great bright green band now

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.390 
and then the great bright green band now
usually<00:01:33.600> that's<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.930> single<00:01:34.530> peak<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.189> think

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
usually that's a single peak but I think

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.899 
usually that's a single peak but I think
a<00:01:35.790> reading<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.420> isn't<00:01:36.750> super<00:01:37.049> good<00:01:37.229> today

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
a reading there isn't super good today

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.160 
a reading there isn't super good today
but<00:01:38.909> once<00:01:39.180> I've<00:01:39.299> clicked<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:39.869> lose<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
but once I've clicked it we lose the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.240 
but once I've clicked it we lose the
page<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.710> actually<00:01:41.009> done<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
page and it's actually done the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.609 
page and it's actually done the
calibration<00:01:41.810> so<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:43.079> these<00:01:43.200> lines<00:01:43.380> are

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
calibration so because these lines are

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.260 
calibration so because these lines are
so<00:01:43.890> distinct<00:01:45.470> this<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> very<00:01:47.310> easy<00:01:47.790> way<00:01:48.210> for

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
so distinct this is a very easy way for

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.670 
so distinct this is a very easy way for
anyone<00:01:48.570> who<00:01:48.780> has<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> spectrometer<00:01:49.350> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
anyone who has a spectrometer to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.810 
anyone who has a spectrometer to
dissapoint<00:01:50.040> ahead<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.310> fluorescent<00:01:50.700> light

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
dissapoint ahead of fluorescent light

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.350 
dissapoint ahead of fluorescent light
and<00:01:51.060> get<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> calibration<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:53.399> now<00:01:53.579> I'm

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and get the calibration and now I'm

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.980 
and get the calibration and now I'm
gonna<00:01:54.509> reopen<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:56.540> make<00:01:57.540> sure<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:57.780> got<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
gonna reopen and make sure it's got the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.069 
gonna reopen and make sure it's got the
right<00:01:58.140> camera<00:01:58.969> and<00:01:59.969> now<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.450> actually<00:02:00.750> using

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
right camera and now it's actually using

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.020 
right camera and now it's actually using
that<00:02:01.200> most<00:02:01.409> recent<00:02:01.799> calibration<00:02:02.310> if<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:02.909> go

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
that most recent calibration if we go

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.319 
that most recent calibration if we go
ahead<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.420> switch<00:02:03.750> back<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:05.610> know<00:02:05.729> a

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
ahead and we switch back to you know a

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.669 
ahead and we switch back to you know a
xenon<00:02:07.079> light<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:08.330> we<00:02:09.330> hit<00:02:09.479> save<00:02:09.780> it'll

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
xenon light and we hit save it'll

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.100 
xenon light and we hit save it'll
actually<00:02:11.039> it'll<00:02:11.640> point<00:02:12.120> out<00:02:12.270> that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
actually it'll point out that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.750 
actually it'll point out that
the<00:02:13.380> calibration<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:13.920> only<00:02:14.100> one<00:02:14.310> minute<00:02:14.580> hold

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
the calibration is only one minute hold

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.730 
the calibration is only one minute hold
so<00:02:15.330> it'll<00:02:15.510> tell<00:02:15.630> us<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:15.930> can<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.410> use<00:02:16.530> that

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
so it'll tell us we can we can use that

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.150 
so it'll tell us we can we can use that
calibration<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:19.020> there<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.230> go

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
calibration so there you go

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.200 
calibration so there you go
this<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.910> calibration<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.540> special<00:02:21.870> workbench
