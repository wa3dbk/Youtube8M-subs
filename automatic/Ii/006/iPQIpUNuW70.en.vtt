also think he's a little on a slender

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.420 
also think he's a little on a slender
side<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.290> would<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.680> liked<00:02:04.829> him<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.009> be<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.369> a

little<00:02:05.700> broader<00:02:06.030> across<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.659> chest<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.290> I'm

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560
