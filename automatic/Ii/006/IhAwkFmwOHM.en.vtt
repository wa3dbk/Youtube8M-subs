my<00:02:16.040> specs<00:02:16.520> but<00:02:16.940> it's<00:02:17.810> actually<00:02:18.080> kind<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.290> good

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
my specs but it's actually kind of good

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.980 
my specs but it's actually kind of good
if<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.300> think<00:02:20.480> about<00:02:20.660> it

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
if you think about it

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.990 
if you think about it
because<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.770> can<00:02:22.010> flash<00:02:22.250> cannon<00:02:22.580> now<00:02:22.790> if<00:02:22.910> he

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
because I can flash cannon now if he

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.310 
because I can flash cannon now if he
goes<00:02:23.150> into<00:02:23.330> Swampert<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:23.840> can<00:02:23.990> hidden<00:02:24.170> power

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
goes into Swampert I can hidden power

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.520 
goes into Swampert I can hidden power
ice<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.000> don't<00:02:26.180> really<00:02:26.240> mind<00:02:26.600> that<00:02:26.690> isn't

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
ice so I don't really mind that isn't

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.110 
ice so I don't really mind that isn't
