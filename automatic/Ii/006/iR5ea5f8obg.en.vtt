00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 of technology everything new what is 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.609
 He has already seen it in las vegas 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.730
 now nicolás gutiérrez bad and tells us 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.139
 What is the news about? 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.269
 let's start to raise this not the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.160
 summers where this time where a lot 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.929
 people are taken to project how it comes 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.400
 2012 if some are on vacation 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.529
 looking at us right now and others 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.000
 are thinking to see what is coming of 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.250
 technology in 2012 with the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.019
 virtual graphics technology of c5n 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.400
 we are going to show you some things 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.630
 highlighted that we are in the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.789
 consumer electronics show that is the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.650
 most important technology fair 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.910
 world where there all the advances that 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.190
 they look are the technology that is going to get 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.140
 in this 2012 and also for 2013 I 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.820
 I encourage you to say and take out the magic letter 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.329
 on this side we are going to meet with 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.450
 this hospital besides telling 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.510
 technology of a little bit of computers 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.160
 and good is a notebook is a netbook 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.320
 there is not the new generation of 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.829
 computers that are called ultrabooks is 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.719
 say your ultralight computers 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.180
 ultra thin and ultra fast maybe 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.980
 we in the market know one that 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.210
 it's called macbook air which in this case is 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.030
 the one that dominates 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.290
 sales in terms of this segment are 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.000
 ideal computers for those 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.950
 people who for example have the power 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.990
 of a notebook have the power of what 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.210
 which is to generate content and power 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.130
 Browse the web 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.470
 clear be comfortable to help the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.030
 portfolio in the backpack where it is most 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.770
 light is very light 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.270
 computers really very light and in 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.399
 this year the consumer electronics show will 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.560
 have presented a lot in 2011 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.750
 intel pushed this concept of the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.520
 ultrabooks and now that many brands 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.080
 they have joined with processors extremely 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.460
 fast which is going to allow the 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.679
 people being able to navigate and do things 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.390
 multitasking in a very, very, very 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.130
 simple ultrabooks I encourage you to 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.720
 tell them they're going to think very, very, very 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.179
 strong in this year 2012 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.399
 now I remember that in the presentation 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.140
 of the macbook air that you talked about in the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.600
 presentation the chair of steve jobs in 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.720
 that moment was they took it out on paper 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.140
 of paper 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.640
 lighter than that and good in a 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.530
 moment in the apple stores it 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.330
 exhibited with a helium balloon held up to 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.590
 the foreign macbook is not how much they weigh 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.450
 these computers that practically do not 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.729
 they weigh nothing so that the one between a 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.330
 doubt between a tablet and a computer 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.490
 but you have 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.600
 next to the compu so what generates the 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.550
 question of power to generate 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.830
 really interesting good content 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.910
 but I have more I 'm going to take a little 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.440
 cunning of magic 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.490
 and I'm going to this side to see here 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.830
 I'm here saying here in this 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.570
 moment is the 3 of these little glasses are 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.340
 they will accustom everyone in the 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.260
 home they will find mom dad to the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.400
 children all to be watching the 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.750
 movies are the contents with the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.620
 new generation of televisions that 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.240
 they come that I will also speak to them 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.190
 eyeglasses projects in the area of 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.410
 passive or active technology depends on what 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.330
 have the TV are going to be furor 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.130
 already at the technology fair is in the 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.720
 Everyone was walking with a lens 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.610
 why because all the contents 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.220
 both video games and televisions 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.080
 how movies were in 3d with high 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.310
 definition is to say in a little while I'm going 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.870
 to tell about televisions that also 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.970
 they are going to think very strongly everybody 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.040
 he was wearing these glasses perhaps for the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.230
 Last year, 2011, which was the year of 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.760
 tablets one said good to walk with 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.020
 glasses all the time at home to 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.330
 being able to look at a content will be a bit 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.920
 this year is going to be the most normal 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.420
 unique world for that is going to have to 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.920
 change the TVs because in the 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.440
 cinema we are already getting used to talking 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.900
 for this, it will be necessary to renew 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.310
 of televisions with 3d technology is what 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.690
 that take this year in a little while 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.090
 story about televisions we have something 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.590
 more if I do so also appear what 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.750
 that has to do with consoles this 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.550
 we were talking last year maybe this year 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.190
 still some rumors this blanquita 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.810
 that you see here is xbox 360 the console 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.400
 microsoft and the black one that is already is 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.290
 playstation3 the two consoles that 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.700
 lead the market so far the 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.230
 new thing that there is for this console to 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.670
 xbox we have to keep in mind that 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.320
 maybe in e3 that is the fair of 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.260
 most important video game technology 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.850
 of the world is present in the xbox 720 there 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.890
 Rumors may be for this year for the 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.060
 2013 but I encourage that the consoles go 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.860
 to walk very well with respect to playstation 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.260
 3 another console that is growing 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.270
 very much and another novelty that I have 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.370
 about maybe the successor actually in 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.080
 As for portable consoles is that 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.910
 on February 22 of this year it reaches 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.200
 playstation vita a console that is 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.940
 really spectacular that we show it 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.320
 in the consumption of the collection and that is going to 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.730
 weigh very strong with double screen 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.010
 touch augmented reality games 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.840
 good many things so that people 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.610
 start having fun and I have the vedette 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.170
 these actually productions 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.150
 technological with virtual graphics 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.820
 if I do so directly it's going to look 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.989
 a television and again I'm going to come 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.130
 here for you to see the 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.730
 technology that we have here 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.200
 I'm going to count inside the television and 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.000
 I'm going to tell you what this is what 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.170
 what we are showing you is the new 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.030
 generation of smart televisions 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.730
 what we saw at the technology fair 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.190
 in the ces consumer electronics show is 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.630
 the outlet technology is to say superior 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.000
 to the LED for example we had told them 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.900
 when we arrived from las vegas that are and 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.690
 For example, I presented the 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.520
 4k technology as we met the 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.840
 h of this image resolution that is 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.030
 really interesting that has 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.770
 approximately 2 million pixels in 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.810
 the whole screen for this is a lot 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.120
 better the most advanced thing this 4k 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.710
 quadruples the hb then it's really 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.720
 awesome the televisions outlet 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.220
 that are coming will be ultra thin 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.170
 ultra aesthetic and they are also called 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.030
 smart televisions this what do you want 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.560
 say give and for example us inside 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.940
 of the television we will be able to command it 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.230
 for example with the voice we can talk 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.180
 with television so that it goes down the 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.960
 volume change channel is over 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.960
 remote control debate 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.670
 and also the remotes that 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.840
 now they are going to open with keyboards like 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.440
 if they were cell phones are the 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.630
 computers 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.460
 and garden to see the contents 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.080
 because I tell you this because they will be able to 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.120
 surf the internet to be able to have 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.160
 widgets that are the shortcuts by 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.990
 example to different platforms and so 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.730
 share the different contents more 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.300
 Beyond watching television, there's something 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.300
 the TV a little while 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:51.270
 to the internet we are in the last times 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.010
 hyperconnected internet all the time and 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.970
 this really asks you what 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.430
 we separate from the televisions 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.260
 transparent from the neighbors that's a 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.120
 thing I hope that comes soon but what 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.410
 I 'll tell you now is that this year is 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.290
 the year of smart televisions 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.880
 3-d TVs with lots and lots of 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.080
 technology and especially to do very 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.310
 intuitive will know what is coming 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.110
 in this year 2012 I hope that they have 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.520
 enjoyed great said thank you very much 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.530
 liked everything that is coming and the way 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.480
 in what presents it is doing magic 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:20.870
 almost someone with the technology that 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.870
 we have and that's it, thanks, I'm pleased
