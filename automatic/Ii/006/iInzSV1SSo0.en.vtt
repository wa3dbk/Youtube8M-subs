00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.349
 Hi, well, I'm going to explain how the hooligans program works. 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.800
 apple hayworth drug then when they get worse progre d'anvers 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.570
 or about sara is for sale 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.079
 that is very similar to the country 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.720
 and here we are here two months from the tutor the previous ones 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.989
 then it will settle let us be treated the subject 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.100
 percent of the side of the spreadsheet 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.100
 I passed through procampo 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.950
 it is known by the persistent people open the program itself 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.560
 to lower the icons a little 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.010
 what each one has 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.400
 what has program 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.860
 the hiv-1 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.860
 that serves to see the poor was unfolding days 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.880
 several votes or bombs several buttons 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.550
 in his first son is to see how the uncertainty would remain 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.120
 They are varied 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.110
 security arches page 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.700
 I can only express the rules and these 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.260
 for 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.360
 good for the to move the photos that are all imposed 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.020
 that day 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.789
 then there are forms bar forged in turn that form give 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:16.230
 It was required 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.100
 what of paracuellos 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.450
 hide or not 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.480
 p its formulate and this month here that this serves to see all forms be 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.550
 used 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.790
 we did that as I know how this presentation is already there but as 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.520
 is 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.290
 as two states 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.079
 pages is made 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.700
 its formats 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.090
 tonight 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.900
 and then afterwards it is shuffled and I started pose you do for and comments colon with 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.320
 something from the east so they do not look 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.230
 good to dose the formulas because we do not want them was going to be a bit 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.240
 per hundred more lead 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.240
 then you are going to make a new page that is being pursued 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.920
 of Quito Ecuador then that page we can pay different types of tables 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.930
 this one that is with the / is of color that is that we already have 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.349
 the basic 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:09.899
 to the appointment but with 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.479
 crazy work 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.129
 ready for fumes 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.729
 because if it is true good example away from the moments 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.319
 after clan 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.859
 sectors 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.519
 which is part has 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.349
 buttons of your tics 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.389
 for 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.389
 few and the results of the 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:32.449
 it happens that he waits in sum 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.969
 but with the brutal facts perhaps the tables this post 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.149
 to add rows 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:40.409
 you want 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.519
 little less 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.559
 very easy 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.559
 rather they remain 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:54.739
 A) Yes 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.619
 mahler then more buttons p chacho 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:01.619
 If we do, I implored 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:03.479
 the moment 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:06.479
 let's do for example 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.480
 then you will lose 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.579
 percent 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.509
 to see how much two people spend 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.509
 the person 1 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.210
 already past we can know what has happened to have less than up to 12 euros on 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.650
 the second do not wait until 13 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.350
 and the fourth month chaste 78 let's add 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.349
 bring us this 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.049
 and the two person up to 45 56 been 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:40.899
 that you can choose 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:42.249
 month 1 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:45.749
 of these the stress 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:48.749
 then we learned all 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.739
 let's read court 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.710
 which we can franky good one of the features sad people 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.679
 the powers to govern for them 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:03.679
 on the other hand bars 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.879
 Pakistan 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:12.089
 as from the person or not 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.180
 that state alberic and this is what you spend every month sources 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:20.989
 heart 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.159
 two move it 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.729
 the 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.009
 the graph 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.409
 as without being mentioned being elusive 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.409
 when doing those divestments that the very pretty 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.260
 bo now let's see respects less responsibilities that have 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.129
 the ped program 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.700
 yes we put the cure loose 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.300
 if we can go because if we buy you see things 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.199
 as suppose we buy 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.960
 percent in those years this 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.130
 thirty four triples 5 of 6 74 euros 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.240
 then the operators 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.240
 small 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:07.210
 baltar then percent like these mark boal 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.599
 the side format 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:09.620
 sun 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.099
 osasuna he was the sum 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.650
 per se would put it with two hours given ends 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.029
 then here 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:19.259
 after we want to do 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.659
 the sum of that average bet the average 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.529
 that extra 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.529
 the minimum to the maximum and the number of d 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.270
 of fairies we have ain 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.340
 after this topic is the button for this 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.199
 formats 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.419
 These guys 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.449
 comments part of that time they uploaded 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.409
 to the water page 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.120
 the castro expert to do 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.729
 all kinds of things from 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.219
 from which to power because we want 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.360
 even in the soup is integrated for more than seven hours 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.590
 Well, I do not watch videos of tÃ©lam photos either 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.490
 with the color button 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.710
 how the color of anything looks 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.710
 for example, the color is 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.050
 it crawls and this 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.050
 This is very simple 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.930
 and well there he 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.580
 the fons are left is in the inspector 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.770
 then when we select different things expert 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.610
 the Palestinian has changed shortly after in addition to a deep has 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.809
 the forecast was like this 

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:33.940
 reflection 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.099
 quesnel reflected this 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:42.449
 I shadow this issue and this with each and every thing on a stretcher and it's very 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.449
 interesting because it has things so adjust the brightness 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:47.559
 this terrain 

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:52.139
 thanks to the program is very well then let's talk to see the 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:53.809
 differences between the former mayor 

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:55.139
 and hernandez 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.819
 the percent exam 

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:02.949
 gravity the biggest star that comes but when the selection this 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:05.080
 board shaped arrangement 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.180
 and then those that overcome them 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.180
 this town the hundred graphics 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:12.040
 this event 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.600
 be more focused 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.820
 to a page 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.009
 what it is about is that it looks more hippie is much more visual 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:19.699
 the progress is simple 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:24.210
 there will be closes situ for the ibex the pattern a graph suppose 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.730
 in this field 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.069
 four clicks here the 

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:33.389
 in two clicks and these practices like these the basketball lion 

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:34.929
 many times you can see with religion
