although kr unders of yellow so that's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.430 
although kr unders of yellow so that's
really<00:00:39.320> at<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:39.530> moment<00:00:40.600> heard<00:00:41.600> a<00:00:41.840> few<00:00:41.990> vinyls

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
really at the moment heard a few vinyls

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.870 
really at the moment heard a few vinyls
on<00:00:42.560> there<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.460> few<00:00:43.670> sponsors<00:00:45.640> looks<00:00:46.640> I

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
on there and a few sponsors looks I

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.020 
on there and a few sponsors looks I
think<00:00:47.150> it<00:00:47.240> looks<00:00:47.360> quite<00:00:47.510> nice<00:00:48.880> but<00:00:49.880> the<00:00:49.970> thing

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
think it looks quite nice but the thing

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.060 
think it looks quite nice but the thing
is<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:50.420> mod<00:00:50.660> which<00:00:51.260> is<00:00:51.410> different<00:00:51.800> to<00:00:51.860> most

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
is this mod which is different to most

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.280 
is this mod which is different to most
what<00:00:52.940> this<00:00:53.300> skin<00:00:53.600> which<00:00:53.840> is<00:00:53.870> different<00:00:53.990> to

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
what this skin which is different to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.020 
what this skin which is different to
most<00:00:54.470> of<00:00:54.650> our<00:00:54.680> skins<00:00:55.010> is<00:00:55.190> that<00:00:55.400> instead<00:00:55.970> of

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
most of our skins is that instead of

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.840 
most of our skins is that instead of
just<00:00:56.150> replace<00:00:56.540> in<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:57.320> car<00:00:57.620> and<00:00:57.950> lock<00:00:58.730> the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
just replace in the the car and lock the

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.150 
just replace in the the car and lock the
teammates<00:00:59.210> car<00:00:59.570> it<00:01:00.140> replaces<00:01:00.410> a<00:01:00.770> lot<00:01:01.010> more

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
teammates car it replaces a lot more

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.190 
teammates car it replaces a lot more
than<00:01:01.280> that<00:01:01.370> replaces<00:01:01.850> your<00:01:02.420> garage<00:01:02.660> your

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
than that replaces your garage your

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.030 
than that replaces your garage your
mechanics<00:01:03.939> your<00:01:04.939> pit<00:01:05.630> crew<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:06.770> know<00:01:06.890> all

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
mechanics your pit crew you know all

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.830 
mechanics your pit crew you know all
that<00:01:07.189> sort<00:01:07.369> of<00:01:07.460> stuff<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:07.939> looks<00:01:08.540> like<00:01:08.720> a

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
that sort of stuff so it looks like a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.290 
that sort of stuff so it looks like a
complete<00:01:09.590> team<00:01:09.830> change<00:01:10.190> instead<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:10.790> just<00:01:11.090> a

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
complete team change instead of just a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.260 
complete team change instead of just a
car<00:01:11.630> replacement<00:01:12.760> you<00:01:13.760> still<00:01:13.970> select

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
car replacement you still select

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.180 
car replacement you still select

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
you can see all your mechanics were in

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.440 
you can see all your mechanics were in
the<00:01:56.149> correct<00:01:56.960> clothing<00:02:03.280> yeah<00:02:04.280> there's<00:02:04.549> walked

the correct clothing yeah there's walked

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.690 
the correct clothing yeah there's walked
out<00:02:05.600> your<00:02:05.780> teammate<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.320> those<00:02:06.440> who<00:02:06.700> wear

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.240 
out your teammate and those who wear
short<00:02:08.000> of<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.179> cauda<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.979> that's<00:02:10.130> an

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
short of the cauda and that's an

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.410 
short of the cauda and that's an
on-board<00:02:10.580> shop

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.510 

I<00:02:14.540> think<00:02:15.080> we'll<00:02:15.200> just<00:02:15.230> should<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.040> start<00:02:16.370> of

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
I think we'll just should the start of

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.460 
I think we'll just should the start of
it<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:16.910> then<00:02:17.090> I'll<00:02:17.690> cut<00:02:17.900> through<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.170> pit<00:02:18.440> stop

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
it and then I'll cut through a pit stop

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.050 
it and then I'll cut through a pit stop
so<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.010> can<00:02:19.130> see<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.640> pick<00:02:19.819> through<00:02:20.030> a
