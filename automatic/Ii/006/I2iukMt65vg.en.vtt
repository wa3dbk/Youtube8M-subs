if it happens it happens but I'm just

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.260 
if it happens it happens but I'm just
gonna<00:04:46.500> keep<00:04:46.740> playing<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.520> same<00:04:47.550> way<00:04:47.910> you<00:04:47.970> can

until<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:48.870> happens<00:04:49.230> are<00:04:49.890> things<00:04:50.130> different

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
until it happens are things different

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.430 
until it happens are things different
without<00:04:50.580> Chip<00:04:50.940> Kelly<00:04:51.210> now<00:04:51.540> there's<00:04:51.780> been<00:04:51.870> six

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
without Chip Kelly now there's been six

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.400 
without Chip Kelly now there's been six
months<00:04:52.590> um<00:04:53.160> right<00:04:53.700> now<00:04:54.480> through<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.110> summer

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
months um right now through the summer

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.950 
months um right now through the summer
so<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.710> can't<00:04:56.040> really<00:04:56.190> say<00:04:56.540> it's<00:04:57.540> been<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:57.750> little

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
so I can't really say it's been a little

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.750 
so I can't really say it's been a little
bit<00:04:58.200> different<00:04:58.620> but<00:04:58.770> for<00:04:59.160> the<00:04:59.220> most<00:04:59.370> part<00:04:59.490> is

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
bit different but for the most part is

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.600 
bit different but for the most part is
pretty<00:04:59.970> much<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.210> same<00:05:00.540> i<00:05:00.870> think<00:05:01.500> that<00:05:01.610> with

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
pretty much the same i think that with

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
think the players have had to show that

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.180 
think the players have had to show that
had<00:05:09.210> to<00:05:09.390> step<00:05:09.900> up<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.260> show<00:05:10.290> a<00:05:10.740> more

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
had to step up and show a more

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.370 
had to step up and show a more
leadership<00:05:11.580> role<00:05:12.030> especially<00:05:12.690> with<00:05:13.020> a<00:05:13.050> big

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
leadership role especially with a big

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.470 
leadership role especially with a big
figure<00:05:13.890> like<00:05:14.070> ship<00:05:14.400> leaving<00:05:14.730> yeah<00:05:15.030> everybody

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
figure like ship leaving yeah everybody

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.150 
figure like ship leaving yeah everybody
has<00:05:15.660> to<00:05:15.690> step<00:05:16.020> up<00:05:16.169> not<00:05:16.440> just<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.800> head<00:05:16.919> coach

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
has to step up not just the head coach

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.640 
has to step up not just the head coach
to<00:05:18.000> think<00:05:18.210> that<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:18.480> the<00:05:18.840> program<00:05:19.230> can<00:05:19.440> keep

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
to think that it the program can keep

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.530 
to think that it the program can keep
rolling<00:05:20.130> with<00:05:20.430> this<00:05:20.640> kind<00:05:20.910> of<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.150> aura<00:05:21.360> of

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
rolling with this kind of the aura of

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.290 
rolling with this kind of the aura of
the<00:05:22.110> swagger<00:05:22.770> of<00:05:22.980> organ<00:05:23.520> for<00:05:23.700> swagger<00:05:24.180> and

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
the swagger of organ for swagger and

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.550 
the swagger of organ for swagger and
whether<00:05:24.450> it's<00:05:24.570> overused<00:05:24.810> i<00:05:25.080> think<00:05:25.290> but<00:05:25.350> kind

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
whether it's overused i think but kind

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.900 
whether it's overused i think but kind
of<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.680> swagger<00:05:25.980> of<00:05:26.100> oregon<00:05:26.430> footballs<00:05:26.790> you

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
of the swagger of oregon footballs you

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.580 
of the swagger of oregon footballs you
think<00:05:27.060> that<00:05:27.180> can<00:05:27.330> keep

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
think that can keep

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
think that can keep
definitely<00:05:29.590> I<00:05:29.620> think<00:05:29.650> it<00:05:29.949> might<00:05:30.430> even

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
definitely I think it might even

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.909 
definitely I think it might even
increase<00:05:31.120> honestly<00:05:31.660> I<00:05:31.900> think<00:05:32.380> that<00:05:32.560> we<00:05:32.740> just

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919
