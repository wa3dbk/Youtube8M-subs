a virus that actually gets inside of
your<00:00:50.640> T<00:00:50.879> cells<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.449> replicates<00:00:52.230> its<00:00:52.410> own<00:00:52.530> RNA

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
your T cells and replicates its own RNA

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.920 
your T cells and replicates its own RNA
in<00:00:53.190> them<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.579> when<00:00:53.969> they<00:00:54.090> get<00:00:54.239> infected<00:00:54.510> your

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
in them so when they get infected your

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.569 
in them so when they get infected your
body<00:00:55.170> doesn't<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.680> anything<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.190> call<00:00:56.460> the

body doesn't have anything to call the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.670 
body doesn't have anything to call the
shots<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.239> fight<00:00:57.420> infection<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.500> makes

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
shots and to fight infection so it makes

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.040 
shots and to fight infection so it makes
more<00:00:58.949> t-cells<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.699> try<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> fix<00:01:00.239> things<00:01:00.570> which

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
more t-cells to try to fix things which

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.990 
more t-cells to try to fix things which
just<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.680> infected<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.280> caused<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> virus

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
just get infected and caused the virus

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.850 
just get infected and caused the virus
to<00:01:03.149> spread<00:01:03.270> faster<00:01:03.960> now<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.470> new<00:01:04.650> vaccine

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
to spread faster now this new vaccine

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.130 
to spread faster now this new vaccine
actually<00:01:05.339> attacks<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:06.060> body<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.720> another

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
actually attacks your body with another

actually a class of viruses that causes

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.020 
actually a class of viruses that causes

just sitting around harmlessly inside of

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.520 
just sitting around harmlessly inside of
us<00:01:17.490> about<00:01:17.909> 50<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.450> 80<00:01:18.540> percent<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:19.110> people<00:01:19.170> in

us about 50 to 80 percent of people in
the<00:01:19.560> US<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:20.070> CMV<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.850> chilling<00:01:21.720> inside<00:01:22.080> and

the US have CMV just chilling inside and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.679 
the US have CMV just chilling inside and
once<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:22.920> there<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.460> there<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:24.060> life<00:01:24.210> so

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
once it's there it's there for life so

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.359 
once it's there it's there for life so
here's<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.229> virus<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.920> already<00:01:26.070> have

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
here's this virus that we already have

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.160 
here's this virus that we already have
in<00:01:26.610> our<00:01:26.670> body<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.150> very<00:01:27.509> adept<00:01:27.840> at<00:01:27.990> dealing

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
in our body is very adept at dealing

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.859 
in our body is very adept at dealing
with<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.680> lab<00:01:29.070> team<00:01:29.400> combined<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.270> CMV<00:01:30.630> and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
with the lab team combined the CMV and

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.710 
with the lab team combined the CMV and
SIV<00:01:31.530> viruses<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.430> injected<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.060> into<00:01:33.180> monkeys

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
SIV viruses and injected it into monkeys

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.020 
SIV viruses and injected it into monkeys
and<00:01:33.900> basically<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:35.009> caused<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.670> monkeys

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
and basically it caused the monkeys

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.960 
and basically it caused the monkeys
immune<00:01:36.450> system<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.500> better<00:01:37.770> prepare<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.369> SIV
