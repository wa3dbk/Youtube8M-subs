00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello again today I am you 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.080
 I'll tell you about the exercise bike or a shooting gallery 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.240
 metal or Amed here who somehow 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.240
 just different manufacturers call it 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.650
 differently and so here you are 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.439
 exercise bike that you drive up to 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.039
 stroller or put a chair next to or 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.619
 couch no matter who is more comfortable 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.310
 change but still he just 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.859
 must 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.630
 rotate your tired legs in 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.780
 certain given directions 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.430
 I take off the plastic and want fatigue 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.680
 whip here fatigue if you just 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.780
 will sit and watch as many 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.890
 steep pedals or pedals turns your 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.480
 legs from maybe so this is true very i 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.270
 tell you this thing is useful in terms of 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.079
 morning wandering fattening and 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.629
 all that 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.719
 because everyone needs to wake up once 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.579
 move a divorce and you're still easy 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.629
 make the body parts that are available 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.190
 your brain 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.829
 and what to do with those that they 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.170
 perceive the signals they owe 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.000
 charge and that 's okay with no position 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.070
 it was natural and it happens 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.890
 curl up and you sleep and nothing about it 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.580
 you don't know, but you wake up and your feet are wet 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.560
 and why and why is it on the body so 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.869
 reacted to the natural pain and 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.330
 for him the position and legs were sweating 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.860
 although it can only be because I did not 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.250
 maybe because the injury is wrong 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.159
 long 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.140
 but this is no less so 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.200
 simulator most electron than all 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.290
 the rest here is a huge display 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.409
 buttons crowd the old school multicolored and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.110
 for each one you can click it performs a bunch 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.110
 well, let's say functions can be adjusted 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.790
 speed 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.220
 decrease and increase increased 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.409
 reduce the load 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.470
 time and all that and change 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.329
 position closed ahead depending on 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.610
 where you want your 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.700
 legs of course i could tell you about 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.530
 a bunch of operations that 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.689
 program with these buttons 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.149
 but for some reason it seems to me then this 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.920
 release will be delayed for a long time will tell 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.569
 its practices that this simulator 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.610
 used most often 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.629
 firstly because you can be on it 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.360
 lazy you seem to be doing nothing 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:20.390
 movement of the legs still present and 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.580
 this is good and secondly because 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.860
 it's easy to start practicing 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.510
 nothing is required of you you just 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.269
 drive up put your legs and everything and sit 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.120
 enjoy the process but nonetheless 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.540
 itâ€™s better somehow to penetrate it and 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.569
 help at least in terms of psychology 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.970
 still engaged in it because it is not easy 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.860
 it is necessary to vertical zero and vertical 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.870
 Zero sometimes it was damn hard 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.700
 for starters, I would recommend kneading 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.130
 legs in some kind of simulator 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.410
 or in some other way before 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.709
 vertical vertical curl then they are much 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.200
 obedient and this is pure mine 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.910
 observation 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.930
 do it more conveniently on something 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.170
 hard 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.299
 on something more mustache than a stroller and 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.220
 than sitting on a soft pillow 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.040
 when you do something in a wheelchair on 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.250
 something less stable then he you 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:22.180
 can still move a little and not 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.180
 specifically you feel the fullness of movements and 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.630
 always try to move 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.770
 connect the case or so it seems to me 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.960
 what i try 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.450
 but would still like some absurd or 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.049
 This idea seemed to help. 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.510
 and on the scale that shows the load 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.610
 there is a difference from zero and it makes me happy 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.010
 simulator as if telling me Sasha 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.680
 look your positive dynamics 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.090
 I am happy well, just like a child never 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.500
 I could not imagine that I would be 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.310
 develop such simple things 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.020
 but that's all goodbye 2013 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.890
 very cool year promised to be 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.890
 all success
