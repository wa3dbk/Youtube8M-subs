something designed specifically for
memory<00:01:47.159> nut<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.640> flip<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.060> over<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:49.740> take

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
memory nut so we flip this over and take

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.359 
memory nut so we flip this over and take
off<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.340> back<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> unit<00:01:54.350> nice<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:56.130> quite

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
off the back of the unit nice it's quite

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.550 
off the back of the unit nice it's quite
hard<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.700> undo<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.479> fully<00:01:58.380> waterproof
