00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.529
 currently partly private with one 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
 of my friends since obviously we 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.050
 did not have time to unlock 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.970
 all the camouflages 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.420
 gold so you can see a little 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.699
 little rendering of these cases words in step the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.710
 deceive the rank 10 of these cases word on your 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.860
 weapons so you see he has equipped his 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.000
 two weapons he at the asm 805 him too 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.410
 actuating my favorite weapon 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.610
 it's a colossus that makes me rather 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.930
 pleasure and I wanted to make you 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.829
 this little surprise by showing you 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.420
 how to unlock his camouflage 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.199
 to do that, we'll go right away 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.199
 on the next menu yesterday go it's gone 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.280
 then go back to the heart of 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.930
 subject passers-by following this 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.370
 video so simply since the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.340
 multiplayer mode you play in 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.260
 line created a Nazi soldier this is your 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.700
 soldier your weapons class so you have to 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.200
 obviously spend points of 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.870
 squats that you win during your 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.670
 different parts to see unlock 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.590
 the weapon classes so the more you in 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.200
 unlock more is expensive and this one 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.090
 hate au is so it's my class 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.010
 for the normal mode with the army that 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.690
 is called own badgers so this is 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.330
 class cost me 20 points the squad the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.520
 next is at 25 and the last one is at 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.330
 30 squad points required for the 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.920
 unlock so brief you take a 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.510
 class any one you go on 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.490
 the camouflage that interest you 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.910
 so unlike the previous call 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.740
 of the autumn camouflage is no longer 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.479
 as prestigious since apparently he 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.170
 is easy enough to unlock it need to 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.450
 just get 35 assistance but 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.040
 good we will serve after the first 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.320
 camouflage that you will have to unlock 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.150
 it's the camouflage snipers who 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.890
 is done simply by touching 75 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.170
 and a half with tears that you wish 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.610
 unlock the camouflage boureij as to 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.980
 it is done by killing one hundred and fifty 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.750
 enemies by squatting the 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.250
 camouflage fall so it's no longer 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.630
 as prestigious as the previous ones 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.820
 colloquia since you unlock it in 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.739
 third position with just 35 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.350
 assistance to perform to obtain it 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.150
 so there simply it is a 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.650
 camouflage that you unlock when 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.040
 you save a teammate from a death 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.510
 some 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.100
 while an enemy is in the process of 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.630
 shoot the camouflage following the 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.670
 camouflage and case it simply takes 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.709
 kill without enemies with your weapon in 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.330
 you leaning so the simpler it is 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.890
 to put yourself in a corner of the wall or 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.930
 on a truck and lean into 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.490
 pulling your joystick to the left or to 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.500
 right 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.140
 the red camouflage is obtained in 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.640
 eliminating 150 enemies with your weapon and 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.220
 welcome in this very accessory sense 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.320
 exquisitely important camouflage very 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.420
 girly in the name of caustic him gets himself 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.010
 eliminating three enemies in one 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.230
 life so we just feel a 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.069
 series of eliminations of 3 and doing 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.349
 this 25 times in a row 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.299
 croco camouflage is obtained in 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.760
 killing 40 enemies by a long shot 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.829
 distances to get the cam to the green 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.540
 you have to kill 40 and a half 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.980
 wearing so it really takes his 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.689
 limits of solid aiming one must be 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.030
 very close to the enemy it is almost 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.799
 it's got reflex often have kills 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.959
 that are done without really looking for them 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.090
 the net camouflage you just need to 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.739
 kill 500 enemies with your weapon for the 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.139
 following the challenge just in time for the 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.109
 camo track you have to kill 35 enemies with 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.549
 a weapon right after recharging so 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.260
 like this is the kind of challenge that 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.480
 naturally support as and when 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.010
 as parts for the wooded it 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.780
 you have to kill 15 enemies with your weapon 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.280
 after slipping so that's the 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.019
 little novelty of the game of sliding in 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.969
 doing the joystick if you're in 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.650
 tactical and I believe the touch round if 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.120
 you play in normal mode but I pass 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.230
 to the last two camouflage before 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.730
 tell you about camouflage 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.049
 gold since we are a little bit here to 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.730
 that's still so it's two 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.349
 camouflage that are related to your clan the 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.730
 first being clan war victory 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.530
 you just have to win a 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.840
 clan war division gold or even 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.489
 superior so it's happening in the menu 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.810
 war of clans obviously when 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.549
 you choose your party mode and 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.009
 the camouflage kiss of death him he 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.379
 go up your clan to level 23 and 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.659
 let's finally move home or camouflage 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.790
 so to get it you have to have 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.220
 unlocked all the camouflages mentioned 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.799
 previously if you spend your prestige 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.479
 or this camouflage will disappear small 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.060
 novelty of the game so you have six 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.060
 classes unlocked by character and ten 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.220
 Total characters to ride level 60 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.659
 for those who do not know it yet 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.400
 to find a clan war there you 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:33.990
 simply need to be a member of a 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.610
 clan of course or to create one 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.979
 you do in online mode 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.349
 looking for clan versus clan party and you 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.280
 can launch your two game modes if 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.590
 Are you in group 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.090

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.710
