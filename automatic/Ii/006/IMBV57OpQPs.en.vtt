00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.259
 good afternoon with you irina bagnyuk and channel 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.340
 Manor Bagir I love all sorts 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.929
 decorative herbs and today will tell 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.330
 to you about one of my favorites is bamboo 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.109
 do not see that I am much taller than him 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.300
 he's planted with me now I 'll tell you 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.910
 show you more of it here with us 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.359
 slope behind me is pretty 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.760
 steep slope here and to slope 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.000
 constantly he tends to crumble 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.719
 if it was not strengthened at the very bottom 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.420
 planted bamboo here hopefully will be seen in 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.100
 the very bottom he was a passageway when he 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.800
 here it was planted 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.039
 one of his first twigs they were 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.239
 about 50 centimeters high it is so 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.550
 there is that land is his first twigs 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.079
 was planted very small such here 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.480
 this size and 50 centimeters very 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.500
 small planted here specifically to 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.049
 he sits down a hill 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.939
 gives my slope to pour well and here 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.490
 growing gradually means bamboo is pretty 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.100
 difficult to choose to choose and I 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.100
 did quite a good job 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.040
 because firstly though we have a climate and 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.970
 winter is quite warm 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.869
 warm plus but come to -20 and this 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.740
 may last a few weeks very 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.720
 many types of bamboo they winter in such 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.090
 conditions 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.280
 so I needed to firstly have him 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.350
 wintered well and secondly bamboo 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.130
 there are those species that grow is not easy 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.850
 custom expanding and doing so 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.159
 called shutter speeds yet at a distance i 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.040
 This could not afford because 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.140
 in the first near neighbors fences well and in 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.520
 I didn't want my garden through the meter 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.860
 discover more bamboo 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.229
 so here to honor these two 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.830
 conditions had to look 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.360
 well one more condition was that their often in 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.330
 garden centers are already selling very large 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.960
 them and they can be brought only on what 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.110
 the huge machines for some reason so me 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:27.210
 came across so I took him quite a while 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.360
 searched and found the view means he has a very 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.820
 interesting 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.220
 and I didn't need to have him 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.040
 very big means this is the kind that 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.550
 grows as much as 23 meters it is his 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:44.170
 maximum he does not give you pawns on the side 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.470
 he winters to -25 at all calmly 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.750
 maybe even short and longer 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.180
 lower temperatures if 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.860
 they are not very long 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.350
 here that is, this is what I found plus 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.470
 he has very beautiful varieties 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.630
 which trunk 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.650
 black i didn't like it i don't 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.140
 wanted my trunk to be reddish 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.560
 but for now you see yellow 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.160
 these ones and with age they become 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.720
 especially until young shoots and 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.140
 greenish a little reddish I you 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.799
 I'll show them now means tell you about 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.769
 how he grows bamboo is grass therefore 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:33.459
 like any grass it grows here are the first we 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:36.730
 see here they are small they grow all 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.570
 these little ones they grow but they grow 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.790
 So slow 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.519
 next year, that is, these are all 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.610
 they won't increase much 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.760
 and every year that is, it was the first 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.370
 the following year shoots grew 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.670
 when steel became steel 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:59.350
 so strong has not grown this year 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.269
 public already now they are high now 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.760
 just clearly seen that this is exactly 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:08.530
 new escape since it has not yet revealed 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:11.079
 bot and here they are 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.920
 shoots grow even somewhere like this for 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.790
 this year let from foliage and it will be 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.549
 this year 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.500
 higher they will not grow much with each 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.229
 year they will be a little bit and stretch 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.419
 quite a bit of something that will be even higher 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.740
 it will be new shoots again 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.060
 turns out that 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.229
 every year the shoots are taller and thicker 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:39.069
 that is, the first ones that you can 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:42.580
 look first there will probably be 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:46.479
 it is difficult to see this is quite a thin 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.509
 they stick here in these already well thicker 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:53.500
 and with age all the others here it is 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:56.130
 the chair itself is even thicker over the years 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.900
 you will be fatter and fatter will grow 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:04.300
 beautiful slender fishing rods if here 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.210
 some part here starts with me 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:11.470
 fall i can all these old cut and 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:14.819
 I will see these new fishing rods so to speak 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.949
 as usual in the pictures draw 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:22.930
 bamboo forest what looks like such trunks 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:25.720
 and there somewhere at the top of their foliage that is 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.949
 who as he wants if you want a bushy bush 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:34.539
 then we leave these old ones 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:38.080
 if you want such a forest and trunks 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:40.449
 we clean means good for what 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.789
 use bamboo bamboo is very good 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:48.550
 use for those walls that is he 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.270
 it's easy to cut it very easy if it is 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.050
 interferes 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.360
 he is green not so beautiful in winter 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.330
 green as in summer but still he 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.639
 some green leaves 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.069
 Of course, showered with this need to accept 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:06.909
 what will the wall be under it with another 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:08.979
 hand it helps him to winter because 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:12.759
 that in many areas, all the same, winter is not 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:15.940
 such as in his homeland therefore this 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:18.810
 nuance helps us therefore from it very 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.979
 and very good to make a green wall 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:25.990
 only consider that 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:29.610
 replant or cut off a piece of it 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:32.680
 if it is from the ground how to chop off 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:36.940
 a piece of it is very difficult because there 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:40.030
 so strong all intertwined and tough 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.700
 such a root system and dakar not here 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:45.670
 there is such a thick pillow very hard 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.200
 so before you put him 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.720
 think where so then not 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.940
 repot and not clean 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.430
 if it grows it is easier 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:58.120
 cut to the bottom 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:01.360
 this will be enough but somehow it 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:06.280
 it is very difficult to cut here 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:10.390
 work hard then there is one of these 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:13.510
 my favorite herbs specifically showed 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:16.720
 its now when these shoots are visible 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:20.530
 to make it clear how it will grow well 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:24.070
 here is me bamboo for this summer he 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:29.320
 close here already likely to grow 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:32.050
 he rather quickly loves water more 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.710
 no care is needed but strongly 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:37.120
 you don't need to water it either 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:39.580
 it usually rains 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.830
 the only one sometimes in severely arid 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.800
 days especially if you have bamboo young 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.990
 just planted 1 year all the rest already 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:51.250
 when he is a few years old 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:55.090
 a little bit not not much much it follows 

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:59.080
 do well here so i will be glad if 

00:07:55.090 --> 00:08:00.660
 helped you with the choice of bamboo hope 

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.550
 you will succeed
