00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
you get to the size it was before so

unchecking the resample image and

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.990 
unchecking the resample image and

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
that'll make the image larger because

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.790 
that'll make the image larger because
you've<00:06:23.240> then<00:06:23.360> got<00:06:23.419> pixels<00:06:23.990> despair<00:06:24.380> which<00:06:24.590> can

you've then got pixels despair which can

then be put to use in making the image

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.980 
then be put to use in making the image
larger<00:06:28.099> or<00:06:29.000> if<00:06:29.180> you<00:06:29.270> want<00:06:29.419> to<00:06:29.510> skip<00:06:29.630> at<00:06:29.930> the

that first scenario though is usually

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.970 
that first scenario though is usually

the one that said it is pay attention

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.680 
the one that said it is pay attention
too<00:06:39.070> as<00:06:39.640> long<00:06:39.670> as<00:06:39.880> you<00:06:39.970> starting<00:06:40.330> with<00:06:40.450> a<00:06:40.480> high

a low resolution that's we can start

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.520

high enough resolution for printing and

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.550 
high enough resolution for printing and
you<00:06:50.530> need<00:06:50.710> in<00:06:50.890> it<00:06:51.040> a<00:06:51.810> larger<00:06:52.810> size<00:06:52.990> if<00:06:53.290> we<00:06:53.380> then

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
you need in it a larger size if we then

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.620 
you need in it a larger size if we then
converted<00:06:54.100> to<00:06:54.220> 300<00:06:54.610> DPI<00:06:54.910> it<00:06:54.970> might<00:06:55.180> be<00:06:55.360> it<00:06:55.450> too

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.630 
converted to 300 DPI it might be it too

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.050 
converted to 300 DPI it might be it too
small<00:06:55.870> to<00:06:56.260> use<00:06:56.440> on<00:06:56.710> there<00:06:56.890> and<00:06:57.130> the<00:06:57.340> you<00:06:57.940> know

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
small to use on there and the you know

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.300 
small to use on there and the you know
the<00:06:58.240> design<00:06:58.660> you<00:06:58.780> wanted<00:06:58.990> to<00:06:59.080> use<00:06:59.200> it<00:06:59.230> for<00:06:59.380> so<00:07:00.280> I

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310 
the design you wanted to use it for so I

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.550 
the design you wanted to use it for so I
suppose<00:07:00.610> it<00:07:00.790> for<00:07:00.970> this<00:07:01.090> first<00:07:01.840> episode<00:07:02.230> of

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 
suppose it for this first episode of

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.140 
suppose it for this first episode of
this<00:07:02.770> new<00:07:02.980> series<00:07:03.280> i'll<00:07:03.550> try<00:07:03.700> and<00:07:03.790> keep<00:07:03.940> them

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150 
this new series i'll try and keep them

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.700 
this new series i'll try and keep them
pretty<00:07:04.420> short<00:07:04.660> or<00:07:04.870> fully<00:07:05.110> under<00:07:05.350> 10<00:07:05.560> minutes

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
pretty short or fully under 10 minutes

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.190 
pretty short or fully under 10 minutes
and<00:07:06.040> I<00:07:06.130> ok<00:07:06.430> they<00:07:06.670> can<00:07:06.850> kind<00:07:07.090> of<00:07:07.180> get<00:07:07.300> dragon<00:07:08.050> all

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.200 
and I ok they can kind of get dragon all

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.440 
and I ok they can kind of get dragon all
a<00:07:08.230> bit<00:07:08.470> of<00:07:08.590> major<00:07:08.800> rambling<00:07:09.280> until<00:07:09.730> they<00:07:10.030> keep

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:10.450 
a bit of major rambling until they keep

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.150 
a bit of major rambling until they keep
it<00:07:10.630> shot<00:07:10.960> two<00:07:11.230> or<00:07:11.350> three<00:07:11.500> questions<00:07:11.860> it<00:07:12.070> was

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 
it shot two or three questions it was

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.920 
it shot two or three questions it was
two<00:07:12.310> questions<00:07:12.760> in<00:07:12.910> this<00:07:13.000> one<00:07:13.210> because<00:07:13.720> it

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930 
two questions in this one because it

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.750 
two questions in this one because it
serves<00:07:14.380> to<00:07:14.500> to<00:07:14.680> pretty<00:07:15.040> pretty<00:07:15.340> longest

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.760 
serves to to pretty pretty longest
