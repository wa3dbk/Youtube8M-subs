 area of the capes is going to intensify 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.309
 because the system 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.460
 is getting very very fast this is 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.230
 juliette that today was formed there 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.020
 in the Pacific Ocean on the other hand 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.320
 we have the tropical wave number 16 about 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.460
 what is the yucatan peninsula and this 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.860
 system will travel to me from you 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.000
 towards the west will lead 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.110
