00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello riga friends followers 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.790
 hightech news or just viewers who 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.719
 got on this video and today I tell you 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.410
 I will show the assembly of the game pack in the region of 50 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:21.390
 thousand rubles well let's start with the processor 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.550
 I chose the processor intel core i5 44 40 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.310
 without a suffix to it and then not 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.070
 accelerates this processor can 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.630
 unlock the full potential of any 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.660
 video about '23 process 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:42.829
 operates at a frequency of 3100 megahertz 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.829
 turbo boost and reaches purity in 1300 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.550
 3300 megahertz and prices in general 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.480
 is currently 11400 10 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.829
 rubles will cool our process 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.399
 coolermaster with 200 heat dissipation 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.309
 more than 8 85 th then it means without 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.400
 problems will cool our processor 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.409
 even at peak load have four 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.930
 copper heatpipe and aluminum 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:21.170
 radiator cooler to the fullest 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:24.479
 justifies its price in the forest 70 rubles 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.700
 so I chose a video card from invidia 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.759
 more precisely gtx 970 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.829
 from mss and and branded cooling twin 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.340
 for 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:38.130
 This card has full dx12 support. 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.270
 memory capacity is 4 gigabytes 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:46.670
 the video card will last 23 years on the ultra 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.670
 settings in all modern games 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.640
 motherboard chose from omass with 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.100
 intel b85 chipset 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.740
 supports maximum 32 gigabytes 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.649
 RAM or RAM 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:07.240
 and also has sata 2 and sata3 connectors 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.520
 full size board from x format 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.709
 which fully justifies its price 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.360
 due to its quality also on it 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:18.130
 possible principle if you have a processor with 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.459
 locked multiplier principle 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.720
 can be a good bit of overclocking 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.459
 drive the processor so operative 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.810
 our memory will be from 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.910
 kingston two dies of 4 gigabytes 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.670
 which operate at 1600 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.620
 megahertz budget operational payment 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:45.610
 a memory that will not yield to no 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:50.590
 inferior to more expensive ozone with large 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.239
 frequency memory does not have 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.579
 massive radiator 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:03:00.690
 which means yes and there is no point in overpaying 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:05.320
 I think this is my personal opinion. 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:11.190
 normal RAM hard disk 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:14.500
 we have a code in Austin digital for 1 terabyte 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.570
 combine the right price and the good 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.130
 quality is the only 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.760
 only hard selection options 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.709
 disk 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:32.659
 all the features you see on 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:36.189
 photos has 700 7200 revolutions per 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.189
 minute sata 3 and 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:45.969
 3.5 inches 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:49.370
 power supply chose 600 watt aerocool 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:52.639
 I looked online stores and in 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.209
 Basically, this is the best for its price. 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:04:01.810
 power supply up 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:04.120
 there are 120mm fans 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.669
 certification we have 80 plus bronze 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.799
 active cooling system for its price 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:13.219
 basically a good power supply 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:17.530
 the only one is adequate price also 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:20.299
 if quality is good even if you 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:26.449
 important and better advise the 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:30.460
 take from corsa c their series or rm. Well 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:35.360
 last we have left deepcool case 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:39.340
 form factor from x location bp lower 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.789
 housing material made of steel 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.740
 the maximum length of the video card in it you 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:48.320
 310 millimeters principle any video card 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.530
 even from gigabytes or 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.389
 this is mass and max. maximum height 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:58.780
 cooler then 165 millimeters 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:02.449
 In principle, any cooler can eat 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:06.759
 has derveys on the front panel this yusb 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:09.139
 2-legged knocked-on audio outputs 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:11.270
 installed fan it costs 20 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.440
 millimeters back fan 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.050
 In principle, a good body 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.380
 also a factory for its price of 2 thousand 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:24.300
 four hundred and forty rubles and in principle I 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.760
 counted and our assembly cost 49 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.570
 thousand rubles for whom speed is important 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:36.680
 work applications in games as you can 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:40.380
 take ssd for about 240 gigabytes 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.260
 You can take from us 240 gigabytes and 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.920
 take hard drives of the same in the stand 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:50.790
 vital for 500 gigabytes principle think 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:53.670
 this would be enough but what was with you 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.010
 hightech news will sign you subscribe
