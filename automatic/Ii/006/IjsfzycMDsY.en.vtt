00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
batteries which range from the battery

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.170 
batteries which range from the battery
percentage<00:00:50.660> increasing<00:00:51.660> from<00:00:51.870> empty<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.500> full

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
percentage increasing from empty to full

I'll give you an example this is the one
when<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.670> empty<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.680> as<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.129> see<00:00:59.359> it

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
when it's empty and as you can see it

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.030 
when it's empty and as you can see it
gets<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:03.409> and<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.860> 17th<00:01:05.430> one<00:01:05.990> ok<00:01:07.040> so

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
gets up and this is the 17th one ok so

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.300 
gets up and this is the 17th one ok so
to<00:01:08.100> make<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.729> battery<00:01:09.890> you<00:01:10.890> want<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> make<00:01:11.250> a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
to make the battery you want to make a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.219 
to make the battery you want to make a
new<00:01:12.170> picture<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.979> want<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> width<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.939> be

528<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.400> height<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:20.420> 258<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.909> then

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
528 and the height to be 258 and then

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.780 
528 and the height to be 258 and then
you<00:01:24.810> want<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.080> make<00:01:25.259> get<00:01:25.650> rid<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.159> white

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
you want to make get rid of this white

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.520 
you want to make get rid of this white
background<00:01:27.390> because<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.110> has<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.409> be

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
background because it has to be

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.990 
background because it has to be
transparent<00:01:34.009> ok<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.340> once<00:01:35.520> you've<00:01:35.700> done<00:01:35.939> that

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
transparent ok so once you've done that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.800 
transparent ok so once you've done that

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.990

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
you want to save it as battery capital B

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:10.430 
you want to save it as battery capital B
