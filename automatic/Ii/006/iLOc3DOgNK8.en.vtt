00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that's pretty damn cool and then yeah it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.069 
that's pretty damn cool and then yeah it
just<00:01:38.400> gives<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.759> an<00:01:38.939> opportunity<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.570> get

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
away and it will actually work with

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.630 
away and it will actually work with
solve<00:01:42.450> multiple<00:01:43.170> mobs<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.070> if<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.430> get

voice well there we go
oh<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.930> awesome<00:03:38.349> the<00:03:38.799> only<00:03:39.010> sort<00:03:39.250> of

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
oh it's awesome the only sort of

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.300 
oh it's awesome the only sort of
criticism<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:40.090> harbor<00:03:40.419> with<00:03:40.660> this<00:03:40.870> mod<00:03:41.139> is<00:03:41.410> the

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
criticism I harbor with this mod is the

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.300 
criticism I harbor with this mod is the
fact<00:03:42.609> that<00:03:42.790> um<00:03:43.410> it's<00:03:44.410> all<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.680> one-time-use

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
fact that um it's all a one-time-use

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.920 
fact that um it's all a one-time-use
thing<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.000> recipe<00:03:46.329> it's<00:03:46.599> kind<00:03:46.870> of

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
thing and the recipe it's kind of

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.140 
thing and the recipe it's kind of
expensive<00:03:47.530> for<00:03:47.709> one<00:03:48.099> time<00:03:48.310> used<00:03:48.579> so<00:03:49.120> I

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
expensive for one time used so I

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.690 
expensive for one time used so I
personally<00:03:49.450> think<00:03:49.690> that<00:03:50.049> once<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.769> once<00:03:51.310> time

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
personally think that once a once time

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.729 
personally think that once a once time
they<00:03:51.940> saw<00:03:52.150> buck<00:03:52.450> again<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:53.349> should<00:03:53.560> be<00:03:53.680> able

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
they saw buck again you should be able

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.159 
they saw buck again you should be able
to<00:03:53.859> pick<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.400> pick<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.090> clock<00:03:55.299> back<00:03:55.510> up<00:03:55.720> but

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
to pick the pick the clock back up but

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.749 
to pick the pick the clock back up but
it<00:03:56.260> should<00:03:56.410> have<00:03:56.500> like<00:03:56.709> a<00:03:56.739> durability<00:03:57.220> so<00:03:57.609> each

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:57.759 
it should have like a durability so each

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.030 
it should have like a durability so each
each

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
each

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.030 
each
pause<00:03:59.370> time<00:03:59.790> it<00:04:00.209> solve<00:04:00.780> uses<00:04:01.200> of<00:04:01.379> wonder

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
pause time it solve uses of wonder

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.709 
pause time it solve uses of wonder
ability<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:02.909> then<00:04:03.060> make<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.390> durability

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:03.719 
ability and then make the durability

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:05.839 
ability and then make the durability
like<00:04:04.049> 50<00:04:04.500> or<00:04:04.590> something<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:04.950> just<00:04:05.010> think<00:04:05.310> that

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
like 50 or something I just think that

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.339 
like 50 or something I just think that
will<00:04:06.000> be<00:04:06.120> solved<00:04:06.480> there<00:04:06.629> better<00:04:07.019> than<00:04:07.200> having

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
will be solved there better than having

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.399 
will be solved there better than having
to<00:04:07.560> spend<00:04:07.829> like<00:04:08.040> four<00:04:08.790> gold<00:04:09.180> one<00:04:09.629> redstone<00:04:09.900> and

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
to spend like four gold one redstone and

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.309 
to spend like four gold one redstone and
four<00:04:11.010> glowstone<00:04:11.640> all<00:04:11.969> on<00:04:12.180> this<00:04:12.299> mod<00:04:12.569> cuz<00:04:12.840> you

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
four glowstone all on this mod cuz you

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.699 
four glowstone all on this mod cuz you
know<00:04:13.469> that's<00:04:13.620> that's<00:04:14.159> kind<00:04:14.670> of<00:04:15.350> expensive<00:04:16.350> but

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
know that's that's kind of expensive but

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.920 
know that's that's kind of expensive but
you<00:04:17.130> know<00:04:17.160> it's<00:04:17.370> just<00:04:17.489> my<00:04:17.699> opinion<00:04:17.870> if<00:04:18.870> the

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
you know it's just my opinion if the

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.689 
you know it's just my opinion if the
mods<00:04:19.350> developer<00:04:19.919> doesn't<00:04:20.160> want<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.400> do<00:04:20.519> that

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
mods developer doesn't want to do that

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.430 
mods developer doesn't want to do that
then<00:04:20.910> that's<00:04:21.030> perfectly<00:04:21.660> alright

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
then that's perfectly alright

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.860
