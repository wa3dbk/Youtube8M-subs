00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.230
 I will give it especially in troye time 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.900
 getting control of the ball as if our 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.360
 advantage was missing a little 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.880
 sharpening gear forward so in 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.870
 principle owned the initiative a little bit 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.160
 add us had 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.000
 and where in front then everything would turn out but 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.400
 lost 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.060
 not very good but what guys 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.590
 all the same 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.000
 tried to play football and with good 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.590
 I consider it a rival too 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.510
 preaches such a combination style 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.880
 but I think the first one was worthy of them 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.590
 second, we tried to say that some 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.210
 moments were maybe loud 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.430
 said the approaches were as fashionable now 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.640
 speak and on the final blow in 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.230
 the players came out and it was possible to doge 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.390
 still tight opponent defense already 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.910
 it was harder to hide her 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.459
 Well, I think such a productive machin 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.650
 the future of the team is useful, you need more 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.520
 working out in training 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.380
 it turns out and continue in the same 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.090
 direction to move and everything will turn out and 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.070
 Generally no complaints of dedication is not 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.400
 wishes well duck there were mistakes we caught 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.440
 on 2 so let's say a trim made 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.739
 counterattack and the same goals we scored 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.810
 but this is football someone wins someone 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.669
 loses 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.400
 Well, in general, then today such a positive 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.470
 there is no one around down 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.080
 We will work further hurt course 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.450
 lose but here's football is always someone 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.230
 loses and someone eats away therefore 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.230
 we will work further
