00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
weapons that I talked about today so

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.100 
weapons that I talked about today so
basically<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.300> jump<00:00:42.570> into<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.870> gameplay

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
basically as we jump into the gameplay

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.130 
basically as we jump into the gameplay
you'll<00:00:43.530> start<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.920> see<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.520> use<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:45.390> three

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140

you'll start to see that I use all three
of<00:00:46.170> these<00:00:46.350> weapons<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:47.010> lot<00:00:47.309> when<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> play<00:00:48.030> in

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
of these weapons a lot when I play in

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.540 
of these weapons a lot when I play in
most<00:00:49.079> Team<00:00:49.350> Fortress<00:00:49.590> classes<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.309> you've

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
most Team Fortress classes that you've

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.299 
most Team Fortress classes that you've
seen<00:00:50.760> me<00:00:50.940> play<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.660> my<00:00:51.780> other<00:00:51.930> videos<00:00:52.320> or<00:00:52.559> just

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
seen me play in my other videos or just

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.529 
seen me play in my other videos or just
in<00:00:53.520> general<00:00:53.730> when<00:00:54.059> you're<00:00:54.180> playing<00:00:54.360> Team

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
in general when you're playing Team

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.910 
in general when you're playing Team
Fortress<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.960> lot<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.350> times<00:00:55.559> you'll<00:00:55.739> select

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
Fortress a lot of times you'll select

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.160 
Fortress a lot of times you'll select
one<00:00:56.219> weapon<00:00:56.550> usually<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.449> primary<00:00:57.870> weapon

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
one weapon usually the primary weapon

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.200 
one weapon usually the primary weapon
and<00:00:58.320> you're<00:00:59.100> pretty<00:00:59.340> much<00:00:59.489> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.789> be<00:00:59.850> using

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
and you're pretty much going to be using

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.750 
and you're pretty much going to be using
that<00:01:00.300> most<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> time<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.739> case<00:01:02.609> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
that most of the time now in the case of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.460 
that most of the time now in the case of
the<00:01:02.850> pyro<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.420> especially<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.350> this

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the pyro and especially with this

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.800 
the pyro and especially with this
loadout<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:05.070> lot<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.790> times<00:01:06.000> you're<00:01:06.420> kind<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
loadout a lot of times you're kind of

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.149 
loadout a lot of times you're kind of
switching<00:01:07.229> between<00:01:07.350> all<00:01:07.710> three<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.040> your

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
switching between all three of your

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.710 
switching between all three of your
weapons<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:09.030> get<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> use<00:01:09.450> all

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
weapons and you really get to use all

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.890 
weapons and you really get to use all
three<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.500> them<00:01:10.650> quite<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> bit<00:01:11.510> so<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> reason

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
three of them quite a bit so the reason

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.630 
three of them quite a bit so the reason
for<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.380> because<00:01:13.680> these<00:01:14.070> weapons<00:01:14.460> work

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
for this is because these weapons work

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.429 
for this is because these weapons work
really<00:01:14.880> well<00:01:15.119> together<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.960> secondary

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
really well together on the secondary

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.440 
really well together on the secondary
weapon<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.890> play<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> different<00:01:17.970> secondary

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
weapon I play a different secondary

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.390 
weapon I play a different secondary
weapon<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:18.960> when<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.259> play<00:01:19.560> pyro<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.979> usually

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
weapon but when I play pyro I usually

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.490 
weapon but when I play pyro I usually
play<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.759> degreaser<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.869> extinguisher

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
play the degreaser in the extinguisher

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.920 
play the degreaser in the extinguisher
at<00:01:22.920> least<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.850> reason<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.659> that

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
at least and the reason for that is that

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.149 
at least and the reason for that is that
the<00:01:25.409> greaser<00:01:26.060> has<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.450> reduced<00:01:28.110> weapon<00:01:28.920> switch

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the greaser has a reduced weapon switch

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.920 
the greaser has a reduced weapon switch
time<00:01:29.430> now<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> reserve<00:01:30.299> shooter<00:01:30.600> which<00:01:30.780> is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
time now at the reserve shooter which is

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.980 
time now at the reserve shooter which is
my<00:01:31.079> secondary<00:01:31.680> shotgun<00:01:32.159> also<00:01:32.610> has<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.000> reduced

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
my secondary shotgun also has a reduced

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.530 
my secondary shotgun also has a reduced
weapon<00:01:34.470> switch<00:01:34.710> time<00:01:35.009> now<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:36.150> benefit<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
weapon switch time now the benefit of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.660 
weapon switch time now the benefit of
this<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.200> basically<00:01:37.560> pairing<00:01:38.340> these<00:01:38.460> two

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
this is that basically pairing these two

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.789 
this is that basically pairing these two
weapons<00:01:38.820> together<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:40.140> shotgun<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
weapons together that shotgun and the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.590 
weapons together that shotgun and the
flamethrower<00:01:41.310> will<00:01:41.610> allow<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.299> switch

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
flamethrower will allow you to switch

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.840 
flamethrower will allow you to switch
weapons<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.229> quickly<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:44.250> whenever<00:01:44.579> you

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
weapons so quickly that whenever you

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.490 
weapons so quickly that whenever you
switch<00:01:45.180> your<00:01:45.390> weapon<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.110> pretty<00:01:46.380> much

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
switch your weapon is pretty much

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.289 
switch your weapon is pretty much
automatically<00:01:47.040> ready<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.460> go<00:01:47.610> now<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.060> you

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
automatically ready to go now if you

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.300 
automatically ready to go now if you
don't<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.229> what<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.380> mean<00:01:49.590> basically<00:01:49.799> usually

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
don't know what I mean basically usually

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.010 
don't know what I mean basically usually
whenever<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.700> switch<00:01:50.850> there's<00:01:51.659> kind<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.960> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
whenever you switch there's kind of a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.840 
whenever you switch there's kind of a
little<00:01:52.170> transition<00:01:52.890> period<00:01:53.399> time<00:01:53.640> between

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
little transition period time between

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.249 
little transition period time between
when<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.299> switch<00:01:54.509> weapons<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.049> when<00:01:55.140> your

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
when you switch weapons and when your

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.530 
when you switch weapons and when your
weapons<00:01:55.590> actually<00:01:55.979> ready<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.250> fire<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
weapons actually ready to fire and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.560 
weapons actually ready to fire and
that's<00:01:57.899> pretty<00:01:58.200> much<00:01:58.320> completely<00:01:59.570> erased

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
that's pretty much completely erased

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.240 
that's pretty much completely erased
when<00:02:00.840> you're<00:02:00.990> playing<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.439> class<00:02:01.680> now<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
when you're playing this class now the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.700 
when you're playing this class now the
benefit<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.500> using<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
benefit of that is that using the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.639 
benefit of that is that using the
extinguisher<00:02:05.340> with<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.030> weapon<00:02:06.659> switch<00:02:06.930> is

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
extinguisher with the weapon switch is

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.469 
extinguisher with the weapon switch is
that<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.099> bite<00:02:08.369> people<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.819> fire<00:02:09.060> with<00:02:09.360> your

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
that you bite people on fire with your

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.570 
that you bite people on fire with your
degreaser<00:02:10.050> or<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.560> guess<00:02:10.739> even<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.310> another

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
degreaser or I guess even in another

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.920 
degreaser or I guess even in another
class<00:02:11.849> if<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.120> were<00:02:12.209> just<00:02:12.330> playing<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.750> regular

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
class if you were just playing a regular

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.790 
class if you were just playing a regular
flamethrower

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
flamethrower

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.860 
flamethrower
something<00:02:14.070> else<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.460> then<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.240> switch<00:02:15.600> to

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
something else and then you switch to

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.510 
something else and then you switch to
the<00:02:15.990> extinguisher<00:02:16.620> you're<00:02:17.040> going<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.310> be<00:02:17.430> able

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
the extinguisher you're going to be able

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.790 
the extinguisher you're going to be able
to<00:02:17.640> deal<00:02:18.210> crits<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.900> people<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.290> are<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.500> fire

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
to deal crits to people that are on fire

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.650 
to deal crits to people that are on fire
so<00:02:20.160> being<00:02:20.400> able<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.850> light<00:02:21.180> them<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:21.420> fire<00:02:21.480> and

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
so being able to light them on fire and

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.260 
so being able to light them on fire and
then<00:02:21.990> quick<00:02:22.230> switch<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.400> rapidly<00:02:23.880> with<00:02:24.120> that

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
then quick switch so rapidly with that

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.880 
then quick switch so rapidly with that
reduced<00:02:24.630> weapon<00:02:24.960> switch<00:02:25.200> time<00:02:25.470> with<00:02:25.710> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
reduced weapon switch time with the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.840 
reduced weapon switch time with the
extinguisher<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.150> just<00:02:27.770> unbelievably

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
extinguisher is just unbelievably

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.400 
extinguisher is just unbelievably
overpowered<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.330> that's<00:02:30.870> one<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.140> reasons

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
overpowered so that's one of the reasons

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.740 
overpowered so that's one of the reasons
that<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.530> really<00:02:31.710> love<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.010> play<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.760> class<00:02:33.540> in

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
that I really love to play this class in

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.550 
that I really love to play this class in
this<00:02:33.840> loadout<00:02:34.490> so<00:02:35.490> just<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.720> couple<00:02:36.990> tips<00:02:37.260> with

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
this loadout so just a couple tips with

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.280 
this loadout so just a couple tips with
the<00:02:37.800> flamethrower<00:02:38.250> just<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:39.150> general<00:02:39.420> um<00:02:39.900> and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
the flamethrower just in general um and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.700 
the flamethrower just in general um and
degreaser<00:02:40.710> is<00:02:41.000> basically<00:02:42.170> almost<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.440> the

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
degreaser is basically almost like the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.290 
degreaser is basically almost like the
stock<00:02:43.950> flamethrower<00:02:44.430> there's<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.910> couple<00:02:45.120> of

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
stock flamethrower there's a couple of

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.870 
stock flamethrower there's a couple of
differences<00:02:45.630> one<00:02:45.960> is<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.770> has<00:02:46.880> reduced

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
differences one is that it has reduced

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.180 
differences one is that it has reduced
flame<00:02:48.390> time<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:49.020> if<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.530> like<00:02:49.800> someone<00:02:50.100> on

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
flame time so if you like someone on

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.890 
flame time so if you like someone on
fire<00:02:50.370> they're<00:02:50.580> not<00:02:50.700> going<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:50.970> stay<00:02:51.240> on<00:02:51.570> fire

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
fire they're not going to stay on fire

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.830 
fire they're not going to stay on fire
as<00:02:52.170> long<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:53.250> that's<00:02:53.760> pretty<00:02:54.030> much<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.300> only

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
as long and that's pretty much the only

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.770 
as long and that's pretty much the only
negative<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.860> I've<00:02:56.010> really<00:02:56.310> seen<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.790> now

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
negative that I've really seen to it now

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.960 
negative that I've really seen to it now
the<00:02:57.840> positives<00:02:58.470> are<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.220> do<00:02:59.490> still<00:02:59.760> have

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
the positives are that you do still have

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.300 
the positives are that you do still have
your<00:03:00.300> air<00:03:00.600> blast<00:03:00.960> so<00:03:01.710> you'll<00:03:01.830> see<00:03:02.010> me<00:03:02.130> using

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
your air blast so you'll see me using

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.330 
your air blast so you'll see me using
that<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.580> lot<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.660> gameplay<00:03:04.650> now<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.070> air

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
that a lot in the gameplay now the air

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.280 
that a lot in the gameplay now the air
blast<00:03:05.580> is<00:03:05.940> basically<00:03:06.300> one<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.960> can<00:03:07.110> push

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
blast is basically one you can push

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.150 
blast is basically one you can push
enemies<00:03:07.470> away<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:09.180> can<00:03:09.500> basically<00:03:10.500> repel

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
enemies away to you can basically repel

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.190 
enemies away to you can basically repel
projectiles<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.300> if<00:03:12.390> someone<00:03:12.660> with<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.870> rocket

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
projectiles so if someone with a rocket

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.750 
projectiles so if someone with a rocket
launcher<00:03:13.230> shoots<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.740> rocket<00:03:14.040> at<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.550> can

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
launcher shoots a rocket at you you can

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.940 
launcher shoots a rocket at you you can
air<00:03:14.940> blast<00:03:15.210> it<00:03:15.390> back<00:03:15.540> at<00:03:15.750> them<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.110> blow<00:03:16.740> them

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
air blast it back at them in blow them

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.560 
air blast it back at them in blow them
up<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.520> can<00:03:17.640> do<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.820> same<00:03:17.910> thing<00:03:18.090> with<00:03:18.209> arrows

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
up you can do the same thing with arrows

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.440 
up you can do the same thing with arrows
and<00:03:19.100> flare<00:03:20.100> gun<00:03:20.310> shots<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.880> all<00:03:21.090> kinds<00:03:21.390> of

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
and flare gun shots and all kinds of

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.150 
and flare gun shots and all kinds of
things<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.470> third<00:03:22.650> thing<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.040> can

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
things and the third thing that you can

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.060 
things and the third thing that you can
do<00:03:23.220> with<00:03:23.340> an<00:03:23.430> air<00:03:23.550> blast<00:03:23.820> is<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.330> take<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:25.070> put

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
do with an air blast is to take and put

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.300 
do with an air blast is to take and put
out<00:03:26.250> other<00:03:26.540> teammates<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.690> are<00:03:27.750> on<00:03:28.200> fire<00:03:28.650> so

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
out other teammates that are on fire so

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.040 
out other teammates that are on fire so
it<00:03:29.489> definitely<00:03:29.640> becomes<00:03:30.150> very<00:03:30.840> beneficial

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
it definitely becomes very beneficial

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.660 
it definitely becomes very beneficial
you<00:03:31.470> can<00:03:31.590> see<00:03:31.709> right<00:03:31.860> there<00:03:32.100> I<00:03:32.130> just<00:03:32.250> pushed

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
you can see right there I just pushed

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.699 
you can see right there I just pushed
that<00:03:32.850> pyro<00:03:33.120> away<00:03:33.540> from<00:03:33.900> my<00:03:34.050> medic<00:03:34.350> as<00:03:34.500> he<00:03:34.590> was

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
that pyro away from my medic as he was

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.130 
that pyro away from my medic as he was
trying<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:35.040> murder<00:03:35.220> him<00:03:35.550> so<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.630> was<00:03:36.870> able<00:03:36.989> to

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
trying to murder him so I was able to

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.740 
trying to murder him so I was able to
use<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.470> air<00:03:37.650> blast<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.130> my<00:03:38.250> advantage<00:03:38.750> now

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
use that air blast to my advantage now

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.479 
use that air blast to my advantage now
make<00:03:40.590> sure<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.860> you're<00:03:41.010> kind<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.370> paying

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
make sure that you're kind of paying

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.210 
make sure that you're kind of paying
attention<00:03:41.940> for<00:03:41.970> those<00:03:42.150> air<00:03:42.390> blast

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
attention for those air blast

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.979 
attention for those air blast
opportunities<00:03:44.220> because<00:03:44.670> in<00:03:45.360> combination

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
opportunities because in combination

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.420 
opportunities because in combination
with<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.200> reserve<00:03:46.500> shooter<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:47.040> definitely

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
with the reserve shooter it definitely

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.890 
with the reserve shooter it definitely
becomes<00:03:47.730> very<00:03:47.970> helpful<00:03:48.360> because<00:03:48.600> what<00:03:48.810> the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
becomes very helpful because what the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.229 
becomes very helpful because what the
reserve<00:03:49.230> shooter<00:03:49.500> does<00:03:49.739> is<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:50.760> mean

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
reserve shooter does is I mean

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.750 
reserve shooter does is I mean
differently<00:03:51.930> than<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.560> regular<00:03:53.040> shotgun<00:03:53.340> is

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
differently than the regular shotgun is

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.690 
differently than the regular shotgun is
that<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.000> reserve<00:03:54.330> shooter<00:03:54.720> allows<00:03:55.170> you<00:03:55.380> to

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
that the reserve shooter allows you to

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.380 
that the reserve shooter allows you to
do<00:03:56.700> many<00:03:56.970> crits<00:03:57.390> to<00:03:57.720> airborne<00:03:58.350> enemies<00:03:59.090> so<00:04:00.090> it

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
do many crits to airborne enemies so it

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.290 
do many crits to airborne enemies so it
has<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.690> reduced<00:04:01.680> ammo<00:04:02.310> capacity<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:03.030> instead

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
has a reduced ammo capacity so instead

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.390 
has a reduced ammo capacity so instead
of<00:04:03.360> like<00:04:03.600> normal<00:04:04.260> six<00:04:04.530> shots<00:04:04.770> I<00:04:04.920> think<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.220> get

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
of like normal six shots I think you get

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.340 
of like normal six shots I think you get
four<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.790> shotgun<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.239> have<00:04:06.390> three<00:04:06.870> so

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
four the shotgun you have three so

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.330 
four the shotgun you have three so
you're<00:04:07.410> gonna<00:04:07.530> want<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.800> be<00:04:07.860> careful<00:04:08.130> when

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
you're gonna want to be careful when

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.830 
you're gonna want to be careful when
you're<00:04:08.459> using<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.060> kind<00:04:09.239> of<00:04:09.330> plan<00:04:09.630> your

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
you're using it and kind of plan your

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.110 
you're using it and kind of plan your
shots<00:04:10.260> accordingly<00:04:10.860> but<00:04:11.459> if<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:11.730> can<00:04:11.910> take

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
shots accordingly but if you can take

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.699 
shots accordingly but if you can take
and<00:04:12.330> use<00:04:12.450> that<00:04:12.600> air<00:04:12.780> blast<00:04:13.080> of<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.350> degreaser

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
and use that air blast of the degreaser

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.920 
and use that air blast of the degreaser
to<00:04:14.160> pop<00:04:14.459> someone<00:04:14.760> up<00:04:14.880> on<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.060> air<00:04:15.269> then<00:04:15.720> you

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
to pop someone up on the air then you

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.020 
to pop someone up on the air then you
can<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.200> quick<00:04:16.799> switch<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.400> your<00:04:17.669> reserve

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
can a quick switch to your reserve

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.909 
can a quick switch to your reserve
shooter<00:04:18.299> again<00:04:18.510> with<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:19.109> added<00:04:19.620> quick

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
shooter again with that added quick

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.490 
shooter again with that added quick
switch<00:04:20.160> speed<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.120> then<00:04:21.630> just<00:04:21.840> finish<00:04:22.260> them

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
switch speed and then just finish them

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.350 
switch speed and then just finish them
off<00:04:22.650> in<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.890> air<00:04:23.039> now<00:04:23.340> it's<00:04:23.669> a<00:04:23.880> lot<00:04:24.060> harder

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
off in the air now it's a lot harder

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.480 
off in the air now it's a lot harder
when<00:04:25.169> I<00:04:25.200> say<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.590> like<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:26.160> just<00:04:26.190> sounds

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
when I say it like that it just sounds

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.490 
when I say it like that it just sounds
like<00:04:26.669> it's<00:04:26.910> oh<00:04:27.120> yeah

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
like it's oh yeah

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.810 
like it's oh yeah
you<00:04:27.560> just<00:04:27.740> pop<00:04:27.950> them<00:04:28.070> in<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.310> air<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:28.610> shoot

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
you just pop them in the air and shoot

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.670 
you just pop them in the air and shoot
it<00:04:28.940> off<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:29.060> shot<00:04:29.780> with<00:04:29.930> your<00:04:30.050> reserve<00:04:30.350> shooter

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
it off a shot with your reserve shooter

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.390 
it off a shot with your reserve shooter
and<00:04:30.800> you're<00:04:30.890> good<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.100> go

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
and you're good to go

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.970 
and you're good to go
um<00:04:31.970> it's<00:04:32.240> way<00:04:32.540> harder<00:04:32.810> when<00:04:33.290> I<00:04:33.320> started<00:04:33.710> trying

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
um it's way harder when I started trying

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.200 
um it's way harder when I started trying
to<00:04:34.160> play<00:04:34.310> this<00:04:34.460> class<00:04:34.700> than<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.060> actually

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
to play this class than it actually

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.460 
to play this class than it actually
looks<00:04:36.670> what<00:04:37.670> you<00:04:37.760> want<00:04:37.940> to<00:04:38.030> do<00:04:38.180> is<00:04:38.540> kind<00:04:39.140> of<00:04:39.290> try

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
looks what you want to do is kind of try

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.710 
looks what you want to do is kind of try
and<00:04:39.860> pick<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.520> people<00:04:40.850> that<00:04:41.120> are<00:04:41.270> going<00:04:41.420> to<00:04:41.540> be

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
and pick the people that are going to be

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.860 
and pick the people that are going to be
the<00:04:41.840> easiest<00:04:42.230> to<00:04:43.150> actually<00:04:44.150> mini<00:04:44.360> crits<00:04:44.660> so

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
the easiest to actually mini crits so

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.090 
the easiest to actually mini crits so
you're<00:04:45.050> gonna<00:04:45.140> want<00:04:45.380> to<00:04:45.440> look<00:04:45.560> for<00:04:45.860> people

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
you're gonna want to look for people

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.370 
you're gonna want to look for people
like<00:04:46.310> demos<00:04:46.730> you're<00:04:47.540> gonna<00:04:47.660> want<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:47.900> look<00:04:48.080> for

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
like demos you're gonna want to look for

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.380 
like demos you're gonna want to look for
soldiers<00:04:48.650> and<00:04:48.860> scouts<00:04:49.730> I<00:04:49.940> found<00:04:50.180> are<00:04:50.330> the

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
soldiers and scouts I found are the

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.850 
soldiers and scouts I found are the
easiest<00:04:50.720> people<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:51.050> kill<00:04:51.290> because<00:04:51.470> those<00:04:51.740> are

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
easiest people to kill because those are

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.020 
easiest people to kill because those are
the<00:04:51.890> people<00:04:51.950> that<00:04:52.190> are<00:04:52.340> already<00:04:52.670> going<00:04:52.760> to<00:04:52.940> be

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
the people that are already going to be

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.180 
the people that are already going to be
airborne<00:04:53.450> now<00:04:53.630> as<00:04:54.380> I<00:04:54.620> started<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:54.950> kind<00:04:55.070> of

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
airborne now as I started to kind of

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.620 
airborne now as I started to kind of
play<00:04:55.400> this<00:04:55.580> class<00:04:55.850> I<00:04:56.030> realized<00:04:56.210> that<00:04:56.510> people

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
play this class I realized that people

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.930 
play this class I realized that people
kind<00:04:56.870> of<00:04:56.990> jump<00:04:57.290> around<00:04:57.410> a<00:04:57.740> lot<00:04:57.920> and<00:04:58.160> just<00:04:58.820> in

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
kind of jump around a lot and just in

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.430 
kind of jump around a lot and just in
their<00:04:59.060> normal<00:04:59.360> game<00:04:59.540> play<00:04:59.750> like<00:04:59.990> they<00:05:00.380> think

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
their normal game play like they think

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.170 
their normal game play like they think
it's<00:05:00.710> going<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:00.860> help<00:05:01.010> them<00:05:01.220> avoid<00:05:01.520> damage<00:05:01.970> or

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
it's going to help them avoid damage or

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.510 
it's going to help them avoid damage or
whatnot<00:05:02.810> but<00:05:03.230> you'll<00:05:03.560> see<00:05:03.800> them<00:05:03.980> just<00:05:04.160> jumping

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
whatnot but you'll see them just jumping

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.820 
whatnot but you'll see them just jumping
around<00:05:04.640> like<00:05:05.060> lunatics<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:06.169> if<00:05:06.320> you<00:05:06.410> can<00:05:06.590> take

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
around like lunatics and if you can take

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.250 
around like lunatics and if you can take
advantage<00:05:07.310> of<00:05:07.550> those<00:05:07.790> periods<00:05:08.780> of<00:05:08.840> time<00:05:09.050> that

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
advantage of those periods of time that

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.990 
advantage of those periods of time that
they're<00:05:09.380> jumping<00:05:09.860> with<00:05:10.550> that<00:05:10.700> reserved

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
they're jumping with that reserved

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.500 
they're jumping with that reserved
shooter

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
shooter

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.300 
shooter
you<00:05:12.020> only<00:05:12.200> have<00:05:12.410> three<00:05:12.590> seconds<00:05:13.010> from<00:05:13.130> when

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
you only have three seconds from when

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.500 
you only have three seconds from when
you're<00:05:13.430> taking<00:05:13.730> the<00:05:13.760> gun<00:05:13.970> out<00:05:14.000> to<00:05:14.330> actually

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
you're taking the gun out to actually

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.470 
you're taking the gun out to actually
get<00:05:14.810> those<00:05:14.990> added<00:05:15.500> mini<00:05:15.710> crits<00:05:16.010> but<00:05:16.970> you<00:05:17.210> can

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
get those added mini crits but you can

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.300 
get those added mini crits but you can
actually<00:05:18.490> steal<00:05:19.490> some<00:05:19.730> kills<00:05:19.970> that<00:05:20.810> way<00:05:21.310> now

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
actually steal some kills that way now

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.580 
actually steal some kills that way now
as<00:05:22.820> I<00:05:22.970> was<00:05:23.060> saying<00:05:23.270> with<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.600> soldier<00:05:24.110> the

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
as I was saying with the soldier the

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.010 
as I was saying with the soldier the
demo<00:05:24.890> and<00:05:25.100> the<00:05:25.400> scout<00:05:25.640> those<00:05:26.450> are<00:05:26.600> the<00:05:26.660> classes

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
demo and the scout those are the classes

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.890 
demo and the scout those are the classes
that<00:05:27.050> I've<00:05:27.200> noticed<00:05:27.380> seems<00:05:27.710> to<00:05:27.890> jump<00:05:28.160> more

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
that I've noticed seems to jump more

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.120 
that I've noticed seems to jump more
strategically<00:05:29.900> so<00:05:30.140> you'll<00:05:30.380> see<00:05:30.560> your<00:05:30.770> demos

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
strategically so you'll see your demos

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.370 
strategically so you'll see your demos
sticky<00:05:31.850> jumping<00:05:32.240> and<00:05:32.419> you'll<00:05:32.540> see<00:05:32.750> the

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
sticky jumping and you'll see the

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.590 
sticky jumping and you'll see the
soldiers<00:05:34.280> taking<00:05:34.610> in<00:05:34.820> rocket<00:05:35.180> jumping<00:05:35.419> and

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
soldiers taking in rocket jumping and

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.020 
soldiers taking in rocket jumping and
then<00:05:35.690> scouts<00:05:35.990> just<00:05:36.370> obviously<00:05:37.370> they<00:05:37.520> can<00:05:37.760> jump

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
then scouts just obviously they can jump

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.420 
then scouts just obviously they can jump
all<00:05:38.300> over<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.600> place<00:05:38.630> multiple<00:05:39.410> times<00:05:39.919> so

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
all over the place multiple times so

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.400 
all over the place multiple times so
you'll<00:05:40.760> see<00:05:40.970> those<00:05:41.240> characters<00:05:41.720> airborne

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
you'll see those characters airborne

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.130 
you'll see those characters airborne
that<00:05:42.590> the<00:05:42.680> most<00:05:43.210> besides<00:05:44.210> just<00:05:44.900> the<00:05:44.960> people

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
that the most besides just the people

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.360 
that the most besides just the people
that<00:05:45.229> you<00:05:45.380> pop<00:05:45.590> into<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:45.890> air<00:05:46.040> with<00:05:46.250> the

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
that you pop into the air with the

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.409 
that you pop into the air with the
flamethrower<00:05:46.640> so<00:05:46.970> you're<00:05:47.090> gonna<00:05:47.180> want<00:05:47.390> to

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
flamethrower so you're gonna want to

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:48.700 
flamethrower so you're gonna want to
kind<00:05:47.600> of<00:05:47.630> take<00:05:47.780> advantage<00:05:48.290> of<00:05:48.470> those

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
kind of take advantage of those

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.580 
kind of take advantage of those
characters<00:05:49.220> in<00:05:49.400> particular<00:05:50.180> while<00:05:51.050> using<00:05:51.320> the

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
characters in particular while using the

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.380 
characters in particular while using the
reserve<00:05:51.890> shooter<00:05:52.310> now<00:05:52.669> the<00:05:52.760> reserve<00:05:53.120> shooter

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
reserve shooter now the reserve shooter

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.630 
reserve shooter now the reserve shooter
don't<00:05:53.930> get<00:05:54.020> me<00:05:54.110> wrong<00:05:54.169> it<00:05:54.590> has<00:05:54.800> reduced<00:05:55.430> damage

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
don't get me wrong it has reduced damage

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.780 
don't get me wrong it has reduced damage
I<00:05:55.910> think<00:05:55.940> maybe<00:05:56.870> a<00:05:56.960> little<00:05:57.140> bit<00:05:57.400> just<00:05:58.400> against

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
I think maybe a little bit just against

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.050 
I think maybe a little bit just against
regular<00:05:59.090> people<00:05:59.560> but<00:06:00.560> it<00:06:00.950> definitely<00:06:01.220> packs<00:06:01.910> a

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
regular people but it definitely packs a

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.969 
regular people but it definitely packs a
punch<00:06:02.210> I<00:06:02.360> love<00:06:02.510> the<00:06:02.660> sound<00:06:02.960> of<00:06:03.080> it<00:06:03.200> it<00:06:03.650> sounds

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
punch I love the sound of it it sounds

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.430 
punch I love the sound of it it sounds
like<00:06:04.130> it<00:06:04.280> definitely<00:06:04.669> means<00:06:04.880> business<00:06:05.440> but

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
like it definitely means business but

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.440 
like it definitely means business but
the<00:06:06.530> reserve<00:06:06.800> shooter<00:06:07.130> I<00:06:07.550> found<00:06:07.850> that<00:06:08.000> it's

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
the reserve shooter I found that it's

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.500 
the reserve shooter I found that it's
pretty<00:06:08.830> damaging<00:06:09.830> to<00:06:10.340> just<00:06:10.790> use<00:06:11.030> against

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
pretty damaging to just use against

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.270 
pretty damaging to just use against
regular<00:06:11.900> non<00:06:12.200> airborne<00:06:12.680> people<00:06:13.070> so<00:06:13.250> I

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
regular non airborne people so I

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.409 
regular non airborne people so I
wouldn't<00:06:13.760> sell<00:06:14.510> it<00:06:14.630> short<00:06:14.660> in<00:06:15.080> that<00:06:15.320> capacity

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
wouldn't sell it short in that capacity

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.270 
wouldn't sell it short in that capacity
so<00:06:17.419> basically<00:06:18.229> just<00:06:18.350> a<00:06:18.560> couple<00:06:18.710> of<00:06:18.800> tips<00:06:18.950> when

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
so basically just a couple of tips when

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.490 
so basically just a couple of tips when
you're<00:06:19.400> playing<00:06:19.669> pyro<00:06:20.000> in<00:06:20.240> general<00:06:20.540> just<00:06:21.169> spam

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
you're playing pyro in general just spam

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.310 
you're playing pyro in general just spam
your<00:06:21.710> fire<00:06:22.010> you<00:06:22.790> do<00:06:22.970> have<00:06:23.180> the<00:06:23.330> reduced<00:06:23.660> damage

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
your fire you do have the reduced damage

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.500 
your fire you do have the reduced damage
or<00:06:25.010> you<00:06:25.280> do<00:06:25.400> have<00:06:25.550> the<00:06:25.640> reduced<00:06:25.850> burn<00:06:26.180> time

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
or you do have the reduced burn time

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.110 
or you do have the reduced burn time
with<00:06:27.080> the<00:06:27.350> degreaser<00:06:28.160> but<00:06:28.340> just<00:06:28.700> spamming

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
with the degreaser but just spamming

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.969 
with the degreaser but just spamming
fire<00:06:29.330> just<00:06:29.990> lighting<00:06:30.260> people<00:06:30.380> on<00:06:30.590> fire<00:06:30.770> and

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:30.979 
fire just lighting people on fire and

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:32.890 
fire just lighting people on fire and
then<00:06:31.100> kind<00:06:31.310> of<00:06:31.400> picking<00:06:32.030> when<00:06:32.240> you<00:06:32.360> want<00:06:32.540> to<00:06:32.690> go

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
then kind of picking when you want to go

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.940 
then kind of picking when you want to go
back<00:06:33.080> to<00:06:33.260> them<00:06:33.410> while<00:06:33.560> they're<00:06:33.710> kind<00:06:33.890> of

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
back to them while they're kind of

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.620 
back to them while they're kind of
panicking<00:06:34.400> is<00:06:34.790> definitely<00:06:35.270> something<00:06:35.450> you

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
panicking is definitely something you

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.290 
panicking is definitely something you
want<00:06:35.810> to<00:06:35.840> do<00:06:36.050> so<00:06:36.979> that<00:06:37.250> about<00:06:37.400> wraps<00:06:37.669> it<00:06:38.060> up<00:06:38.120> for
