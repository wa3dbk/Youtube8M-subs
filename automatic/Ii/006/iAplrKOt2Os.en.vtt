00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
piece of legislation and thought that it

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.330

choice<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.590> very<00:02:03.770> obvious<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.850> who<00:02:05.000> you<00:02:05.090> vote

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
choice is very obvious to who you vote

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.120

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.040 
for if you don't agree if you don't
think<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.940> this<00:02:11.120> course<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.720> we've<00:02:11.870> been

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.870 
think that this course that we've been
on<00:02:12.170> for<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.440> last<00:02:12.500> four<00:02:12.950> years<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.520> what<00:02:13.730> you

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
on for the last four years is what you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.400 
on for the last four years is what you
would<00:02:13.970> like<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.330> see<00:02:14.510> us<00:02:14.540> fall<00:02:14.900> over<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.170> next

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
would like to see us fall over the next

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.510 
would like to see us fall over the next
four<00:02:16.209> then<00:02:17.209> I<00:02:17.540> could<00:02:18.200> suggest<00:02:18.620> another<00:02:19.190> choice

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
four then I could suggest another choice

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.360 
four then I could suggest another choice
that<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.120> have
