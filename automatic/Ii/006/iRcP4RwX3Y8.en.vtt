00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
need my hi-hat is high but it does come

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.910 
need my hi-hat is high but it does come
with<00:00:34.219> one<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:36.590> will<00:00:37.590> give<00:00:37.770> you

with one that will give you
approximately<00:00:39.020> that<00:00:40.020> much<00:00:40.320> more<00:00:40.559> height

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
approximately that much more height

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.040 
approximately that much more height
which<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.149> cool<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.540> know<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:42.809> it's

which is just cool you know it's it's

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.770 
which is just cool you know it's it's
something<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.530> not<00:00:43.770> every<00:00:44.600> hi-hat<00:00:45.600> stand

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
something that not every hi-hat stand

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.110 
something that not every hi-hat stand
comes<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.680> really<00:00:47.250> appreciate<00:00:47.670> DW

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
comes with so I really appreciate DW

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.150 
comes with so I really appreciate DW
thinking<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.649> then<00:00:49.649> we're<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
thinking of that then we're going to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.310 
thinking of that then we're going to
look<00:00:50.219> at<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.399> hi-hat<00:00:50.760> clutch<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:52.170> is

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
look at the hi-hat clutch and this is

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.990 
look at the hi-hat clutch and this is
their<00:00:52.469> standard<00:00:52.739> locking<00:00:53.340> hi-hat<00:00:53.760> clutch

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
their standard locking hi-hat clutch

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.150 
their standard locking hi-hat clutch
I've<00:00:54.270> actually<00:00:54.600> never<00:00:54.930> owned<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.559> locking

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
I've actually never owned a locking

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.209 
I've actually never owned a locking
hi-hat<00:00:56.520> clutch<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.059> at<00:00:57.719> first<00:00:57.930> glance<00:00:58.219> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
hi-hat clutch and at first glance it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.250 
hi-hat clutch and at first glance it
just<00:00:59.489> looks<00:00:59.699> like<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.449> going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.870> screw

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
just looks like this is going to screw

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.100 
just looks like this is going to screw
in<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.300> mess<00:01:03.480> up<00:01:03.629> your<00:01:03.780> threads

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
in and and you know mess up your threads

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.609 
in and and you know mess up your threads
but<00:01:04.920> upon<00:01:05.430> further<00:01:05.460> investigation<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:07.350> can't

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
but upon further investigation you can't

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.590 
but upon further investigation you can't
really<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.150> look<00:01:09.299> inside

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
really see it but if you look inside

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.289 
really see it but if you look inside
there<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.560> doesn't<00:01:10.920> actually<00:01:11.369> screw<00:01:12.090> down

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
there this doesn't actually screw down

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.620 
there this doesn't actually screw down
on<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.900> threads<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.439> pushes<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.400> whole<00:01:15.210> section

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
on the threads it pushes a whole section

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.160 
on the threads it pushes a whole section
of<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.200> threads<00:01:17.509> this<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.689> hard<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.049> it

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
of the threads this is hard to do it

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.109 
of the threads this is hard to do it
with<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:19.650> hand<00:01:19.799> holding<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.189> camera<00:01:20.400> it

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
with just one hand holding the camera it

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.999 
with just one hand holding the camera it
pushes<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> whole<00:01:21.869> section<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> threads

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
pushes a whole section of the threads

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.429 
pushes a whole section of the threads
that<00:01:23.130> way<00:01:25.130> so<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.259> pretty

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
that way so it's it's just it's a pretty

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.950 
that way so it's it's just it's a pretty
brilliant<00:01:28.650> design<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.310> well<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.450> won't

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
brilliant design as well so it won't

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.469 
brilliant design as well so it won't
mess<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.350> your<00:01:31.680> your<00:01:32.430> threads<00:01:32.820> inside<00:01:33.240> there

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
mess up your your threads inside there

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.090 
mess up your your threads inside there
which<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.990> great<00:01:34.610> then<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:36.180> go<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:37.770> little

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
which is great then we go to this little

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.240 
which is great then we go to this little
guy<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.700> I've<00:01:39.630> never<00:01:39.990> really<00:01:40.500> used<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:41.009> but

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
guy and I've never really used this but

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.880 
guy and I've never really used this but
this<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.030> thing<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:45.119> kind<00:01:45.360> of

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
this is just a thing to to kind of

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.420 
this is just a thing to to kind of
actually<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> don't<00:01:46.979> even<00:01:47.130> know<00:01:47.280> what<00:01:47.369> this

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
actually I don't even know what this

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.120 
actually I don't even know what this
does<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.909> mean<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.960> guess<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:49.770> kind<00:01:50.009> of

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
does I mean I guess it just kind of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.730 
does I mean I guess it just kind of
sizzles<00:01:50.670> your<00:01:50.820> hi-hat<00:01:51.149> some<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:52.710> can

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
sizzles your hi-hat some more you can

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.590 
sizzles your hi-hat some more you can
raise<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.520> lower<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.090> I'll<00:01:54.210> keep<00:01:54.390> it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
raise and lower that but I'll keep it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.620 
raise and lower that but I'll keep it
kind<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.020> flat<00:01:56.030> then<00:01:57.030> again<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
kind of flat then again we have the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.719 
kind of flat then again we have the
memory<00:01:58.020> locks<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.909> this<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.210> course<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.990> a

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
memory locks and this of course is a

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.550 
memory locks and this of course is a
really<00:02:02.729> great<00:02:03.119> thing<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:04.079> around

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
really great thing to have around

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.249 
really great thing to have around
and<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:05.280> hi-hat<00:02:05.670> stand<00:02:05.820> comes<00:02:06.270> with<00:02:06.570> this

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
and this hi-hat stand comes with this

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.400 
and this hi-hat stand comes with this
plastic<00:02:07.920> clip<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.580> drum<00:02:09.450> key<00:02:09.690> holder<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.229> with

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
plastic clip on drum key holder and with

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.809 
plastic clip on drum key holder and with
the<00:02:10.500> drum<00:02:10.709> key<00:02:10.920> so

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
the drum key so

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.610 
the drum key so
that's<00:02:12.090> just<00:02:12.299> another<00:02:12.569> thing<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.290> thought

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
that's just another thing that I thought

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.449 
that's just another thing that I thought
was<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.860> great<00:02:14.129> addition<00:02:15.950> also<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.069> have<00:02:17.220> the

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
was a great addition also we have the

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.220 
was a great addition also we have the
actually<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.390> don't<00:02:18.450> think<00:02:18.569> we<00:02:18.780> have<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.019> steel

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
actually I don't think we have the steel

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.530 
actually I don't think we have the steel
piping<00:02:19.620> or<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.400> PVC<00:02:20.819> type<00:02:21.030> piping<00:02:21.450> in

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
piping or the the PVC type piping in

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.020 
piping or the the PVC type piping in
there<00:02:21.890> then<00:02:22.890> we<00:02:23.069> go<00:02:23.189> to<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.579> double<00:02:23.819> braced

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
there then we go to the double braced

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.410 
there then we go to the double braced
legs<00:02:24.269> which<00:02:25.230> are<00:02:25.319> awesome<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:26.090> then<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.209> go<00:02:27.360> to

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
legs which are awesome and then we go to

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.860 
legs which are awesome and then we go to
the<00:02:28.200> very<00:02:28.349> bottom<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.129> the<00:02:29.340> hi-hat<00:02:29.730> which<00:02:30.540> this

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the very bottom of the hi-hat which this

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.339 
the very bottom of the hi-hat which this
has<00:02:31.079> a<00:02:31.110> steel<00:02:31.650> plate<00:02:32.340> footplate<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:34.230> has

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
there and and then also another cool

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.259 
there and and then also another cool
thing<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.359> you<00:03:21.599> can<00:03:22.400> you<00:03:23.400> know<00:03:23.519> adjust<00:03:24.000> the

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
thing is you can you know adjust the

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.430 
thing is you can you know adjust the
tension<00:03:25.169> level<00:03:25.349> of<00:03:25.650> your<00:03:26.069> actual<00:03:26.459> foot<00:03:27.440> so

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
tension level of your actual foot so

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.879 
tension level of your actual foot so
you're<00:03:28.709> going<00:03:28.859> to<00:03:29.120> unscrew<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.329> a<00:03:30.889> little

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
you're going to unscrew that a little

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.960 
you're going to unscrew that a little
bit<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.250> then<00:03:32.879> you<00:03:33.120> have<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.329> little<00:03:33.629> knob<00:03:33.780> that

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
bit and then you have a little knob that

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:42.080 
bit and then you have a little knob that
makes<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.120> harder<00:03:36.569> or<00:03:39.829> makes<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:40.949> softer<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:42.060> I

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
makes it harder or makes a softer so I

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.610 
makes it harder or makes a softer so I
think<00:03:42.389> that's<00:03:42.569> really<00:03:42.690> cool<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:43.230> was<00:03:43.410> actually

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
think that's really cool I was actually

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.099 
think that's really cool I was actually
looking<00:03:43.919> for<00:03:44.099> that<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.489> just<00:03:44.699> now<00:03:44.849> found<00:03:45.120> it

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
looking for that and just now found it

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.539 
looking for that and just now found it
way<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.650> go<00:03:46.829> DW<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:48.209> fold<00:03:48.449> it<00:03:48.569> up<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.900> just<00:03:49.549> undo

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
way to go DW to fold it up you just undo

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.839 
way to go DW to fold it up you just undo
these<00:03:50.730> little<00:03:51.329> guys<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.810> then<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.739> just<00:03:53.310> pull

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
these little guys and then you just pull

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.210 
these little guys and then you just pull
up<00:03:54.030> like<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.449> and<00:03:55.079> when<00:03:55.590> this<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:55.949> out<00:03:56.069> of<00:03:56.099> the

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
up like that and when this is out of the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.949 
up like that and when this is out of the
way<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.699> actually<00:03:57.120> folds<00:03:57.299> up<00:03:57.540> really<00:03:57.750> nice<00:03:57.930> and

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
way it actually folds up really nice and

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.409 
way it actually folds up really nice and
neat<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.409> will<00:03:58.680> go<00:03:58.859> right<00:03:59.819> in<00:03:59.970> your<00:04:00.120> hardware

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
neat and will go right in your hardware

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.659 
neat and will go right in your hardware
