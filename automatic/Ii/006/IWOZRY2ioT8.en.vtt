can<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:39.030> twice<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.360> work<00:01:39.659> at<00:01:39.840> once<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.710> squash

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
can do twice the work at once the squash

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.160 
can do twice the work at once the squash
and<00:01:41.189> zucchini<00:01:41.250> both<00:01:41.880> took<00:01:42.090> about<00:01:42.360> 17<00:01:42.990> minutes

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and zucchini both took about 17 minutes

to<00:01:43.500> steam<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.009> carrots<00:01:44.399> took<00:01:44.640> about<00:01:44.880> half<00:01:44.939> an

to steam the carrots took about half an
hour<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.570> steam<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.649> what's<00:01:46.770> great<00:01:47.009> is

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
hour to steam and then what's great is

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
hour to steam and then what's great is
the<00:01:47.250> train<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.700> bottom<00:01:48.119> will<00:01:48.329> gather<00:01:48.630> all<00:01:49.020> of

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the train the bottom will gather all of

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.840 
the train the bottom will gather all of
the<00:01:49.320> liquid<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> lot<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.340> nutrients

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the liquid and a lot of the nutrients

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.660 
the liquid and a lot of the nutrients
that<00:01:50.939> run<00:01:51.240> out<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.140> vegetable<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.799> it

that run out of the vegetable as it

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.520 
that run out of the vegetable as it
steams<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.360> want<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.600> save<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.930> water

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
steams you want to save that water

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.260 
steams you want to save that water
because<00:01:56.009> when<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> puree<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.090> can

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
because when you do the puree you can

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.060 
because when you do the puree you can
pour<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.380> you're<00:01:58.560> maintaining

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
pour that in and so you're maintaining

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.310 
pour that in and so you're maintaining
all<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.880> those<00:01:59.969> nutrients<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.810> you're<00:02:01.170> not

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
all of those nutrients and you're not

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.289 
all of those nutrients and you're not
adding<00:02:01.530> water<00:02:01.950> or<00:02:02.280> fruit<00:02:02.490> juice<00:02:02.549> or<00:02:02.939> sugar<00:02:03.180> or
