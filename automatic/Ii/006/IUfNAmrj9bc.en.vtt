00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello how are you here the thing of the 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.520
 welcome back to my channel and 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.830
 today's design is inspired by 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.540
 comments that have made me about 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.670
 in the schools they do not let them use 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.519
 very strong and extravagant colors as well 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.389
 that today's design is for you as well 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.389
 that we go to the workshop 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.600
 excellent we are already in the workshop and for 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.420
 today as the design has to 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.750
 be very very clear I have a base in 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.910
 my case I chose a color that is low in 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.280
 the dark or that illuminate darkness that is 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.730
 transparent but you can use a 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.739
 transparent color or these colors 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.440
 that are translucent that they use to make 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.780
 French can also use it but 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.250
 I love this one that is here that although 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.600
 can not show them because 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.370
 obviously I would need a special light 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.409
 when it is charged with light it is seen in the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.300
 darkness then for me it 's magical in 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.309
 the school will not realize that 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.559
 you have an incredible color and in the night 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.650
 when you upload to the light you go 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.890
 realize that you have 12 unai very lar 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.260
 bright ready to complement this 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.170
 design what I'm going to do is that with 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.880
 little dots of different colors like that in the 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.370
 mobile space today I'm doing the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.720
 slow enough video for you 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.120
 can see what the process is like 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.790
 but here I chose different colors 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.230
 I know it depends on the school of the veils 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.220
 of the school that you have can 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.260
 use some colors or not, and I hope 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.630
 those who are here can use them but 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.730
 you can simply do it blank or 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.930
 in a very light pink in a very blue 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:44.700
 clear and you will like it very much for sure 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.700
 here I finish with my last point 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.350
 I continue with the cleaning you know how is the 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.630
 technique that I like more seed to make 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.980
 and if you come here I'm also making a 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.890
 last layer 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.870
 with the enamel globe in the dark or the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.730
 that illuminate the darkness if not what 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.890
 they get in their country because I told you 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.750
 can use a translucent color or 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.340
 simply transparent if they like it 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.100

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.210
 college if pierre thomas of photos and 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.340
