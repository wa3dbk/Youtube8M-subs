I've heard of them or looking forward to
them<00:03:25.540> so<00:03:25.840> first<00:03:26.769> on<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.100> list<00:03:27.340> is<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.700> movie

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
them so first on the list is a movie

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.880 
them so first on the list is a movie
called<00:03:28.450> oculus<00:03:29.049> I<00:03:29.230> believe<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.590> that's<00:03:29.739> how

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
called oculus I believe it that's how

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.039 
called oculus I believe it that's how
you<00:03:29.950> pronounce<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.600> it's<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.690> horror<00:03:31.989> movie

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
you pronounce it it's a horror movie

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.320 
you pronounce it it's a horror movie
it's<00:03:32.380> about<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.799> guess<00:03:33.010> like<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.670> family<00:03:34.180> that

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
it's about I guess like a family that

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
it's about I guess like a family that
lives<00:03:34.480> in<00:03:34.570> this<00:03:34.630> house<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.080> there's<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:35.290> a

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
lives in this house and there's like a

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.259 
lives in this house and there's like a
haunted<00:03:35.560> mirror<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:37.000> looks<00:03:37.150> really

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
haunted mirror and it looks really

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.220 
haunted mirror and it looks really
interesting<00:03:37.390> it's<00:03:37.840> kind<00:03:37.959> of<00:03:37.989> one<00:03:38.140> of<00:03:38.170> those

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
interesting it's kind of one of those

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.229 
interesting it's kind of one of those
scary<00:03:38.620> movies<00:03:38.650> it's<00:03:39.100> like<00:03:39.340> it's<00:03:40.030> kinda<00:03:40.180> like

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
scary movies it's like it's kinda like

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.060 
scary movies it's like it's kinda like
this<00:03:40.390> there's<00:03:41.049> a<00:03:41.110> lot<00:03:41.170> of<00:03:41.260> deception<00:03:41.709> it's

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
this there's a lot of deception it's

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.310 
this there's a lot of deception it's
kind<00:03:42.310> of<00:03:42.340> confusing<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:43.329> there's<00:03:44.200> like<00:03:44.260> a

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
kind of confusing and there's like a

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.960 
kind of confusing and there's like a
backstory<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:45.010> makes<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.340> even<00:03:45.459> more<00:03:45.579> creepy

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
backstory that makes it even more creepy

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.370 
backstory that makes it even more creepy
and<00:03:46.299> of<00:03:46.390> course<00:03:46.600> there's<00:03:46.750> just<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.049> creepy

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
and of course there's just the creepy

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.420 
and of course there's just the creepy
things<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:47.680> happen<00:03:47.950> throughout<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.220> movie

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
things that happen throughout the movie

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.819 
things that happen throughout the movie
so<00:03:48.519> it<00:03:48.579> looks<00:03:48.730> really<00:03:48.940> good<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:50.320> then<00:03:50.470> there

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
so it looks really good and then there

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.280 
so it looks really good and then there
is<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.579> purge<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.420> second<00:03:52.780> purge<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.140> think

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
is the purge the second purge I think

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.900 
is the purge the second purge I think
it's<00:03:53.410> called<00:03:53.560> like<00:03:53.709> anarchy<00:03:54.459> I'm<00:03:54.700> not<00:03:54.850> a

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
it's called like anarchy I'm not a

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.640 
it's called like anarchy I'm not a
hundred<00:03:55.090> percent<00:03:55.209> sure<00:03:55.450> but<00:03:56.200> as<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.320> second

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
hundred percent sure but as a second

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.039 
hundred percent sure but as a second
purge<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:56.980> that<00:03:57.100> looks<00:03:57.220> really<00:03:57.519> interesting

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
purge and that looks really interesting

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.380 
purge and that looks really interesting
I<00:03:59.100> kind<00:04:00.100> of<00:04:00.190> like<00:04:00.250> movies<00:04:00.640> that<00:04:00.820> like<00:04:01.030> have

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
I kind of like movies that like have

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.319 
I kind of like movies that like have
scenarios<00:04:01.810> that<00:04:02.519> aren't<00:04:03.519> realistic<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.209> that

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
scenarios that aren't realistic and that

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.840 
scenarios that aren't realistic and that
are<00:04:04.390> never<00:04:04.600> going<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.780> happen<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:06.400> kind<00:04:06.579> of<00:04:06.640> see

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
are never going to happen to kind of see

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.500
