proven on the river that our stuff holds

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.420 
proven on the river that our stuff holds
up<00:01:14.430> really<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:15.030> well<00:01:15.710> why<00:01:16.710> does<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.009> fit

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
up really really well why does it fit

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.460 
up really really well why does it fit
well<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.790> our<00:01:17.880> line<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.270> our<00:01:18.450> ultimate<00:01:18.630> pal<00:01:19.080> it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
well in our line is our ultimate pal it

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.380 
well in our line is our ultimate pal it
really<00:01:19.860> comes<00:01:20.070> down<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.549> buoyancy<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
really comes down to the buoyancy and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.929 
really comes down to the buoyancy and
the<00:01:21.509> blades<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.530> although<00:01:22.830> very<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:23.549> strong

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
the blades so although very very strong

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.140 
the blades so although very very strong
they<00:01:24.570> float<00:01:25.110> really<00:01:25.830> high<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> water<00:01:26.490> so

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
they float really high on the water so

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.749 
they float really high on the water so
for<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> beginner<00:01:28.290> learning<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> role<00:01:29.549> in

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
for the beginner learning that a role in

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.149 
for the beginner learning that a role in
the<00:01:29.850> eddy<00:01:30.030> learning<00:01:30.900> their<00:01:31.020> first<00:01:31.049> braces<00:01:31.890> it

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the eddy learning their first braces it

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.190 
the eddy learning their first braces it
gives<00:01:32.369> them<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> lot<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.759> confidence<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.780> then

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
gives them a lot of confidence and then

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.649 
gives them a lot of confidence and then
for<00:01:34.439> boaters<00:01:34.650> at<00:01:34.920> our<00:01:35.070> level<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:36.360> know<00:01:36.420> think

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
for boaters at our level you know think
