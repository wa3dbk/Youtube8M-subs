00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.600 

so<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.500> can<00:02:14.590> see<00:02:14.710> up<00:02:14.830> here<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.190> estimated

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
so you can see up here the estimated

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.240 
so you can see up here the estimated
earnings<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:17.500> we're<00:02:17.740> a<00:02:17.770> little<00:02:18.070> bit

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
earnings the that we're a little bit

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.150 
earnings the that we're a little bit
more<00:02:18.460> than<00:02:18.670> double<00:02:19.060> for<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.390> second<00:02:19.810> period

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
more than double for the second period

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.670 
more than double for the second period
after<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.340> theme<00:02:22.300> was<00:02:22.660> applied<00:02:23.110> now<00:02:23.410> all

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
after the theme was applied now all

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.590 
after the theme was applied now all
things<00:02:23.980> being<00:02:24.220> equal<00:02:24.400> while<00:02:25.150> we<00:02:25.300> did<00:02:25.420> more

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
things being equal while we did more

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.260 
things being equal while we did more
than<00:02:25.660> double<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.410> revenue<00:02:26.920> we<00:02:27.640> did<00:02:27.790> also<00:02:27.970> have

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
than double the revenue we did also have

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.650 
than double the revenue we did also have
an<00:02:28.390> increase<00:02:28.720> in<00:02:28.930> page<00:02:29.350> use<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:31.210> that<00:02:31.240> could<00:02:31.630> be

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
an increase in page use so that could be

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.030 
an increase in page use so that could be
seasonal<00:02:32.230> there's<00:02:32.410> many<00:02:32.620> different<00:02:32.710> factors

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
seasonal there's many different factors

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.560 
seasonal there's many different factors
here<00:02:33.340> but<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:33.580> would<00:02:33.940> want<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.390> know<00:02:34.540> that

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
here but I would want you to know that

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.360 
here but I would want you to know that
that<00:02:35.230> there<00:02:35.410> was<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.590> little<00:02:35.800> bit<00:02:35.980> more<00:02:36.100> traffic

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
that there was a little bit more traffic

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.540 
that there was a little bit more traffic
about<00:02:36.910> six<00:02:37.870> percent<00:02:38.050> of<00:02:38.590> increase<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:39.040> traffic

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
about six percent of increase of traffic

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.660 
about six percent of increase of traffic
but<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.720> is<00:02:40.960> negligible<00:02:41.800> compared<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.520> the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
but that is negligible compared to the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.660 
but that is negligible compared to the
revenue<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.270> was<00:02:43.810> increased<00:02:44.230> by<00:02:44.670> applying

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
revenue that was increased by applying

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.240 
revenue that was increased by applying
this<00:02:45.940> theme<00:02:46.240> that's<00:02:46.510> designed<00:02:46.960> to<00:02:47.250> to

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
this theme that's designed to to

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.040 
this theme that's designed to to
monetize<00:02:48.730> WordPress<00:02:50.190> websites<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:52.180> again<00:02:52.750> I

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
monetize WordPress websites so again I

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.160 
monetize WordPress websites so again I
think<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:53.770> this<00:02:54.400> theme<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.970> certainly<00:02:55.959> worth

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
think that this theme is certainly worth

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.310 
think that this theme is certainly worth
