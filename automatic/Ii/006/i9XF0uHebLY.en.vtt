another<00:00:35.980> reason<00:00:36.190> why<00:00:36.309> I<00:00:36.370> think<00:00:36.399> it's<00:00:36.640> kenchi

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
another reason why I think it's kenchi

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.229 
another reason why I think it's kenchi
is<00:00:37.149> because<00:00:37.510> it<00:00:37.750> blooms<00:00:38.230> to<00:00:38.829> put<00:00:39.219> her<00:00:39.309> on<00:00:39.579> that

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
is because it blooms to put her on that

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.090 
is because it blooms to put her on that
tweet<00:00:40.510> he<00:00:40.629> put<00:00:40.840> it<00:00:40.960> but<00:00:41.320> in<00:00:41.469> the<00:00:41.590> about<00:00:41.980> that

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
tweet he put it but in the about that

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.590 
tweet he put it but in the about that
motion<00:00:42.280> capture<00:00:42.760> thing<00:00:42.940> where<00:00:43.090> they<00:00:43.180> capture

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
motion capture thing where they capture

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.530 
motion capture thing where they capture
you<00:00:43.780> know<00:00:43.950> cutscenes<00:00:44.950> or<00:00:45.190> whatever<00:00:45.489> they<00:00:46.150> he

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
you know cutscenes or whatever they he

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.319 
you know cutscenes or whatever they he
put<00:00:46.720> a<00:00:46.750> picture<00:00:47.079> of<00:00:47.560> a<00:00:48.100> person<00:00:48.340> moment

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
put a picture of a person moment

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.889 
put a picture of a person moment
capturing<00:00:50.280> obvious<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.489> obvious<00:00:51.940> can<00:00:52.690> she

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
capturing obvious and obvious can she

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.720 
capturing obvious and obvious can she
pose<00:00:53.140> like<00:00:53.530> with<00:00:53.710> his<00:00:53.860> fingers<00:00:54.280> towards<00:00:54.610> his

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
pose like with his fingers towards his

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.420 
pose like with his fingers towards his
head<00:00:54.940> and<00:00:55.120> stuff<00:00:55.300> obviously<00:00:55.720> this<00:00:56.260> kimchi<00:00:56.530> now

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
head and stuff obviously this kimchi now

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.010 
head and stuff obviously this kimchi now
the<00:00:57.489> reason<00:00:57.820> why<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:57.970> think<00:00:58.090> this<00:00:58.329> kimchi<00:00:58.660> is

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
the reason why I think this kimchi is

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.660 
the reason why I think this kimchi is
because<00:00:59.530> when<00:00:59.680> he<00:00:59.770> tweeted<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.100> picture<00:01:00.250> of

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
because when he tweeted that picture of

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.430 
because when he tweeted that picture of
the<00:01:00.760> guy<00:01:00.880> in<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.090> motion<00:01:01.390> capture<00:01:01.719> suit<00:01:01.930> with

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
the guy in the motion capture suit with

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.069 
the guy in the motion capture suit with
the<00:01:02.559> obvious<00:01:03.010> can<00:01:03.820> she<00:01:04.030> pose<00:01:04.239> with<00:01:04.509> the<00:01:04.629> oldest

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
the obvious can she pose with the oldest

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:06.510 
the obvious can she pose with the oldest
fingers<00:01:05.350> towards<00:01:05.590> his<00:01:05.680> head<00:01:05.860> because<00:01:06.490> he

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
fingers towards his head because he

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.190 
fingers towards his head because he
never<00:01:06.880> really<00:01:07.119> talked<00:01:07.450> about<00:01:07.570> it<00:01:07.750> like<00:01:07.930> after

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
never really talked about it like after

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.350 
never really talked about it like after
a<00:01:08.380> couple<00:01:08.649> days<00:01:08.829> after<00:01:09.219> he<00:01:09.369> created<00:01:10.000> it<00:01:10.240> a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
a couple days after he created it a

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.940 
a couple days after he created it a
couple<00:01:10.600> days<00:01:10.810> after<00:01:11.049> he<00:01:11.140> tweeted<00:01:11.439> it<00:01:11.590> he<00:01:11.740> never

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
couple days after he tweeted it he never

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.279 
couple days after he tweeted it he never
treated<00:01:12.430> about<00:01:12.640> it<00:01:12.939> again<00:01:13.149> now<00:01:13.840> back<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.049> the

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
treated about it again now back to the

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:16.590 
treated about it again now back to the
PlayStation<00:01:14.799> exporting<00:01:15.369> I<00:01:15.579> don't<00:01:16.209> believe

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
PlayStation exporting I don't believe

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.940 
PlayStation exporting I don't believe
that<00:01:16.630> we're<00:01:16.810> gonna<00:01:16.929> get<00:01:17.049> a<00:01:17.109> character<00:01:17.560> reveal

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
that we're gonna get a character reveal

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.249 
that we're gonna get a character reveal
there<00:01:18.249> because<00:01:18.850> another<00:01:19.509> one<00:01:19.719> hasn't<00:01:19.899> say

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
there because another one hasn't say

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:21.870 
there because another one hasn't say
anything<00:01:20.679> about<00:01:20.770> being<00:01:21.069> there<00:01:21.340> neither<00:01:21.670> has

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
anything about being there neither has

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.580 
anything about being there neither has
Ed<00:01:22.060> Boon<00:01:22.299> so<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:22.840> don't<00:01:23.079> think<00:01:23.229> we're<00:01:23.319> gonna<00:01:23.409> get

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
Ed Boon so I don't think we're gonna get

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.590 
Ed Boon so I don't think we're gonna get
any<00:01:23.799> kind<00:01:23.979> of<00:01:24.100> reveal<00:01:24.729> trailer<00:01:24.999> or<00:01:25.329> anything

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.569 
that's probably just gonna be a demo
there<00:01:29.020> but<00:01:29.709> I<00:01:29.740> do<00:01:29.829> believe<00:01:30.219> that<00:01:30.249> we're<00:01:30.490> gonna
