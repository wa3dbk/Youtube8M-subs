athletic movements on earth if you want

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.160 
athletic movements on earth if you want
to<00:00:11.460> move<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.210> redirect<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.960> force

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
to move you have to redirect the force

apple is made up of matter giving it a
specific<00:00:20.550> mass<00:00:20.900> now<00:00:21.900> let's<00:00:22.140> introduce

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
specific mass now let's introduce

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.070 
specific mass now let's introduce
gravity<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> Apple<00:00:23.640> what<00:00:24.330> happens<00:00:24.720> it

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
gravity to the Apple what happens it

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.710 
gravity to the Apple what happens it
falls<00:00:25.550> now<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:26.849> falling<00:00:27.269> how<00:00:27.510> much

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
falls now that it's falling how much

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.929 
falls now that it's falling how much
does<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:27.990> weigh<00:00:28.109> at<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.189> moment<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.699> isn't

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
does it weigh at the moment this isn't

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.450 
does it weigh at the moment this isn't
relevant<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:31.109> Apple<00:00:31.439> has<00:00:31.560> no<00:00:31.830> weight<00:00:32.070> unless

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
relevant the Apple has no weight unless

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.220 
relevant the Apple has no weight unless
there<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.820> support<00:00:33.270> present<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.840> interact

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
there is a support present to interact

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.380 
there is a support present to interact
with<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.280> let's<00:00:35.489> take<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.969> free-falling

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
with it so let's take the free-falling

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.080 
with it so let's take the free-falling
Apple<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.020> rest<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> table<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.760> bottom

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
Apple and rest it on a table the bottom

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.959 
Apple and rest it on a table the bottom
of<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> Apple<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.840> now<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> point<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.590> support

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
of the Apple is now the point of support

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.639 
of the Apple is now the point of support
this<00:00:41.969> interaction<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.719> gravity<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.230> support

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
this interaction of gravity and support

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.760 
this interaction of gravity and support
turns<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.160> apples<00:00:44.550> mass<00:00:44.760> into<00:00:45.210> weight<00:00:45.770> now

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
turns the apples mass into weight now

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.650 
turns the apples mass into weight now
let's<00:00:47.070> consider<00:00:47.280> how<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.879> relates<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.420> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
let's consider how this relates to you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.990 
let's consider how this relates to you
trying<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.050> move<00:00:49.289> if<00:00:49.590> you're<00:00:50.340> standing<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
trying to move if you're standing in the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.819 
trying to move if you're standing in the
running<00:00:51.300> pose<00:00:51.480> gravity<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.230> interacting<00:00:52.800> with

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
running pose gravity is interacting with

weight occurs at the point of support in

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
weight occurs at the point of support in
this<00:00:57.300> case<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.840> foot<00:00:58.109> which<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.649> should

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
this case your foot which you should

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.700 
this case your foot which you should
perceive<00:00:59.280> as<00:00:59.489> pressure<00:00:59.960> this<00:01:00.960> interaction<00:01:01.469> of

initiated<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.630> downward<00:01:07.020> force<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.560> your

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
initiated the downward force that your

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.280 
initiated the downward force that your
muscles<00:01:08.100> are<00:01:08.189> balancing<00:01:08.729> against<00:01:09.290> to

muscles are balancing against to
initiate<00:01:10.770> movement<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.369> simply<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.909> to

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
initiate movement you simply have to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.910 
initiate movement you simply have to
fall<00:01:12.330> from<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.750> support<00:01:13.170> by<00:01:13.409> allowing<00:01:13.799> your

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
fall from that support by allowing your

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.679 
fall from that support by allowing your
body<00:01:14.070> weight<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.400> shift<00:01:14.580> ahead<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.450> foot

body weight to shift ahead of your foot

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.170 
body weight to shift ahead of your foot
now<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.070> where<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.430> take<00:01:17.640> action<00:01:18.060> by

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
now this is where you take action by

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.480 
now this is where you take action by
utilizing<00:01:18.840> active<00:01:19.229> muscle<00:01:19.619> efforts<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.280> pull

of it this way if someone pushed you

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.499 
of it this way if someone pushed you
from<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> side<00:01:44.100> would<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.640> actively<00:01:45.090> think

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
from the side would you actively think

landing going from one foot to the next
is<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.090> act<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.479> changing<00:01:57.719> support<00:01:58.320> which<00:01:58.619> is

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
is the act of changing support which is

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.639 
is the act of changing support which is
the<00:01:58.950> definition<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.700> movement<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:01.140> remember

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the definition of movement so remember

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.499 
the definition of movement so remember
while<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.310> are<00:02:02.430> focused<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:02.969> falling<00:02:03.420> and
