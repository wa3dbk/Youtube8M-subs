00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 and so hello everyone today talk about 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.260
 how to resize an image 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.550
 i use adobe photoshop 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.969
 version ks-6 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.279
 I think the younger versions in that in 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.890
 future releases the algorithm is hardly strong 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.650
 change and then start but you need 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.019
 open our image 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.840
 click file about pan or open in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.219
 Russian version choose a photo or 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.020
 any image being opened 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:38.430
 further to resize our 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.309
 pictures go upper context 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.040
 menu item image or image in 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.579
 Russian version further and my website or 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.930
 image size appears such 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.539
 context menu 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.210
 context window where we see the current 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:59.219
 the parameters of our image and its 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.250
 1280 by 1024 pixels to 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.989
 resize the image the most 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.760
 easy way 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.650
 if to you if you are not tied by any 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.799
 specific 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:14.729
 size choose a percentage here and set 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.830
 tick keep proportions and for example 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.909
 imagine you need to halve the image 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.770
 put the number 50 that is 50 percent 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.799
 click ok the image was doubled 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.010
 less 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:31.380
 thus, it is accordingly possible 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.850
 change the image to any number 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.650
 percent that is if we want 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.410
 reduce by 20 percent here is just 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.410
 put the number 80 click ok 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.700
 further if you need someone you need 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.540
 bring an image to some 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:56.270
 certain resolution who are we just 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:59.460
 here we enter numbers for example 640 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.500
 this will be our image length 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.050
 width with tick preserved 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.729
 proportions width adjusts itself 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.750
 if this tick is removed 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.080
 then when we enter numbers and click 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.370
 ok 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.290
 image is deformed in some 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.390
 cases of this can be put up like here 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.450
 That happened but sometimes for example if everyone 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.240
 demonstrate if we put here 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.980
 so here is the image very much 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.530
 it is deformed that we are naturally not 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.600
 arranges to more or less exactly 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.940
 bring the image to you need numbers 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.060
 you can use the crop tool 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.709
 or cropping in the Russian version 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.989
 click on the icon appears 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:52.380
 around the image a peculiar frame and 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:55.769
 just pull the corner and choose 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.600
 us image format naturally in 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.400
 in some cases part of the image 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.490
 have to sacrifice but this 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.060
 the only option 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.720
 Do not lose picture quality and 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.720
 proportions 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.240
 next option 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.240
 this 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.970
 bringing a picture to a certain 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.930
 permission by simply exhibiting 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:41.950
 the most popular lengths are for the internet 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:41.950
 maybe 640 or 1024 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.620
 Again, I remind you that the tick save 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.590
 proportions to constraint report 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.170
 must always be turned on otherwise bends 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.819
 the image will be deformed after 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.739
 how the image size is changed 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.359
 again back to the top 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:04.849
 context menu, click file so if 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:08.319
 save and choose qualities they 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:13.249
 I usually put 10 depending on the number 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.930
 file weight increases 10 press 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:17.269
 ok 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.079
 image saved thanks for 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.079
 attention yet
