00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.700 

hi<00:00:07.090> today<00:00:07.510> I'm<00:00:07.600> going<00:00:07.720> to<00:00:07.810> show<00:00:08.410> you<00:00:08.440> how<00:00:08.650> to

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 
hi today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.770 
hi today I'm going to show you how to
get<00:00:09.280> some<00:00:09.460> extra<00:00:09.700> life<00:00:09.880> out<00:00:10.150> of<00:00:10.180> your<00:00:10.480> nickel

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
get some extra life out of your nickel

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.299 
get some extra life out of your nickel
metal<00:00:10.870> hydride<00:00:11.050> batteries<00:00:11.770> that<00:00:11.889> may<00:00:12.130> have

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
metal hydride batteries that may have

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.009 
metal hydride batteries that may have
fallen<00:00:12.520> below<00:00:12.760> they're<00:00:13.059> charging<00:00:13.450> threshold

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
fallen below they're charging threshold

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.930 
fallen below they're charging threshold
and<00:00:14.230> you<00:00:15.010> might<00:00:15.190> think<00:00:15.220> that<00:00:15.519> when<00:00:15.730> they<00:00:15.820> get

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
and you might think that when they get

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.760 
and you might think that when they get
to<00:00:16.000> that<00:00:16.180> point<00:00:16.360> you're<00:00:16.570> going<00:00:16.689> to<00:00:16.779> throw<00:00:17.650> them

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
to that point you're going to throw them

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.130 
to that point you're going to throw them
out<00:00:17.800> and<00:00:17.950> recycle<00:00:18.310> them<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:19.390> in<00:00:19.660> this<00:00:19.869> case

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
out and recycle them but in this case

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.900 
out and recycle them but in this case
what<00:00:20.410> I<00:00:20.439> noticed<00:00:20.830> is<00:00:20.950> that<00:00:21.130> there's<00:00:21.400> a<00:00:21.520> little

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
what I noticed is that there's a little

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.730 
what I noticed is that there's a little
trick<00:00:22.090> you<00:00:22.270> can<00:00:22.420> use<00:00:22.480> to<00:00:22.750> get<00:00:23.289> a<00:00:23.320> little<00:00:23.590> bit<00:00:23.680> of

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
trick you can use to get a little bit of

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.290 
trick you can use to get a little bit of
extra<00:00:23.949> life<00:00:24.220> out<00:00:24.400> of<00:00:24.430> these<00:00:24.640> now<00:00:24.850> this<00:00:25.029> is<00:00:25.180> a

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
extra life out of these now this is a

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.290 
extra life out of these now this is a
1.2<00:00:25.840> volt<00:00:26.310> 2500<00:00:27.310> milliamp<00:00:27.640> battery<00:00:27.670> but<00:00:28.180> it

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
1.2 volt 2500 milliamp battery but it

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.760 
1.2 volt 2500 milliamp battery but it
has<00:00:28.449> fallen<00:00:28.720> below<00:00:28.990> the<00:00:29.080> threshold<00:00:29.590> of<00:00:29.650> where

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
has fallen below the threshold of where

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.010 
has fallen below the threshold of where
the<00:00:29.890> charger<00:00:30.250> will<00:00:30.369> accept<00:00:30.699> it<00:00:30.820> so<00:00:31.660> if<00:00:31.750> I<00:00:31.840> put

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
the charger will accept it so if I put

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.979 
the charger will accept it so if I put
it<00:00:32.110> on<00:00:32.169> my<00:00:32.349> charger<00:00:32.770> what<00:00:33.460> you'll<00:00:33.580> see<00:00:33.850> is<00:00:34.150> that

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
it on my charger what you'll see is that

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.620 
it on my charger what you'll see is that
I<00:00:35.170> just<00:00:35.379> get<00:00:35.559> a<00:00:35.590> null<00:00:35.949> on<00:00:36.220> this<00:00:36.970> last<00:00:37.210> screen

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
I just get a null on this last screen

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.299 
I just get a null on this last screen
right<00:00:37.840> here<00:00:38.040> normally<00:00:39.040> this<00:00:39.130> would<00:00:39.280> be

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
right here normally this would be

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.470 
right here normally this would be
showing<00:00:39.820> me<00:00:39.970> the<00:00:40.470> charging<00:00:42.329> statistics<00:00:43.329> it

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
showing me the charging statistics it

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.299 
showing me the charging statistics it
would<00:00:43.570> show<00:00:43.719> me<00:00:43.840> how<00:00:43.930> much<00:00:44.110> voltage<00:00:45.010> is<00:00:45.160> going

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
would show me how much voltage is going

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.280 
would show me how much voltage is going
into<00:00:45.520> that<00:00:45.610> battery<00:00:46.059> but<00:00:46.989> here<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:47.200> have

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
into that battery but here I have

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.900 
into that battery but here I have
nothing<00:00:47.739> and<00:00:47.920> that's<00:00:47.980> because<00:00:48.370> it's<00:00:48.520> below<00:00:48.880> a

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
nothing and that's because it's below a

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.490 
nothing and that's because it's below a
certain<00:00:49.210> threshold<00:00:49.360> where<00:00:49.899> the<00:00:49.989> charger<00:00:50.350> will

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
certain threshold where the charger will

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.990 
certain threshold where the charger will
accept<00:00:50.860> it<00:00:51.010> so<00:00:52.920> what<00:00:53.920> you<00:00:53.950> can<00:00:54.190> do<00:00:54.370> is<00:00:54.670> apply

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
accept it so what you can do is apply

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.959 
accept it so what you can do is apply
the<00:00:55.960> same<00:00:56.290> trick<00:00:56.590> to<00:00:56.770> these<00:00:56.920> as<00:00:57.340> you<00:00:57.489> would<00:00:57.700> a

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
the same trick to these as you would a

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.090 
the same trick to these as you would a
car<00:00:58.000> battery<00:00:58.480> that's<00:00:58.840> fallen<00:00:59.230> below<00:00:59.800> its

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
car battery that's fallen below its

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.139 
car battery that's fallen below its
charge<00:01:00.489> and<00:01:01.350> when<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:02.469> jumpstart<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.190> car<00:01:03.219> with

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
charge and when you jumpstart a car with

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:05.670 
charge and when you jumpstart a car with
a<00:01:04.180> dead<00:01:04.390> battery<00:01:04.539> you<00:01:04.869> connect<00:01:05.170> positive<00:01:05.379> to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
a dead battery you connect positive to

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.410 
a dead battery you connect positive to
positive<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:06.280> then<00:01:06.550> ground<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:06.970> ground

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
positive and then ground to ground

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.389 
positive and then ground to ground
and<00:01:07.539> what<00:01:07.960> you<00:01:08.050> can<00:01:08.200> do<00:01:08.380> is<00:01:08.619> do<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:08.979> same<00:01:09.190> thing

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
and what you can do is do the same thing

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.790 
and what you can do is do the same thing
with<00:01:09.550> these<00:01:09.729> now<00:01:10.479> I<00:01:10.509> have<00:01:10.869> a<00:01:10.899> fully<00:01:11.350> charged

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
with these now I have a fully charged

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.059 
with these now I have a fully charged
Duracell<00:01:12.550> battery<00:01:12.880> here<00:01:13.149> also<00:01:13.619> 1.2<00:01:14.619> volts

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:15.069 
Duracell battery here also 1.2 volts

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:17.850 
Duracell battery here also 1.2 volts
2500<00:01:15.700> milliamps<00:01:16.179> same<00:01:16.539> rating<00:01:16.929> I<00:01:17.050> actually

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
2500 milliamps same rating I actually

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.570 
2500 milliamps same rating I actually
don't<00:01:18.250> recommend<00:01:18.910> this<00:01:19.300> particular<00:01:19.600> brand<00:01:20.200> of

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
don't recommend this particular brand of

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.370 
don't recommend this particular brand of
battery<00:01:21.580> I've<00:01:21.759> had<00:01:21.970> proof<00:01:22.750> pretty<00:01:22.990> much<00:01:23.110> every

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
battery I've had proof pretty much every

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.529 
battery I've had proof pretty much every
single<00:01:23.560> one<00:01:23.770> of<00:01:23.830> these<00:01:24.009> fail<00:01:24.310> on<00:01:24.520> me<00:01:24.640> what<00:01:25.420> I<00:01:25.450> do

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
single one of these fail on me what I do

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.650 
single one of these fail on me what I do
recommend<00:01:25.780> is<00:01:26.410> these<00:01:27.399> these<00:01:27.910> are<00:01:28.119> great<00:01:28.270> I

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
recommend is these these are great I

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.499 
recommend is these these are great I
haven't<00:01:29.229> had<00:01:29.380> any<00:01:29.590> of<00:01:29.740> these<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:30.220> show<00:01:30.670> me<00:01:31.390> that

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
haven't had any of these to show me that

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.410 
haven't had any of these to show me that
behavior<00:01:31.959> or<00:01:32.110> display<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.740> problem<00:01:33.069> so<00:01:33.940> what

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
behavior or display that problem so what

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.809 
behavior or display that problem so what
I<00:01:34.450> found<00:01:35.110> was<00:01:35.289> easiest<00:01:35.770> if<00:01:36.310> I<00:01:36.399> take<00:01:36.580> a<00:01:36.610> pair<00:01:36.759> of

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
I found was easiest if I take a pair of

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:38.520 
I found was easiest if I take a pair of
barbecue<00:01:37.179> tongs<00:01:37.330> which<00:01:37.599> are<00:01:37.750> metal<00:01:37.929> and<00:01:38.170> will

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
barbecue tongs which are metal and will

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.710 
barbecue tongs which are metal and will
conduct<00:01:38.740> current<00:01:39.369> all<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:39.970> way<00:01:40.060> through<00:01:40.390> from

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
conduct current all the way through from

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.469 
conduct current all the way through from
one<00:01:41.170> side<00:01:41.440> to<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.649> other<00:01:41.940> and<00:01:42.940> then<00:01:43.270> what<00:01:43.390> I'll

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
one side to the other and then what I'll

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.859 
one side to the other and then what I'll
do<00:01:43.690> is<00:01:44.849> I'll<00:01:45.849> take<00:01:45.880> these<00:01:46.119> two<00:01:46.300> batteries<00:01:46.690> and

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
do is I'll take these two batteries and

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.210 
do is I'll take these two batteries and
I'll<00:01:47.080> actually<00:01:47.349> connect<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.709> two<00:01:47.830> negative

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
I'll actually connect the two negative

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.339 
I'll actually connect the two negative
sides<00:01:48.399> together<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.970> only<00:01:49.780> do<00:01:50.080> this<00:01:50.200> because

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:50.349 
sides together I only do this because

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:52.199 
sides together I only do this because
these<00:01:50.649> are<00:01:50.709> flat<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:51.940> makes<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.179> really

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
these are flat and it makes a really

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.020 
these are flat and it makes a really
good<00:01:52.660> solid<00:01:52.899> surface<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.739> what<00:01:54.459> you<00:01:54.520> do<00:01:54.729> is

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
good solid surface and what you do is

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.770 
good solid surface and what you do is
you<00:01:55.209> take<00:01:55.479> your<00:01:55.810> two<00:01:56.739> batteries<00:01:57.190> and<00:01:57.690> then<00:01:58.690> you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
you take your two batteries and then you

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.680 
you take your two batteries and then you
connect<00:01:59.110> them<00:01:59.229> together<00:02:00.149> with<00:02:01.149> your<00:02:01.179> barbecue

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
connect them together with your barbecue

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.180 
connect them together with your barbecue

that<00:02:11.530> Duracell<00:02:12.010> battery<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.580> actually

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
that Duracell battery is actually

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.209 
that Duracell battery is actually
putting<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.510> charge<00:02:13.840> on<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.709> second<00:02:15.069> one<00:02:15.159> now

putting a charge on the second one now

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.819 
putting a charge on the second one now
that<00:02:15.400> charge<00:02:16.329> is<00:02:16.569> not<00:02:16.719> controlled<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.680> when

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
that charge is not controlled and when

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:18.990

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
we're only going to do this for about 30

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.490 
we're only going to do this for about 30
seconds<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:26.830> no<00:02:27.130> more<00:02:27.370> okay<00:02:28.150> there<00:02:29.140> we<00:02:29.320> go

nickel metal hydride I put that in the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.320 
nickel metal hydride I put that in the
charger<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:42.190> what<00:02:42.400> you'll<00:02:42.520> see<00:02:42.550> is<00:02:45.330> it's

charger and what you'll see is it's
charging<00:02:46.870> up<00:02:47.310> there<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.430> goes<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:50.430> will

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
charging up there it goes and that will

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.060 
charging up there it goes and that will
continue<00:02:51.850> its<00:02:52.239> charge<00:02:52.510> cycle<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.830> when<00:02:53.950> it's

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
continue its charge cycle and when it's

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.050 
continue its charge cycle and when it's
done<00:02:54.220> I'll<00:02:54.370> be<00:02:54.459> able<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.670> use<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:54.910> battery

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
done I'll be able to use that battery

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.060 
done I'll be able to use that battery
again<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.660> what<00:02:56.200> I'll<00:02:56.290> need<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.590> do<00:02:56.739> is<00:02:56.890> just

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
again and what I'll need to do is just

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.850

make<00:02:57.220> sure<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.910> don't<00:02:58.840> let<00:02:59.350> that<00:02:59.530> battery

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
make sure that I don't let that battery

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.520 
make sure that I don't let that battery
sit<00:03:00.160> there<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.900> drain<00:03:01.900> below<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.380> threshold

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
sit there and drain below that threshold

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.229 
sit there and drain below that threshold
again<00:03:03.070> or<00:03:03.220> I'll<00:03:03.310> have<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.610> apply<00:03:03.880> that<00:03:04.060> trick
