00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.279
 this against not a single rosario goal 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.710
 look what way to come from where you 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.019
 hit the area as the kid opens 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.250
 first receives the pass 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.470
 stepping on the line of the area marks the goal 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.810
 at that time when he was in his 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.640
 best moments and romance with the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.939
 swollen racing this goal did it with 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.079
 blue cross if I remember correctly without third 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.730
 hello date 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.309
 exactly fifth date of group 3 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.190
 had appeared to help me with my bad 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.289
 memory what a goal does not give me 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:44.089
 the cup of mexico and ends up getting 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:46.730
 ball to angle characteristic number 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.379
 303 this also contessa blue 23 al 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.149
 roof of the arch without what way to define 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.629
 notice that there was also putting 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.909
 ramón playing almost like 99 always 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.070
 stepping on the plane this goal is fantastic 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.500
 against also the Argentine Cup in the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.199
 2011-2012 season as we open the foot 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.970
 and how it also appears from left to 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.550
 right as they surprise us who like 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.240
 you think I would not give you hand can play and 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.789
 this other from 9 classic to news in the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.100
 2011 closing tournament as the pike but 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:19.580
 what way to define is a definidor 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.500
 very cold and that has all the 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.509
 features that you need to 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.490
 making those kinds of decisions can sting 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.909
 you can hit me with right or pear 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.310
 with left 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.509
 He also does not fare badly in the bathroom if his 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.060
 better weapon but it's not a marker and as 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.980
 he said also what can they use we say 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.670
 the 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.640
 number 5 and added to the market against 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.100
 larense the short goal definition of 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.600
 left something more the simplest of the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.850
 young people that we have selected the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.000
 production but it shows the skill that 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.070
 has a tile that collateral 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.310
 Here is a gift exact the advantage 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.040
 very well 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.200
 and this also hits you right 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.479
 and hit him left-handed and how he hits that 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.290
 also you where to place the ball 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.090
 in the angle 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.300
 and now there are three goals for me that 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.720
 they are as well myth said at some point 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.590
 acrobatic inside to put a bunch 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.170
 of some resolutions that are 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.460
 truly sumptuous but you 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.960
 here not the deception 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.960
 hook definition above 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.660
 and for me it's important that word 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.660
 corroborate all this prove all this 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.480
 in a field as competitive as without 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.540
 European 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.440

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.440

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.990
 seeing what is the resource that he uses in 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.390
 a place where out there 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:07.220
 it is no longer just a luxury but a 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:11.000
 need a pulti resource 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.720
