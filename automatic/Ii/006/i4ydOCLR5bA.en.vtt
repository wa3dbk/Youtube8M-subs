00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.800
 When I arrived, they told me to leave 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.440
 from behind to pick it up 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.740

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.170
 same they charged me very well for the part 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.390
 from back when I asked no madman I did not 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.130
 they gave it because it was behind and not 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.259
 they had the machine 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.800
 because the machine is in the part of 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.259
 in front 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.140
 I get upset because you tell us that 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.380
 we should always ask for the lotus ivu but 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:03.360
 they did not want to give it to me 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.250
 it's because I did not have in the back 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.119
 I 'm supposed to give it to me even if it's 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.970
 letters with the secretary who does not 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.990
 they gave the ivu lotus by letters 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.330
 yes 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.330
 dear consumer 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.420
 this one who have gone through that situation 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.160

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.500

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.140
 the internet page where it is where 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.540
 is left black he had to give that 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.269
 kind of very hot to banalize the 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.830
 I want not to give this book with where 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.470
 be that all are going to give to my God 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.120
 so send me the address that 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.120
 Joan closed of fine 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:04.239
 what way of speaking is the secretary who 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.700
 many people who are not seeing or talking 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.739
 let's see the good one if today I'm going to 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.079
 talk about the iguanas that I am 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.540
 driving a circular so that 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.389
 iguanas can be collected and that people 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.420
 copper for this but you have to classify 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.489
 first because like iguanas 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.799
 it will cost more, that is the measure 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.930
 they count more money for them and the 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.700
 they collect but that has to be all 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.980
 this one can not be a mesh 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.959
 we also have a whole no no is it is 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.930
 that not all are not equal there 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.079
 different types of iguanas and I'm going to 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.079
 show 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.549
 there are only about 2 no no no no differences 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.660
 let's see the first one here how can 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.600
 watch 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.860
 and good payment yes true and the 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.910
 policies that do not always good 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.170
 still 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.120
 is the 'chilindrina' that happened to me 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.780
 disguising miami chihuahua the 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.780
 chilindrina 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.890
 but let's go to the other one and look at the language 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.230
 police there is no insurance that exists 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.070
 the good police as we are going to see her 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.810
 continuation 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.810
 the police iguana 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.810
 that's going to tell you without eating belts and the 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:35.080
 claw that always walks 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:36.760
 we go with the preparer to good yes 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.730
 because they climb trees walls 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.310
 everything but stalin a climber look at 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.960
 see if you 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.960
 where what comes in panama 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.740
 and we're going to notice why I do not have that 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.360
 the day you see an iguana climbing 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.289
 a wall 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.150
 that is the mother I am the mother of the 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.470
 clay between the walls because it makes 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.370
 pegas 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:15.790
 in this field 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.790
 what he does is buy the plane 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.009
 this measurement at what point are they giving 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.159
 this mixes moments with paper of 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.159
 aluminum 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.100
 about me 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.470
 let's go to good ones other let's keep 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.470
 hello while it dawns if you are you 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:51.310
 look at the coquettish iguana laiguana 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.930
 but the one of this minor media 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.669
 this 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.470
 I have is quite clear because as it is 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.900
 with people who are wearing the mustache and 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.380
 making up part of the courts and 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:06.389
 that 's good sleeper that turns you 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.389
 lie to the female female 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.010
 no other wall each 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.820
 this is the iguana jaime or iguana 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.820
 sleeper sleepers same 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.120
 it's okay 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.650
 and I do not like that, it's very difficult to 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.050
 capture because she disguises herself and you 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.620
 I confuse I have to disguise as a toad 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.370
 of snakes 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.910
 of boar and I have the iguana used 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.910
 public 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:57.380
 is looking for shadows 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:07:01.780
 good so our community is with 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:12.500

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:16.690

 that
