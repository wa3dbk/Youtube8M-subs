00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:06.309
 lately they have been asking me 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.490
 what are the best weapons for app 

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:12.769
 compiled edition of the best weapons 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.320
 the first best soul that I found comes 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.360
 being the magnetic shield I'm going to 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.119
 leave the entire list of weapons that 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.360
 I'm mentioning in the description of 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.360
 video 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.689
 how can you see what the shield does 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.989
 magnetic is that you put it to all your 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.600
 allies and if the shield is destroyed or it 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.370
 just the shield time gives you a 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.310
 extra shift to everyone who is using 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.650
 The shield 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.360
 then this weapon he will recommend 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.140
 get it in the mode 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.700
 the challenger goes out with the epic boss piper 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.700
 leave the 4.4 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.330
 the following is one that is called the 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.750
 stealth is not very good but it serves 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.740
 A little bit always hits 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.940
 get burnt give I go and the waypoint that 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.330
 makes the next attack be 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.810
 totally critical and that has been assured 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.370
 of giving then combination with others 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.820
 monkeys like for example war machine can 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.820
 be very strong 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.490
 another one that we have here is the one of classes 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.680
 so it is still allowing 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.900
 this is that all his companions are 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.470
 come back 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.300
 more heteros says that they are like 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.540
 invisible and you can not hit them like 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:48.340
 kiki prime and can recover a bit of 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.340
 Life when it attacks is taken away 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:59.240
 there are a number d 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.979
 of weapons that are like argument call 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.810
 what they allow is that they give it a 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.670
 buff all of your team that are 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.060
 of the same class there are of all 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.209
 lessons 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.450
 then here the link of each one the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.599
 infiltrate is what gives you this agility 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.550
 and gives them strength as sometimes the pp 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.560
 that you can really use all the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.350
 characters of only one type can you 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.600
 serve a lot is 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.730
 apart from that I recommend that you 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.950
 take on challenger because if you do not go to 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.240
 have less percentage of getting the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.400
 third bonus 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.650
 if it's not going to have like 25 percent 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.090
 get it and if you took it rotator 60 by 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.910
 hundred 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.220
 as you can see shoots infiltrators there are 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.550
 for puncher 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.490
 for guards for detonating 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.300
 and for tactical all that if they have the 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:58.150
 same as that agility or and strength or 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:01.900
 force and defense or west or precision and 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.660
 what always changes is 60 per 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.570
 hundred to get some skill that 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.730
 it's typical of that class I'm going to 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.050
 leave the link here and so they can 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:18.010
 see them these are taken in the 3 the season 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:23.080
 2 in chapter 3 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.150
 the other is the staff of this chao 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.950
 What makes this walking stick is that when 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.350
 you place for three turns to follow 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.200
 getting life and you're going to get more life 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.090
 for having the racing 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.819
 it's not exactly the best weapons 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.459
 but it serves a little 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.900
 and this is one of the weapons that says 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.349
 get in the raids of the 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.569
 season 2 and it serves so that you can 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:49.420
 make counterattacks when you do 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.400
 counterattack is to a shield and almost 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.909
 it always hits critics is a very good 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.859
 weapon I recommend it a lot and the best 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:00.939
 weapon that is being this one also come out 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:03.280
 incursions is the parchment this 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.319
 parchment is a quick action and allows 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.450
 that you take all the states 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.590
 positive to the enemy and you take all 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.830
 the negatives to you 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.120
 this weapon is very good and used until 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:19.669
 two the pp to avoid it put me states 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.760
 does not work against beast or titanium with 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.310
 his suit of riders but lately 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.840
 is using us so much 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.710
 they also asked about what was the 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.910
 better suit me in pp used the suit of 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.750
 generalist so I do not have any problem 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.630
 I almost left all the work to the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.480
 heroes and I'm nothing like support 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.280
 then as support I use then the 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:50.150
 skills that can not stand 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.730
 or help the other team 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.900
 can not see all these are weapons that 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.900
 no more give support 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.630
 well this is all that was going to 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.320
 show the best weapons you can 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.270
 get on missions 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.370
 one of the best weapons that also 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.750
 I will recommend that they do not think 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.750
 I put this 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.350
 he opened the link or list but I had 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.350
 April 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.350
 this news get also in that 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.710
 peak boss of season 1 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.560
 is the 9.4 and what this weapon allows 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.110
 is to have the skill of emma frost 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.720
 apart from that always for critics 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:41.000
 prevents the component from doing more damage 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.600
 in the next turn and apart if you 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.810
 attacks or does some action 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:52.850
 Offensive you are going to put a terrible damage 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:56.270
 as 40% or more all depends on 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.520
 what states bring altered is one of 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.370
 the best weapons you can have is 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.830
 very used in high levels although already 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.210
 a little less but still the 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.690
 I recommend totally like the 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.690
 parchment
