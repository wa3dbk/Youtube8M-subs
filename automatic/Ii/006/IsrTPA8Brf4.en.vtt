00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.870
 july is alexander von rohr energie us 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.539
 Try chocolate today as well 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.750
 because I like show and so on 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.039
 I co-migrate the mixa the tastes good 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.670
 but sometimes too much bananas 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.670
 who now the ice duet of 1 great 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:36.379
 chocolate vanilla and next to it a half 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.269
 liter in the with soymilk 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:43.379
 but I also take white with me 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:52.440
 but you can even do that right 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:53.479
 Munich no longer now first 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.780
 acquire 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:01:04.370
 milk and then you have the cocoa powder 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.840
 that is the bought and is with it 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.580
 or that powder is all that too 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.810
 they are both chocolate 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.969
 or you can just choco or 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.990
 do less than that and so maybe 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:23.509
 can do together 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:23.509
 I like it because it always has to 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.080
 There is just one can read that too 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.870
 listen to it in the old form 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:51.310
 but my experience with milk and cocoa 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:53.880
 It does not dissolve the one in the 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.880
 warm with 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:43.240
 comes in the warm milk comes this 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:45.370
 The mass was just very sticky 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.950
 See what it really is warm otherwise 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.950
 Because it is only because 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.980
 remove the latter in the battle ever 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.980
 very nice 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:25.769
 Neat conscientiousness that 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.769
 fleeting white 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:50.750
 then has to boil briefly and that 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:59.240
 stand for a moment and continue cooking 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:04:01.370
 stirring middle ages is just once 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.000
 briefly show what's in there everything 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.790
 So ingredients are agave syrup cash flows 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.040
 cacau weak applies 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.910
 rice zero powder collection in rice powder 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:22.160
 vanilla and thickener johannes 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:23.810
 bread kern mail and little movies from 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.360
 controlled biological other so 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.260
 For the most part , yes, it's time again 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.360
 it is without ice maker 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:38.360
 works hoose vegan and free 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:49.610
 gluten free and yes we know of course 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:52.460
 does not taste like ice cream or 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.110
 if it is then he water this ice if 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:59.360
 Now we can stand on it, you can 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.680
 rice molds for a style you have the 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.740
 I have to say something real now 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.740
 what already feels very creamy 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:32.120
 nobody stops 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:33.050
 we do not know that anymore 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.240
 one must now at room temperature 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.640
 let it cool down logically 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.900
 far when he's so hot in fresh 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.670
 apart from that, 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.270
 that is a total waste of energy 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.440
 you would be uptown because of that 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.290
 first cool with that 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.490
 room temperature so that all I do 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.560
 It is now cooled down to room temperature 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.730
 and it looks like it is already 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.530
 have become firm so public 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:04.940
 Can you stay in the room for three hours now ? 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:06.980
 Freezer then let's have a look 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.620
 been outside that one such a 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.540
 half an hour before you want to eat 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.260
 get it out of the freezer again 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:18.230
 gets something out of it then just look to come good 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:22.760
 Now it's done and I would have 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:26.090
 try out the three hours that 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.980
 is not quite so clear 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:39.440
 longer in there than two hours in the 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:44.060
 middle is still quite 70 there in the 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.770
 middle is always 26 hours or 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.500
 maybe over night you can see here 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:52.600
 are very soft and here is there 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.600
 Slightly tried to swirl with it 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:12.050
 tastes annoying about it times 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:14.900
 taste good it tastes different than than 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:19.750
 normal ice cream what you have in the supermarket 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:22.879
 buys but I find slacker me good 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:26.030
 Let's have a look but do not try 

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:28.389
 folder must try escada much 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.389
 fun
