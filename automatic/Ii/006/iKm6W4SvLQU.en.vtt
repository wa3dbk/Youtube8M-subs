00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.129
 Jorge for a hundred 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.070
 I see a world, I give a ball, I just 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.610
 is a confusing world regulate the roof was reported 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.499
 bersin transition 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.150
 and therefore a world 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.550
 I live with hope sinking emerging 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.420
 two movements 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.010
 despite it had a premiere reveals that this world is like an ocean of change 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.740
 permanent ones have forgotten 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.490
 and that since it is a wonder to be 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.200
 I see how families dissolve is one of the countries cultures 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.620
 borders 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.750
 and we are attending like that great nicky 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.430
 of something that we do not know what it is going to be anyway do not do this 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.470
 it will surely be totally new 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.660
 and we are immersed in that which is like an adventure to live 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.450
 qantas 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.920
 with a fundamental human being 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.440
 ture kinase simplicity 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.280
 I can give more hard because it will break if you are a crystal casique 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.119
 perfect rigid grid 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.390
 all a magnificent fundamentalist entered the past but he is going to spend the 

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:32.219
 current of life and we're going to tell you that it's going to go bankrupt so 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.030
 that we are all going to change 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.200
 said cambiasso not only the current of the dian the candidates of the individuals 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.600
 i resist this current 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.530
 and you stay closed back 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.370
 its banks on the edge of the comfort of the venues 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.560
 world security 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.499
 for the current life is going 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:53.740
 start anyway 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.270
 but if you throw yourself into the current you become that deep current 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.950
 so you have to your favor 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.310
 all that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.430
 that course the student 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.800
 students 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.159
 is the spinal fluid 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:12.599
 lives travel lunch to the question clarify why it is not reported 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:19.419
 because we live on this planet because we are human because it also 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:23.910
 sick mineral kingdom because the metals are fatigued because they also 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.519
 they have tumors the vegetables 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.569
 because our common destiny is part of our karma 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.049
 but also because of the nonsense that we do with nature and when 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.069
 we make nature our own nature 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:42.689
 there are planetary diseases that are part of the evolution of diseases 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:47.099
 unnecessary there are deaths that have to happen because the time does not come but the 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.419
 Most deaths are premature 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.169
 and they happen ahead of time for what we do to life 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:58.090
 since the disease is not only a personal matter but it is an issue 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:59.739
 what reflect 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.549
 the quality of our relations with the planet do not make you sick carry the 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.219
 vegetables do not get magnesium because we exhaust the trace elements 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.259
 because the earth has not been read and then it will be so easier for us not to 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:15.829
 we have radicals 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.979
 we do not have santi free radicals on top of that 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.479
 we get sick because they breathe 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:23.389
 as it was known 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.589
 because we breathe pollution but not only physical pollution but 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:29.679
 emotional and mental 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:35.039
 because we live in a turbulence that we have created ourselves yes 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.449
 we have not managed to manage our nature in nature that we 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:41.859
 surrounds 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.819
 we get sick too because the disease is a teacher of 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:46.719
 the nurses 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.719
 it helps us to grow that is to say that the disease has positive connotations 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.519
 necessary negative negatives 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.739
 the nurse will exist on the planet as there will be death the body 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:03:59.679
 physical 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:04.179
 but stay in us that make us sick the conscience and the level of 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:07.489
 consciousness from which we can heal 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.179
 and life has been given I say that hands in carnac the soul well 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:12.770
 experience in heaven 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.239
 this instrument 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.559
 and that in a certain way the disease also represents our heels of 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:21.559
 Achilles in our places of maximum 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:24.550
 Gisela ask now 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.690
 and she that close the eyes I know that you are going to be more well so I do not know 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.479
 get to dakota dad pc ps3 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.479
 It is very good but the truth 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.000
 I said a month ago it was for 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.940
 for you for us for the Argentines for doctors for the 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.809
 humanity as the day 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:46.389
 that we are human 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.680
 more human medicine does not need more technology we need way 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:55.280
 human relationships need 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.139
 more humanity 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:02.450
 what happens to us is because we have not agreed to our way 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.870
 It is not in what we have where humans but in what we have 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.960
 of human ekin 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.680
 joel what we have dehumanized 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.680
 where we find the root of our problems 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.570
 if we knew that the human being is a unit of cosmic consciousness that 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:23.550
 formed of stars and not 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.870
 stellar essence of consciousness 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.550
 if one day we knew that all the united kingdom reaches in us and has 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.880
 initiated and he has expanded his consciousness and that the plant kingdom has 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.000
 bequeathed its light to turn it into 100ma enard 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.680
 in CÃ¡diz and creativity 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.970
 and that the animal kingdom has given us the freedom of its movement so that 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.819
 we really free ourselves not from each other and not from each other 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.389
 the other hand 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.060
 all together with crystals the free will that makes us human 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:04.229
 then really gay link we would not be to a new culture of 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:05.919
 human relations 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.150
 to a new earth I think that new land creation of all 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:12.490
 I would invite you 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.759
 here between all of the hand 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.990
 projecting our hearts let's build that way 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:22.919
 I think it's going to be like that 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.379
 on Tuesday 6 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:27.909

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.159
