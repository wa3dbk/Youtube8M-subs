I quite like working to music I must in

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.539 
I quite like working to music I must in
my<00:00:02.399> studio<00:00:02.850> I<00:00:02.909> like<00:00:03.149> working<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.629> music<00:00:04.520> so<00:00:05.520> I

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
my studio I like working to music so I

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.530 
my studio I like working to music so I
tend<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.330> kind<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:07.049> I<00:00:08.120> don't<00:00:09.120> wear<00:00:09.269> earphones

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
tend to kind of I don't wear earphones

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.419 
tend to kind of I don't wear earphones
but<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:09.990> usually<00:00:10.170> let<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.590> music<00:00:10.769> kind<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.250> just

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
but I usually let the music kind of just

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.419 
but I usually let the music kind of just
invade<00:00:12.000> around<00:00:12.360> me<00:00:12.450> later<00:00:12.780> on<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.099> drawing

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
invade around me later on in the drawing

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.499 
invade around me later on in the drawing
blots<00:00:14.670> we're<00:00:14.880> going<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.089> be<00:00:15.150> doing<00:00:15.269> some

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
blots we're going to be doing some

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.490 
blots we're going to be doing some
drawing<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.929> sound<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.560> stuff<00:00:16.770> like<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.130> so

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
drawing to sound and stuff like that so

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.470 
drawing to sound and stuff like that so
just<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.619> kind<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.980> get<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.850> interested<00:00:21.150> in

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
just to kind of get you interested in

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.929 
just to kind of get you interested in
that<00:00:21.660> kind<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.020> thinking<00:00:22.670> asanas<00:00:23.670> are<00:00:23.789> quite

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
that kind of thinking asanas are quite

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.290 
that kind of thinking asanas are quite
nice<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.240> imagine<00:00:24.600> particular<00:00:26.119> music<00:00:27.119> that

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
nice to imagine particular music that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.599 
nice to imagine particular music that
you<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.630> or<00:00:28.470> your<00:00:28.710> where<00:00:28.859> particularly<00:00:29.369> you

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
you like or your where particularly you

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.799 
you like or your where particularly you
like<00:00:29.869> a<00:00:30.869> right<00:00:31.740> here<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.189> go<00:00:32.360> I'm<00:00:33.360> gonna<00:00:33.480> start

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
like a right here we go I'm gonna start

00:00:33.809 --> 00:01:27.090 
like a right here we go I'm gonna start
like<00:00:33.930> this

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.429 

as<00:01:28.570> if<00:01:29.570> by<00:01:29.780> magic<00:01:29.810> some<00:01:30.469> music<00:01:30.890> occurs<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:32.840> work

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
as if by magic some music occurs to work

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:46.059 
as if by magic some music occurs to work
too<00:01:44.170> so<00:01:45.170> what<00:01:45.319> I'm<00:01:45.409> doing<00:01:45.439> is<00:01:45.649> really<00:01:45.890> working

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
too so what I'm doing is really working

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.130 
too so what I'm doing is really working
from<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.490> outside<00:01:46.670> first<00:01:47.509> I'm<00:01:47.840> kind<00:01:48.079> of

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
from the outside first I'm kind of

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.469 
from the outside first I'm kind of
leaving<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.890> space<00:01:49.840> starting<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.990> kind<00:01:51.289> of

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
leaving the space starting to kind of

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:24.760 
leaving the space starting to kind of
happen<00:01:53.479> in<00:01:53.630> here

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.930 

here's<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.920> really<00:02:26.100> motivating<00:02:26.760> bit<00:02:27.920> Inc<00:02:28.940> bit

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
here's the really motivating bit Inc bit

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.620 
here's the really motivating bit Inc bit
of<00:02:30.030> water<00:02:33.560> quite<00:02:34.560> pared<00:02:34.860> down<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:36.480> maybe

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
of water quite pared down and maybe

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:49.530 
of water quite pared down and maybe
start<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.200> work<00:02:37.410> into<00:02:38.340> it

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.710 

I<00:02:49.569> wouldn't<00:02:50.670> be<00:02:51.670> too<00:02:51.939> heavy<00:02:52.180> with<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.540> though

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
I wouldn't be too heavy with it though

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.229 
I wouldn't be too heavy with it though
because<00:02:52.900> if<00:02:53.379> you're<00:02:53.500> too<00:02:53.650> heavy<00:02:53.829> with<00:02:54.069> it<00:02:54.250> it

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
because if you're too heavy with it it

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.380 
because if you're too heavy with it it
will<00:02:55.390> really<00:02:55.599> get<00:02:56.579> it'll<00:02:57.579> clog<00:02:57.909> with<00:02:58.269> the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
will really get it'll clog with the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.839 
will really get it'll clog with the
charcoal<00:02:58.930> so<00:02:59.769> what<00:02:59.950> I<00:02:59.980> would<00:03:00.220> do<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.459> I'd<00:03:00.579> keep

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
charcoal so what I would do is I'd keep

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.979 
charcoal so what I would do is I'd keep
it<00:03:01.060> fairly<00:03:01.780> light<00:03:02.349> I<00:03:02.560> would<00:03:02.620> hardly<00:03:03.840> put<00:03:04.840> too

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
it fairly light I would hardly put too

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.140 
it fairly light I would hardly put too
much<00:03:05.110> pressure<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.620> wouldn't<00:03:05.890> get<00:03:06.010> great<00:03:06.849> big

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
much pressure I wouldn't get great big

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.330 
much pressure I wouldn't get great big
washes<00:03:07.659> of<00:03:07.840> ink<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.260> splash<00:03:08.769> it<00:03:08.950> all<00:03:09.040> over<00:03:09.069> the

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
washes of ink and splash it all over the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.160 
washes of ink and splash it all over the
charcoals<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:09.940> think<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.209> might<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.629> might<00:03:10.690> make

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
charcoals I think it might it might make

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.759 
charcoals I think it might it might make
it<00:03:11.379> less<00:03:11.530> effective<00:03:16.019> but<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.079> can<00:03:17.319> do<00:03:17.530> things

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
it less effective but you can do things

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.059 
it less effective but you can do things
like<00:03:18.659> if<00:03:19.659> you<00:03:19.750> dip<00:03:19.989> your<00:03:20.200> bigger<00:03:20.560> brush<00:03:20.859> in

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
like if you dip your bigger brush in

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.460 
like if you dip your bigger brush in
there<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.340> can<00:03:21.489> really<00:03:21.700> kind<00:03:22.629> of<00:03:22.750> drag<00:03:23.140> like

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
there you can really kind of drag like

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.410 
there you can really kind of drag like
that<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:24.220> makes<00:03:24.459> quite<00:03:24.609> interesting<00:03:25.120> marks

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
that it makes quite interesting marks

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:41.600 
that it makes quite interesting marks
doesn't<00:03:25.599> it<00:03:25.780> like<00:03:26.319> that

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.610 

and<00:03:41.940> then<00:03:42.210> what<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:42.510> would<00:03:42.660> also<00:03:42.900> do<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.350> start

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
and then what I would also do is start

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.290 
and then what I would also do is start
letting<00:03:43.800> that<00:03:43.950> dry<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.280> little<00:03:44.490> bit<00:03:44.820> if<00:03:45.060> you

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
letting that dry a little bit if you

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.510 
letting that dry a little bit if you
keep<00:03:45.600> working<00:03:45.840> on<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.530> will<00:03:46.650> clog<00:03:46.860> up<00:03:46.920> again

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
keep working on it it will clog up again

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.100 
keep working on it it will clog up again
but<00:03:47.940> if<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.150> actually<00:03:48.300> just<00:03:48.510> let<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.840> dry<00:03:49.080> for

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
but if you actually just let it dry for

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.290 
but if you actually just let it dry for
a<00:03:49.320> few<00:03:49.500> moments<00:03:49.980> maybe<00:03:50.430> do<00:03:50.670> another<00:03:50.700> one<00:03:51.180> or

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
a few moments maybe do another one or

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.870 
a few moments maybe do another one or
work<00:03:51.450> in<00:03:51.630> your<00:03:51.720> sketchbook<00:03:52.340> yeah<00:03:53.340> you'd<00:03:53.760> be

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
work in your sketchbook yeah you'd be

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.750 
work in your sketchbook yeah you'd be
able<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.120> draw<00:03:54.330> back<00:03:54.540> over<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.960> top<00:03:55.140> of<00:03:55.170> it

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
able to draw back over the top of it

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.920 
able to draw back over the top of it
because<00:03:56.760> if<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:56.970> work<00:03:57.150> directly<00:03:57.570> with<00:03:57.780> a

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
because if you work directly with a

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.960 
because if you work directly with a
charcoal<00:03:58.440> straight<00:03:58.770> into<00:03:59.010> that<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.610> won't<00:03:59.820> be

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
charcoal straight into that you won't be

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.150 
charcoal straight into that you won't be
able<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.270> yeah<00:04:01.260> it'll<00:04:01.560> be<00:04:01.740> really<00:04:01.890> difficult

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
able to yeah it'll be really difficult

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.190 
able to yeah it'll be really difficult
so<00:04:02.940> what<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.210> need<00:04:03.330> to<00:04:03.390> do<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:03.750> just<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.020> give

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
so what you need to do is just to give

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.070 
so what you need to do is just to give
it<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.410> little<00:04:04.590> bit<00:04:04.800> of<00:04:04.920> time<00:04:05.660> maybe<00:04:06.660> work<00:04:06.930> with

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
it a little bit of time maybe work with

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.980 
it a little bit of time maybe work with
some<00:04:07.230> directional<00:04:07.800> marks<00:04:08.570> where<00:04:09.570> you<00:04:09.660> haven't

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
some directional marks where you haven't

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.550 
some directional marks where you haven't
put<00:04:10.140> any<00:04:10.440> kind<00:04:11.130> of<00:04:11.220> sense<00:04:11.430> of<00:04:12.350> sense<00:04:13.350> of<00:04:13.500> the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
put any kind of sense of sense of the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.340 
put any kind of sense of sense of the
form<00:04:13.800> in<00:04:13.980> there<00:04:14.190> in<00:04:14.490> terms<00:04:14.700> of<00:04:14.820> ink<00:04:15.000> you<00:04:15.350> might

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
form in there in terms of ink you might

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.530 
form in there in terms of ink you might
just<00:04:16.560> start<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.799> think<00:04:17.100> how<00:04:17.370> can<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.150> start<00:04:18.390> to

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
just start to think how can I start to

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.140 
just start to think how can I start to
work<00:04:18.690> maybe<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:19.890> tend<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:20.760> like<00:04:20.970> working

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
work maybe and I tend to like working

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.600 
work maybe and I tend to like working
with<00:04:21.330> a<00:04:21.450> little<00:04:21.630> bit<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:21.900> Swizzle<00:04:22.430> but<00:04:23.430> just

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
with a little bit of a Swizzle but just

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.940 
with a little bit of a Swizzle but just
like<00:04:23.970> this<00:04:24.260> this<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.410> quite<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.620> nice<00:04:25.710> way<00:04:25.770> of

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
like this this is quite a nice way of

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.500 
like this this is quite a nice way of
drawing<00:04:26.130> anybody<00:04:26.550> like<00:04:26.760> that<00:04:27.170> kind<00:04:28.170> of<00:04:28.260> fun

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.700 

and<00:04:33.510> then<00:04:33.570> base<00:04:33.840> they<00:04:34.020> maybe<00:04:34.200> start<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.500> think

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
and then base they maybe start to think

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:44.860 
and then base they maybe start to think
about<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:34.980> sort<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.250> sense<00:04:35.460> of<00:04:35.580> space<00:04:36.410> again

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.909 

in<00:04:45.870> a<00:04:45.960> way<00:04:46.050> straightaway<00:04:46.530> you've<00:04:46.680> created

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
in a way straightaway you've created

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.430 
in a way straightaway you've created
something<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.460> work<00:04:47.669> on<00:04:47.970> okay<00:04:48.630> Joe<00:04:49.260> I<00:04:49.290> would

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
something to work on okay Joe I would

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.350 
something to work on okay Joe I would
just<00:04:49.770> then<00:04:49.980> maybe<00:04:50.490> let<00:04:50.760> it<00:04:50.880> dry<00:04:51.090> for<00:04:51.150> a<00:04:51.330> bit

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
just then maybe let it dry for a bit

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.790 
just then maybe let it dry for a bit
because<00:04:51.810> if<00:04:51.930> you're<00:04:52.050> Keith<00:04:52.200> as<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.470> keep<00:04:52.590> keep

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
because if you're Keith as I keep keep

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.830 
because if you're Keith as I keep keep
working<00:04:53.190> so<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.340> it<00:04:54.000> won't<00:04:54.419> be<00:04:54.660> possible

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
working so that it won't be possible

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.600 
working so that it won't be possible
just<00:04:55.110> let<00:04:55.380> it<00:04:55.470> dry<00:04:55.620> off<00:04:55.830> work<00:04:56.070> in<00:04:56.280> your<00:04:56.370> sketch

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
just let it dry off work in your sketch

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.570 
just let it dry off work in your sketch
but<00:04:56.790> think<00:04:57.090> about<00:04:57.210> it<00:04:57.740> okay<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:58.919> then<00:04:59.370> maybe

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
but think about it okay and then maybe

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.000 
but think about it okay and then maybe
go<00:04:59.820> back<00:05:00.060> like<00:05:00.540> then<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:01.380> next<00:05:01.680> thing<00:05:01.830> you<00:05:01.980> can

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
go back like then the next thing you can

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.250 
go back like then the next thing you can
do<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.550> I<00:05:02.640> think<00:05:02.880> it<00:05:02.970> might<00:05:03.120> be<00:05:03.180> quite<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:03.990> nice

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
do and I think it might be quite a nice

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.980 
do and I think it might be quite a nice
thing<00:05:04.500> to<00:05:04.530> do<00:05:04.710> also<00:05:04.890> is<00:05:05.070> to<00:05:05.580> rip<00:05:06.090> another<00:05:06.570> piece

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
thing to do also is to rip another piece

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:16.159 
thing to do also is to rip another piece
of<00:05:07.020> paper<00:05:07.380> like<00:05:08.240> this<00:05:14.000> motivator<00:05:15.000> says<00:05:15.360> rip

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
of paper like this motivator says rip

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.590 
of paper like this motivator says rip
paper<00:05:17.990> better<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.669> maybe<00:05:20.669> put<00:05:20.970> in<00:05:21.150> a<00:05:21.270> kind<00:05:21.510> of

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
paper better and maybe put in a kind of

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.240 
paper better and maybe put in a kind of
strut<00:05:22.020> like<00:05:23.010> this<00:05:23.390> okay<00:05:24.390> and<00:05:24.600> stick<00:05:25.410> it<00:05:25.530> on<00:05:25.650> so

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
strut like this okay and stick it on so

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.310 
strut like this okay and stick it on so
you<00:05:26.340> can<00:05:26.460> start<00:05:26.730> breaking<00:05:27.390> up<00:05:27.510> the<00:05:27.570> whole<00:05:27.960> form

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
you can start breaking up the whole form

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.350 
you can start breaking up the whole form
alright<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:29.490> then<00:05:29.610> you<00:05:29.700> can<00:05:29.820> draw<00:05:30.000> over<00:05:30.300> it

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
alright and then you can draw over it

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.210 
alright and then you can draw over it
again<00:05:30.750> I<00:05:30.960> think<00:05:31.410> you've<00:05:31.530> brought<00:05:31.740> glue<00:05:32.040> with

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
again I think you've brought glue with

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.250 
again I think you've brought glue with
you<00:05:32.370> anybody<00:05:33.330> got<00:05:33.390> any<00:05:33.570> Pritt<00:05:33.810> stick<00:05:33.840> or

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
you anybody got any Pritt stick or

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.870 
you anybody got any Pritt stick or
anything<00:05:34.410> up<00:05:34.560> like<00:05:34.590> that<00:05:34.950> yeah<00:05:35.340> in<00:05:35.580> your<00:05:35.669> box

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
anything up like that yeah in your box

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.830 
anything up like that yeah in your box
or<00:05:36.210> share<00:05:36.750> it<00:05:36.840> around<00:05:36.980> yeah<00:05:38.010> so<00:05:38.820> let<00:05:39.510> the<00:05:39.630> dry

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
or share it around yeah so let the dry

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.200 
or share it around yeah so let the dry
and<00:05:39.990> maybe<00:05:40.140> put<00:05:40.740> angles<00:05:41.280> in<00:05:41.430> with<00:05:41.610> paper<00:05:41.880> over

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
and maybe put angles in with paper over

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.560 
and maybe put angles in with paper over
the<00:05:42.300> top<00:05:42.590> that<00:05:43.590> kind<00:05:43.830> of<00:05:43.860> stuff<00:05:44.100> yeah<00:05:44.790> and<00:05:45.060> then

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
the top that kind of stuff yeah and then

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.080 
the top that kind of stuff yeah and then
you<00:05:45.660> can<00:05:45.810> work<00:05:45.960> back<00:05:46.200> into<00:05:46.560> it<00:05:46.680> don't<00:05:47.430> dismiss

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
you can work back into it don't dismiss

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.850 
you can work back into it don't dismiss
some<00:05:48.479> of<00:05:48.510> the<00:05:48.690> things<00:05:49.020> that<00:05:49.229> you<00:05:49.320> were<00:05:49.410> using

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
some of the things that you were using

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.310 
some of the things that you were using
this<00:05:49.950> morning<00:05:50.580> like<00:05:51.450> the<00:05:51.630> draw<00:05:51.900> and<00:05:52.110> quick

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
this morning like the draw and quick

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.650 
this morning like the draw and quick
mark

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
mark

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.570 
mark
 the<00:05:53.140> linear<00:05:53.470> marks<00:05:53.920> the<00:05:54.070> structural

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
 the linear marks the structural

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.120 
 the linear marks the structural
decisions<00:05:55.150> that<00:05:55.900> stuff<00:05:56.230> can<00:05:56.500> come<00:05:56.710> back<00:05:56.890> into

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
decisions that stuff can come back into

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.790 
decisions that stuff can come back into
it<00:05:57.400> all<00:05:58.180> right<00:05:58.420> but<00:05:58.930> you<00:05:59.050> can<00:05:59.230> also<00:05:59.380> bear<00:05:59.770> in

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
it all right but you can also bear in

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.460 
it all right but you can also bear in
mind<00:06:00.190> what<00:06:00.400> we've<00:06:00.580> talked<00:06:00.790> about<00:06:01.060> initially

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
mind what we've talked about initially

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.500 
mind what we've talked about initially
that<00:06:02.470> this<00:06:02.830> this<00:06:03.100> drawings<00:06:03.460> made<00:06:03.640> up<00:06:03.820> tonally

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
that this this drawings made up tonally

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.100 
that this this drawings made up tonally
isn't<00:06:04.840> it

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
isn't it

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.610 
isn't it
yeah<00:06:05.890> the<00:06:06.040> tone<00:06:06.340> is<00:06:06.550> structuring<00:06:07.120> the<00:06:07.240> form

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
yeah the tone is structuring the form

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.110 
yeah the tone is structuring the form
and<00:06:08.620> it's<00:06:08.770> the<00:06:08.920> majority<00:06:09.040> of<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:09.520> drawing

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
and it's the majority of the drawing

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.660 
and it's the majority of the drawing
okay<00:06:11.050> so<00:06:11.110> sort<00:06:11.530> of<00:06:11.560> thinking<00:06:11.980> in<00:06:12.100> that<00:06:12.250> way<00:06:12.310> so

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:12.670 
okay so sort of thinking in that way so

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.060 
okay so sort of thinking in that way so
it's<00:06:13.150> less<00:06:13.480> linearly<00:06:14.050> controlled<00:06:14.650> and

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
it's less linearly controlled and

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.550 
it's less linearly controlled and
brought<00:06:15.280> about<00:06:15.550> rather<00:06:16.180> and<00:06:16.690> more<00:06:16.900> tonally

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
brought about rather and more tonally

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.000 
brought about rather and more tonally
yes<00:06:18.220> it's<00:06:18.400> mass<00:06:18.730> form<00:06:19.600> a<00:06:19.960> stone<00:06:20.320> mass

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
yes it's mass form a stone mass

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.890 
yes it's mass form a stone mass
direction<00:06:21.700> and<00:06:21.880> then<00:06:22.390> when<00:06:22.510> you've<00:06:22.600> got<00:06:22.720> some

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
direction and then when you've got some

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.140 
direction and then when you've got some
mass<00:06:23.170> direction<00:06:23.770> there<00:06:23.950> you<00:06:24.250> can<00:06:24.400> control<00:06:24.850> it

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
mass direction there you can control it

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.370 
mass direction there you can control it
you<00:06:26.110> know<00:06:26.170> with<00:06:26.320> some<00:06:26.500> linear<00:06:26.830> structure
