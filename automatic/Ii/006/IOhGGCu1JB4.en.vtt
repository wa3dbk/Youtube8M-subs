00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.980
 two 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.980
 is essential 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:21.160
 we live unfortunately humiliated that 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.450
 privilege but not individual and there 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.670
 small loopholes that we find 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.290
 build a temple but it seems that it is 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.520
 little in places where now access the 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:34.280
 discursive and social relationship for here is 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.309
 what they transmit what happens in 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.829
 the country in the town in the neighborhood because 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.020
 always in favor of changing in favor of 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.220
 psrm in favor of criticizing within 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.220
 questioned has to be with his 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.220
 weather 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.160
 nor can it lead past because it is lost 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.450
 and too much the future because it grabs this 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.890
 it's an artistic fact so you have to 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.190
 find an artistic return this 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.190
 history 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.900
 begins the reflection of your society 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:08.480
 with the dew drop from the dry branches 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.830
 the flask 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:16.520
 the default from its foundation she wants 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:20.420
 so the family with writing and laughing is 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.780
 a permanent inhabitant of the sites 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:28.380
 loners and they are never alone 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.540
 today as more marketing follow-up than 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.310
 before there was not if it had been done 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.150
 commercial there would be boys winning a lot 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.570
 Silver is the tenant of nothing and of 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.390
 all the owner by what kind of 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.830
 crazy 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:50.930
 I do not know what Uruguayan likes the wall 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:53.350
 I like very much everything is great 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.259
 and look I do not know 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.439
 and for me the good mule in the burga is 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.439
 a 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.429
 stable 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.720
 9 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:21.770
 s singing and keep singing 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.640
 17 guys singing with all their strength is 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:29.460
 one thing that impresses you the way 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.460
 par excellence of reversible to think 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.940
 lasarte 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.940

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:55.750
 in the neighborhood there are too many things together 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.680

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.790
 all right 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:23.620
 while Canada 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.620
 a blue bird 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.590
 floors at the same time that for the day a 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:37.040
 enormous effort to be heard is 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:39.319
 a set of sizes that catches you and you 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.189
 une 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.189
