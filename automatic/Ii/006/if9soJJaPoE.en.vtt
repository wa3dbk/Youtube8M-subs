payment<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> case<00:00:30.240> i<00:00:30.480> think<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.840> case<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.170> an

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
payment the case i think this case is an

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.000 
payment the case i think this case is an
antec<00:00:32.219> 300<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.840> mid-sized<00:00:34.350> tower<00:00:34.680> case

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
antec 300 it's a mid-sized tower case

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.280 
antec 300 it's a mid-sized tower case
it's<00:00:35.250> pretty<00:00:35.489> cool<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.719> know<00:00:36.840> I've<00:00:37.079> used

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
it's pretty cool but you know I've used

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.500 
it's pretty cool but you know I've used
it<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> year<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.430> got<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> little<00:00:38.969> bored

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
it for a year and I got a little bored

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.709 
it for a year and I got a little bored
of<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.770> regular<00:00:41.520> black<00:00:41.910> case<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
of just the regular black case and the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.350 
of just the regular black case and the
LEDs<00:00:43.230> kept<00:00:43.890> me<00:00:44.010> up<00:00:44.129> at<00:00:44.280> night<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.520> usually<00:00:45.239> like

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
LEDs kept me up at night I usually like

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.360 
LEDs kept me up at night I usually like
to<00:00:45.420> sleep<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.050> very<00:00:46.260> dark<00:00:46.500> room<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:46.980> these

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
to sleep in a very dark room and these

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.430 
to sleep in a very dark room and these
LEDs<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.149> light<00:00:48.329> up<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.570> entire<00:00:48.660> room<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.410> I

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
LEDs just light up the entire room so I

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.520 
LEDs just light up the entire room so I
decided<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.950> switch<00:00:50.280> cases<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:51.420> kind<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.289> give

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
decided to switch cases to kind of give

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.529 
decided to switch cases to kind of give
it<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.739> new<00:00:53.039> look<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.000> what<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.210> came<00:00:54.329> up

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
it a new look and this is what I came up

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.760 
it a new look and this is what I came up
with<00:00:55.340> this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> BitFenix<00:00:57.260> shinobi<00:00:58.260> window

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
with this is the BitFenix shinobi window

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.760 
with this is the BitFenix shinobi window
Dwight<00:00:59.219> case<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.030> think<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.750> looks<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.320> cool

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
Dwight case I think it looks really cool

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.889 
Dwight case I think it looks really cool
and<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.460> reason<00:01:02.609> why<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.940> wanted<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and the reason why I wanted to go with a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.190 
and the reason why I wanted to go with a
white<00:01:04.140> computer<00:01:04.589> was<00:01:05.309> because<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.000> don't<00:01:06.840> see<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
white computer was because I don't see a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200 
white computer was because I don't see a
whole<00:01:07.320> lot<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.710> white<00:01:07.979> computers<00:01:08.460> out<00:01:08.580> there<00:01:08.670> I

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
whole lot of white computers out there I

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.120 
whole lot of white computers out there I
think<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.810> really<00:01:09.840> unique<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:10.830> something

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
think is really unique to have something

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.710 
think is really unique to have something
like<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.119> know<00:01:12.180> not<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
like this and so you know not the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.660 
like this and so you know not the
standard<00:01:12.990> black<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.920> everyone<00:01:14.310> else<00:01:14.490> with

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
standard black like everyone else with

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.510 
standard black like everyone else with
blue<00:01:14.880> LEDs<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.630> red<00:01:15.810> LEDs<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.860> one<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> decided

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
blue LEDs at red LEDs this one I decided

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.820 
blue LEDs at red LEDs this one I decided
to<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.790> white<00:01:18.150> case<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.810> looks<00:01:19.049> clean<00:01:19.439> and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
to get a white case it looks clean and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.850 
to get a white case it looks clean and
that's<00:01:20.670> why<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.880> really<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.630> now<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.500> case

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
that's why I really like it now the case

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.399 
that's why I really like it now the case
didn't<00:01:23.220> come<00:01:23.400> completely<00:01:23.970> white<00:01:24.420> by<00:01:25.049> default

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
didn't come completely white by default

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.890 
didn't come completely white by default
it<00:01:25.740> actually<00:01:26.100> comes<00:01:26.310> as<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> white<00:01:26.820> case<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it actually comes as a white case but it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.859 
it actually comes as a white case but it
has<00:01:28.049> blue<00:01:28.500> mesh<00:01:29.250> strips<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.659> i<00:01:30.689> actually

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
has blue mesh strips on it so i actually

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.469 
has blue mesh strips on it so i actually
purchased<00:01:31.259> some<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.189> meh<00:01:32.880> strips<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.329> were

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
purchased some more meh strips that were

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.749 
purchased some more meh strips that were
white<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.530> i<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.770> make<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.369> entire

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
white so that i can make the entire

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.550 
white so that i can make the entire
computer<00:01:36.270> case<00:01:36.600> white<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.079> i<00:01:37.110> think<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.409> looks

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
computer case white and i think it looks

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.679 
computer case white and i think it looks
really<00:01:37.650> cool<00:01:38.130> i<00:01:38.340> even<00:01:38.820> made<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.329> BitFenix

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
really cool i even made the BitFenix

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.690 
really cool i even made the BitFenix
logo<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> front<00:01:40.890> white<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.400> can't<00:01:41.579> really

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
logo on the front white you can't really

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.910 
logo on the front white you can't really
see<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.030> because<00:01:42.180> everything<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.170> white<00:01:43.409> but

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
see it because everything is white but

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.399

these<00:02:33.090> weird<00:02:33.540> names<00:02:33.750> are<00:02:33.930> really<00:02:34.079> long<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:35.040> as

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
these weird names are really long but as

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.229 
these weird names are really long but as
you<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.340> see<00:02:35.519> when<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.760> have<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:35.970> computer

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
you can see when you have the computer

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.440 
you can see when you have the computer
on<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.959> actually<00:02:37.440> glows<00:02:37.829> a<00:02:37.860> green<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:39.269> kind

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
on it actually glows a green it's kind

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.610 
on it actually glows a green it's kind
of<00:02:39.510> weird<00:02:39.720> because<00:02:39.870> i<00:02:40.049> actually<00:02:40.409> have<00:02:40.500> all

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
of weird because i actually have all

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.809 
of weird because i actually have all
these<00:02:40.709> different<00:02:40.769> computer<00:02:41.370> parts<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.730> are

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
these different computer parts that are

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.569 
these different computer parts that are
different<00:02:42.150> colors<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:43.019> green<00:02:43.290> LED<00:02:43.739> yeah

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
different colors and a green LED yeah

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.400 
different colors and a green LED yeah
that's<00:02:44.760> kind<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.030> weird<00:02:45.209> but<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.989> sort<00:02:46.349> of

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
that's kind of weird but a it sort of

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.630 
that's kind of weird but a it sort of
works<00:02:46.680> i<00:02:48.079> also<00:02:49.079> have<00:02:49.379> 8<00:02:49.620> gigabytes<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.340> ram

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
works i also have 8 gigabytes of ram

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.369 
works i also have 8 gigabytes of ram
which<00:02:50.970> i<00:02:51.090> probably<00:02:51.390> have<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.780> upgrade<00:02:51.930> because

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
which i probably have to upgrade because

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.759 
which i probably have to upgrade because
it's<00:02:53.099> a<00:02:53.220> bit<00:02:53.370> slow<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.000> video<00:02:54.209> editing<00:02:54.620> for<00:02:55.620> my

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
it's a bit slow and video editing for my

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.610 
it's a bit slow and video editing for my
graphics<00:02:56.220> card<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.640> have<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> 5770<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:58.230> this

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
graphics card I have a 5770 and this

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.740 
graphics card I have a 5770 and this
card<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.190> bending<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.879> is<00:03:00.000> scaring<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.540> crap

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
card is bending it is scaring the crap

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.780 
card is bending it is scaring the crap
out<00:03:01.049> of<00:03:01.079> me<00:03:01.290> because<00:03:01.650> when<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.069> first<00:03:02.340> put<00:03:02.549> it<00:03:02.670> in

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
out of me because when I first put it in

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.430 
out of me because when I first put it in
two<00:03:03.000> years<00:03:03.209> ago<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.780> was<00:03:03.900> perfectly<00:03:04.290> straight

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
two years ago it was perfectly straight

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.380 
two years ago it was perfectly straight
but<00:03:04.680> now<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.700> almost<00:03:05.940> like<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:06.299> gonna

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
but now it's almost like it's gonna

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.089 
but now it's almost like it's gonna
break<00:03:06.750> off<00:03:06.989> I'm<00:03:07.200> really<00:03:07.409> scared<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.799> touch<00:03:08.040> it

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
break off I'm really scared to touch it

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.050 
break off I'm really scared to touch it
but<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.730> far<00:03:08.940> it's<00:03:09.420> been<00:03:09.540> working<00:03:09.870> ok<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.879> use<00:03:11.879> an

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
drives it makes this computer really

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.619 
drives it makes this computer really
fast<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.769> also<00:03:38.459> have<00:03:38.700> my<00:03:38.730> optical<00:03:39.299> drive<00:03:39.599> and

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
fast I also have my optical drive and

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.000 
fast I also have my optical drive and
what's<00:03:39.959> really<00:03:40.049> cool<00:03:40.200> about<00:03:40.379> the<00:03:40.590> optical

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
what's really cool about the optical

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.619 
what's really cool about the optical
drive<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.639> I<00:03:41.849> actually<00:03:42.239> kind<00:03:42.599> of

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
drive is that I actually kind of

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.170 
drive is that I actually kind of
recessed<00:03:43.199> it<00:03:43.410> in<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.919> added<00:03:44.370> this<00:03:44.519> cover<00:03:44.879> I

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
recessed it in and added this cover I

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.449 
recessed it in and added this cover I
bought<00:03:45.900> this<00:03:46.109> extra<00:03:46.560> cover<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.069> when<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.220> press

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
bought this extra cover and when I press

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.319 
bought this extra cover and when I press
this<00:03:47.489> button<00:03:47.849> it<00:03:48.239> actually<00:03:48.599> hides<00:03:48.840> the

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
this button it actually hides the

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.460 
this button it actually hides the
optical<00:03:51.329> drive<00:03:51.569> behind<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:52.230> kind<00:03:52.440> of

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
optical drive behind this kind of

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.559 
optical drive behind this kind of
flapping<00:03:52.949> door<00:03:53.129> I<00:03:53.699> thought<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.120> was<00:03:54.329> kind<00:03:54.510> of

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
flapping door I thought that was kind of

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.150 
flapping door I thought that was kind of
cool<00:03:54.629> that<00:03:54.989> way<00:03:55.109> it<00:03:55.260> keeps<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.859> entire

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
cool that way it keeps the entire

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.089 
cool that way it keeps the entire
computer<00:03:56.609> white<00:03:57.379> when<00:03:58.379> I<00:03:58.410> open<00:03:58.680> up<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:58.919> back

the best i could do i know it's very

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.710 
the best i could do i know it's very
ugly<00:04:13.470> but<00:04:13.739> i<00:04:14.010> just<00:04:14.340> tried<00:04:14.609> to<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:15.329> know<00:04:15.389> tie

know it's important to hide all the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.020 
know it's important to hide all the
wires<00:04:22.079> so<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:23.219> air<00:04:23.400> can<00:04:23.430> flow<00:04:23.700> through

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
wires so that the air can flow through

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.430 
wires so that the air can flow through
the<00:04:24.300> case<00:04:24.510> efficiently

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440
