00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:11.800
 when you get into your dream that is 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.170
 to the team of craftsmen as we called it 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.690
 then of course 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.510
 think about someone firing from some 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.990
 to broadcast well, just but cloud they need even 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.500
 didn't work you want respecting elders out 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.510
 of ice 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.900
 going to the gym to win their 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.160
 a place under the sun is a normal reaction 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.890
 descendant understand that not too much 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.870
 you pay a great price for everything and here already 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.570
 wisdom leaders yes that is how 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.190
 in the way of these levers of the family 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.629
 govern but it seems to me not very good 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.170
 It turned out in this regard, Victor 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.710
 basilisina yes yes should at all we were 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.070
 a good psychologist and knew how to say so 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.930
 things to reconfigure and like that one by us 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.250
 driving on in general of course with time 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.760
 all this 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.720
 thank God it is all alive and healthy 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.290
 Of course, I understand that a lot of it has been launched. 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:11.820
 especially when you played in doc format 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.799
 and you at the expense of the internal resource here as 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.200
 that's from human things 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.740
 family relationships are normal there with 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.530
 friends with society you stimulate you 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.439
 a little differently than you someone 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.070
 there everything decided how much lifting how many 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.289
 charging 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.539
 what to do and so on that is in 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.409
 this plan somewhere maybe we were and 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:37.880
 the flawed report here began to recall in 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.710
 In principle, all those guys who managed to leave 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.469
 from his team in general we are not lost 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.509
 for more, though everyone who remained a 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:49.320
 have waited for someone 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.420
 will come something will make something tell 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.700
 somewhere will send something for him 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.700
 so in this regard of course 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.620
 infringement of one human moment here 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.130
 now imagine 13 14 years old to be amazed 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.810
 collection well and 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.720
 will count but if it is a plus, we 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.060
 read a lot we talked to each other but 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.360
 in terms of being very interesting 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.920
 moment i yesterday i saw from the magic interview 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.930
 2 next showed what he says 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.730
 that sports is such a thing and you came here 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:30.790
 self quick you gotta lo 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:35.959
 closer friend what example is that 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.900
 I enjoy life in general high-grade family 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.380
 and you can also play for a long time to play 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.740
 successful of course why well maybe in 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.720
 that time the system did not assume it 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.610
 total control over everything and so but 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.180
 say again that something so fresh was 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:58.040
 how very vivid representatives of that 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:01.820
 there are systems of this school sports him 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.269
 it turned out of course here all his 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.970
 the result is his success they speak for themselves 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.990
 yourself and will enter into the analog of world hockey 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.300
 world sports as a general 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.510
 outstanding achievement he represented 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.020
 the system I represented was generally human 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:25.720
 factors but also fought for their rights in that 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:30.220
 moment so i proved that general i 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.840
 had the right to become successful in that 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.590
 the world 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.350
 returned to Russia in the position of the handle 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.810
 Russian sports that is but 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.600
 touching now doing something wrong 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.410
 long time ago there was no decision by the president 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.810
 appointment writer 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.580
 Sports Committee is a very difficult time for 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.810
 Russian side for the Russian 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.870
 sports so well 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.660
 I remember when I got to know 75 years old Victor 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.890
 Vasiliev and I came with the departments 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.250
 reward fix and gratitude on 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.610
 on the anniversary as it opens further in general 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.310
 came down congratulated by the way practically 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.880
 hockey players was not remember one was not 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.960
 the only reason was therefore once again giving 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.650
 the time of our these years of formation 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:28.840
 do you think we grew up which is prince 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.980
 came the team after cisco's victory 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.120
 national championship 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.040
 only Konstantin Laptev was the successor 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.030
 army tradition tarot drying school 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:43.810
 together with firs we are innocent 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.440
 alexander they general seems to me 3 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.580
 die and just continued the army 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.240
 which one that created the Taras and 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.060
 came on 2 to prove 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.690
 already I gain credibility in the 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:03.289
 time 19-year-old boy here too 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.650
 understood why such changes occur 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:10.280
 what are they connected with and then you but it was 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.289
 political decision but in principle on 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:17.660
 the young guys wanted to play 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:20.360
 conquer the world wanted to be the best of what 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.940
 we trained for it can say that 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.940
 we talked a lot about the game a lot 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.599
 general and got together we talk 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.050
 some moments especially played in 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:34.639
 unequal compositions is that in general a 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:39.520
 determines your quality bill 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:42.289
 the work of any coach by and large 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.970
 naturally discussed with him again in 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:49.250
 main or other share of all work in 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.400
 general interaction within this desire 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.199
 each other play as I can here in 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.229
 this connection to say that in that team 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:06:01.150
 Viktor Vasilievich atmosphere was 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:03.810
 it was inside the team that was on 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.810
 special
