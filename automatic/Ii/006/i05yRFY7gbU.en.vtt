the front and back yokes we'll begin by

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.099 
the front and back yokes we'll begin by
dividing<00:00:16.650> our<00:00:17.310> circular<00:00:18.029> body<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:18.869> knit

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the knit side and on knit rows only we

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.959 
the knit side and on knit rows only we
will<00:00:59.809> decrease<00:01:00.809> stitches<00:01:01.770> at<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.550> beginning

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
will decrease stitches at the beginning

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.660 
will decrease stitches at the beginning
of<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.840> row<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.589> end<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> row<00:01:05.400> in

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
of the row and the end of the row in

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.630 
of the row and the end of the row in
other<00:01:05.939> words<00:01:06.270> at<00:01:06.540> each<00:01:07.140> edge<00:01:09.290> several<00:01:10.290> times

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
other words at each edge several times

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.359 
other words at each edge several times
now<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.850> creates<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.299> nice<00:01:12.479> smooth<00:01:12.950> curve<00:01:13.950> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
now this creates a nice smooth curve to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.600 
now this creates a nice smooth curve to
your<00:01:14.400> armhole<00:01:15.320> after<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.860> completed

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
your armhole after you have completed

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.910 
your armhole after you have completed
your<00:01:17.790> last<00:01:18.180> decrease<00:01:18.509> row<00:01:19.049> you'll<00:01:19.650> knit

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
your last decrease row you'll knit

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.219 
your last decrease row you'll knit
straight<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> top<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.600> your<00:01:21.810> arm<00:01:21.990> hole

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
straight up to the top of your arm hole

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.890 
straight up to the top of your arm hole
so<00:01:22.710> what<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.250> need<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.490> figure<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.390> how

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
so what we need to figure out is how

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.080 
so what we need to figure out is how
many<00:01:25.470> stitches<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.250> bind<00:01:26.490> off<00:01:26.729> at<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
many stitches to bind off at the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.289 
many stitches to bind off at the
beginning<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.630> those<00:01:27.780> first<00:01:28.080> two<00:01:28.229> rows<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
beginning of those first two rows and

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.260 
beginning of those first two rows and
how<00:01:30.299> many<00:01:30.689> decrease<00:01:31.290> rows<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.829> work<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.909> if<00:01:33.090> we

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
how many decrease rows to work so if we

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.660 
how many decrease rows to work so if we
were<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.540> write<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.930> out<00:01:34.140> first<00:01:35.040> we'd<00:01:35.400> say

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
were to write this out first we'd say

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.350 
were to write this out first we'd say
bind<00:01:36.630> off<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.320> certain<00:01:38.130> number<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.460> stitches<00:01:38.850> at

decreases<00:02:21.100> we<00:02:21.760> need<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.120> convert<00:02:22.570> these

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
decreases we need to convert these

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.170 
decreases we need to convert these
measurements<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.100> stitches<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.880> do<00:02:25.030> our

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
measurements to stitches to do our

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.540 
measurements to stitches to do our
calculations<00:02:25.990> remember<00:02:26.800> I<00:02:26.830> said<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.250> our

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
calculations remember I said that our

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.620 
calculations remember I said that our
back<00:02:27.880> was<00:02:28.780> simply<00:02:29.740> half<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.490> our<00:02:31.270> circular

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
back was simply half of our circular

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.440 
back was simply half of our circular
body<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.130> back<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.370> going<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.910> equal<00:02:34.270> our

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
body so the back is going to equal our

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.530 
body so the back is going to equal our
original<00:02:35.020> number<00:02:35.320> of<00:02:35.410> cast<00:02:35.709> on<00:02:35.980> stitches

to our shoulder width here and that is

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.620 
to our shoulder width here and that is
because<00:04:24.320> when<00:04:25.100> we<00:04:25.220> go<00:04:25.370> to<00:04:25.430> knit<00:04:25.669> the<00:04:25.820> sleeve<00:04:26.210> we

armhole and using up a stitch so in
order<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.780> keep<00:04:32.960> our<00:04:33.229> shoulder<00:04:33.650> width

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
order to keep our shoulder width

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.700 
order to keep our shoulder width
accurate<00:04:34.520> we<00:04:35.090> need<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.479> allow<00:04:35.930> an<00:04:36.290> extra

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
accurate we need to allow an extra

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.890 
accurate we need to allow an extra
stitch<00:04:36.979> there<00:04:37.340> so<00:04:38.270> that<00:04:38.419> means<00:04:38.570> one<00:04:38.870> less

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
stitch there so that means one less

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.310 
stitch there so that means one less

final number of stitches on armhole
shaping<00:04:47.150> we<00:04:47.630> have<00:04:47.840> to<00:04:48.020> decide<00:04:48.320> how<00:04:48.650> to<00:04:48.710> divide

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
shaping we have to decide how to divide

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.330 
shaping we have to decide how to divide
it<00:04:49.280> up<00:04:49.400> between<00:04:49.610> our<00:04:50.150> bind<00:04:50.600> off<00:04:50.840> and<00:04:51.340> our

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
it up between our bind off and our

it up between our bind off and our
decrease<00:04:52.880> rows<00:04:53.180> I<00:04:53.479> have<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.139> simple<00:04:54.530> formula

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
decrease rows I have a simple formula

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.490 
decrease rows I have a simple formula
for<00:04:55.190> this<00:04:55.310> I<00:04:55.580> simply<00:04:56.510> divide<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:57.050> number<00:04:57.380> in

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
for this I simply divide the number in

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.070 
for this I simply divide the number in
half<00:04:58.030> now<00:04:59.030> if<00:04:59.240> your<00:04:59.419> final<00:04:59.660> number<00:05:00.050> of

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
half now if your final number of

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.680 
half now if your final number of
stitches<00:05:00.410> on<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:00.889> armhole<00:05:01.370> is<00:05:01.610> an<00:05:02.419> odd<00:05:02.660> number

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
stitches on the armhole is an odd number

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.740 
stitches on the armhole is an odd number
it<00:05:03.350> doesn't<00:05:03.530> really<00:05:03.830> matter<00:05:04.160> which<00:05:04.880> side<00:05:05.570> of

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
it doesn't really matter which side of

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.230 
it doesn't really matter which side of
this<00:05:05.870> gets<00:05:06.139> the<00:05:06.320> extra<00:05:06.440> stitch<00:05:06.919> for<00:05:07.820> example

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
this gets the extra stitch for example

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.330 
this gets the extra stitch for example
if<00:05:08.330> I<00:05:08.419> had<00:05:08.600> nine<00:05:08.870> stitches<00:05:09.260> here<00:05:09.650> too<00:05:09.860> on<00:05:10.100> my

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
if I had nine stitches here too on my

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.640 
if I had nine stitches here too on my
arm<00:05:10.580> hole<00:05:10.760> shaping<00:05:11.210> I<00:05:11.360> could<00:05:11.840> find<00:05:12.080> out<00:05:12.320> five

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
arm hole shaping I could find out five

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.610 
arm hole shaping I could find out five
and<00:05:12.949> decrease<00:05:13.400> four<00:05:13.700> or<00:05:14.020> find<00:05:15.020> out<00:05:15.169> four<00:05:15.470> and

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
and decrease four or find out four and

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.700 
and decrease four or find out four and
decrease<00:05:15.979> five<00:05:16.220> not<00:05:17.000> too<00:05:17.210> important<00:05:17.690> in<00:05:18.410> part

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
decrease five not too important in part

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.620 
decrease five not too important in part
two<00:05:18.950> I'll<00:05:19.160> do<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.490> math<00:05:19.669> on<00:05:19.940> Nikki's<00:05:20.330> sweater

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
two I'll do the math on Nikki's sweater

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.620 
two I'll do the math on Nikki's sweater
and<00:05:20.840> knit<00:05:21.050> the<00:05:21.169> armholes
