00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.410
 very good people from youtube here river 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.790
 continue commenting on a new video 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.660
 Minecraft tutorial in which good 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.490
 first of all 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.480
 I know that the house is a bit more light or 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.670
 what you want is worth but good 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.090
 How many times has it happened to you? 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.540
 what do you want to keep your diamonds and 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.529
 your golds and you do not know how good 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:31.710
 Well, I'm going to show you how to make a 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.440
 invisible room like how to disguise 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.020
 a secret entrance to shown 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.820
 diamonds and your gold very well for 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.879
 we're going to need everything you see 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.879
 here 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.190
 and a clear christina table is the 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.820
 wood is to make the door door of 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.600
 wood 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.050
 I'm sorry go for god now the door 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:00.190
 of wood that is made like that and the sticks and 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.559
 the wool are to make a painting 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.229
 I know there are many ways to do 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.409
 invisible doors to invisible entrances 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.130
 and with red zone they are more useful and everything 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.289
 that you want 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.259
 but well I know that the redstone is difficult 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:18.229
 to do and well I do not want to complicate the 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.689
 thing else before that much less 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.610
 several touches is too many times I have a 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.240
 video where I explain it in the link of 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.369
 the description here below 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.630
 I put the link for you to see 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.750
 OK 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.750
 Well, it's as easy as putting the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.000
 door here or the door open and with the 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.369
 paint in the good are four squares 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.070
 then in the bottom left click 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.049
 right and you put it and it has to be 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.060
 so 2 x 2 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.329
 of 4 squares what can happen is 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.119
 that you waste two hours and not go 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:57.399
 nothing like what's happening to me now 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.399
 had very good luck then 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.520
 lovely thank you now no 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.340
 good is what you have to do 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.280
 it's just jumping here and spending more 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.310
 in here very, very much, until you get money 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.370
 you mount orgies what others are moll 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.350
 of uncles what you like best is a 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.540
 easy way to disguise it and if you put 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.290
 more paintings throughout the house because as 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.450
 you're going to see that right in this is this the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.120
 wash then I will explain what it is worth 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.760
 guys is important then in the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.440
 problem is if you have the door 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.980
 closed 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.140
 It's a mess because when you leave then you do not 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.370
 you can enter we will explain later 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:46.460
 what to do and for a mess 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:49.070
 and another thing that you can do now is 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.980
 as I was saying something else that you can 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.160
 to do is to deceive who loves you 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.990
 steal as you know what are 34 is equal 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.750
 is the house is imagined to be a 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.030
 house is worth then imagine that jump to 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.530
 this and a lava falls 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.990
 I know that was why they have gone 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.240
 running 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.840
 or enter through this and also 34 of what 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.800
 same goes 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.720
 then it would be good to see when 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.640
 you go that you want to take your things what 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.250
 you have if there are objects around here 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.530
 thrown away or I do not know is that someone has 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.300
 tried to enter would be a trap that 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.540
 also when you try to catch something 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.990
 warns that someone has entered 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.020
 Oh okay 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.130
 it's a useful way to monitor that nobody 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.840
 the bad thing is that lava can 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.660
 burn here the eyes that we have 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.100
 because it has burned wood and such that 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.900
 much care has to be two 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.430
 spaces so much grass also burns 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.120
 so be careful in this regard 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.400
 Boys 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.340
 and finally I explain to you why it was 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.130
 lava on the roof imagine that an uncle 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.950
 says host I'm going to climb on your roof 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.530
 then to see how things are in 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.110
 that for the theme of lava if you do 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.570
 well can not see that there is a chest there 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.420
 I 've done it wrong on purpose you have 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.000
 to put the crystal here and wash it 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.100
 from here that occupies everything then 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.830
 if for anything you try not to 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.790
 removes lava as the time at which 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.100
 you enter the house if you see that 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.980
 if you see missing as a block of lava 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.440
 you do not have to think and such then 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.510
 be careful because it can rain 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.220
 so this is not very safe either 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.590
 imagine that it rains here is formed 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.870
 stone and brown brown or if you guys 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.710
 want more than you have prepared the 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.820
 waterfall here close 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.540
 and it is already 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.210
 saved 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.889
 and that's all guys I think I hope you 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.009
 I liked it 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.400
