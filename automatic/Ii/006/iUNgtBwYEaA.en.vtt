00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.019 
but he also is not really he has killed
a<00:04:41.259> man<00:04:41.439> of<00:04:41.590> steel<00:04:41.770> of<00:04:41.949> course<00:04:42.159> but<00:04:42.699> we<00:04:42.849> know

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:43.029 
a man of steel of course but we know

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:44.489 
a man of steel of course but we know
that<00:04:43.210> he<00:04:43.270> doesn't<00:04:43.599> want<00:04:43.809> to<00:04:43.870> kill<00:04:44.080> we<00:04:44.349> know

00:04:44.489 --> 00:04:44.499 
that he doesn't want to kill we know

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:46.589 
that he doesn't want to kill we know
that<00:04:44.529> he's<00:04:44.949> not<00:04:45.129> willing<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.580> kill<00:04:45.939> Batman<00:04:46.419> on

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
that he's not willing to kill Batman on

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.540 
that he's not willing to kill Batman on
the<00:04:46.659> same<00:04:46.840> he's<00:04:47.650> similar<00:04:47.919> in<00:04:48.129> the<00:04:48.189> same<00:04:48.370> way<00:04:48.490> to

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
the same he's similar in the same way to

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.920 
the same he's similar in the same way to
you<00:04:48.819> know<00:04:48.909> he's<00:04:49.059> had<00:04:49.180> lots<00:04:49.330> of<00:04:49.479> chances<00:04:49.539> to

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
you know he's had lots of chances to

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.779 
you know he's had lots of chances to
kill<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:50.289> Joker<00:04:50.710> but<00:04:50.889> he<00:04:50.979> never<00:04:51.189> has<00:04:51.430> so<00:04:51.639> it's

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
kill the Joker but he never has so it's

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:52.350 
kill the Joker but he never has so it's
kind<00:04:51.939> of<00:04:51.969> similar

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
kind of similar

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.929 
kind of similar
in<00:04:52.389> that<00:04:52.599> but<00:04:53.229> I<00:04:53.710> don't<00:04:54.250> really<00:04:54.490> think<00:04:54.610> that

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:54.939 
in that but I don't really think that

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:57.480 
in that but I don't really think that
Superman<00:04:55.509> will<00:04:55.659> think<00:04:55.900> Batman<00:04:56.289> as<00:04:56.409> much<00:04:56.710> of<00:04:56.949> a

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
Superman will think Batman as much of a

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.610 
Superman will think Batman as much of a
foe<00:04:58.300> forum<00:04:58.719> will<00:04:58.840> be<00:04:58.870> much<00:04:59.169> of<00:04:59.199> a<00:04:59.409> challenge

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
foe forum will be much of a challenge

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.469 
foe forum will be much of a challenge
and<00:04:59.979> thus<00:05:00.610> he<00:05:00.819> will<00:05:00.939> probably<00:05:01.300> take<00:05:01.419> him

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
and thus he will probably take him

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.600 
and thus he will probably take him
lightly<00:05:01.750> due<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.229> his<00:05:02.349> pride<00:05:02.650> in<00:05:02.889> his<00:05:02.979> ego<00:05:03.400> and

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
lightly due to his pride in his ego and

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.760 
lightly due to his pride in his ego and
do<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.509> fact<00:05:04.719> that<00:05:04.810> Batman<00:05:05.199> will<00:05:05.229> have<00:05:05.620> done

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
opportunity at the beginning and then

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.510 
opportunity at the beginning and then
once<00:05:41.319> they<00:05:41.500> get<00:05:41.650> into<00:05:41.800> it<00:05:42.069> he's<00:05:42.250> going<00:05:42.460> to
