probably<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.360> boxing<00:00:54.870> game<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.350> that's<00:00:55.559> it's

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
probably a boxing game and that's it's

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.439 
probably a boxing game and that's it's

allowed to play foot basically what I

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.210 
allowed to play foot basically what I
think<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.900> they<00:01:19.500> don't<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.159> you

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
think it is is they don't have it so you

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.649 
think it is is they don't have it so you
guys<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.549> download<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> packs<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.509> all<00:01:21.570> that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.420 
guys can download the packs and all that
stuff<00:01:21.750> yet<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.290> not<00:01:22.470> implemented<00:01:23.070> into<00:01:23.220> it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
stuff yet that's not implemented into it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.800 
stuff yet that's not implemented into it
so<00:01:24.000> you're<00:01:24.119> not<00:01:24.240> going<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.540> able<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.720> play
