00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
it more honesty there's a part of me who

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.240

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.580 

I'll<00:04:11.640> admit<00:04:11.999> I<00:04:12.209> was<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.540> bit<00:04:12.689> worried<00:04:13.319> when<00:04:13.439> I

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
I'll admit I was a bit worried when I

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.500 
I'll admit I was a bit worried when I
saw<00:04:13.680> these<00:04:14.010> two<00:04:14.249> crews<00:04:14.579> at<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.909> bottom<00:04:15.239> for<00:04:15.480> a

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.689 
saw these two crews at the bottom for a
second<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.019> thought<00:04:16.049> most<00:04:16.530> wanted<00:04:17.039> was<00:04:17.370> going

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
second I thought most wanted was going

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.300 
second I thought most wanted was going
to<00:04:17.789> be<00:04:17.880> saved<00:04:18.289> because<00:04:19.289> I've<00:04:19.560> been<00:04:19.590> ruling<00:04:19.979> for

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
to be saved because I've been ruling for

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.069 
to be saved because I've been ruling for
electrolytes<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:20.940> get<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.419> definitely<00:04:21.780> since

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
electrolytes to get to definitely since

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.290 
electrolytes to get to definitely since
