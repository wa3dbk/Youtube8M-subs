too but that's mostly the you know the
golf<00:01:39.240> cart<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.600> thought<00:01:39.870> was<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.080> rain<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.350> was

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
golf cart I thought was this rain I was

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.660 
golf cart I thought was this rain I was
gonna<00:01:40.590> make<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.920> really<00:01:41.130> good<00:01:41.250> slick<00:01:41.460> track

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
gonna make it a really good slick track

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.100 
gonna make it a really good slick track
I've<00:01:42.060> been<00:01:42.120> on<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.330> course<00:01:42.570> before<00:01:42.690> it<00:01:42.990> has

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
I've been on this course before it has

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840 
I've been on this course before it has
some<00:01:43.230> good<00:01:43.320> stand<00:01:43.620> jumps<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.100> usually<00:01:44.460> end<00:01:44.640> up

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
some good stand jumps I usually end up

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.540 
some good stand jumps I usually end up
in<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.150> sand<00:01:45.330> trap<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.780> when<00:01:45.870> I<00:01:45.930> play<00:01:46.200> so

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
in the sand trap on that when I play so

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.200 
in the sand trap on that when I play so
unfortunately<00:01:47.550> I<00:01:47.640> think<00:01:47.760> there's<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.120> to

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
unfortunately I think there's going to

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.640 
unfortunately I think there's going to
put<00:01:48.300> a<00:01:48.330> little<00:01:48.450> bit<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.660> a<00:01:48.750> damper<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.050> on<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
put a little bit of a damper on on the

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.190 
put a little bit of a damper on on the
conditions<00:01:50.010> and<00:01:50.480> the<00:01:51.480> drinking<00:01:51.750> may<00:01:51.900> have<00:01:52.080> to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
conditions and the drinking may have to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.780 
conditions and the drinking may have to
happen<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.890> here<00:01:53.280> instead<00:01:53.550> of<00:01:53.610> out<00:01:53.729> there

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
happen in the here instead of out there

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.280 
happen in the here instead of out there
I<00:01:54.090> think<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.479> would<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.720> won<00:01:54.900> I'm<00:01:55.140> just

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
I think you would have won I'm just

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.130 
I think you would have won I'm just
saying<00:01:55.760> we<00:01:56.760> would<00:01:57.300> have<00:01:57.420> won<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.570> funnel<00:01:57.990> word

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
saying we would have won the funnel word

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.560

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
maybe now we definitely were not very

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.900 
maybe now we definitely were not very
good<00:02:00.810> golfers<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.800> nitro<00:02:02.190> circus<00:02:02.369> true<00:02:02.700> but
