00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.010
 80 welcome that the crisis in the 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.289
 christoph and we do it ourselves today 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.590
 Needed herbal butter for that 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.349
 we 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.849
 parsley Chives 2 garlic cloves 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.860
 we still need compliments i do 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.300
 like to go in 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.000
 the stalk may throw at UNIVEG 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.129
 of parsley a bit of olive oil 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.050
 sea salt pepper lemon juice spritzer 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.390
 and of course the good old mother 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.519
 so you can start packing right now 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.659
 straight out she throws in 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:49.379
 In the meantime, I'll take that one for me 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:50.369
 mint before that just took off me 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.140
 always find great when still one 

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:55.199
 a little coin with it in there is again 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.500
 such a fresh taste should me 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.180
 Not everybody likes it but it does not taste that 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.180
 that fits that fits just wonderful 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.310
 very important otherwise 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.100
 It does not work like a kind 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.070
 fire out how it always strikes 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.619
 it will take 56 minutes to get there 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.929
 really scary aligns more volume 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.469
 and not only as a club as you would 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:25.049
 most of the time, I get it somewhere 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:29.100
 cut just finished with the 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.359
 Crash starts so the coin grad times in 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.579
 cut strips 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.920
 zack wonderful then still enough 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.560
 the rod is very important that a lot 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.560
 taste in there and we need 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.210
 of course the color that means we 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.210
 cut just think bit rudely 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:02:00.770
 the in the mix cup communication 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.770
 olive oil on it 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.610
 that's how you mix and mix 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.080
 parsley mint chives everything in 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.320
 then, as I've already mentioned , never did 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.520
 more since and white pepper can do it 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.200
 also make it clean in time 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:35.860
 snow look fast the cut 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:37.740
 Rotating be beautiful garlic that 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.390
 He later distributed himself well 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.610
 not that you have garlic butter 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.510
 and not once 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.510
 but that he all smells nice 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.220
 slowly a small tip rattles on 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.480
 Close to the garlic peel fine 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.910
 but do not get him to press 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:12.970
 gbk had to salt over it and through the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.830
 fine graining canek the beautiful 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.910
 push in 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.350
 but he still does not have and 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.750
 obtrusive taste as you like 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.530
 you chase through a garlic press 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.530
 it does not look so nice 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:51.860
 is just a bag off with it 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:55.400
 normal then have a go now 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.470
 here we parsley the parsley 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.390
 stems with olive oil once vigorously 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.769
 mixed her look beautiful green color has 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.370
 again really intense herbs 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.060
 taste here but are partially threads 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.420
 from the front stem that's why 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.650
 let's just go through a sieve 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.409
 right there you see how 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.940
 that is not really going to happen 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.010
 Of course she can be very rough too 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.260
 let in there but I think it's nice 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.130
 if it is no longer in it 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.130
 Do not pinch anything between your teeth 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.260
 that is true but partly to one 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:37.490
 Stupid threads do not have to be 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:39.380
 stir a man fries carefully 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:46.000
 not that your kitchen would turn green with me 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.000
 not because it is already going 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:11.570
 and fits wonderfully now even more 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.830
 Tricks and tips relatively much bigger 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.830
 made that much needed of course 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.430
 do not take that evening at all 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.610
 I always have alufoil and clear view 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.990
 before that , it gives me a clear view 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:35.990
 clear away a bit earlier that 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:38.770
 you know it better then give it out 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.770
 I'm up here 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:56.710
 so we take the transparencies 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:06:00.139
 put it over rolling once too big 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.409
 and then basically just one 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:06.199
 calm 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:13.249
 then we have a nice aware of that 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:14.629
 whole sausage the whole sausage comes because 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:17.599
 hi a film characterized she gets 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:23.509
 again a bit more stability 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:26.960
 just turned down exactly 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:29.149
 is it really boast so it has to be 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.229
 should be, it can only write 

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:33.259
 But the herbs were in the 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:35.569
 Freezer and a fire department 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:36.740
 on saturday in the month on friday evening out 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.479
 great thing 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.870
 Have fun while copying until 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:40.870
 next time
