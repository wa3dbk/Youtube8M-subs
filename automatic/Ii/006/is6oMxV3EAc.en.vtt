00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.850 
this picture especially when we like
shooting<00:02:46.450> action<00:02:46.630> because<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.500> athlete

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
shooting action because the athlete

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.710 
shooting action because the athlete
actually<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.430> one<00:02:48.580> who<00:02:48.730> really<00:02:49.060> knows<00:02:49.270> if

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
actually is the one who really knows if

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.480 
actually is the one who really knows if
the<00:02:49.900> position<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.470> 100%<00:02:50.890> right<00:02:51.310> and

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
the position is 100% right and

00:02:51.490 --> 00:03:01.190 
the position is 100% right and
acceptable<00:02:52.270> or<00:02:52.720> if<00:02:52.900> it's<00:02:53.050> not

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.690 

another<00:03:02.200> thing<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:02.500> was<00:03:02.890> quite<00:03:03.160> exciting<00:03:03.580> at

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
another thing that was quite exciting at

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.100 
another thing that was quite exciting at
the<00:03:03.730> shoot<00:03:04.000> was<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.390> we<00:03:04.480> were<00:03:04.630> using<00:03:04.840> some

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
the shoot was that we were using some

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.870 
the shoot was that we were using some
special<00:03:05.500> effects<00:03:05.800> for<00:03:06.190> each<00:03:06.370> athlete<00:03:06.610> we

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
special effects for each athlete we

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.690 
special effects for each athlete we
produced<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.630> set<00:03:07.900> of<00:03:07.930> gimmicks<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.650> we<00:03:09.520> use

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
produced a set of gimmicks that we use

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.730 
produced a set of gimmicks that we use
that<00:03:09.910> we<00:03:10.090> thought<00:03:10.360> that<00:03:10.750> would<00:03:10.930> support<00:03:11.650> the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
that we thought that would support the

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.910 
that we thought that would support the
concept<00:03:12.160> for<00:03:12.400> each<00:03:12.490> individual<00:03:13.060> athlete<00:03:13.300> and

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
concept for each individual athlete and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.980 
concept for each individual athlete and
yeah<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.310> effort<00:03:15.940> was<00:03:16.060> totally<00:03:16.390> worth<00:03:16.570> it<00:03:16.840> and

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
yeah the effort was totally worth it and

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.380 
yeah the effort was totally worth it and
the<00:03:17.620> images<00:03:18.010> just<00:03:18.190> turned<00:03:18.490> out<00:03:18.580> great

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:32.300
