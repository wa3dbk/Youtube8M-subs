little bit trouble finding the parts so

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.810 
little bit trouble finding the parts so
I'm<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:19.890> gonna<00:00:20.010> speed<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.310> up<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.520> little<00:00:20.640> bit

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
I'm just gonna speed it up a little bit

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.340 
I'm just gonna speed it up a little bit
I<00:00:21.029> know<00:00:21.330> they're<00:00:21.600> all<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.840> building<00:00:22.140> but<00:00:22.320> I

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
I know they're all in the building but I

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.320 
I know they're all in the building but I
didn't<00:00:22.560> know<00:00:22.650> exactly<00:00:22.800> where<00:00:23.160> they<00:00:23.279> were<00:00:23.340> so

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
didn't know exactly where they were so

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.410 
didn't know exactly where they were so
you<00:00:24.900> build<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.289> whole<00:00:25.439> thing<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.090> for<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.240> I

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
you build the whole thing and for this I

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.140 
you build the whole thing and for this I
recommend<00:00:27.810> getting<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.710> paralyzer<00:00:29.220> since<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
recommend getting the paralyzer since it

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.229 
recommend getting the paralyzer since it
doesn't<00:00:30.330> run<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.630> ammo<00:00:31.820> here<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.059> while<00:00:33.180> I

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.790 
make it a little bit quicker and this
area<00:01:33.380> I<00:01:33.800> messed<00:01:34.580> up<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.060> I<00:01:35.750> got<00:01:36.410> very<00:01:36.560> confused

area I messed up and I got very confused

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.520 
area I messed up and I got very confused
of<00:01:37.220> where<00:01:37.369> to<00:01:37.580> go<00:01:37.790> so<00:01:38.060> this<00:01:39.050> is<00:01:39.140> not<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:39.440> area

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
of where to go so this is not the area

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.990 
of where to go so this is not the area
I'm<00:01:39.830> recording<00:01:40.340> this<00:01:40.430> in<00:01:40.580> theater<00:01:40.850> mode

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
I'm recording this in theater mode

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.109 
I'm recording this in theater mode
because<00:01:41.450> I<00:01:41.780> it<00:01:42.440> was<00:01:42.650> pretty<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.490> know<00:01:43.610> a<00:01:43.850> long

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
because I it was pretty you know a long

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.320 
because I it was pretty you know a long
time<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.509> do<00:01:44.659> this<00:01:44.869> so<00:01:45.490> then<00:01:46.490> I<00:01:46.790> find<00:01:47.210> the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
time to do this so then I find the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.230 
time to do this so then I find the
correct<00:01:47.509> way<00:01:48.190> sooner<00:01:49.190> or<00:01:49.280> later<00:01:49.400> right<00:01:49.880> here

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
correct way sooner or later right here

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.999 
correct way sooner or later right here
and<00:01:50.420> I'm<00:01:51.020> gonna<00:01:51.140> pause<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.560> recording<00:01:51.590> right
