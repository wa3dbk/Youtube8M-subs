00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.419 
think about that mr. next time okay you
know<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:47.340> honestly<00:01:47.939> really<00:01:48.899> honestly<00:01:49.680> you

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
know just honestly really honestly you

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:51.649 
know just honestly really honestly you
know<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.820> people<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.179> said<00:01:51.330> that<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.570> me

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
know and people have said that to me

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.330 
know and people have said that to me
which<00:01:51.810> i<00:01:51.899> think<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.140> really<00:01:52.289> really<00:01:53.009> stupid

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
which i think is really really stupid

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.880 
which i think is really really stupid
logic<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.659> suppose<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:55.799> you're

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
logic is you know I suppose if you're

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.440 
logic is you know I suppose if you're
gonna<00:01:56.009> use<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.220> kind<00:01:56.580> of<00:01:56.610> rationale<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.299> I

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
gonna use that kind of rationale then I

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.590 
gonna use that kind of rationale then I
I<00:01:57.720> suppose<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.500> should<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.950> eating<00:01:59.600> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
I suppose we should be eating the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.110 
I suppose we should be eating the
retarded
