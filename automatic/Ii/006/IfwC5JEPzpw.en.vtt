00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
we looked at we're kind of getting into

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.209 
we looked at we're kind of getting into
the<00:00:08.639> auto<00:00:08.880> mode<00:00:09.660> era<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.830> one<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.130> a

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
the auto mode era and this one is a

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.850 
the auto mode era and this one is a
fully<00:00:11.610> auto<00:00:11.940> mode<00:00:12.240> Nikon<00:00:12.929> it's<00:00:13.380> actually<00:00:13.710> one

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
fully auto mode Nikon it's actually one

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.770 
fully auto mode Nikon it's actually one
of<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.040> last<00:00:14.219> consumer<00:00:14.849> or<00:00:15.089> maybe<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.630> last

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
of the last consumer or maybe the last

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.240 
of the last consumer or maybe the last
consumer<00:00:16.970> Nikon<00:00:17.970> SLR<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:19.140> used<00:00:19.439> film<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.070> a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
consumer Nikon SLR that used film so a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.279 
consumer Nikon SLR that used film so a
lot<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.210> functions<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.840> I'll<00:00:21.900> try<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.080> get

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
lot of functions and I'll try to get

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.019 
lot of functions and I'll try to get
into<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> live<00:00:22.710> as<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.039> can<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:23.460> there's<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:23.850> so

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
into a live as I can but there's just so

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.009 
into a live as I can but there's just so
much<00:00:24.150> function<00:00:24.510> that's<00:00:24.600> going<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.869> tough

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
much function that's going to be tough

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.230 
much function that's going to be tough
but<00:00:25.279> if<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.369> look<00:00:26.490> at<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:26.970> look<00:00:27.000> at

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
but if you look at this and you look at

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.099 
but if you look at this and you look at
a<00:00:27.390> modern<00:00:28.050> SLR<00:00:28.560> not<00:00:29.279> much<00:00:29.580> differences<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.330> I'm

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
a modern SLR not much differences so I'm

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.610 
a modern SLR not much differences so I'm
heavily<00:00:31.560> heavily<00:00:31.949> influenced<00:00:32.700> by<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:34.200> era<00:00:34.380> in

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
heavily heavily influenced by the era in

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.830 
heavily heavily influenced by the era in
the<00:00:34.710> 2000s<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.270> when<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> camera<00:00:36.630> came

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the 2000s this is when the camera came

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.660 
the 2000s this is when the camera came
out<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.649> looks<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.890> lot<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.190> cameras<00:00:38.520> now

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
out and it looks a lot like cameras now

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.240 
out and it looks a lot like cameras now
so<00:00:39.110> pretty<00:00:40.110> recognizable<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.860> bet<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.100> thought

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
so pretty recognizable I bet you thought

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
so pretty recognizable I bet you thought
it<00:00:41.399> through<00:00:41.430> stuff<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.820> might<00:00:41.969> think<00:00:42.149> it's

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
it through stuff you might think it's

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.450 
it through stuff you might think it's
digital<00:00:42.899> SLR<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.440> I'm<00:00:43.920> how<00:00:44.070> deep<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.340> your

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
digital SLR but I'm how deep on your

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.029 
digital SLR but I'm how deep on your
lens<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.390> lenses<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.410> an<00:00:46.500> older<00:00:46.829> lens

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
lens so the lenses this is an older lens

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.240 
lens so the lenses this is an older lens
but<00:00:48.320> you're<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.559> basically<00:00:49.860> put<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.160> on

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
but you're going to basically put it on

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.760 
but you're going to basically put it on
like<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.399> line<00:00:50.789> up<00:00:50.940> these<00:00:51.379> line<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.590> dots

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
like that line up these line up the dots

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.279 
like that line up these line up the dots
here<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.460> there's<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.699> dot<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:54.180> line<00:00:54.719> up<00:00:54.750> to

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
here so there's a dot here line up to

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.520 
here so there's a dot here line up to
that<00:00:55.469> dot<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.100> then<00:00:56.250> turn<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.610> left<00:00:57.530> see

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
that dot and then turn to the left see

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.090 
that dot and then turn to the left see
it<00:00:58.620> come<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:59.449> to<00:01:00.449> release<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.750> lens<00:01:01.100> this

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
it come on to release the lens this

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.039 
it come on to release the lens this
button<00:01:02.370> right<00:01:02.399> here<00:01:02.510> allows<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> take<00:01:03.960> it

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
button right here allows you to take it

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.270 
button right here allows you to take it
off<00:01:04.199> turning<00:01:04.769> right<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:07.950> try<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.100> do

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
off turning right so we just try to do

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.899 
off turning right so we just try to do
on<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.520> front<00:01:09.979> this<00:01:10.979> light<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.340> probably<00:01:11.670> for

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
on the front this light is probably for

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.140 
on the front this light is probably for
focusing<00:01:14.180> here<00:01:15.180> you're<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> see

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
focusing here you're going to see

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.260 
focusing here you're going to see
settings<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.049> lens<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.500> AF<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.520> lot<00:01:21.150> of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
settings for the the lens so AF a lot of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.420 
settings for the the lens so AF a lot of
focus<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.860> manual<00:01:22.860> focus<00:01:24.170> bracketing<00:01:26.299> flash

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the camera here's a back of the camera

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.770 
the camera here's a back of the camera
by<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.579> camera<00:01:47.939> these<00:01:48.119> are<00:01:48.180> these<00:01:48.750> are

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
by the camera these are these are

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.499 
by the camera these are these are
metering<00:01:49.170> modes<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.710> spot<00:01:50.040> metering<00:01:50.509> scene

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
metering modes so spot metering scene

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.179 
metering modes so spot metering scene
metering<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.110> think<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.070> an

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
metering I think this is like an

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.880 
metering I think this is like an
in-between<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.850> them<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.409> change<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.530> by<00:01:55.590> using

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
in-between of them to change it by using

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.330 
in-between of them to change it by using
this<00:01:56.070> tower<00:01:56.310> here<00:01:57.320> this<00:01:58.320> one<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.770> actually<00:01:59.189> to

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
this tower here this one is actually to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.020 
this tower here this one is actually to
select<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.560> focus<00:02:01.560> points<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:01.950> top<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.939> you're

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
select the focus points on top so you're

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.039 
select the focus points on top so you're
going<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.180> see<00:02:03.299> how<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:03.600> getting<00:02:03.689> kind<00:02:03.990> of

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
going to see how it's getting kind of

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.230 
going to see how it's getting kind of
awkward<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.340> many<00:02:05.490> settings<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.090> not<00:02:06.210> a

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
awkward that so many settings and not a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.969 
awkward that so many settings and not a
really<00:02:06.540> great<00:02:06.719> way<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.200> when<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.860> get

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
really great way to do it when you get

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.889 
really great way to do it when you get
into<00:02:08.069> digital<00:02:08.399> cameras<00:02:08.789> later<00:02:09.119> they<00:02:09.509> take<00:02:09.750> all

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
into digital cameras later they take all

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.089 
into digital cameras later they take all
these<00:02:10.080> Dixey<00:02:10.440> care<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.709> all<00:02:10.770> these<00:02:10.860> because<00:02:11.069> I

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
these Dixey care of all these because I

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.890 
these Dixey care of all these because I
have<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.280> screen<00:02:11.550> live<00:02:11.760> Acula<00:02:12.060> here<00:02:12.330> you're

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
have a screen live Acula here you're

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
have a screen live Acula here you're
still<00:02:13.020> using<00:02:13.170> LCD<00:02:13.650> screen

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
still using LCD screen

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.290 
still using LCD screen
on<00:02:14.040> tops<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.459> let's<00:02:14.580> turn<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.880> real<00:02:15.000> quick<00:02:15.150> to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
on tops and let's turn on real quick to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.210 
on tops and let's turn on real quick to
show<00:02:15.360> but<00:02:15.720> that's<00:02:16.530> how<00:02:16.650> you're<00:02:16.800> changing<00:02:16.920> it

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
show but that's how you're changing it

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.620 
show but that's how you're changing it
so<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.400> see<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.760> when<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.030> move<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.450> I'm

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
so you see that when I move that I'm

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.979 
so you see that when I move that I'm
changing<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.590> autofocus<00:02:19.920> point<00:02:20.780> pretty<00:02:21.780> good

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
changing the autofocus point pretty good

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.699 
changing the autofocus point pretty good
till<00:02:22.140> five<00:02:22.290> autofocus<00:02:22.830> points<00:02:23.480> not<00:02:24.480> bad

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
till five autofocus points not bad

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.640 
till five autofocus points not bad
auto<00:02:25.980> exposure<00:02:26.400> lock<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:28.170> changes<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
auto exposure lock this changes the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.880 
auto exposure lock this changes the
diopter<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:30.450> view<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:31.020> viewfinder

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
diopter and the the view the viewfinder

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.130 
diopter and the the view the viewfinder
so<00:02:32.220> moving<00:02:33.209> up<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.480> little<00:02:33.600> bit<00:02:33.720> moving<00:02:33.900> down<00:02:34.110> a

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
so moving up a little bit moving down a

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.660 
so moving up a little bit moving down a
little<00:02:34.290> bit<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.739> see<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.190> moves<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.520> right

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
little bit you see it moves it right

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.640 
little bit you see it moves it right
there<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.180> I'm<00:02:36.890> customization<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.160> way<00:02:38.340> this

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
there so I'm customization that way this

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.830 
there so I'm customization that way this
has<00:02:40.650> one<00:02:41.100> dollar<00:02:41.340> here<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.420> style<00:02:42.660> is<00:02:42.810> for

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
has one dollar here and the style is for

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.090 
has one dollar here and the style is for
changing<00:02:43.489> things<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:46.100> changing

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
changing things like is it changing

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.430 
changing things like is it changing
things<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.370> shutter<00:02:47.610> speed<00:02:47.850> aperture<00:02:48.440> on

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
things like shutter speed aperture on

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.600 
things like shutter speed aperture on
top<00:02:49.709> flash<00:02:51.950> into<00:02:52.950> your<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.190> want<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.459> see

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
top flash into your you want to see

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.949 
top flash into your you want to see
exposure<00:02:53.970> compensation<00:02:54.209> so<00:02:54.720> exposure

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
exposure compensation so exposure

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.229 
exposure compensation so exposure
conversation<00:02:55.470> pretty<00:02:56.220> simple<00:02:56.580> try<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.090> out

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
conversation pretty simple try it out

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.710 
conversation pretty simple try it out
right<00:02:57.330> here

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.440 

things<00:03:00.720> playing<00:03:01.370> but<00:03:02.370> holding<00:03:02.850> down<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.000> and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
things playing but holding down that and

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.870 
things playing but holding down that and
turning<00:03:03.900> changing<00:03:04.260> this<00:03:04.530> changes<00:03:05.519> exposure

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
turning changing this changes exposure

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.720 
turning changing this changes exposure
compensation<00:03:06.620> on<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.980> right<00:03:08.130> your<00:03:08.489> start<00:03:08.640> to

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.490 
compensation on the right your start to
see<00:03:08.819> a<00:03:08.850> lot<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.180> these<00:03:09.480> modes<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.200> looks<00:03:10.410> a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
see a lot of these modes so this looks a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.530

it's<00:04:20.010> trying<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.280> go<00:04:21.440> on<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:23.070> bottom

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
it's trying to go on the bottom

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.560 
it's trying to go on the bottom
on<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.900> camera<00:04:24.640> going<00:04:25.640> to<00:04:25.790> see<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.210> tripod

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
on the camera going to see the tripod

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.340 
on the camera going to see the tripod
socket<00:04:26.750> right<00:04:27.050> there<00:04:27.790> battery<00:04:28.930> uses<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.140> see

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
socket right there battery uses to see

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:48.330 
socket right there battery uses to see
our<00:04:30.530> two<00:04:30.770> batteries<00:04:33.760> look<00:04:34.760> like<00:04:34.940> that<00:04:46.390> so<00:04:47.390> um

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
our two batteries look like that so um

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.620 
our two batteries look like that so um
build<00:04:49.340> quality<00:04:49.580> actually<00:04:49.940> feels<00:04:50.240> pretty<00:04:50.330> good

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
build quality actually feels pretty good

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.660 
build quality actually feels pretty good
I<00:04:50.690> like<00:04:51.140> the<00:04:51.230> way<00:04:51.320> it<00:04:51.380> feels<00:04:51.530> it<00:04:51.770> feels<00:04:51.800> a<00:04:52.220> lot

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
I like the way it feels it feels a lot

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.820 
I like the way it feels it feels a lot
like<00:04:52.850> a<00:04:52.940> modern<00:04:53.210> DSLR<00:04:53.690> so<00:04:53.900> if<00:04:54.620> you<00:04:54.740> were

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
like a modern DSLR so if you were

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.410 
like a modern DSLR so if you were
looking<00:04:55.070> for<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.280> film<00:04:55.850> camera<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.150> don't<00:04:56.300> want

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
looking for a film camera you don't want

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.660 
looking for a film camera you don't want
to<00:04:56.480> go<00:04:56.570> all<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.810> way<00:04:57.020> back<00:04:57.230> old-school<00:04:57.670> to

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
to go all the way back old-school to

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.210 
to go all the way back old-school to
manual<00:04:59.090> focus<00:04:59.360> lens<00:04:59.570> but<00:05:00.530> this<00:05:01.100> one's

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
manual focus lens but this one's

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.490 
manual focus lens but this one's
actually<00:05:01.370> will<00:05:01.760> be<00:05:01.790> a<00:05:02.030> good<00:05:02.240> switch<00:05:02.450> off<00:05:03.280> also

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
actually will be a good switch off also

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.700 
actually will be a good switch off also
self<00:05:06.500> timer<00:05:06.770> right<00:05:06.890> there<00:05:08.140> so<00:05:09.140> many<00:05:09.320> settings

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
self timer right there so many settings

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.800 
self timer right there so many settings
it's<00:05:10.040> hard<00:05:10.190> to<00:05:10.280> go<00:05:10.370> through<00:05:10.450> this<00:05:11.450> camera<00:05:11.690> is

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
it's hard to go through this camera is

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.720 
it's hard to go through this camera is
pretty<00:05:11.930> good<00:05:12.110> build<00:05:12.350> quality<00:05:12.470> I<00:05:13.070> like<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.610> way

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
pretty good build quality I like the way

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.130 
pretty good build quality I like the way
it<00:05:13.850> feels<00:05:14.060> in<00:05:14.240> my<00:05:14.300> hand<00:05:14.600> it<00:05:14.690> feels<00:05:14.750> really

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
it feels in my hand it feels really

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.370 
it feels in my hand it feels really
natural<00:05:15.290> so<00:05:15.800> pretty<00:05:16.550> ergonomic<00:05:17.390> it's<00:05:18.230> not

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
natural so pretty ergonomic it's not

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.050 
natural so pretty ergonomic it's not
going<00:05:18.650> anywhere<00:05:18.890> it<00:05:19.550> was<00:05:19.670> a<00:05:19.760> lot<00:05:19.910> like<00:05:20.030> a

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
going anywhere it was a lot like a

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.200 
going anywhere it was a lot like a
modern<00:05:20.420> SLR<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:21.730> that's<00:05:22.730> probably<00:05:22.940> why<00:05:23.060> it's

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
modern SLR and that's probably why it's

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.020 
modern SLR and that's probably why it's
funny<00:05:23.420> um<00:05:23.660> since<00:05:24.650> you're<00:05:24.830> thinking<00:05:25.340> about<00:05:25.430> you

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
funny um since you're thinking about you

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.840 
funny um since you're thinking about you
know<00:05:26.290> Nikon<00:05:27.290> needed<00:05:27.620> to<00:05:27.770> make<00:05:28.070> digital

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
know Nikon needed to make digital

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.280 
know Nikon needed to make digital
cameras<00:05:29.420> after<00:05:29.660> this<00:05:29.780> point<00:05:29.960> because<00:05:30.200> there's

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
cameras after this point because there's

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.110 
cameras after this point because there's
so<00:05:30.560> many<00:05:30.710> settings<00:05:31.040> on<00:05:31.160> here<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:31.550> it's

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
so many settings on here and it's

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.290 
so many settings on here and it's
getting<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.420> little<00:05:32.540> bit<00:05:32.780> confusing<00:05:33.290> and<00:05:34.300> when

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
getting a little bit confusing and when

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.430 
getting a little bit confusing and when
you<00:05:35.360> have<00:05:35.510> all<00:05:35.690> these<00:05:35.840> things<00:05:35.900> and<00:05:36.170> you<00:05:36.260> put<00:05:36.380> it

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
you have all these things and you put it

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.990 
you have all these things and you put it
into<00:05:36.620> your<00:05:36.710> screen<00:05:37.040> it's<00:05:37.310> a<00:05:37.370> lot<00:05:37.520> easier<00:05:37.700> to<00:05:37.850> go

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
into your screen it's a lot easier to go

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.710 
into your screen it's a lot easier to go
through<00:05:38.330> this<00:05:39.260> LCD<00:05:40.070> screen<00:05:40.520> does<00:05:41.150> a<00:05:41.180> lot<00:05:41.450> but

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
through this LCD screen does a lot but

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.120 
through this LCD screen does a lot but
it<00:05:41.840> doesn't<00:05:42.080> do<00:05:42.140> enough<00:05:42.230> a<00:05:42.500> lot<00:05:42.620> of<00:05:42.680> times<00:05:42.860> to

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
it doesn't do enough a lot of times to

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.710 
it doesn't do enough a lot of times to
is<00:05:43.790> there's<00:05:44.000> so<00:05:44.090> much<00:05:44.210> stuff<00:05:44.450> that<00:05:44.480> you<00:05:44.630> have

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
is there's so much stuff that you have

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.960 
is there's so much stuff that you have
to<00:05:44.810> deal<00:05:45.080> with<00:05:45.430> so<00:05:46.430> when<00:05:46.580> you<00:05:46.640> think<00:05:46.730> of<00:05:46.850> the

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
to deal with so when you think of the

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.020 
to deal with so when you think of the
last<00:05:47.090> consumer<00:05:47.600> SLR<00:05:48.260> with<00:05:48.950> film<00:05:49.250> this<00:05:49.670> is<00:05:49.820> it

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
last consumer SLR with film this is it

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.310 
last consumer SLR with film this is it
this<00:05:50.210> is<00:05:50.270> what's<00:05:50.480> going<00:05:50.660> to<00:05:50.750> look<00:05:50.840> like<00:05:51.020> and<00:05:51.260> it

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
this is what's going to look like and it

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.790 
this is what's going to look like and it
looks<00:05:51.500> a<00:05:51.680> lot<00:05:52.190> like<00:05:52.370> a<00:05:52.610> modern<00:05:53.090> SLR<00:05:53.800> price-wise

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
looks a lot like a modern SLR price-wise

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.340 
looks a lot like a modern SLR price-wise
I<00:05:54.860> would<00:05:55.250> I<00:05:55.430> see<00:05:55.820> these<00:05:55.970> pretty<00:05:56.780> pretty<00:05:57.110> weird

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
I would I see these pretty pretty weird

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.380 
I would I see these pretty pretty weird
range<00:05:57.560> on<00:05:57.740> these<00:05:57.830> I<00:05:57.890> see<00:05:58.190> these<00:05:58.340> from<00:05:58.490> like<00:05:58.670> ten

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
range on these I see these from like ten

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.760 
range on these I see these from like ten
dollars<00:05:59.780> all<00:06:00.050> the<00:06:00.080> way<00:06:00.170> up<00:06:00.260> to<00:06:00.470> fifty<00:06:00.740> dollars

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
dollars all the way up to fifty dollars

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.190 
dollars all the way up to fifty dollars
and<00:06:01.220> I<00:06:01.250> think<00:06:01.520> I<00:06:01.760> would<00:06:02.240> pay<00:06:02.390> probably<00:06:02.660> thirty

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
and I think I would pay probably thirty

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.290 
and I think I would pay probably thirty
dollars<00:06:03.740> for<00:06:03.770> a<00:06:04.010> working<00:06:04.400> one<00:06:04.430> in<00:06:04.820> the<00:06:05.210> only

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
dollars for a working one in the only

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.610 
dollars for a working one in the only
thing<00:06:05.420> with<00:06:05.690> that<00:06:05.750> is<00:06:06.050> that<00:06:06.080> these<00:06:06.560> are

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
thing with that is that these are

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.250 
thing with that is that these are
possible<00:06:07.370> find<00:06:07.820> parts<00:06:08.090> for<00:06:08.180> you're<00:06:09.080> going<00:06:09.200> to

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
possible find parts for you're going to

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.990 
possible find parts for you're going to
buy<00:06:09.620> two<00:06:09.680> or<00:06:09.920> three<00:06:10.070> if<00:06:10.370> you<00:06:10.460> really<00:06:10.670> like<00:06:10.820> it

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
buy two or three if you really like it

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.360 
buy two or three if you really like it
and<00:06:11.150> then<00:06:11.270> scrap<00:06:12.080> the<00:06:12.350> new<00:06:12.530> ones<00:06:12.770> scrap<00:06:13.250> the

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
and then scrap the new ones scrap the

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.950 
and then scrap the new ones scrap the
other<00:06:13.520> ones<00:06:13.670> or<00:06:13.790> parts<00:06:14.060> and<00:06:14.270> scrap<00:06:14.480> them<00:06:14.810> they

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
other ones or parts and scrap them they

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.270 
other ones or parts and scrap them they
kind<00:06:15.170> of<00:06:15.260> like<00:06:15.410> switch<00:06:15.710> interchange<00:06:16.160> parts

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
kind of like switch interchange parts

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.010 
kind of like switch interchange parts
between<00:06:16.490> them<00:06:16.760> because<00:06:17.450> you<00:06:17.600> probably<00:06:17.840> can't

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
between them because you probably can't

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.660 
between them because you probably can't
order<00:06:18.170> parts<00:06:18.500> these<00:06:18.680> cameras<00:06:19.010> anymore<00:06:20.770> and<00:06:21.770> so

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
order parts these cameras anymore and so

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
order parts these cameras anymore and so
that's<00:06:22.940> the<00:06:23.030> issue<00:06:23.090> with<00:06:23.360> these<00:06:23.480> kind<00:06:23.660> of

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
that's the issue with these kind of

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.570 
that's the issue with these kind of
cameras<00:06:24.080> once<00:06:24.230> the<00:06:24.440> electronics<00:06:25.040> are<00:06:25.160> faulty

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
cameras once the electronics are faulty

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.070 
cameras once the electronics are faulty
once<00:06:25.850> it<00:06:25.970> starts<00:06:26.180> to<00:06:26.240> break<00:06:26.480> its<00:06:26.780> bricked

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
once it starts to break its bricked

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.110 
once it starts to break its bricked
you're<00:06:27.350> kind<00:06:27.500> of<00:06:27.530> done<00:06:27.740> and<00:06:27.980> there's<00:06:28.910> no<00:06:29.000> way

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
you're kind of done and there's no way

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.710 
you're kind of done and there's no way
around<00:06:29.150> that<00:06:29.480> so<00:06:29.870> a<00:06:30.590> nice<00:06:31.010> camera<00:06:31.430> and<00:06:31.690> kind<00:06:32.690> of

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
around that so a nice camera and kind of

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.870 
around that so a nice camera and kind of
like<00:06:32.900> a<00:06:32.930> predecessor<00:06:33.290> to<00:06:33.740> the<00:06:34.070> predecessor<00:06:34.730> to

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
like a predecessor to the predecessor to

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.879 
like a predecessor to the predecessor to
what<00:06:35.030> Falls<00:06:35.300> and<00:06:35.570> it's<00:06:35.690> a<00:06:35.780> pretty<00:06:36.080> cool

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
what Falls and it's a pretty cool

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:38.860 
what Falls and it's a pretty cool
no<00:06:36.949> a<00:06:36.979> piece<00:06:37.159> of<00:06:37.249> history<00:06:37.490> looking<00:06:37.879> at<00:06:37.999> this<00:06:38.689> is

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
no a piece of history looking at this is

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.110 
no a piece of history looking at this is
this<00:06:39.620> is<00:06:39.770> how<00:06:39.949> this<00:06:40.159> is<00:06:40.280> where<00:06:40.460> they<00:06:40.729> kind<00:06:41.030> of

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
this is how this is where they kind of

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.480 
this is how this is where they kind of
ended<00:06:41.479> the<00:06:41.840> film<00:06:42.110> lost<00:06:42.259> the<00:06:42.620> film<00:06:42.830> SLR<00:06:43.310> and

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.550 
ended the film lost the film SLR and
they<00:06:44.060> took<00:06:44.330> these<00:06:44.569> designs<00:06:44.900> straight<00:06:45.289> into<00:06:45.529> a

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
they took these designs straight into a

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.619 
they took these designs straight into a
digital<00:06:45.830> SLR<00:06:46.069> and<00:06:46.520> this<00:06:46.639> is<00:06:46.789> what<00:06:47.509> they

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:47.629 
digital SLR and this is what they

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:49.929 
digital SLR and this is what they
thought<00:06:47.810> worked<00:06:48.139> so<00:06:48.849> that's<00:06:49.849> just

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:49.939 
thought worked so that's just

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:52.869 
thought worked so that's just
interesting<00:06:50.389> in<00:06:50.509> itself<00:06:51.639> remember<00:06:52.639> to<00:06:52.729> like
