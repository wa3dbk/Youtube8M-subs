sweet fricken constructive tutorial and
now<00:00:04.859> that<00:00:05.100> we<00:00:05.250> got<00:00:05.400> our<00:00:05.520> dude<00:00:05.700> imported<00:00:06.420> I

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
now that we got our dude imported I

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.120 
now that we got our dude imported I
think<00:00:07.140> it's<00:00:07.410> time<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:07.710> we<00:00:07.919> actually

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
think it's time that we actually

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.089 
think it's time that we actually
animated<00:00:08.940> them<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:10.139> order<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.620> do<00:00:10.889> that

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
animated them so in order to do that

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.950 
animated them so in order to do that
we're<00:00:12.000> gonna<00:00:12.059> be<00:00:12.240> working<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.599> lot<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:12.870> this

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
we're gonna be working a lot in this

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.570 
we're gonna be working a lot in this
animations<00:00:13.590> window<00:00:13.920> right<00:00:14.130> here<00:00:14.160> pretty<00:00:14.460> much

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
animations window right here pretty much

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.790 
animations window right here pretty much
say<00:00:14.880> take<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.389> image<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:15.990> make<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.440> into<00:00:16.710> an

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
say take this image and make it into an

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.920 
say take this image and make it into an
animation<00:00:17.180> so<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.270> first<00:00:18.480> thing<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.720> want<00:00:18.900> to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
animation so the first thing I want to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.620 
animation so the first thing I want to
do<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.350> rename<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.039> from<00:00:20.279> default<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.150> if

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
do is rename this from default and if

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.070 
do is rename this from default and if
you<00:00:21.750> actually<00:00:22.080> just<00:00:22.289> click<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.800> then<00:00:23.369> a

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
you actually just click on it then a

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.970 
you actually just click on it then a
litters<00:00:25.080> gonna<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.470> here<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.590> don't<00:00:25.710> need<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
litters gonna be here you don't need to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.790 
litters gonna be here you don't need to
press<00:00:26.189> like<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.369> pen<00:00:26.640> like<00:00:27.090> last<00:00:27.300> time<00:00:27.800> just

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
press like a pen like last time just

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.429 
press like a pen like last time just
rename<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.550> idle<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.060> then<00:00:30.750> deselect<00:00:31.080> it

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
rename this to idle and then deselect it

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.709 
rename this to idle and then deselect it
and<00:00:31.590> it'll<00:00:31.740> um<00:00:32.009> pretty<00:00:32.820> much<00:00:33.000> well<00:00:33.420> just

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and it'll um pretty much well just

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.670 
and it'll um pretty much well just
rename<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.170> idle<00:00:34.469> though<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:36.020> so<00:00:37.020> now<00:00:37.620> that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
rename it to idle though and so now that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.160 
rename it to idle though and so now that
we<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.850> animation<00:00:39.300> name<00:00:39.570> properly<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
we have this animation name properly the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.110 
we have this animation name properly the
next<00:00:40.500> thing<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.710> wanted<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.340> change<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
next thing I wanted to do is change the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.290 
next thing I wanted to do is change the
speed<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.780> animation<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.370> make<00:00:45.059> sure<00:00:45.180> that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
speed of the animation so make sure that

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.479 
speed of the animation so make sure that
this<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.629> selected<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.289> once<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
this is selected and once it is the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.340 
this is selected and once it is the
properties<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.360> will<00:00:48.510> pop<00:00:48.719> up<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.079> left

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
properties of it will pop up on the left

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.540 
properties of it will pop up on the left
and<00:00:49.890> change<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> speed<00:00:50.550> from<00:00:50.820> five<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.930> nine

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
and change the speed from five to nine

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.439 
and change the speed from five to nine
now<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.640> course<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.030> speed<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> your

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
now of course the speed of your

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.439 
now of course the speed of your
animation<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.920> gonna<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.449> preference

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
animation is just gonna be preference

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.209 
animation is just gonna be preference
more<00:00:57.750> than<00:00:57.870> anything<00:00:58.140> else<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.859> know<00:00:58.980> that

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
more than anything else but I know that

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.209 
more than anything else but I know that
nine<00:00:59.460> looks<00:00:59.670> pretty<00:00:59.879> good<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
nine looks pretty good on here and

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.250 
nine looks pretty good on here and
obviously<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.430> faster<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.570> speed<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
obviously the faster the speed is the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.170 
obviously the faster the speed is the
faster<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.890> these<00:01:05.280> images<00:01:05.549> are<00:01:05.790> gonna<00:01:05.909> play

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
faster that these images are gonna play

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.450 
faster that these images are gonna play
so<00:01:06.869> if<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.290> change<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.770> slow<00:01:07.950> he's<00:01:08.189> gonna<00:01:08.310> be

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
so if you change it slow he's gonna be

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.090 
so if you change it slow he's gonna be
bobbing<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.299> down<00:01:09.420> slowly<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> you

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
bobbing up and down slowly like a you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.280 
bobbing up and down slowly like a you
know<00:01:11.130> big<00:01:11.460> lard<00:01:11.820> if<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.390> change<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.049> like

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
know big lard if you change it to like

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.810 
know big lard if you change it to like
fifty<00:01:13.770> he's<00:01:13.950> gonna<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.220> bobbing<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.729> down

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
fifty he's gonna be bobbing up and down

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.969 
fifty he's gonna be bobbing up and down
real<00:01:15.090> quick<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> crackhead<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.680> nine

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
real quick like a crackhead so nine

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.740 
real quick like a crackhead so nine
perfect<00:01:17.610> make<00:01:17.970> them<00:01:18.090> look<00:01:18.240> normal

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
perfect make them look normal

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.350 
perfect make them look normal
and<00:01:19.070> right<00:01:20.070> now<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.850> actually<00:01:20.970> want<00:01:21.299> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and right now if you actually want to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.240 
and right now if you actually want to
test<00:01:21.630> how<00:01:21.840> fast<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.229> looks<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.710> you

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
test how fast it looks if you

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.410 
test how fast it looks if you
right-click<00:01:24.200> idle<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.409> press<00:01:26.130> preview<00:01:28.009> as

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
right-click idle and press preview as

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.660 
right-click idle and press preview as
you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:30.810> he<00:01:31.350> Bob's<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.979> down<00:01:32.130> once

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
you can see he Bob's up and down once

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.450 
you can see he Bob's up and down once
then<00:01:33.090> stops<00:01:33.450> alright<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.950> that's<00:01:35.280> obviously

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
then stops alright so that's obviously

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.850 
then stops alright so that's obviously
not<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.750> wanted<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.079> do<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.560> what's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
not one what we wanted to do so what's

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.280 
not one what we wanted to do so what's
the<00:01:38.009> issue<00:01:38.100> right<00:01:38.400> here<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.420> issue<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.960> if

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the issue right here and the issue is if

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.679 
the issue right here and the issue is if
we<00:01:40.680> want<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.040> animation<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:42.000> done<00:01:42.240> then

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
we want this animation to get done then

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.870 
we want this animation to get done then
keep<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:42.990> over<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.189> over<00:01:44.490> again<00:01:44.579> pretty

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
keep going over and over again pretty

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580 
keep going over and over again pretty
much<00:01:44.970> once<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.509> gets<00:01:45.659> done<00:01:45.869> start<00:01:46.320> from<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
much once it gets done start from the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.330 
much once it gets done start from the
beginning<00:01:46.680> again

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
beginning again

can see it but he continually Bob is up
and<00:02:00.000> down<00:02:00.119> hopefully<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.659> guys<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:01.049> see<00:02:01.170> that

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and down hopefully you guys can see that

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.469 
and down hopefully you guys can see that
on<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.500> screen<00:02:01.619> recorder

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
on the screen recorder

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.330 
on the screen recorder
alright<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.630> our<00:02:03.750> dude<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.170> bobbing<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.159> and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
alright so our dude is bobbing up and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.639 
alright so our dude is bobbing up and
down<00:02:05.509> continually<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:07.229> pretty<00:02:07.530> much

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
down continually so that's pretty much

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.779 
down continually so that's pretty much
what's<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.099> happen<00:02:08.429> when<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.759> user

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
what's going to happen when the user

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.760 
what's going to happen when the user
isn't<00:02:09.239> pressing<00:02:09.629> anything<00:02:10.020> when<00:02:10.289> they<00:02:10.410> just

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
isn't pressing anything when they just

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
isn't pressing anything when they just
like<00:02:10.920> walk<00:02:11.250> away<00:02:11.370> from<00:02:11.610> their<00:02:11.790> keyboard

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
like walk away from their keyboard

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.360 
like walk away from their keyboard
so<00:02:13.480> right<00:02:13.750> now<00:02:13.900> what<00:02:14.379> we<00:02:14.500> can<00:02:14.650> do<00:02:14.799> is<00:02:15.069> since

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
so right now what we can do is since

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.860 
so right now what we can do is since
we're<00:02:15.519> kind<00:02:15.939> of<00:02:16.060> done<00:02:16.209> with<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.450> animation

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
we're kind of done with this animation

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.190 
we're kind of done with this animation
right<00:02:17.200> now<00:02:17.349> just<00:02:18.189> close<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.670> out<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.420> actually

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
right now just close it out and actually

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.949 
right now just close it out and actually
want<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.590> move<00:02:20.829> him<00:02:21.099> so<00:02:22.090> he<00:02:22.209> starts<00:02:22.599> out<00:02:22.720> like

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
want to move him so he starts out like

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.449 
want to move him so he starts out like
right<00:02:23.349> there

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
right there

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.910 
right there
might<00:02:24.849> as<00:02:24.939> well<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.840> I'm<00:02:26.079> also<00:02:26.319> gonna<00:02:26.530> rename

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
might as well and I'm also gonna rename

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.740 
might as well and I'm also gonna rename
him<00:02:27.159> from<00:02:27.430> sprite<00:02:27.849> to<00:02:28.620> two-player<00:02:30.480> since<00:02:31.480> this

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
him from sprite to two-player since this

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.009 
him from sprite to two-player since this
guy<00:02:31.959> is<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:32.200> player<00:02:33.060> all<00:02:34.060> right<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:34.989> our

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
guy is a player all right so our

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.960 
guy is a player all right so our
animation<00:02:35.709> is<00:02:35.950> good<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.280> go<00:02:36.400> let's<00:02:36.790> go<00:02:36.819> ahead

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
animation is good to go let's go ahead

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.559 
animation is good to go let's go ahead
and<00:02:37.120> preview<00:02:37.269> this<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.599> see<00:02:37.780> how<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.079> looks

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
and preview this and see how it looks

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.920 
and preview this and see how it looks
okay<00:02:40.569> so<00:02:40.810> we<00:02:41.170> have<00:02:41.349> some<00:02:41.500> issues<00:02:42.239> with<00:02:43.239> the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
okay so we have some issues with the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.509 
okay so we have some issues with the
screen<00:02:44.319> which<00:02:44.680> we're<00:02:44.859> going<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.010> fix<00:02:45.220> later

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
screen which we're going to fix later

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.970 
screen which we're going to fix later
but<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.450> dude<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:47.049> bobbing<00:02:47.470> up<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.650> down<00:02:47.739> it

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
but that dude is bobbing up and down it

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.050 
but that dude is bobbing up and down it
looks<00:02:48.099> like<00:02:48.190> he's<00:02:48.400> just<00:02:48.459> sitting<00:02:48.849> on<00:02:48.909> the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
looks like he's just sitting on the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.800 
looks like he's just sitting on the
toolbar<00:02:49.540> on<00:02:49.750> my<00:02:50.459> computer<00:02:51.459> so<00:02:52.030> I<00:02:52.060> know<00:02:52.540> it

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
toolbar on my computer so I know it

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.479 
toolbar on my computer so I know it
actually<00:02:53.049> looks<00:02:53.260> pretty<00:02:53.440> cool<00:02:53.620> leave<00:02:54.340> that

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
actually looks pretty cool leave that

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.140 
actually looks pretty cool leave that
right<00:02:54.639> there<00:02:54.670> for<00:02:54.970> now

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
right there for now

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.420 
right there for now
and<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.049> reason<00:02:56.379> is<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.709> because<00:02:56.739> this<00:02:57.250> is

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
and the reason is is because this is

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.309 
and the reason is is because this is
your<00:02:57.639> screen<00:02:57.849> size<00:02:58.120> if<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.690> didn't<00:02:58.989> know<00:02:59.079> this

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
your screen size if you didn't know this

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.740 
your screen size if you didn't know this
dotted<00:02:59.620> line<00:02:59.829> right<00:03:00.280> here<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:00.700> we<00:03:01.480> can<00:03:01.629> adjust

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
dotted line right here and we can adjust

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.960 
dotted line right here and we can adjust
that<00:03:02.079> later<00:03:02.409> on<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.799> give<00:03:02.950> us<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.220> little<00:03:03.639> better

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
that later on to give us a little better

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.899 
that later on to give us a little better
resolution<00:03:04.750> but<00:03:05.440> for<00:03:05.620> right<00:03:05.739> now<00:03:05.799> I<00:03:06.190> want<00:03:06.879> to

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
resolution but for right now I want to

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.129 
resolution but for right now I want to
talk<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.269> guys<00:03:07.389> about<00:03:08.040> behaviors<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:10.420> what

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
talk to you guys about behaviors so what

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.649 
talk to you guys about behaviors so what
we<00:03:11.349> want<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.680> do<00:03:11.799> is<00:03:12.069> we're<00:03:13.000> gonna<00:03:13.090> be<00:03:13.269> working

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
we want to do is we're gonna be working

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.420 
we want to do is we're gonna be working
a<00:03:13.720> lot<00:03:13.870> with<00:03:13.930> something<00:03:14.470> called<00:03:14.650> platform

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
a lot with something called platform

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.199 
a lot with something called platform
behaviors<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:17.650> is<00:03:17.949> basically<00:03:18.250> the

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
behaviors and this is basically the

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.119 
behaviors and this is basically the
behavior<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:19.900> your<00:03:20.199> add<00:03:20.349> to<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.680> lot<00:03:20.919> of<00:03:21.040> these

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
behavior that your add to a lot of these

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.699 
behavior that your add to a lot of these
sprites<00:03:21.549> for<00:03:22.299> a<00:03:22.329> platformer<00:03:23.019> game<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.590> guys

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
sprites for a platformer game you guys

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.050 
sprites for a platformer game you guys
are<00:03:23.859> gonna<00:03:23.949> see<00:03:24.160> exactly<00:03:24.310> what<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:24.790> platform

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
are gonna see exactly what a platform

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.900 
are gonna see exactly what a platform
behavior<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:25.930> little<00:03:26.290> later<00:03:26.739> on<00:03:26.829> okay<00:03:27.639> let<00:03:27.819> me

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
behavior is little later on okay let me

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.059 
behavior is little later on okay let me
move<00:03:28.090> him<00:03:28.239> up<00:03:28.449> so<00:03:28.840> if<00:03:29.290> I<00:03:29.410> demonstrate<00:03:29.889> anything

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
move him up so if I demonstrate anything

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.930 
move him up so if I demonstrate anything
else<00:03:31.799> it's<00:03:32.799> gonna<00:03:32.889> be<00:03:33.099> easier<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.579> see<00:03:33.730> on<00:03:33.849> the

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
else it's gonna be easier to see on the

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.140 
else it's gonna be easier to see on the
screen<00:03:34.319> but<00:03:35.319> anyways<00:03:35.709> I<00:03:35.949> want<00:03:36.699> to<00:03:36.760> mention<00:03:37.000> one

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
dude is standing right here he should

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.949 
dude is standing right here he should
not<00:04:09.310> be<00:04:09.370> on<00:04:09.879> the<00:04:10.180> thing<00:04:10.329> anymore<00:04:10.449> he<00:04:10.780> should

not be on the thing anymore he should

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.369 
not be on the thing anymore he should
fall<00:04:11.169> down<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:12.400> we<00:04:13.359> want<00:04:13.629> to<00:04:13.720> keep<00:04:13.840> this<00:04:14.019> crop

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
fall down so we want to keep this crop

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.960 
fall down so we want to keep this crop
because<00:04:14.590> I<00:04:14.739> mean<00:04:14.979> that's<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.340> area<00:04:15.519> of<00:04:15.819> the

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
because I mean that's the area of the

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.349 
because I mean that's the area of the
entire<00:04:16.299> animation<00:04:16.780> but<00:04:17.590> how<00:04:17.769> do<00:04:17.829> we<00:04:17.919> make<00:04:18.190> it

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
entire animation but how do we make it

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.070 
entire animation but how do we make it
so<00:04:19.359> that<00:04:19.389> um<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.919> game<00:04:21.130> reacts<00:04:21.579> to<00:04:22.120> only<00:04:22.599> where

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
so that um the game reacts to only where

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.529 
so that um the game reacts to only where
his<00:04:23.260> feet<00:04:23.530> are<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:24.039> he<00:04:24.820> would<00:04:24.969> fall<00:04:25.150> down<00:04:25.180> in

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
his feet are and he would fall down in

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:26.680 
his feet are and he would fall down in
the<00:04:25.630> situation<00:04:26.139> like<00:04:26.169> this

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
let me go ahead and snap to grid again

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.250 
let me go ahead and snap to grid again
