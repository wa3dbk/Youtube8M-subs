00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the roof you can use them to work from

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.279 
the roof you can use them to work from
and<00:00:42.800> basically<00:00:43.800> we're<00:00:44.719> we're<00:00:45.719> cleaning<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
and basically we're we're cleaning it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.069 
and basically we're we're cleaning it
with<00:00:46.430> various<00:00:47.430> tools<00:00:47.730> here<00:00:49.370> whether<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.550> got

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
with various tools here whether we got

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.069 
with various tools here whether we got
i'm<00:00:52.079> using<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.559> little<00:00:52.710> trial<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.539> that<00:00:54.539> cleans

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
i'm using a little trial and that cleans

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.080 
i'm using a little trial and that cleans
out<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.320> area<00:00:55.680> between<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.190> shingles<00:00:56.760> really

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
out the area between the shingles really

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.569 
out the area between the shingles really
good<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.649> needs<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.129> need<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.430> get

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
good because it needs you need to get

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.430 
good because it needs you need to get
pine<00:00:59.879> needles<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.449> stuff<00:01:00.629> out<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.960> there<00:01:01.199> so

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
pine needles and stuff out of there so

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.369 
pine needles and stuff out of there so
the<00:01:01.559> roof<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.460> dry<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:02.879> again<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:04.199> then

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the roof can dry out again and then

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.280 
the roof can dry out again and then
we're<00:01:04.559> using<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.949> real<00:01:05.159> stiff<00:01:05.869> type<00:01:06.869> yacht

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
we're using a real stiff type yacht

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.350 
we're using a real stiff type yacht
brush<00:01:08.030> that<00:01:10.100> scrubs<00:01:11.100> off<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.580> lichen<00:01:12.000> it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
brush that scrubs off the lichen it

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.060 
brush that scrubs off the lichen it
comes<00:01:12.600> off<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> little<00:01:12.990> easier<00:01:13.500> when<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.740> wet

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
comes off a little easier when it's wet

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.580 
comes off a little easier when it's wet
but<00:01:14.420> that's<00:01:15.420> what<00:01:16.020> makes<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.409> really

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
but that's what makes it really

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.100 
but that's what makes it really
treacherous<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:18.150> Roland's<00:01:18.630> using<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
treacherous the Roland's using that

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.890 
treacherous the Roland's using that
yacht<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.710> there<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.900> he's<00:01:23.689> he's<00:01:24.689> gonna

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
yacht not there now and he's he's gonna

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.609 
yacht not there now and he's he's gonna
set<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> new<00:01:25.799> record<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.549> little<00:01:26.759> piece

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
set a new record on that little piece

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.030 
set a new record on that little piece
the<00:01:28.619> longest<00:01:29.009> ever<00:01:29.280> spent<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:30.710> two<00:01:31.710> square

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the longest ever spent on two square

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.850 
the longest ever spent on two square
feet<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.310> roof<00:01:33.140> anyway<00:01:34.140> we're<00:01:34.350> getting<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.710> all

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
feet of roof anyway we're getting it all

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.980 
feet of roof anyway we're getting it all
done<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.759> roof<00:01:35.970> itself<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:36.750> bad

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
done and the roof itself is not bad

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.690 
done and the roof itself is not bad

shape if it can be preserved probably

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.050 
shape if it can be preserved probably
get<00:01:41.820> another<00:01:41.939> five<00:01:42.299> or<00:01:42.329> ten<00:01:42.659> years<00:01:42.689> out<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.229> it

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
get another five or ten years out of it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.609 
get another five or ten years out of it
whereas<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.270> moss<00:01:45.689> would<00:01:45.930> stay<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.409> it

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
whereas if the moss would stay on it

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
whereas if the moss would stay on it
that<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.130> would<00:01:47.310> never<00:01:47.520> dry<00:01:47.759> out<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.210> would

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
that it would never dry out and it would

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.050 
that it would never dry out and it would
rot<00:01:48.540> immediately<00:01:49.460> within<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.729> next<00:01:50.880> couple

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
rot immediately within the next couple

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.260 
rot immediately within the next couple
of<00:01:51.329> years<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.960> would<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.320> nothing<00:01:52.470> left<00:01:53.270> so

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
of years it would be nothing left so

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.649 
of years it would be nothing left so
it's<00:01:54.960> working<00:01:55.140> sometimes<00:01:55.500> worthwhile

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
it's working sometimes worthwhile

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.480 
it's working sometimes worthwhile
spending<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:58.049> few<00:01:58.590> bucks<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:58.950> I'm<00:01:59.100> cleaning

loss and the lichen doesn't seem to like
as<00:03:44.370> much<00:03:44.780> it's<00:03:45.780> not<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.050> perfect<00:03:46.470> answer<00:03:46.860> but

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
as much it's not the perfect answer but

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.220 
as much it's not the perfect answer but
it's<00:03:47.460> the<00:03:47.760> only<00:03:47.790> one<00:03:48.180> we<00:03:48.330> had<00:03:48.540> at<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.840> moment

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
it's the only one we had at the moment

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.630 
it's the only one we had at the moment
so<00:03:49.700> that's<00:03:50.700> what<00:03:50.940> we're<00:03:51.120> doing<00:03:51.150> with<00:03:51.570> it<00:03:51.750> and

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
so that's what we're doing with it and

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.100 
so that's what we're doing with it and
you<00:03:53.640> can<00:03:53.790> see<00:03:54.030> we've<00:03:54.210> done<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.510> upper<00:03:54.810> floor

shakes<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:46.110> reason<00:04:46.440> that<00:04:46.470> we<00:04:47.480> went<00:04:48.480> to<00:04:48.720> such<00:04:48.930> a

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
shakes the reason that we went to such a

shakes the reason that we went to such a
great<00:04:49.320> extent<00:04:49.920> on<00:04:50.190> was<00:04:50.490> that<00:04:50.700> they<00:04:50.910> weren't

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
great extent on was that they weren't

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.850 
great extent on was that they weren't
all<00:04:51.300> curled<00:04:51.660> up<00:04:51.870> so<00:04:52.580> you<00:04:53.580> should<00:04:53.790> be<00:04:54.800> quite<00:04:55.800> a

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
all curled up so you should be quite a

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.810 
all curled up so you should be quite a

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
few years left in this was a big slimy

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.290 
few years left in this was a big slimy
roof<00:05:00.180> but

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
roof but

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.650 
roof but
it's<00:05:01.840> much<00:05:02.080> better<00:05:02.319> now
