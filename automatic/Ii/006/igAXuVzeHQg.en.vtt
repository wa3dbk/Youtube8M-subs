00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
of new commandblock stuff that has been

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.039 
of new commandblock stuff that has been
updated<00:00:11.759> it's<00:00:12.420> crazy

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
updated it's crazy

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
some of them are great some of them not

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.400 
some of them are great some of them not
so<00:00:15.179> great<00:00:15.420> such<00:00:15.690> as<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.049> look<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.320> these

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
so great such as the look of these

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.500 
so great such as the look of these
command<00:00:16.740> blocks<00:00:16.920> but<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.340> know<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.090> looks<00:00:18.449> like

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
command blocks but I know it looks like

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.630 
command blocks but I know it looks like
some<00:00:19.080> graffiti<00:00:19.289> Don<00:00:19.740> them<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.130> don't<00:00:20.520> really

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
some graffiti Don them I don't really

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.630 
some graffiti Don them I don't really
like<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> way<00:00:21.060> they<00:00:21.180> look<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.449> be<00:00:21.539> honest<00:00:21.840> but

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
like the way they look to be honest but

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.609 
like the way they look to be honest but
welcome<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.910> snapshot<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.600> have<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.109> concept

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
welcome to the snapshot I have a concept

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.920 
welcome to the snapshot I have a concept
for<00:00:25.980> pixel<00:00:26.609> painting<00:00:27.029> today<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.480> Minecraft

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
for pixel painting today in Minecraft

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.900 
for pixel painting today in Minecraft
which<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.380> one<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> minigames<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.789> those

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
which is one of the minigames in those

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.730 
which is one of the minigames in those
one<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.150> those<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.750> big<00:00:30.960> servers<00:00:31.470> which<00:00:31.650> I

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
one of those like big servers which I

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.900 
one of those like big servers which I
don't<00:00:31.920> tend<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.340> go<00:00:32.550> on

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
don't tend to go on

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.790 
don't tend to go on
it's<00:00:33.210> like<00:00:33.329> mineplex<00:00:33.899> something<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.680> looks

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
it's like mineplex something that looks

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.380 
it's like mineplex something that looks
caught<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:35.130> mine<00:00:35.399> complex<00:00:35.670> something<00:00:36.239> I

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
caught like mine complex something I

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.119 
caught like mine complex something I
don't<00:00:36.809> go<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.079> those<00:00:37.200> multiplayer<00:00:37.649> servers<00:00:38.010> I

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
don't go on those multiplayer servers I

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.940 
don't go on those multiplayer servers I
just<00:00:38.460> work<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.420> Pokemon<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.170> what<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.739> need<00:00:40.829> to

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
just work on Pokemon so what I need to

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.740 
just work on Pokemon so what I need to
do<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.489> press<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.180> button<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:42.600> gonna

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
do is press this button that's gonna

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.709 
do is press this button that's gonna
start<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.590> whole<00:00:43.710> process<00:00:44.190> now<00:00:44.940> well<00:00:45.180> as

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
start the the whole process now well as

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.150 
start the the whole process now well as
you<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:45.989> see<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.200> already<00:00:46.289> started<00:00:46.680> what

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
you can see it's already started what

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.520 
you can see it's already started what
you<00:00:47.219> need<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.399> do<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.610> press<00:00:47.820> shift<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
you need to do is press shift and the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.319 
you need to do is press shift and the
AMA<00:00:49.800> stands<00:00:50.160> will<00:00:50.370> basically<00:00:50.850> draw<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
AMA stands will basically draw the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.970 
AMA stands will basically draw the
pattern<00:00:51.719> for<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.050> depending<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.800> where<00:00:52.920> you

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
pattern for you depending on where you

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.400 
pattern for you depending on where you
look<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.610> it's<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:53.910> entirely<00:00:54.449> accurate<00:00:54.899> I

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
look now it's not entirely accurate I

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.830 
look now it's not entirely accurate I
know<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.829> be<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.949> lot<00:00:56.129> better<00:00:56.370> than<00:00:56.430> this

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
know it can be a lot better than this

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.470 
know it can be a lot better than this
but<00:00:57.840> I'm<00:00:58.109> gonna<00:00:58.230> try<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.559> draw<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.390> even<00:01:00.390> know

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
but I'm gonna try and draw a even know

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.910 
but I'm gonna try and draw a even know
what<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:00.690> drawing<00:01:00.930> right<00:01:00.989> now<00:01:01.109> hopefully

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
what I'm drawing right now hopefully

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.349 
what I'm drawing right now hopefully
it's<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.340> gonna<00:01:02.489> turn<00:01:02.699> out<00:01:02.820> really<00:01:02.969> awkward

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
it's not gonna turn out really awkward

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.390 
it's not gonna turn out really awkward
let's<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.439> let's<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.799> change<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.309> a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
let's see let's just change it to like a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.950 
let's see let's just change it to like a
balloon<00:01:05.640> or<00:01:05.820> something<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.510> there<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.659> go<00:01:06.750> so

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
balloon or something but there you go so

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.420 
balloon or something but there you go so
that's<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> how<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.740> kind<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:07.950> works<00:01:08.159> it's

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
that's what it how it kind of works it's

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.760 
that's what it how it kind of works it's
it's<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.030> little<00:01:09.270> less<00:01:09.510> accurate<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.530> further

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it's a little less accurate the further

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.399 
it's a little less accurate the further
away<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.130> look<00:01:11.430> from<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> center<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
away you look from the center but I

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.170 
away you look from the center but I
think<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.830> works<00:01:14.010> pretty<00:01:14.220> well<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.820> vanilla

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
think it works pretty well for a vanilla

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.240 
think it works pretty well for a vanilla
sort<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.170> concept<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:16.770> not<00:01:16.920> something<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
sort of concept it's not something that

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.940 
sort of concept it's not something that
you<00:01:17.549> generally<00:01:18.299> want<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:19.049> because<00:01:19.770> this

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you generally want to do because this

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.100 
you generally want to do because this
uses<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.280> lot<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> command<00:01:21.090> blocks<00:01:21.299> which<00:01:21.900> I

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
uses a lot of command blocks which I

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.950 
uses a lot of command blocks which I
must<00:01:22.380> say<00:01:22.790> works<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.970> lot<00:01:24.119> better<00:01:24.180> now<00:01:24.630> with<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
must say works a lot better now with the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.210 
must say works a lot better now with the
new<00:01:25.110> command<00:01:25.470> block<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.890> don't<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.100> to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
new command block so you don't have to

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.710 
new command block so you don't have to
use<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> whole<00:01:26.580> field<00:01:26.850> clock<00:01:27.090> which<00:01:27.360> causes

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
use a whole field clock which causes

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.870 
use a whole field clock which causes
chunk<00:01:27.990> updates<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.009> need<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.369> now<00:01:29.579> is

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
chunk updates all you need to do now is

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
chunk updates all you need to do now is
just<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> repeat<00:01:30.659> command<00:01:30.960> block<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
just have a repeat command block for a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.340 
just have a repeat command block for a
whole<00:01:32.040> bunch<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:33.210> guess<00:01:33.689> mechanics<00:01:34.200> you'd

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
whole bunch of I guess mechanics you'd

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.960 
whole bunch of I guess mechanics you'd
like<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.680> create<00:01:34.799> I'm<00:01:35.490> gonna<00:01:35.700> show<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.880> that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
like to create I'm gonna show you that

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.609 
like to create I'm gonna show you that
in<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> moment<00:01:36.270> look<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.869> little<00:01:37.079> smiley<00:01:37.470> face

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
in a moment look a little smiley face

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.499 
in a moment look a little smiley face
here<00:01:37.799> there<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.310> go<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.549> does<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:39.479> not

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
here there you go it does it's not

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.219 
here there you go it does it's not
alright<00:01:40.259> doesn't<00:01:41.189> look<00:01:41.280> very<00:01:41.310> good<00:01:41.610> now

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
alright doesn't look very good now

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.960 
alright doesn't look very good now
unfortunately<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.799> armor<00:01:44.070> stands<00:01:44.280> tend<00:01:44.820> to

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
unfortunately the armor stands tend to

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.569 
unfortunately the armor stands tend to
go<00:01:45.090> flying<00:01:45.509> all<00:01:45.659> over<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> place

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
go flying all over the place

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.370 
go flying all over the place
with<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.210> lag<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.780> not<00:01:48.899> exactly<00:01:49.200> as

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
with the the lag it's not exactly as

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.440 
with the the lag it's not exactly as
precise<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.040> would<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.220> hoped<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:51.180> let's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
precise as I would have hoped but let's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.749 
precise as I would have hoped but let's
clear<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.200> clear<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> board<00:01:53.189> here<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.610> let's

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
clear the clear the board here and let's

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.240 
clear the clear the board here and let's
just<00:01:53.939> draw<00:01:54.090> somebody<00:01:54.299> face<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:55.040> show<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.130> guys

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
just draw somebody face to show you guys

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.880 
just draw somebody face to show you guys
how<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.460> works<00:01:56.670> now<00:01:56.880> well<00:01:57.689> okay<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.710> what's

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
how this works now well okay so what's

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.039 
how this works now well okay so what's
going<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.280> here<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.790> every<00:02:00.689> time<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.899> hold

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
going on here is every time I hold

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.709 
going on here is every time I hold
shifts<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.369> AMA<00:02:02.549> stands<00:02:02.880> will<00:02:03.090> follow<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
shifts the AMA stands will follow the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.200 
shifts the AMA stands will follow the
direction<00:02:04.229> I'm<00:02:04.350> looking<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.060> they<00:02:06.060> always

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
direction I'm looking and they always

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.900 
direction I'm looking and they always
they<00:02:06.540> should<00:02:06.840> only<00:02:07.229> draw<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.530> mark<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
they should only draw one mark on the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.130 
they should only draw one mark on the
board<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.390> they<00:02:09.479> tend<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.810> draw<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.110> a

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
board but they tend to draw like a

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.110 
board but they tend to draw like a
couple<00:02:10.560> because<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> lag<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:12.030> it

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
couple because of the lag that it

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.940 
couple because of the lag that it
creates<00:02:12.420> now<00:02:12.930> I'm<00:02:13.020> using<00:02:13.170> like<00:02:13.440> come

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
creates now I'm using like come

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.320 
creates now I'm using like come
hundred<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.280> command<00:02:14.610> blocks<00:02:14.819> which<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.120> why

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
hundred of command blocks which is why

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.110 
hundred of command blocks which is why
it<00:02:15.390> does<00:02:15.690> this<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.709> course<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:17.879> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
it does this but of course I like the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.850 
it does this but of course I like the
multiplayer<00:02:18.599> service<00:02:19.080> there<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.379> plug-in

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
multiplayer service there is a plug-in

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.170 
multiplayer service there is a plug-in
so<00:02:20.160> then<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.489> really<00:02:20.670> needs<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:20.910> worry<00:02:21.150> about

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
so then it really needs to worry about

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.300 
so then it really needs to worry about
that<00:02:21.510> stuff<00:02:21.629> so<00:02:22.230> it's<00:02:22.349> all<00:02:22.470> coded<00:02:22.769> within

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that stuff so it's all coded within

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.369 
that stuff so it's all coded within
their<00:02:23.700> system<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.330> that's<00:02:24.629> that's<00:02:25.260> my

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
their system so that's that's my

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.320 
their system so that's that's my
beautiful<00:02:25.560> smiley<00:02:26.129> face<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.910> guys<00:02:27.030> can<00:02:27.239> like

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
beautiful smiley face you guys can like

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.570 
beautiful smiley face you guys can like
frame<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.170> don't<00:02:28.590> know<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:29.280> here<00:02:29.430> the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
frame that I don't know but here the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.550 
frame that I don't know but here the
command<00:02:29.849> blocks<00:02:30.090> it's<00:02:30.239> really<00:02:30.599> quite<00:02:31.319> bulky

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
command blocks it's really quite bulky

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.580 
command blocks it's really quite bulky
but<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.580> lot<00:02:32.910> easier<00:02:33.269> now<00:02:33.450> more<00:02:33.840> compact<00:02:34.290> now

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
but a lot easier now more compact now

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.830 
but a lot easier now more compact now
that<00:02:34.680> I'm<00:02:34.739> using<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.099> few<00:02:35.510> farlis<00:02:36.510> command

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
that I'm using a few farlis command

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.650 
that I'm using a few farlis command
blocks<00:02:37.080> than<00:02:37.550> usual<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:39.060> what's<00:02:39.390> going<00:02:39.569> on

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
blocks than usual so what's going on

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.509 
blocks than usual so what's going on
here<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.080> you've<00:02:40.799> got<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> whole<00:02:41.220> bunch<00:02:41.370> of

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
here is you've got a whole bunch of

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.460 
here is you've got a whole bunch of
repeat<00:02:41.849> command<00:02:42.120> blocks<00:02:42.330> now<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:43.200> was

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
repeat command blocks now this was

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.500 
repeat command blocks now this was
originally<00:02:43.980> planned<00:02:44.340> for<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.580> 1.8<00:02:45.090> sort<00:02:45.420> of

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
originally planned for a 1.8 sort of

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.300 
originally planned for a 1.8 sort of
sort<00:02:46.049> of<00:02:46.140> thing<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.530> realized<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:46.980> was<00:02:47.099> so

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
sort of thing but I realized it was so

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.110 
sort of thing but I realized it was so
bad

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
bad

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.059 
bad
so<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.510> basically<00:02:48.870> abandoned<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.590> project<00:02:49.769> but

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
so I basically abandoned the project but

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.910 
so I basically abandoned the project but
now<00:02:50.190> with<00:02:50.400> all<00:02:50.430> these<00:02:50.819> new<00:02:50.880> command<00:02:51.360> blocks

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
now with all these new command blocks

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.170 
now with all these new command blocks
which<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.099> love<00:02:53.310> really<00:02:53.459> love<00:02:53.549> this<00:02:53.760> color<00:02:54.000> by

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
which I love really love this color by

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.059 
which I love really love this color by
the<00:02:54.239> way<00:02:54.410> with<00:02:55.410> all<00:02:55.530> these<00:02:55.620> new<00:02:55.769> command

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
the way with all these new command

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.610 
the way with all these new command
blocks<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.519> is<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.970> lot<00:02:57.180> more<00:02:57.329> compact<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.470> what

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
blocks it is a lot more compact so what

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.520 
blocks it is a lot more compact so what
I<00:02:58.650> did<00:02:58.739> was<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.040> used<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.489> plus<00:02:59.730> n<00:02:59.940> B's<00:03:00.180> filter<00:03:00.900> to

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
I did was I used a plus n B's filter to

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.080 
I did was I used a plus n B's filter to
change<00:03:01.920> all<00:03:02.099> of<00:03:02.160> these<00:03:02.310> command<00:03:02.730> blocks<00:03:02.790> into

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
change all of these command blocks into

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.610 
change all of these command blocks into
repeat<00:03:03.480> command<00:03:03.810> blocks<00:03:04.019> so<00:03:04.290> that's<00:03:04.470> why<00:03:04.560> I'm

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
repeat command blocks so that's why I'm

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.680 
repeat command blocks so that's why I'm
not<00:03:04.709> using<00:03:04.890> chain<00:03:05.190> command<00:03:05.400> blocks<00:03:05.640> here<00:03:05.819> but

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
not using chain command blocks here but

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.120 
not using chain command blocks here but
it's<00:03:06.870> basically<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:07.349> detecting<00:03:07.920> where<00:03:08.040> I'm

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
it's basically just detecting where I'm

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.339 
it's basically just detecting where I'm
looking<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.640> applying<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.510> motion<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.140> AMA

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
looking and applying a motion to the AMA

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.819 
looking and applying a motion to the AMA
stands<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:11.340> they<00:03:12.060> basically<00:03:12.269> just<00:03:12.630> fly<00:03:13.200> in<00:03:13.590> the

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
stands so they basically just fly in the

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.589 
stands so they basically just fly in the
place<00:03:14.040> which<00:03:14.250> I'm<00:03:14.370> looking<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.940> look<00:03:15.510> how

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
place which I'm looking and look how

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.750 
place which I'm looking and look how
compact<00:03:16.049> this<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.290> it's<00:03:16.620> beautiful

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
compact this is it's beautiful

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.039 
compact this is it's beautiful
because<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.239> don't<00:03:18.389> really<00:03:18.540> need<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.840> use<00:03:18.959> the

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
because I don't really need to use the

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.300 
because I don't really need to use the
redstone<00:03:19.319> blocks<00:03:19.530> now<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:19.889> I<00:03:19.920> have<00:03:20.130> this

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
redstone blocks now that I have this

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.270 
redstone blocks now that I have this
like<00:03:20.579> needs<00:03:20.970> redstone<00:03:21.510> thing<00:03:21.780> but<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.920> made

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
like needs redstone thing but I made

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.920 
like needs redstone thing but I made
this<00:03:23.400> like<00:03:23.579> one<00:03:23.850> snapshot<00:03:24.180> previous<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.810> this

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
this like one snapshot previous to this

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.780 
this like one snapshot previous to this
one<00:03:25.139> so<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.709> didn't<00:03:25.950> have<00:03:26.069> this<00:03:26.250> there<00:03:26.639> you<00:03:26.700> go

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
one so it didn't have this there you go

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.460 
one so it didn't have this there you go
so<00:03:26.970> that's<00:03:27.060> that's<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.630> contraptions<00:03:28.290> it's

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
so that's that's the contraptions it's

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.069 
so that's that's the contraptions it's
quite<00:03:28.680> bulky<00:03:28.859> but<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.400> really<00:03:29.790> love<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.079> you're

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
quite bulky but I really love it you're

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.509 
quite bulky but I really love it you're
kind<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.380> like<00:03:31.560> revolutionizes<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.370> way

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
kind of like revolutionizes the way

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.509 
kind of like revolutionizes the way
things<00:03:33.420> work<00:03:33.630> now<00:03:33.840> with<00:03:34.049> so<00:03:34.920> many<00:03:35.100> more<00:03:35.250> things

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
things work now with so many more things

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.190 
things work now with so many more things
you<00:03:35.700> can<00:03:35.730> combine<00:03:36.329> into<00:03:36.569> your<00:03:36.810> your

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
you can combine into your your

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.319 
you can combine into your your
contraption<00:03:37.799> -<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.730> don't<00:03:38.819> really<00:03:39.120> need<00:03:39.209> to

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
contraption - you don't really need to

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.210 
contraption - you don't really need to
worry<00:03:39.420> about<00:03:39.660> lag<00:03:39.870> anymore<00:03:40.260> but<00:03:40.500> after<00:03:41.160> the

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
worry about lag anymore but after the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.500 
worry about lag anymore but after the
concept<00:03:41.579> I<00:03:41.670> wanted<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:41.940> show<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.120> guys<00:03:42.209> it's
