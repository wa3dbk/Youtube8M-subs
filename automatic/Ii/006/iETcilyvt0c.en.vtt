00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.230
 good today I come to teach you what 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:10.209
 that would be the rest with what we have and 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:12.610
 we need is the club a mod for the one of 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:15.159
 511 there are several videos on the internet of 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.530
 how to put it but reconsidering is two 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:19.150
 seconds the power button and then by 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.730
 massive at least at the same time until 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.720
 to access and from there we have to go to 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.640
 make the waves 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.859
 remember that this is a vital step in 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.779
 every run since if we do not erase them it can 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.779
 that there are errors and the new network note 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.820
 we have to give the white data and the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.520
 next and the drummers website is 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.270
 optional for each one after we must 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.100
 they want to be and then zip and there we have 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.970
 to look for the rom in this case here is 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.970
 the stock rom 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.719
 well many will wonder what brings 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.269
 new is rom and what it brings again 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.390
 it really is not much but it is the rom 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.509
 is released lite fairy works so much 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.500
 as how it bothered us to the cinema and has 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.270
 a weight of 150 megabytes which makes the 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.490
 opinion and I think something lighter than 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.460
 there is currently for the device is 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.780
 super fluid does not have any garbage no 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.180
 has caps included and due to a bug that 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.780
 it was at the time of cooking it when putting 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.240
 some keyboard that will install that 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.950
 will install from this moment on 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.610
 open the room and tear the tit goes to 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.009
 force closing with the keyboard so no 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.590
 I could include a rom and we have to have 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.860
 a list and install it after the rom 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.810
 The rom takes very little time to install, since 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.740
 has many since they have very few 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.740
 things to cooperate 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.000
 right now I'm working on the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.480
 which would be Annex 5 version 3 xperia z 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.660
 1 version 2 and right at that moment in 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.180
 a break the sail fly speak from 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.490
 a backup that I found the first time 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.729
 that I started cooking the one to review and 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.800
 511 well here you finished installing and 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:17.340
 we have to go to the bounce 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.340
 and as we see this is the bean logo 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.340
 and as we see already happened to the putt and in 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.340
 motion 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.790
 It will not take long and what of another 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.830
 thing about the rumba is that since it takes it out 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.310
 Starting from a boat in a few areas of the 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:43.840
 version 130 of that device the hat 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:47.440
 what languages ​​would be and only left what 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.910
 that would be English and do not remember that 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.010
 another language but 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.720
 well over you will find the light 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.500
 but I chose him more and I did it 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.500
 inflatable 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.380
 what we have to do here is 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.410
 just wait for the rom to end 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.810
 boot and proceed to install the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.930
 keyboard as I said the gap are optional 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.850
 but in this case you have to install them 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.430
 to be able to add a google account 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.390
 to your device and let install 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.910
 graffiti as we see here is the rome 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.980
 has nova launcher as defect as 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.320
 good job standing in the movies in this case 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.620
 I have the single sim version so I do not 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.620
 it looks 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.440
 as super fluid sample we are going to 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.440
 settings 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.310
 well here are we have the beans 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.720
 another thing is how we see has 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.650
 trash apps has everything from 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.650
 original hawai 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.600
 well the player takes a little bit 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.840
 load what music would be like 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.250
 strings I will show you the audio itself 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.200
 It is very good and sounds very good to 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.760
 difference from my other rooms that several 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.800
 have complained that the audio despite 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.549
 that is an environment down below this 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.000
 It sounds good and it sounds strong as we see the 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.000
 camera 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.440
 nothing works 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.440
 it works in both 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:38.959
 and calls also the day read the iron 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.959
 modified it a bit and I know a little better 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.830
 context everything well also incredible the 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.750
 vpn dialogues sometimes you can to 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.510
 install the problem rom the role of 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.400
 explorer that you have but the only thing that 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.230
 we have to do is change the tab 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.230
 to the opposite tab where it is 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.250
 or we can force the arrest 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.470
 good since we did that the change of 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.010
 tab we give you force tension and already 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.010
 it will be good 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.230
 and another thing is that we do not see the music 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.989
 I do not think the burden is what I say 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.989
 it took quite a while 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.340
 good in what interests I will teach you what 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.840
 that will be the crime looks the end is 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.840
 the one from huawei the original 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.219
 and as we see it has not loaded my music 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:48.030
 so I'll try them directly with 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:51.610
 the audio file 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.599
 the explorer is also the one of huawei 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.599
 and we can see 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.320
 reproduces perfectly just like 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.289
 everything else is what I tell them it takes 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.919
 quite the gallery also works 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:27.550
 perfectly in this case right now I know 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:29.110
 most recognized is but it is because it takes 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.990
 very much and as I told you we just have to 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.509
 wait or restart the phone and then 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.090
 I think this would be everything and the rom in 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:39.129
 a few minutes is up along with the 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.199
 video 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:42.520
 until the next kids and how they 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.259
 I said if they work in some new 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.259
 projects and I hope not to take long
