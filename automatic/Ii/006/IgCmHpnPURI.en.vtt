00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hi to all so today I 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.359
 find for a cool blog with 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.550
 some novelties since I think that 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.150
 you noticed the quality of the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.620
 camera that has changed a little bit 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.440
 I changed haircuts too 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.510
 so I thought I'd do a little blog 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.560
 to tell you all about you 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.060
 prepare so first of all yes I 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.010
 changed cameras it had been months 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.630
 and months and months that I save 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.760
 and that I hear you speak a little 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.189
 little right and left like what I 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.040
 wanted to invest in a reflex for 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.550
 have this quality that is completely 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.950
 different from a camera with a tonnage 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.600
 used before it's really a color 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.280
 stand out really better but by 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.719
 against this is the first time I have 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.960
 a reflex so this is my first 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.239
 Indians taken in hand and suddenly it's 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.890
 a little bit hard there are buttons 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.000
 everywhere there has been with age to do 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.850
 all over 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.829
 so maybe it will not be perfect here 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.410
 I'm doing the first class I'm 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.470
 not even sure that the sharpness is that 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.890
 it's not settled here but I'm going 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.630
 get there 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.450
 the object that debate I read all the way 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.790
 job so I'm motivated in 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.470
 waiting tell me if you what you 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.810
 think about the new levels of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.520
 brightness all you think of 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.350
 colors like a year they 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.180
 stand out and there are things that you 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.220
 would like me not to change what 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.390
 yet do it now for those 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.460
 and those who ask g1 cannon 650d 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.729
 so it's I think last Saturday 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.130
 who came out I think I'm dipping it 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.720
 for months so here but here it is 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.310
 is still quite new and in fact 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.840
 what it comes from and that's really what 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.060
 I was looking for knows who is actually the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.860
 back camera ie the screen in 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.549
 done where I can see myself when I 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.320
 follow the tutorials 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.860
 here it is still really much more 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.600
 practical and to the oil thus possessing 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.369
 that's it you noticed we are 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.750
 in my room so look really 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.610
 today I do not even have a tripod 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.950
 so I 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.560
 an ultra ristic installation if you 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.850
 see that it's very hardy so in 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.590
 meanwhile I just went there for 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.090
 the block of today if not when 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.680
 I will have my tripod I do not know 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.770
 where else would I put myself I 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.490
 want to be here if you like it either 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.020
 I'll come back to the polish we'll see and for 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.080
 my beauty chain I do not know yet 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.670
 from where I will film I do not know at all 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.550
 do not know I'm waiting to see with two 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.430
 tripods what a light best 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.550
 and they do the best as it 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.930
 cammas shoot is nice and so here it is 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.650
 I'm really waiting for you back with 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.290
 impatience 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.330
 me what you think about it and if there are any 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.280
 changes to make do not hesitate to me 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.100
 also say next in as you 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.959
 did you notice I changed 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.330
 horse to the hairdressers what if you me 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.709
 follow on twitter or on instagram you 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.840
 could not miss the 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.450
 capillary catastrophe because that's 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.959
 was a rumor yes I was taken from a 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.790
 madness to make shadow and a house already 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.830
 last year each time each time 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.560
 this period of luton I want in 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.720
 the shadow and therefore the roots 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.380
 dark and lengths and spikes 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.330
 clearer and that surely 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.070
 jean him but never jumped and there 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.290
 it turns out that they had the laureates 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.209
 output kits so in supermarkets 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.769
 to make one's own shadow and one has 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.280
 say why not that looks nice 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.330
 and 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.360
 and so I did that that monday I 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.030
 did that on Monday and so in the evening 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.620
 9:30 am I did my thing so I put 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.360
 photos will of course produce the result 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.540
 I was ultra extracted I thought it 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.000
 is going to be great here is actually not the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.860
 all used in the shower I was seeing 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.680
 that it was starting to flow 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.930
 orange I have my god what is it 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.530
 that and once I dried my 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.569
 hair there was no words for 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.510
 describe that I cried like a baby 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.769
 I was in a state not possible 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.330
 I was disgusted what because actually 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.220
 discolor hair except that at least 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.130
 in fact the basis I make some 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.350
 coloring some colors actually 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.670
 but it's an icy chestnut so that's okay 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.080
 his loved ones my natural color is 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.880
 just a few euros full ebb in 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.880
 more and I had done it about ago 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.580
 three weeks is actually hit the 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.459
 hombre on coloring is sure not brown 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.530
 never spring like on the hair 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.180
 clearer and on my hearing his 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.489
 exits orange so it was not even a 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.440
 nice wheels it was really orange 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.100
 orange at the stakes little what there is 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.190
 more orange 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.810
 so here are so curious beasts do not hesitate 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.850
 not to see them his serious condition you 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.830
 will see the disasters so I hit 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.560
 took an emergency appointment at my house 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.690
 hairdresser on Wednesday and caught up with her 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.070
 so in fact she just made me a 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.660
 color actually I was just made a 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.630
 color on all of my hair 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.630
 I think it's a chestnut with 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.300
 mocha reflections is what actually makes 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.970
 the water I had my discoloration it's 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.800
 come out clearer but here I have 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.470
 more orange than I had these agents of 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.200
 light brown and suddenly it's not 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.090
 shaded but is a subtle hyper and 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.610
 after at the bottom of oil and 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.380
 frankly not bad it's the thing I have to 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.450
 just about anything that's all and sprouted 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.300
 took advantage to make a fringe I had 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.889
 want to 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.289
 change of mind in fact for the fall 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.870
 but what was to happen happened 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:17.590
 do I get tired of that already? 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.819
 swells already so here is more than 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.440
 wait for it to grow back as 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.479
 usually but hey it's not too serious 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.919
 in the worst case I buy you who weighs him 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:29.020
 and that's it and that will push back so here's the 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.979
 today's blog completely blah 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.620
 I hope this little update 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:38.560
 vis claira so I'm waiting for your feedback 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:42.969
 on about quality what do you think 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:47.129
 and I believe that just about everything so the 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.129
 open from Thursday to soon banished
