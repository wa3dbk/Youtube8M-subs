00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.790
 welcome people to another new video in 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:17.580
 minecraft playstation3 and this time 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:22.910
 a video tutorial on how to do 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:26.810
 a call something to dress fast 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:31.430
 a shipowner who gives you the armor 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.430
 free and easy automatic 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.620
 I do not know what to say but food ok how 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.570
 works good first they work like 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.140
 come is very practical 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.620
 it's very short no no no so many things 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.710
 and you get here you put here the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.899
 lever and not only goes arming 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.510
 and we can go out and fight the 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.839
 monsters and mandar creepers and all the 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.409
 month and when we return we want 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.869
 save our mature armor this 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:15.430
 we raise the lever this and throw the 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:18.700
 things here we have this here is here 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.770
 for this and this and this and it's perfect 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.080
 and it will stay saved and when we 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.119
 we arrived here again we planned it 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.130
 is going to give again all the same the 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.160
 chest boots 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.149
 and it's again we raise the lever and 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.220
 let's go here is a very practical method 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.740
 there are tutorials on how to do 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.840
 changing rooms these automatic but 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.759
 none is as practical as this one look 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.910
 one does not carry as many networks 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.580
 dispensers here like crazy and everything so 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.250
 what are we going 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.890
 what we need is good I did it 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.530
 well orange because I liked it not 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.870
 I saw but let's do it this time 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.000
 fourth so they understand it and we're going to 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:08.680
 do it from Asia red and armpit yellow and 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.410
 let's drill here 44 so wide and 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.440
 3 long 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.990
 after this we are going to operate here and 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.440
 here we are going to put here a red clay 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.190
 and we are going to occupy a stone torch 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.860
 red here is we put it like this after 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.620
 this is going to use a dispenser a 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.780
 dispenser this one you know that 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.940
 lately he's been playing this 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.490
 minecraft this and the dispensers there 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.680
 times that are not placed so that for 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.660
 work we have it we have to 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.750
 jump and put it up this torch 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.780
 so that the expressed one points towards 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.670
 he did not make heaven 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.680
 well after this we are going to compare 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.680
 two with the two souls 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.099
 those of us who are going to bend down already know that 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.430
 they should do but do not call this 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.709
 but we have to bend over and 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.500
 connect it here with the dispenser and 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.000
 put another here as well as they see they're 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.170
 connected down there the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.480
 dispenser 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.159
 after this we are going to occupy a 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.590
 reddish stone comparator and a 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:21.280
 reddish stone repeater also 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.530
 reddish stone stone comparator 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.409
 red this east that had three what 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.609
 we are going to put here so it is a kind of 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.609
 illuminati triangle 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.930
 i 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:45.940
 although after being this we are going to put 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.670
 here a block and we're going to remove these 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.100
 two let's put a porsche here and 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.270
 let's fill these reddish stone 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:58.060
 two and just like that everything goes after 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:01.510
 this is going to put a repeater 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.590
 reddish stone here and we're going to put a 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.810
 block here and reddish stone would already be 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.400
 armed what has been only missing 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.400
 put here 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.450
 without lowering meters here and putting a 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:21.120
 torch here to catch this 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.520
 it would be ready, it is only left 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.840
 I would cover it in my case I'll 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.650
 do this yellow performance so 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.770
 if the lever that we are going to put must 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.310
 be in the middle or on the other side of what 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:42.150
 what is the torch 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:45.030
 so that the dispenser and the 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.000
 hopper we will use carpet myself in this 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:51.030
 case I'll put black because I like to go 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:59.180
 to put it like that on the wall so it does not 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:59.180
 see like that so like that so like that and so 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:10.110
 it would only be to put the armor here 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:11.700
 it's like that and we keep it here here 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.970
 stretch 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.889
 A) Yes 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.979
 after that he only wants to put us 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:24.349
 here on the right side of the lever and 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:27.720
 pull and forgive to pull it and we would arm 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:32.900
 this and to keep things we will have 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.900
 to lift it up and throw everything in like this 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:40.590
 and how do you go and kill me 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.240
 I told them that I here apologized 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.400
 three to not confuse but you 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.250
 they can leave it like this as they see 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.190
 it occupies so much space they do not have anything almost 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.930
 network is not like that and the truth is that 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.970
 it's very good there are some dressing rooms 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.580
 automatic that occupy dispensers 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.890
 here dispensers up here curves and 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.680
 all that and this is very practical you know 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.689
 put here this pull it and wait 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.789
 that chance 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:07.979
 and so I hope you liked 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:10.499
 the tutorial of this automatic wardrobe 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:13.860
