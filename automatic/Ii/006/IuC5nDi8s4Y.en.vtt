00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
that is a very key line that is going to

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.580 
that is a very key line that is going to
lead<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> civil<00:01:39.420> war<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.170> they're<00:01:40.409> going

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
lead up to civil war that they're going

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.530 
lead up to civil war that they're going
to<00:01:40.650> introduce<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.070> lot<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.369> themes<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:42.000> ant-man

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
to introduce a lot of themes in ant-man

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.450 
to introduce a lot of themes in ant-man
because<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.259> lot<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.619> us<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.920> been<00:01:43.979> looking<00:01:44.369> at

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
because a lot of us have been looking at

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.460 
because a lot of us have been looking at
a<00:01:44.549> man<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> post-credits<00:01:45.630> almost<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
a man is a post-credits almost to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.190 
a man is a post-credits almost to
Avengers<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.189> not<00:01:47.610> really<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.479> precursor

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
Avengers and not really as the precursor

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.319 
Avengers and not really as the precursor
to<00:01:49.590> Civil<00:01:49.950> War<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.790> think<00:01:51.090> what<00:01:51.210> this

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
to Civil War and I think what this

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.880 
to Civil War and I think what this
trailer<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.689> done<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.110> suggested<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> lot<00:01:52.829> of

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
trailer is done is suggested a lot of

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.899 
trailer is done is suggested a lot of
different<00:01:53.130> things<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.640> may<00:01:53.790> actually

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
different things that this may actually

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.179 
different things that this may actually
segues<00:01:54.479> into<00:01:54.600> civil<00:01:55.110> war<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.470> kryta<00:01:55.770> way<00:01:55.979> but

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
segues into civil war in kryta way but

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.010 
segues into civil war in kryta way but
forget<00:01:56.549> all<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:57.329> as<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> trailer<00:01:57.840> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
forget all that just as a trailer that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.520

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
I know it's going to be a very small

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.690 
I know it's going to be a very small
section<00:02:35.590> but<00:02:35.800> are<00:02:36.040> we<00:02:36.190> all<00:02:36.220> in<00:02:36.340> agreement<00:02:36.430> that

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
section but are we all in agreement that

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.280 
section but are we all in agreement that
it's<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.240> better<00:02:37.420> trailer<00:02:37.780> than<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.930> first<00:02:38.110> one

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
it's a better trailer than the first one

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.530 
it's a better trailer than the first one
was<00:02:38.410> oh<00:02:38.680> but<00:02:39.280> again<00:02:39.700> it's<00:02:39.940> so<00:02:40.030> important<00:02:40.480> to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
was oh but again it's so important to

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.660 
was oh but again it's so important to
re-emphasize<00:02:40.990> that<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.770> reason<00:02:42.100> why<00:02:42.220> early

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
re-emphasize that the reason why early

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.610 
re-emphasize that the reason why early
trailers<00:02:43.120> just<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.750> be<00:02:43.840> honest<00:02:44.140> stink<00:02:44.440> is

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
trailers just to be honest stink is

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.710 
trailers just to be honest stink is
because<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.250> VFX<00:02:45.640> are<00:02:45.850> just<00:02:46.030> not<00:02:46.180> done<00:02:46.450> oh

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
because the VFX are just not done oh

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.600 
because the VFX are just not done oh
yeah<00:02:47.110> only<00:02:47.380> until<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:47.830> get<00:02:48.070> closer<00:02:48.400> to

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
yeah only until you get closer to

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.910 
yeah only until you get closer to
release<00:02:48.880> at<00:02:49.090> these<00:02:49.210> final<00:02:49.570> VFX<00:02:49.870> shots<00:02:50.110> come<00:02:50.740> in

like flaky pre-approved some of those

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.570 
like flaky pre-approved some of those
and<00:02:53.470> that's<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.920> other<00:02:54.010> reason<00:02:54.130> why<00:02:54.430> we

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
and that's the other reason why we

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.250 
and that's the other reason why we
haven't<00:02:54.820> seen<00:02:54.940> Batman<00:02:55.270> Superman<00:02:55.450> yet<00:02:55.870> why<00:02:56.200> the
