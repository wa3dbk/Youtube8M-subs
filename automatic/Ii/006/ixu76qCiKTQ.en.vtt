00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
mr. Mayweather and I think a lot of it

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.610 
mr. Mayweather and I think a lot of it
makes<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.520> lot<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.760> sense<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.809> probably<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:40.469> to

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
makes a lot of sense but probably not to

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.650 
makes a lot of sense but probably not to
people<00:00:40.950> who<00:00:41.100> don't<00:00:41.250> think<00:00:42.350> as<00:00:43.489> each<00:00:44.660> Manny

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
people who don't think as each Manny

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.959 
people who don't think as each Manny
would<00:00:46.020> wipe<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.770> floor<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.399> Floyd

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969
