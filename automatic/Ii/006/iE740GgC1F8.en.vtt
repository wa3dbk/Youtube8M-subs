once played this game in front of my

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.100 
once played this game in front of my
sister<00:02:12.460> and<00:02:12.970> when<00:02:13.150> she<00:02:13.300> saw<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.480> horse<00:02:13.810> run

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.100 
sister and when she saw the horse run
she<00:02:14.590> thought<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:14.920> was<00:02:15.070> retarded<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.420> mentally

challenged
and<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:18.850> think<00:02:19.850> that<00:02:20.030> was<00:02:20.180> my<00:02:20.330> fault<00:02:20.680> I'm<00:02:21.680> not<00:02:21.740> a

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
and I think that was my fault I'm not a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.010 
and I think that was my fault I'm not a
hundred<00:02:22.010> percent<00:02:22.130> sure<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:23.450> kind<00:02:23.780> of<00:02:23.870> does

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
hundred percent sure it kind of does

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.180 
hundred percent sure it kind of does
have<00:02:24.230> this<00:02:24.380> really<00:02:24.830> odd<00:02:25.040> flail<00:02:25.760> run<00:02:27.010> but<00:02:28.010> maybe

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
have this really odd flail run but maybe

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.010 
have this really odd flail run but maybe
that's<00:02:28.340> just<00:02:28.490> me<00:02:28.790> maybe<00:02:29.120> I'm<00:02:29.420> just<00:02:29.630> terrible

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
that's just me maybe I'm just terrible

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.360 
that's just me maybe I'm just terrible
