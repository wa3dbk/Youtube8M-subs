00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.649
 Welcome dear 1000 ps fans 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.050
 here from milan from the second big one 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.590
 motorcycle fair of the year at bmw stand 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.870
 with sepp mechler hello sap suddenly you 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.060
 You are product manager for all four 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.250
 cylinder models of how exactly so 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.010
 for the doppler have four for the he and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.410
 new for the first 1000 m before the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.269
 we just like it visually 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.310
 very good but I do not know exactly 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.380
 what a kind of motorcycle it is now 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.690
 This is how you do it 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.980
 describe or which concept has bmw 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.469
 found for it 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.030
 we apply adventure sport and 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.079
 old is a combination of one 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.280
 So he's a supersport? 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.079
 knowledge the new answering the new 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.899
 interpretation all for sport tourer 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.820
 That's exactly what my guess is 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.170
 and I'm not afraid I'm 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.370
 not so sport touring fan but that 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.149
 i could be very good in any case 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.340
 imagine 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.770
 I was really excited about the naked 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.199
 bike based on the superbikes says 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.900
 insanely good at once 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.450
 become one of the favorites and 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.010
 I hope that maybe I will too 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.350
 love to learn 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.850
 how do you feel about a superbike now? 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.470
 base from a radical to such a 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.090
 sporty everyday vehicle he the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.070
 consideration is relatively easy Bundestag 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.080
 what the s 1000 rr said the basis of 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.259
 motor are the 116th 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.610
 160 ps and the 112 newtonmeter but 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.659
 actually want to experience winterthur 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.729
 want a bit of weather protection 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.189
 would like to do either suitcase 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.570
 can assemble navi and then have us 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.670
 then the seating position has to be considered 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.229
 Actually ags agree on something ideal 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.549
 and have that as a try again the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.399
 to make a combination 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.280
 upright raised seating position 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.890
 keep up with the good of a four-cylinder 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.270
 revving performance and with 228 kilo 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.020
 we think we have a great package 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.630
 put down 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.240
 I have to honestly say that Bayern have 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.219
 I thought it absurd to have such a motor 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.869
 to offer in a four-cylinder 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.540
 then any other manufacturer 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.649
 with such a concept and you have it 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.940
 now I say so at the moment at least 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.069
 perfected what do we have now 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.980
 technically for a basis or 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.879
 what 's up 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.870
 for electronic driving aids 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.510
 base vehicle is equipped with two 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.569
 driving modes rain road with abs 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.489
 stability control asc and then have 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.950
 We offer two packages a year 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.480
 then get the dynamic packages out 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.090
 driving modes per out of that means in addition 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.519
 then dynamic dynamic pro will come out of the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.459
 it gets abs out of the skews 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.040
 dependent abs then becomes from the asc 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.750
 traction control dtc dynamic 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.700
 Traction culture also with skew 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.650
 sensor green package is there one more 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.150
 shield that is and grow so well both 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.349
 switch directions what we can 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.390
 now even both double r presented 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.519
 will also have the up and down here 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.349
 switch down without going to groups and 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.230
 In addition, it still has heating handles in it 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.209
 in the first package the second package touring 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.510
 package electronic chassis dynamic 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.780
 a loader becomes a load or something 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.660
 they can adjust then they are 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.819
 heating handles while tempomat is led 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.140
 blinker and then remains ready and 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.530
 not installed above here but now 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.519
 multi controller and luggage rack or 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.500
 suitcase 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.849
 these are the packages that's what it's called 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.859
 Vehicle is commonplace 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.959
 either sporty she should be equipped 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.290
 represents wanted the stock on the tour 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.760
 with suitcase and topcase well I think 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.769
 the basic equipment already insane 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.319
 dollar but always when i test vehicles 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.269
 Then I want to stop then 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.859
 already the esa and so on and so on 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.780
 In the meantime I have to say 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:42.060
 partly already in the novels or the 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.060
 electronic speed control 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.090
 Now the question is what does it cost 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.680
 about in the base you know we have 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.790
 German and Austrian too much 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.680
 We do not know the price yet 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.239
 but if we go to ours 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.040
 over squint Italian competitor 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.030
 then it is okay on the price basis 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.859
 no problem 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.190
 more important maybe even the question 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:08.169
 when is the whole thing at the dealer 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.560
 The vehicle will be available from July at the dealership 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:09.400
 stand 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.440
 I still have a little bit to do with the customer 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.569
 so I would suggest 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.120
 Just preorder and think 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.699
 read the review so now the question 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.709
 when will you present this 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.509
 The vehicle will be in the first quarter 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.280
 presented and then analyzed by the 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:27.229
 drive around with the motorcycle and you 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.490
 then enjoy it while I am 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.349
 certainly very economical 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.349
 thank you very much thank you film from the fair
