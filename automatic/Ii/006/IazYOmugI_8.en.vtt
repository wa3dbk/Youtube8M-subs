00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.940
 Ladies day we have today 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.280
 printed again 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.410
 got here wearing the printed pants yes 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.000
 but 12 some things tasty 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.100
 the structure of your pants is important 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.289
 and the shape 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.510
 the hairy pants that have these 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.910
 so a lot is there is in so 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.260
 evil apart from dust that is not the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.689
 easiest pants 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.359
 because the fabric is fairly supple and 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.030
 does not support your body 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.040
 so this literally falls on euro bears 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.380
 or about your body that continues 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.320
 nothing so then I want to say that you are fine 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:45.210
 should be long ahead and the legs must 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.620
 have if she had firm thighs 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.390
 bullied with keith 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.449
 for receive wages why on on 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.100
 download this against structure and that 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.710
 will offer more support in places where 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.960
 need money 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.510
 the print is also important what one does 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.370
 print does little princess away you can 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.180
 or living great princess going 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.700
 to accentuate 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.790
 that creates hefty for printed pants 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.650
 upper leg holes for little princess 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.070
 great princess can be flat 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.070
 enlarge 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.759
 like having pants with different 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.590
 colour 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.780
 height difficult under the appropriate 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.119
 language this very often looks on people 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.679
 walk down the street with the printed pants there 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.819
 pink colored trump 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:31.039
 so just a little too much choose the softest 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:34.810
 or the quietest color in your pants in this 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.810
 this is also the case 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.390
 another example you these pants is it 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.369
 a lot of different colors 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.420
 what we do with this we keep it whole 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.569
 neutral 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.700
 with the black cap and can explain naja 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.079
 black was on everything I can choose here 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.200
 black because black 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.420
 the least common is in the pot and set 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.090
 your team that doesn't like to get black then 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:12.099
 choose your curious color and such a 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:13.450
 nude color understands almost everything and 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.670
 then to top it all made difficult 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.870
 have no rain and the rule 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.379
 hot 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.190
 If You Do not with shit and vial what 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.360
 to say 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.340
 and you 've seen that on the 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.079
 catwalk or a fashion magazine 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.959
 many different starts continued 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.709
 room balls with stripes and all those 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.349
 stuff 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.910
 if you really love and do the stadium 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.379
 it only 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.190

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.650
 bulbs 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.750
 and as you see 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.680
 many still fit together what is here the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.599
 back 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.299
 the motives are different as to the 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.909
 colors come across and so you draw a lot 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:55.879
