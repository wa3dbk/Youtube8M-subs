 Make a ceasar salad with a surprising 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.200
 twist with igloo fish fingers 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.690

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.189
 the cat makes us feel good 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.870
 we start unpacking the stream and 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:40.700
 I don't use oil for bacon 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.590

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.850

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.790
 meanwhile can continue in that 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.530
 with the cat us i was thinking about two 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.809
 briefly leave us whole 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.850
 and to cut one into cubes so put 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.390
 heat high so the grill pan is hot 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.550
 when the grill pan is hot we can 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.839
 Cat dwarf us it must 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.600
 also have a little patience because you 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.460
 Do it over low heat so that you are soft 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.500
 can become a nice crispy 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.660
 do you as assist it will yes i got it 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.490
 sometimes made with chicken only 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.600
 so I am very curious about your version 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.600
 with fish fingers 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.340
 Yes lettuce would you would epic max 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.580
 girls may be slightly fatter 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.580
 all right 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.080
 if you could get in the lettuce 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.590
 and is then the basis of parts of lettuce 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.880
 the 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.730
 we can go further with such 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.730
 cucumber and that forest garden 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.710
 now i will continue to peel the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.710
 I have boiled eggs for 7 minutes 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.760
 how far I can actually cut 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.690
 you can start using the entire forest 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.690
 except the ass 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.310
 I would refuse to do as crescents 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.790
 this falls where he is fun at the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.569
 salad because it is also a kind 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.569
 gives a cruncher 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.780

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.780

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:49.940
