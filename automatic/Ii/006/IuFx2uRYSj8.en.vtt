00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.529
 I think we start very well, we 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.710
 have a really good phase going too 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.360
 completely deserves 2 0 in leadership 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.560
 and then what happened to us in the last 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.169
 weeks happened again then 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.270
 by a little inattention we 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.710
 directly like a goalie but me 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.140
 think it will be 2010 again 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.340
 played in the front and he actually 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.790
 have completely earned but have won 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.879
 simply the result is too short 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.969
 I believe that we are the first 30 35 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.850
 minutes were completely superior 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.720
 deserves to lead 2 0 and then by one 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.800
 carelessness before half-time 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.930
 yes he will play again 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.640
 to let 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.700
 well then 2010 have it under control again 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.670
 Actually, the third one then thinks 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.989
 you actually that's over again 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.360
 Unfortunately, you had to tremble again shortly 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.250
 yes it's just really annoying that 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.090
 we do not understand the thing sooner 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.920
 So, at the moment, you are sitting 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.899
 every one of us could always be with the opponents 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.610
 Of course this is stupid but today must 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.780
 finally managed because three points 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.530
 have retracted and I think that was 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.350
 the most important we certainly do not want 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.690
 That was not our intention 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.330
 but alright i just said so 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.299
 if you have a lot of unnecessary free kicks 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.850
 caused when you concede long balls 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.110
 then it does not matter if the opponent 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.790
 11 or new month or 10 therefore can 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.640
 it's always a standard goal 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.530
 but we are glad we did that 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.490
 I brought home a game 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.049
 I do not have a bad job 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.830
 No, we won that was 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.420
 first the most important 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.299
 I have tried my contribution to it 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.710
 also had one or the other 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.190
 Maybe a good scene in a must 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.909
 but I can do it all in all 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.740
 my job not bad well clear 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.780
 I expect a bit more but me 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.250
 think the thing is that one has to 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.840
 that in the second half noted here 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.970
 right mood made yes must after 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.519
 whipped in front and then came 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.959
 still something on the field so clear 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.940
 which one if he is up there now 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.280
 are that more people are coming but 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.910
 the because you have to say okay 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.220
 atmospheric made 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.530
 yes, so we are now up in it 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.850
 of course next week right there 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.930
 pick up where we left off now 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.910
 so in any case with the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.319
 We think playfully 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.209
 we still have two things 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.530
 improve that was not so ins 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.840
 but stumbling still comes 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.840
 vote out there as well fully on victory
