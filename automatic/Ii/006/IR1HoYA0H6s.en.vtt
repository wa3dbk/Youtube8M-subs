00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.660
 you 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.089

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.060

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.970
 I have with the mold the line of three 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:27.570
 Who is a lively play? 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:30.630
 I think that's how I answered 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.960
 very straight 2013 channel 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.420
 anyone watching the droid channel knows that 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.420
 Do you know what you're talking about? 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.030
 can and if you have seen right where he 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.710
 It's much better than mine but I do not know 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.809
 why should the case be because of 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.100
 do not fit the region 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.050
 I'm not internet, it's not that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.649
 soccer 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.629
 So this video is a game play. 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.140
 a tutorial together and I at the end of the video 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.629
 is to teach how they can avoid is to change 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.380
 and put the schin 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.530
 I think in your mode because of 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.130
 here how to install and boot the way 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.130
 You have to download those that come later. 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.500
 will not put it ours can not serve in the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.810
 water door curious mode find and lay 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.920
 closing it in brazil does not work 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.640
 stay only your arm and if Brazil is playing 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.860
 colored by considering 51 fig only 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.470
 stay as who gets steve 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.900
 so I got lost and efficiently I had 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:45.980
 made in 11 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:49.640

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.290

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.410
 I do not know why I also tried or 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.850
 droid was so much the new economy 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.360
 schin here I think it will be very 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.490
 chic defended on some bugs yet 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.760
 At least in my case it's still that 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:18.490
 Look here, I 'm either not staying or I'm not staying. 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.980
 together but it 's very cool mode 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.460

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:29.210
 with smartmove and other molds that there 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:34.310

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:37.370
