00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.809
 we continue using the pastillaje with 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.089
 jellies in health 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:48.489
 add a little more sugar to 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.489
 harden it and be able to mashal better 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.970
 cornstarch love powder 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.970
 and extend 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.380
 being more focused on how you 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.700
 resists when it extends and after giving the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:16.250
 push if the pickup removed something very 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.250
 fast because it dries easily 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.240
 to make a butterfly 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.750
 preferably we should have the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.530
 carriers of the butterfly form 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.350
 and a stamp to print the texture that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.740
 has in the design of the butterfly this 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.530
 they do not match they are similar but in the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.300
 market and the couple available 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.950
 Cutter and seal of the same size 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.950
 first I give the texture 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.380
 and then I try to match the side what 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.380
 best possible to cut the butterfly 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.600
 this is made with a cardboard that 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.000
 we make some folds 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.000
 and we put the butterfly to dry there 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.870
 They can be made from different opening 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.420
 so that some butterflies with the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.689
 more open wings that is now left 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.890
 dry and then you put the worm and 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:41.410
 the antennas 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.410
 and we have another butterfly carrier 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.270
 we can also do it that way the 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.900
 we can accept and then we can give 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.570
 color for mental abilities and 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.800
 either powder or with colors 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.800
 liquids and brush 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.319
 Y 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.319
 i 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.799
 with cookie cutters we can make 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.799
 cards 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.700
 this heart says to and saw it 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.550
 and is very suitable for the day of love and 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.989
 the friendship a gift for the birthday 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.989
 of the person who does not want 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.110
 another way is counting the if we do not have 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.110
 some mold 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.910
 using the scissors that they have 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:08.410
 Different shapes of edges we can 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.410
 make the card 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.510
 Y 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.450
 and so we have a card ready for 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.920
 write the message with a mouthpiece 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.920
 appropriate the celebration 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.150
 using cutters we can do 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.670
 letters and numbers that are dry 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.090
 rigid and firm and can be paid in the 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.090
 rule 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.800
 being thicker 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.440
 we can also cut the letters and 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.800
 numbers 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.680
 in the it introduces on a toothpick so 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.430
 less than half the number 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.960
 and you can approach them after they are dry 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.960
 can nail on the area 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.110
 You can make molds in cardboard 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:11.610
 they are cut with a scalpel they are silhouetted 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:14.850
 they dry and when it is dry it 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:18.410
 they paint with the details of the figure of 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.410
 the head of a ghost 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.889
 the eyes are put mouth nose and 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.080
 rosy cheeks 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.949
 Sticks on the cookie or sticks on 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.949
 chocolate 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.430
 Y 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.430
 i 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.330
 the tablet can be used with everything 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.509
 Cutter type 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:32.700
 to make figures that we can sautÃ© 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:37.670
 in the decoration of the cakes 

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.670
 like stars hearts points
