00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello today we present the new one 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.059
 apcom stylist a product that unites 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.920
 to the air conditioning functions also 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.190
 lighting and environment functions 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.949
 this is the mood light can be 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.010
 used for example to give energy 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.890
 with a fixed yellow color or 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.210
 for example to relax with one 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.070
 blue color in an environment for 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.150
 example of Thursday but when we do 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.050
 this day 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.420
 before the star in addition to the function 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.900
 There are various types of fixed animation 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.450
 of lighting functions that second 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.280
 that I am a quick command for 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.890
 example you see right now the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.160
 morning alarm function that us 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.810
 we call smart alarms while yes 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.600
 spread remote control 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.520
 a melody that gently awakens i 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.520
 stays in the bedroom 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.470
 the light slowly from the bottom of the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.559
 a lot of lights come on you answer long 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.760
 the whole inner circle 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.820
 this has an effect 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.770
 it not only awakens sound but also 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.079
 the Udinese 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.420
 also you can also set 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:20.340
 other lighting conditions as per 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.759
 example the pulsation of light with 212 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.250
 different colors in regard to 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.439
 air conditioning functions 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.409
 we point out that the square form like 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.439
 he felt good 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.479
 emissions from the treasure side 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.249
 from the bottom and that allows you to have one 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.859
 situation of the most natural area 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:40.960
 to the environment and end not to disturb with 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.359
 an air jet is unfortunately direct 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.810
 who comes from below who for example is 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:50.720
 sleeping 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:53.119
 a bed listening under the appliance is 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.189
 another important thing so far is the 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.649
 depth of only 12 centimeters does not 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.960
 do more than make it possible 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.580
 totally non-intrusive within 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.580
 furniture for example in a room 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.399
 the noise of the appliance alone 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.679
 19 decibels 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.569
 which makes it one of the devices 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.569
 absolute less noisy on the market
