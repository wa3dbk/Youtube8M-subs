got that got the fans wired in with the
fan<00:00:46.950> control<00:00:47.600> also<00:00:48.600> installed<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.530> new

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
fan control also installed a new

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.270 
fan control also installed a new
remanufactured<00:00:52.100> erican<00:00:53.129> AC<00:00:54.059> compressor<00:00:55.280> and

remanufactured erican AC compressor and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.639 
remanufactured erican AC compressor and
then<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.699> also<00:00:56.850> see<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.530> kind<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
then you can also see the kind of the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.740 
then you can also see the kind of the
mock-up<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.219> how<00:00:59.370> these<00:00:59.579> lines<00:01:00.329> are<00:01:00.570> gonna

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
mock-up of how these lines are gonna

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.219 
mock-up of how these lines are gonna
work<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.530> one<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:03.019> loosened<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
work so this one here loosened up a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.690 
work so this one here loosened up a
little<00:01:04.260> bit<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.680> gonna<00:01:04.830> curve<00:01:05.159> around<00:01:05.489> like

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
little bit it's gonna curve around like

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.390 
little bit it's gonna curve around like
that<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:07.380> it'll<00:01:07.619> come<00:01:07.830> over<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.250> then

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
that and then it'll come over and then

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.000 
that and then it'll come over and then
go<00:01:08.549> down<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.180> then<00:01:09.540> another<00:01:09.869> box<00:01:10.140> battery<00:01:10.770> box

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
go down and then another box battery box

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.880 
go down and then another box battery box
is<00:01:11.189> gonna<00:01:11.340> go<00:01:11.549> right<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.530> AC

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
is gonna go right here and then this AC

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.920 
is gonna go right here and then this AC
line<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.790> gonna<00:01:14.909> come<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.509> factory

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
line is gonna come from the factory

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.980 
line is gonna come from the factory
bulkhead<00:01:16.530> into<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> service<00:01:17.939> port<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.570> then

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
bulkhead into a service port and then

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.770 
bulkhead into a service port and then
come<00:01:19.259> around<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.979> some<00:01:20.159> heat<00:01:20.369> shields<00:01:20.850> near

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
come around with some heat shields near

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.320 
come around with some heat shields near
the<00:01:21.930> turbo<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.640> whole<00:01:23.909> section

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the turbo and then this whole section

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.840 
the turbo and then this whole section
right<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.540> where<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.140> old<00:01:27.110> cruise<00:01:28.110> control

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
right here where the old cruise control

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.330 
right here where the old cruise control
module<00:01:29.960> was<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:32.070> air

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
module was is all going to be air

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.670 
module was is all going to be air
cleaner<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.850> then<00:01:33.210> it'll<00:01:33.450> connect<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
cleaner and then it'll connect up to the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.370 
cleaner and then it'll connect up to the
snorkel<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:38.390> we've<00:01:39.390> been<00:01:39.570> grinding<00:01:39.930> through

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
snorkel so we've been grinding through

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.990 
snorkel so we've been grinding through
all<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.979> miscellaneous<00:01:41.820> details<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:44.000> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
all of the miscellaneous details and the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.810 
all of the miscellaneous details and the
best<00:01:45.840> part<00:01:46.110> about<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.710> video<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.610> we

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
best part about this video is that we

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.240 
best part about this video is that we
are<00:01:48.000> gonna<00:01:48.149> start<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.659> up<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.290> runs<00:01:49.590> so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
are gonna start it up and it runs so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.760 
are gonna start it up and it runs so
I'll<00:01:50.549> go<00:01:50.729> hit<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.329> key<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.380> guys<00:01:52.530> can

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
I'll go hit the key and you guys can

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:27.570 
I'll go hit the key and you guys can
hear

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.350 

so<00:02:28.580> as<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:28.970> can<00:02:29.060> see<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.420> runs<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.790> next<00:02:31.790> step

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
so as you can see it runs and next step

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.280 
so as you can see it runs and next step
is<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:33.160> get<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.430> hydraulic<00:02:35.300> clutch<00:02:35.660> dialed<00:02:36.140> in

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
is to get the hydraulic clutch dialed in

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.210 
is to get the hydraulic clutch dialed in
we've<00:02:36.530> had<00:02:36.740> some<00:02:36.950> issues<00:02:37.370> with<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:39.220> factory

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
we've had some issues with the factory

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.240 
we've had some issues with the factory
Toyota<00:02:40.900> clutch<00:02:41.900> master<00:02:42.470> cylinder<00:02:43.010> being

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
Toyota clutch master cylinder being

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.720 
Toyota clutch master cylinder being
compatible<00:02:43.640> with<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.300> Dodge<00:02:45.340> clutch<00:02:46.340> slave

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
compatible with the Dodge clutch slave

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.290 
compatible with the Dodge clutch slave
cylinder<00:02:47.470> size<00:02:48.470> of<00:02:48.740> bore<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.340> kind<00:02:49.610> of<00:02:49.730> off<00:02:50.240> a

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
cylinder size of bore is kind of off a

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.970 
cylinder size of bore is kind of off a
little<00:02:50.660> bit<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:50.900> we<00:02:51.320> think<00:02:51.470> we<00:02:51.620> have<00:02:51.740> that

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
little bit so we think we have that

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.370 
little bit so we think we have that
dialed<00:02:52.490> in<00:02:52.670> so<00:02:53.600> as<00:02:53.660> soon<00:02:53.810> as<00:02:53.930> we<00:02:54.080> get<00:02:54.200> that

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
dialed in so as soon as we get that

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.240 
dialed in so as soon as we get that
taken<00:02:54.800> care<00:02:54.920> of<00:02:55.160> we<00:02:55.910> will<00:02:56.120> be<00:02:56.240> able<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.980> run<00:02:57.980> and

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
taken care of we will be able to run and

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.660 
taken care of we will be able to run and
drive<00:02:58.490> this<00:02:58.990> around<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.140> block<00:03:00.350> so<00:03:00.710> stay

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
drive this around the block so stay

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.830 
drive this around the block so stay
