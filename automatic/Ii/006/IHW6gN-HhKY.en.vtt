00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
thing that's the problem gas so we can

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.190 
thing that's the problem gas so we can
use<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:31.520> later<00:01:31.700> maybe<00:01:32.569> we'll<00:01:32.749> find<00:01:32.929> some<00:01:33.109> in

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
use it later maybe we'll find some in
