00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 plastics filth the sea 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.109
 Welcome to this commented news space 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.730
 according to a recent article in the Madrid public newspaper 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:18.100
 the citizens of this planet have gone from producing about 30 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.380
 million tons of plastic per year in the 70s 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.300
 to almost 200 million at the beginning of this century 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.929
 bottles containers dividers 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.489
 balls to protect bag products and a very long etcetera of various 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.450
 forms compositions 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.380
 uses and textures of plastic 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.050
 have become part of the key to the technological and economic success of 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.130
 our society 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.290
 but also in a program of the first magnitude 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.830
 for marine ecosystems, parts of these products go to the sea 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.270
 the sewers one pushed by the ones created 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.030
 around 80% of the floating waste 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.000
 comes from the mainland 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.910
 the surface currents and the tides transport them and whoever comes 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.320
 accumulate them in the center of the so-called oceanic turns 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.560
 in the central area of ​​these turns 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.889
 the winds are weak and the currents are very weak 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.880
 plastics accumulate in areas little traveled by navigation 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.700
 far from the coast 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.110
 comments king yamashita of the Japanese university of mie 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.090
 the accumulation of waste is a worrying fact 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.790
 and is that the problem is much more than aesthetic 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.899
 intake by marine organisms 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.679
 like birds turtles calamari fish 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.540
 It is very high 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.390
 44 percent of seabird species 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.950
 consume plastics routinely 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.279
 the problem 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:12.829
 it would be anecdotal if the amount of plastics that floated was without 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.479
 significant 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.929
 but in certain zones of accumulation like the sea of ​​the sargasso 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.929
 and the turn of the North Pacific 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:25.389
 it has been proven that there is a huge waste extension 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:27.869
 in these areas 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.869
 the relationship between the weight of the plankton 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.229
 and the weight of plastic and other floating objects was 1 to 6 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:41.879
 that is to say for each kilo of platón six kilos of waste 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:48.079
 we do not know yet the impact that so much material has for ecosystems 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.649
 marine 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.899
 but it is clear that they are interfering in the chains 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:57.779
 food, and maybe in the operation of the system 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:00.149
 in some areas 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:04.479
 it has been estimated that the waste cloud can reach between 20 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.999
 thirty meters deep 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.259
 up to here the news 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:15.199
 The seas have been our big garbage bin for a long time and 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.199
 plastics are now the most visible part 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:24.349
 the problem is that the sea is home to a huge variety of living beings 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:29.099
 that are being that vehemently affected by our works 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:34.249
 the use of reusable bags for purchase 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:41.299
 not plastic would want an important help in the fight against this great 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.519
 absurdity 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:44.669
 see you next year
