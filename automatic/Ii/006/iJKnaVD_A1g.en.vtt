00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.140
 Well Well Sol Saku place er 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.369
 The theme is sacrifice and compensation 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:35.160
 Let's fight while sacrificing oneself 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:39.780
 It's in the form of super magic action, but I'm using magic to defeat monsters, though 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.920
 Various offerings for saying that only magic can be used 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.480
 Well use magician 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:51.430
 I'm A-kun, but when it's gone my life or something 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.030
 I say that I have to fight while sacrificing some of my important things 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.320
 Right 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.450
 Very hard 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.160
 It's an action game, it 's a game where you're fighting hard in the dark worldview 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:05.280
 I will 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:10.880
 I think that comes out monsters in the various myths and Toka I Greek mythology is most 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.270
 But it is only a part of it as an element in it 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.210
 It is often said that it comes out in myths 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.920
 In the form of a monster 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.130
 It is simply Greek mythology 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.530
 It is not only had such a 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.970
 Japanese myths and so on are mixed up 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:36.080
 There is a thing that is finished, but this game is that sacrifice and compensation 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:40.670
 Tteyuu theme Hano multiplayer of me so good I have to enjoy 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:46.040
 It's a game, but its sacrifice and compensation is still to sacrifice its own life 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.550
 You can do it, but it's a fellow fighting with you in a multiplayer fighting together 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.000
 You can sacrifice your life 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:56.310
 It's a game that is characterized by saying that it's coming 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.070
 You say that you have a friend in front of you and you can feel the feeling of sacrificing the one in front of you 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.510
 But 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:05.350
 That is also the characteristic of that vita, and it is the most suitable thing for this game 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:12.130
 In this game I thought it was a shame 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:17.060
 There are two major paths depending on whether you sacrifice or rescue, but this game is before 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:20.870
 There is also a sense of goodness, and now we are fighting in the lost state 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:28.340
 It's like a game I've never been to 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:32.330
 I'm thinking of going to the heart part, so if it's the first game 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.050
 The Fu Tteyuu wonder if not it will be the first of the game-held that feeling good Kana Tteyuu 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.920
 I think if the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.920
 + Pension
