new every year some new challenge and

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.860 
new every year some new challenge and
how<00:00:52.340> have<00:00:52.430> you<00:00:52.520> seen<00:00:52.700> storytelling<00:00:53.329> improving

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
how have you seen storytelling improving

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.900 
how have you seen storytelling improving
games<00:00:54.079> over<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.440> years<00:00:54.820> well<00:00:55.820> it's

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
games over the years well it's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.250 
games over the years well it's
definitely<00:00:56.090> improved<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:56.840> I<00:00:56.870> mean<00:00:57.050> it<00:00:57.170> was

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
definitely improved so I mean it was

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.660 
definitely improved so I mean it was
obviously<00:00:57.590> when<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:57.829> was<00:00:57.980> first<00:00:58.130> doing<00:00:58.310> it<00:00:58.489> was

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
obviously when I was first doing it was

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.889 
obviously when I was first doing it was
a<00:00:58.700> lot<00:00:58.880> more<00:00:58.970> primitive<00:00:59.239> because<00:00:59.600> you<00:00:59.720> didn't

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
a lot more primitive because you didn't

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.410 
a lot more primitive because you didn't
have<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.079> visual<00:01:00.890> tools<00:01:01.310> to<00:01:01.880> do<00:01:02.000> it<00:01:02.030> was<00:01:02.329> day

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
have the visual tools to do it was day

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.389 
have the visual tools to do it was day
love<00:01:02.540> you<00:01:02.660> came<00:01:02.899> out<00:01:03.079> so<00:01:04.009> I've<00:01:04.100> been<00:01:04.250> impressed

love you came out so I've been impressed
I<00:01:04.729> actually<00:01:05.119> think<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.479> technology<00:01:05.750> is<00:01:06.020> now

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
I actually think the technology is now

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.780 
I actually think the technology is now
getting<00:01:06.409> to<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.590> point<00:01:06.829> where<00:01:07.100> you<00:01:07.640> can

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
getting to the point where you can

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.399 
getting to the point where you can
really<00:01:07.909> start<00:01:08.299> to<00:01:08.479> delve<00:01:08.689> into<00:01:08.899> some<00:01:09.020> other

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
really start to delve into some other

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.349 
really start to delve into some other
subtleties<00:01:09.829> of<00:01:09.979> storytelling<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:10.880> there's

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:11.359 
subtleties of storytelling so there's

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:12.819 
subtleties of storytelling so there's
been<00:01:11.539> some<00:01:11.780> stuff<00:01:12.020> like<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.350> Uncharted

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
been some stuff like the Uncharted

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.050 
been some stuff like the Uncharted
series<00:01:13.069> has<00:01:13.429> they've<00:01:13.579> done<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:13.759> really<00:01:13.789> great

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
series has they've done a really great

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.270 
series has they've done a really great
job<00:01:14.179> of<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:15.170> start<00:01:15.439> of<00:01:15.530> storytelling<00:01:16.100> mass

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
job of the start of storytelling mass

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
take on it now you're a pioneer in a

transmedia bring a Wing Commander the
big<00:01:25.880> screen<00:01:26.090> as<00:01:26.209> a<00:01:26.240> director<00:01:26.689> why<00:01:27.170> do<00:01:27.229> you

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
big screen as a director why do you

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.840 
big screen as a director why do you
think<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:27.829> many<00:01:27.889> of<00:01:28.039> you<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.189> game<00:01:28.340> adaptations

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
think so many of you to game adaptations

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.120 
think so many of you to game adaptations
have<00:01:28.999> failed<00:01:29.209> at<00:01:29.359> the<00:01:29.450> box<00:01:29.479> office<00:01:30.100> well<00:01:31.100> I

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
have failed at the box office well I

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.429 
have failed at the box office well I
mean<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.549> couple<00:01:31.909> of<00:01:32.090> things<00:01:32.270> one<00:01:32.359> first<00:01:33.229> up

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
mean a couple of things one first up

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.289 
mean a couple of things one first up
just<00:01:34.219> because<00:01:34.310> you're<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.549> good<00:01:34.759> video<00:01:34.909> game

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
just because you're a good video game

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:36.459 
just because you're a good video game
doesn't<00:01:35.600> necessarily<00:01:35.929> mean<00:01:36.109> that<00:01:36.170> you're<00:01:36.350> a

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
doesn't necessarily mean that you're a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.910 
doesn't necessarily mean that you're a
good<00:01:37.039> story<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:38.329> that<00:01:39.170> I<00:01:39.529> think<00:01:39.649> that's

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
good story and that I think that's

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.149 
good story and that I think that's
probably<00:01:40.039> a<00:01:40.249> big<00:01:40.429> big<00:01:40.819> part<00:01:41.029> of<00:01:41.119> it<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:42.159> i

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
probably a big big part of it and i

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.550 
probably a big big part of it and i
think<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.329> video<00:01:44.630> games<00:01:44.899> need<00:01:45.109> to<00:01:45.200> mature<00:01:45.319> him

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
think the video games need to mature him

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.899

I'm<00:01:54.580> looking<00:01:54.610> to<00:01:55.120> try<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.630> sort<00:01:55.840> of<00:01:55.900> push

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
I'm looking to try and sort of push

because<00:01:57.070> I<00:01:57.190> think<00:01:58.140> films<00:01:59.140> are<00:01:59.290> still<00:01:59.470> at<00:01:59.560> the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
because I think films are still at the

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.870 
because I think films are still at the
infancy<00:01:59.920> I<00:02:00.100> mean<00:02:00.310> games<00:02:00.490> are<00:02:00.640> still<00:02:00.790> the

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
infancy I mean games are still the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.880 
infancy I mean games are still the
infancy<00:02:01.150> so<00:02:01.450> I<00:02:01.720> would<00:02:02.260> say<00:02:02.440> that<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.740> game

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
infancy so I would say that the game

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.110 
infancy so I would say that the game
business<00:02:03.250> is<00:02:03.400> kind<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.610> equivalent<00:02:04.000> at<00:02:04.060> the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
business is kind of equivalent at the

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.410 
business is kind of equivalent at the
film<00:02:04.330> business<00:02:04.480> in<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.870> 1910s<00:02:05.380> 1920s<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:06.430> you

definitely<00:03:20.320> have<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:20.940> juggle<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.120> lot<00:03:22.150> of<00:03:22.360> balls

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
definitely have to juggle a lot of balls

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.600 
definitely have to juggle a lot of balls
and<00:03:22.989> you've<00:03:23.140> got<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.320> sort<00:03:23.530> of<00:03:23.620> be<00:03:24.310> aware<00:03:24.400> of

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
and you've got to sort of be aware of

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.300 
and you've got to sort of be aware of
the<00:03:24.850> different<00:03:25.209> sort<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.570> technical

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
the different sort of technical

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.280 
the different sort of technical
challenges<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.549> directing<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.480> team<00:03:28.690> is<00:03:28.989> kind

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
challenges and directing a team is kind

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.770 
challenges and directing a team is kind
of<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.440> same<00:03:29.590> as<00:03:29.769> directing<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.280> movie<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:31.600> the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
of the same as directing a movie so the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.720 
of the same as directing a movie so the
actual<00:03:31.930> aspects<00:03:32.890> of<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.100> creative<00:03:33.430> side<00:03:33.580> of

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
actual aspects of the creative side of

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.610 
actual aspects of the creative side of
filmmaking<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:34.390> would<00:03:34.959> say<00:03:35.110> there's<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.440> lot<00:03:35.590> of

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
filmmaking I would say there's a lot of

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.370 
filmmaking I would say there's a lot of
game<00:03:36.400> making<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.850> translates<00:03:37.299> across<00:03:37.630> other

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
game making the translates across other

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.720 
game making the translates across other
than<00:03:38.709> just<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:38.980> pressures<00:03:39.340> much<00:03:39.519> higher<00:03:39.700> in

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
than just the pressures much higher in

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.520 
than just the pressures much higher in
the<00:03:39.880> film<00:03:40.090> business<00:03:40.120> because<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:40.810> shoot<00:03:41.350> in<00:03:41.470> a

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
the film business because you shoot in a

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.810 
the film business because you shoot in a
very<00:03:41.709> short<00:03:41.769> period<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.250> time<00:03:42.310> so<00:03:42.670> you'll

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
very short period of time so you'll

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.490 
very short period of time so you'll
shoot<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.060> movie<00:03:43.239> in<00:03:43.390> three<00:03:43.600> months<00:03:43.750> four

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
shoot a movie in three months four

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.229 
shoot a movie in three months four
months<00:03:44.650> whereas<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.070> game<00:03:45.400> you'll<00:03:45.670> make<00:03:45.880> over

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
months whereas a game you'll make over

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.880 
months whereas a game you'll make over
several<00:03:46.600> years<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.110> so<00:03:47.200> you've<00:03:47.350> got<00:03:47.380> time<00:03:47.680> to

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
several years and so you've got time to

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.650 
several years and so you've got time to
make<00:03:48.040> decisions<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.060> you<00:03:49.150> have<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.360> be<00:03:49.390> really

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
make decisions and you have to be really

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.900 
make decisions and you have to be really
prepared<00:03:49.840> in<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.320> film<00:03:50.500> business<00:03:50.910> the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
prepared in the film business the

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.729 
prepared in the film business the
business<00:03:52.060> side<00:03:52.480> of<00:03:52.510> film<00:03:52.930> isn't<00:03:53.470> particularly

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
business side of film isn't particularly

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.710 
business side of film isn't particularly
great<00:03:54.070> so<00:03:54.640> I<00:03:54.670> would<00:03:54.970> say<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.209> game<00:03:55.390> business

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
great so I would say the game business

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.710 
great so I would say the game business
side<00:03:56.080> as<00:03:56.200> much<00:03:56.380> nice

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
side as much nice

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.780 
side as much nice
the<00:03:57.170> film<00:03:57.380> business<00:03:57.530> ID<00:03:57.800> but<00:03:58.490> i<00:03:58.550> would<00:03:58.640> say<00:03:58.730> on

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
the film business ID but i would say on

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.100 
the film business ID but i would say on
the<00:03:58.880> creative<00:03:59.150> side<00:03:59.210> there<00:03:59.540> are<00:03:59.570> some<00:03:59.870> there's

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
the creative side there are some there's

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.080 
the creative side there are some there's
definitely<00:04:00.220> similarities<00:04:01.220> i<00:04:01.400> would<00:04:01.760> just<00:04:01.910> say

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
definitely similarities i would just say

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.630 
definitely similarities i would just say
like<00:04:02.120> i<00:04:02.420> said<00:04:02.660> that<00:04:02.900> film<00:04:03.620> they've<00:04:04.400> been

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
like i said that film they've been

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.250 
like i said that film they've been
learning<00:04:04.820> how<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.150> you<00:04:05.600> know<00:04:05.630> get<00:04:06.020> a<00:04:06.080> whole

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
learning how to you know get a whole

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.380 
learning how to you know get a whole
bunch<00:04:06.470> of<00:04:06.590> creative<00:04:06.890> people<00:04:07.040> together<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.760> you

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
bunch of creative people together to you

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.180 
bunch of creative people together to you
know<00:04:08.480> achieve<00:04:08.810> one<00:04:08.990> vision<00:04:09.290> for<00:04:09.890> longer<00:04:10.160> than

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
know achieve one vision for longer than

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.440 
know achieve one vision for longer than
people<00:04:10.490> will<00:04:10.700> be<00:04:10.760> doing<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.000> game<00:04:11.120> business

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
people will be doing the game business

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.790 
people will be doing the game business
so<00:04:11.540> they<00:04:11.570> sort<00:04:11.810> of<00:04:11.900> got<00:04:12.050> a<00:04:12.080> little<00:04:12.170> bit<00:04:12.440> more<00:04:12.680> of

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
so they sort of got a little bit more of

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.370 
so they sort of got a little bit more of
that<00:04:12.860> down<00:04:13.130> as<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.310> as<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.880> sort<00:04:14.180> of<00:04:14.240> craft<00:04:15.110> or<00:04:15.320> a

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
that down as a as a sort of craft or a

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.490 
that down as a as a sort of craft or a
system<00:04:16.299> but<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:17.329> know<00:04:17.660> i<00:04:17.690> think<00:04:17.989> people<00:04:18.260> go

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
system but you know i think people go

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.479 
system but you know i think people go
between<00:04:18.799> them<00:04:18.920> and<00:04:18.980> i<00:04:19.040> think<00:04:19.220> you'll<00:04:19.340> see

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
between them and i think you'll see

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.280 
between them and i think you'll see
people<00:04:19.700> shift<00:04:20.420> between<00:04:20.600> is<00:04:20.870> certainly<00:04:21.109> on<00:04:21.260> the

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
people shift between is certainly on the

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.800 
people shift between is certainly on the
artists<00:04:21.769> side<00:04:21.980> on<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.580> music<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.600> sound

artists side on the music and the sound

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.590 
artists side on the music and the sound
side<00:04:24.110> already<00:04:24.700> you're<00:04:25.700> seeing<00:04:25.940> it<00:04:26.120> i<00:04:26.180> mean<00:04:26.330> the

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
side already you're seeing it i mean the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.120 
side already you're seeing it i mean the
same<00:04:26.630> artists<00:04:27.170> that<00:04:27.230> do<00:04:27.380> big<00:04:27.560> movies<00:04:27.890> are

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
same artists that do big movies are

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.640 
same artists that do big movies are
doing<00:04:28.340> games<00:04:28.580> and<00:04:29.030> say<00:04:29.450> musicians<00:04:30.080> same

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
doing games and say musicians same

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.250 
doing games and say musicians same
composers<00:04:31.280> same<00:04:31.610> you<00:04:31.730> know<00:04:32.000> sound<00:04:32.960> effects

people and so you'll see fair amount of
that<00:04:35.420> because<00:04:35.630> in<00:04:35.810> really<00:04:36.080> out<00:04:36.200> in<00:04:36.230> reality<00:04:36.680> in

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
that because in really out in reality in

that because in really out in reality in
movies<00:04:37.160> you're<00:04:37.790> basically<00:04:38.560> creating<00:04:39.560> a<00:04:39.650> world

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
movies you're basically creating a world

movies you're basically creating a world
you<00:04:40.130> know<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:40.490> will<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.120> sort<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.360> escape<00:04:41.660> into

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
you know a will to sort of escape into

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.420 
you know a will to sort of escape into
and<00:04:42.230> you're<00:04:42.590> doing<00:04:42.770> kind<00:04:42.980> of<00:04:43.010> a<00:04:43.100> lot<00:04:43.220> of<00:04:43.310> that

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
and you're doing kind of a lot of that

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.450 
and you're doing kind of a lot of that
in<00:04:43.580> games<00:04:44.090> as<00:04:44.300> well
