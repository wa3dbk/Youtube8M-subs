00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
about 10 or 12 plaques let it dry for a

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.010 
about 10 or 12 plaques let it dry for a
couple<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.890> hours<00:02:08.100> and<00:02:08.700> then<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> started

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
couple of hours and then I started

couple of hours and then I started
twisting<00:02:10.350> it<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:12.360> was<00:02:12.480> stretched<00:02:12.900> but

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
twisting it and so it was stretched but

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.770 
twisting it and so it was stretched but
it<00:02:13.650> wasn't<00:02:14.100> full<00:02:15.030> length<00:02:15.330> I'm<00:02:16.260> info<00:02:17.780> mm-hmm
