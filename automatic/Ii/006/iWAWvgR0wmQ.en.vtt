00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:09.110
 at this moment we are close 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:13.700
 well the bottom looks the bridge of route 30 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:17.889
 and rivers next we are about 4 kilometers 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.889
 of the entry of Riestra and flints 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.560
 looking at my back now 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.039
 would be what would be moquegua this is 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:33.590
 match of May 25 and I want you to see 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:36.860
 how far is the water from the route 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.910
 I do not know if you can see there 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.000
 we need nothing so that the water passes through 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.300
 over the route at this time 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.850
 and it is really very impressive what 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.879
 it looks 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.400
 I'm up to the task I'm going to put the 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.010
 vision at the height of the water 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.550
 they are scarce 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.699
 40 to 50 centimeters missing 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.030
 so that the water passes over the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.900
 route 30 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.530
 It is very impressive anyway 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.640
 water is much higher on the side of 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.640
 downstream 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.420
 it would be unforgiving upstream would this be 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.420
 there is not 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.130
 there we are looking towards moquegua level 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.130
 of water say it 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.570
 really the world 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.570
 remaining 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.790
 smart is practically a sea 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.790
 what we are seeing 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.630
 good different is the panorama of the other 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.510
 side of the route 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.940
 the route is acting as evidently 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.940
 and I would almost tell you obviously like a dam 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.819
 on this side the situation is different is 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:28.510
 almost one meter towards the height of the route 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.129
 so that you have measure of what the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.459
 height that water has at this time 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.210
 there we see a gate there you see a 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.640
 gate 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.640
 the wiring directly does not look 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:48.840
 there is the stick of the high-tension stick 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.780
 at this time but it really does not look 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.330
 the wiring 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.880
 I'm going to try to get out walking 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.710
 here you see it 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.850
 all you can in a lizard 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.850
 really impressive there 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.630
 lizard that is choked by success 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:25.720
 I will try to get closer 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.460
 to what would be the entrance to a field 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.310
 there is the helmet there in the background what 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.980
 you see the helmet and right now I'm 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.599
 trying to get as close as I can 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.599
 it would be of the field 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.930
 and I can get here just 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:47.299
 it's a sea really 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.150
 you can not see the wiring 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.040
 water has far exceeded the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.310
 height of the fence and I will show you 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:03.110
 now much closer the gate 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.110
 there you have the gate 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.530
 It is really impressive 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.750
 Now I'm going to show you I'm going to make you a 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.750
 zoom I'm going to go up there to that bridge 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:31.120
 on that bridge and we're going to show what 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.120
 is the flow of the salty
