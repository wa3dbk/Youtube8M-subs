00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
conceptual or online and there is an

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.600 
conceptual or online and there is an

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
so I just I did this

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.030 
so I just I did this
if<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:13.060> get<00:03:13.330> in<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.629> good<00:03:13.840> rhythm<00:03:14.080> you<00:03:14.620> can<00:03:14.800> sort

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
if you get in a good rhythm you can sort

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.030 
if you get in a good rhythm you can sort
of<00:03:15.160> not<00:03:15.640> really<00:03:15.879> think<00:03:16.120> about<00:03:16.209> it<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.690> just

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
of not really think about it and just

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.259 
of not really think about it and just
get<00:03:18.040> lost<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.519> your<00:03:18.610> own<00:03:18.670> thoughts<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:19.150> little

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
get lost in your own thoughts a little

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:36.070 
get lost in your own thoughts a little
bit<00:03:19.540> or<00:03:19.980> unwind<00:03:20.980> from<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.250> day

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.730 

I<00:03:36.220> think<00:03:37.220> it's<00:03:37.970> not<00:03:38.270> a<00:03:38.680> particular<00:03:39.680> subject<00:03:40.040> or

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
I think it's not a particular subject or

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.080 
I think it's not a particular subject or
even<00:03:42.740> a<00:03:42.800> particular<00:03:43.280> style<00:03:43.610> I<00:03:43.760> think<00:03:43.970> I'm

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
even a particular style I think I'm

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.430 
even a particular style I think I'm
really<00:03:44.480> inspired<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.230> drawn<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:46.150> excellence

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
really inspired and drawn to excellence

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.240 
really inspired and drawn to excellence
and<00:03:48.440> passion

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
and passion

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.640 
and passion
I<00:03:49.280> think<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:50.090> generation<00:03:50.600> that<00:03:50.630> is<00:03:50.930> really

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
I think the generation that is really

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.410 
I think the generation that is really
coming<00:03:51.830> to<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.040> forefront<00:03:52.130> right<00:03:52.760> now<00:03:52.910> the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
coming to the forefront right now the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.690 
coming to the forefront right now the
other<00:03:53.600> generation<00:03:54.290> is<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:55.040> group<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.430> people

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
other generation is a group of people

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.100 
other generation is a group of people
who<00:03:55.970> care<00:03:56.720> about<00:03:57.490> reaching<00:03:58.490> a<00:03:58.970> smaller<00:03:59.810> group

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
who care about reaching a smaller group

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.290 
who care about reaching a smaller group
of<00:04:00.260> like-minded<00:04:00.620> individuals<00:04:01.150> rather<00:04:02.150> than

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
of like-minded individuals rather than

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.840 
of like-minded individuals rather than
reaching<00:04:02.810> everybody<00:04:03.080> and<00:04:03.770> I<00:04:03.860> think<00:04:03.890> in

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
reaching everybody and I think in

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.150 
reaching everybody and I think in
decades<00:04:05.300> past<00:04:05.440> in<00:04:06.550> America<00:04:08.890> we've<00:04:09.890> become

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
decades past in America we've become

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.710 
decades past in America we've become
really<00:04:10.670> addicted<00:04:11.060> to<00:04:11.180> cheap<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:14.540> end

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
really addicted to cheap and the end

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.570 
really addicted to cheap and the end
goal<00:04:14.959> behind<00:04:15.350> that<00:04:15.500> was<00:04:15.680> just<00:04:15.980> to<00:04:16.130> reach<00:04:16.340> as

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
goal behind that was just to reach as

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.880 
goal behind that was just to reach as
many<00:04:16.790> people<00:04:16.940> as<00:04:17.299> possible<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.900> sell<00:04:18.350> as<00:04:18.560> many

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
many people as possible to sell as many

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.580 
many people as possible to sell as many
things<00:04:19.190> as<00:04:19.340> possible<00:04:19.400> I<00:04:20.120> think<00:04:21.109> for<00:04:21.380> younger

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
things as possible I think for younger

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.410 
things as possible I think for younger
people<00:04:21.830> growing<00:04:22.190> up<00:04:22.400> they<00:04:22.580> understand<00:04:23.180> and

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
people growing up they understand and

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.930 
people growing up they understand and
they<00:04:23.600> are<00:04:24.380> shifting<00:04:24.800> away<00:04:25.100> from<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.520> they

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
they are shifting away from that they

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.840 
they are shifting away from that they
can<00:04:26.120> see<00:04:26.360> how<00:04:26.950> that<00:04:27.950> doesn't<00:04:28.340> necessarily

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
can see how that doesn't necessarily

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.670 
can see how that doesn't necessarily
provide<00:04:29.150> for<00:04:29.420> the<00:04:29.540> best<00:04:29.750> experience<00:04:29.930> or<00:04:30.500> is

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
provide for the best experience or is

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.940 
provide for the best experience or is
isn't<00:04:31.280> necessarily<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:32.000> best<00:04:32.180> way<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.330> live

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
isn't necessarily the best way to live

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.730 
isn't necessarily the best way to live
and<00:04:34.390> so<00:04:35.390> people<00:04:35.630> are<00:04:35.840> more<00:04:36.110> focused<00:04:36.410> on

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
and so people are more focused on

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.120 
and so people are more focused on
reaching<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.610> smaller<00:04:38.600> group<00:04:38.900> but<00:04:39.590> really

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
reaching a smaller group but really

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.870 
reaching a smaller group but really
being<00:04:40.340> able<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.610> connect<00:04:41.300> with<00:04:41.390> those<00:04:41.600> people

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
being able to connect with those people

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.830 
being able to connect with those people
you<00:04:43.880> know<00:04:44.000> maybe<00:04:44.240> you're<00:04:44.510> not<00:04:44.660> going<00:04:44.780> to
