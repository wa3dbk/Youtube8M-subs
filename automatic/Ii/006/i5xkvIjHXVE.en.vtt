00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.990 
you look at their scorecards I look so
pretty<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.570> pretty<00:01:36.950> big<00:01:37.950> big<00:01:38.280> white<00:01:38.460> decision<00:01:38.880> I

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
pretty a pretty big big white decision I

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.450 
pretty a pretty big big white decision I
don't<00:01:39.180> believe<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.680> scoring<00:01:40.680> was<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> accurate

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
don't believe the scoring was a accurate

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.069 
don't believe the scoring was a accurate
I<00:01:41.640> think<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> referee<00:01:44.540> did<00:01:45.540> exactly<00:01:45.780> what<00:01:45.960> we

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
I think the referee did exactly what we

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.350 
I think the referee did exactly what we
was<00:01:46.290> open<00:01:46.860> he<00:01:46.890> wouldn't<00:01:47.159> do<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.210> know

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
was open he wouldn't do but you know

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.850 
was open he wouldn't do but you know
this<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.960> them<00:01:49.049> I'm<00:01:49.320> fighting<00:01:49.530> Germany

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
this is one of them I'm fighting Germany

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.490 
this is one of them I'm fighting Germany
so<00:01:50.250> he<00:01:50.700> he<00:01:51.210> got<00:01:51.360> he<00:01:51.630> got<00:01:51.689> expect<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.170> did<00:01:52.350> hear
