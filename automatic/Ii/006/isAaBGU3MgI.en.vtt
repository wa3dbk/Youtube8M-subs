this<00:00:47.160> stick<00:00:47.430> has<00:00:47.879> got<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> low<00:00:48.510> kick<00:00:48.750> point<00:00:49.050> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
this stick has got a low kick point to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.470 
this stick has got a low kick point to
it<00:00:49.410> which<00:00:50.250> means<00:00:50.520> basically<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:51.059> your<00:00:51.300> kick

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
it which means basically that your kick

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.630 
it which means basically that your kick
point<00:00:51.780> usually<00:00:52.289> ends<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:52.739> around<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.460> area

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
point usually ends up around this area

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.979 
point usually ends up around this area
here<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.910> guess<00:00:54.090> depending<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.510> how<00:00:54.629> short<00:00:54.960> that

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
here I guess depending on how short that

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:55.910 
here I guess depending on how short that
you<00:00:55.140> caught<00:00:55.320> your<00:00:55.410> stick<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.620> where<00:00:55.829> your

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
you caught your stick and where your

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.319 
you caught your stick and where your
hold<00:00:56.070> your<00:00:56.190> hand<00:00:56.370> gives<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> little<00:00:57.120> bit

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
hold your hand gives you a little bit

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.540 
hold your hand gives you a little bit
more<00:00:58.079> accuracy<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:59.399> harder<00:01:00.390> shot<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.649> also<00:01:01.920> you

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
more accuracy a harder shot and also you

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.680 
more accuracy a harder shot and also you
don't<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.879> put<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.149> much<00:01:03.300> into<00:01:03.660> it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
don't have to put as much into it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.060 
don't have to put as much into it
because<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.170> got<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> nice<00:01:04.589> little<00:01:04.890> kick

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
because it's got a nice little kick

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.280 
because it's got a nice little kick
point<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:06.510> basically<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.020> almost

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
point to it this basically is almost

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.039 
point to it this basically is almost
like<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.710> vapor<00:01:08.189> said<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> vapor<00:01:09.420> 40<00:01:09.810> shaft

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
like the vapor said a vapor 40 shaft

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.780 
like the vapor said a vapor 40 shaft
where<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.380> got<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.710> crisscross<00:01:11.369> design

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
where it's got this crisscross design

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.030 
where it's got this crisscross design
here<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.210> abilene<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.500> multi-layered

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
here in abilene it's a multi-layered

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.850 
here in abilene it's a multi-layered
fiberglass<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.290> graphite<00:01:16.290> layer<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.740> they

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
fiberglass and graphite layer that they

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.370 
fiberglass and graphite layer that they
do<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:18.360> then<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.840> actually<00:01:19.170> thin

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
do so it's then it's actually thin

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.120 
do so it's then it's actually thin
layers<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.970> material<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.390> they<00:01:21.479> keep

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
layers of the material that they keep

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.560 
layers of the material that they keep
waving<00:01:23.130> basically<00:01:23.790> all<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.180> way<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.390> through

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
waving basically all the way up through

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.210 
waving basically all the way up through
all<00:01:24.689> come<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.170> little<00:01:25.350> closer<00:01:25.560> here<00:01:25.680> you

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.139 
couple of weeks ago and I've used it on
the<00:01:49.890> ice<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> couple<00:01:50.369> times<00:01:50.490> got<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> great<00:01:50.970> feel

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
the ice a couple times got a great feel

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.840 
the ice a couple times got a great feel
to<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:52.320> got<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> nice<00:01:52.649> tapered<00:01:53.159> shaft<00:01:53.670> down

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
to it it's got a nice tapered shaft down

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.330 
to it it's got a nice tapered shaft down
here<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.659> taper<00:01:54.930> doesn't<00:01:55.290> go<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:56.250> about

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
here on the taper doesn't go for about

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.039 
here on the taper doesn't go for about
24<00:01:56.939> inches<00:01:56.969> it'll<00:01:57.329> only<00:01:57.390> looks<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:57.750> maybe

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
24 inches it'll only looks like maybe

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.109 
24 inches it'll only looks like maybe
it's<00:01:58.290> got<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> 12<00:01:58.710> inch<00:01:58.890> taper<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.430> and

it's got a 12 inch taper to it and

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.459 
it's got a 12 inch taper to it and
that's<00:02:00.329> maybe<00:02:00.570> why<00:02:00.810> they<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.140> got<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> nice

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
that's maybe why they it's got a nice

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.350 
that's maybe why they it's got a nice
look<00:02:01.740> kick<00:02:01.950> point<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.899> this<00:02:03.899> thick<00:02:05.299> more<00:02:06.299> or
