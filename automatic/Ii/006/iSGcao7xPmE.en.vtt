hello<00:00:00.900> and<00:00:00.930> welcome<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:02.159> my<00:00:02.250> first<00:00:02.280> single

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hello and welcome to my first single

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.289 
hello and welcome to my first single
digit<00:00:03.330> or<00:00:03.480> this<00:00:04.319> tutorial<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:05.100> will<00:00:05.130> just<00:00:05.730> show

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
digit or this tutorial I will just show

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.179 
digit or this tutorial I will just show
you<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.629> basics<00:00:07.140> like<00:00:07.350> you<00:00:07.529> move<00:00:07.680> objects

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
you the basics like you move objects

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.940 
you the basics like you move objects
create<00:00:08.610> primitives<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.540> so<00:00:10.380> on<00:00:10.530> make<00:00:10.769> them

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
create primitives and so on make them

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.459 
create primitives and so on make them
editable<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.759> move<00:00:12.509> some<00:00:12.750> points<00:00:13.080> around<00:00:13.259> or

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
editable and move some points around or

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.810 
editable and move some points around or
so<00:00:13.730> so<00:00:14.730> we<00:00:14.940> are<00:00:15.000> going<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.450> just<00:00:15.870> start<00:00:16.820> first

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
so so we are going to just start first

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.929 
so so we are going to just start first
here<00:00:18.600> are<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:19.170> are<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.410> primitives<00:00:19.880> so<00:00:20.880> you

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
here are here are the primitives so you

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.300 
here are here are the primitives so you
can<00:00:21.180> select<00:00:21.390> different<00:00:21.840> printers<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:22.769> cubes

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
can select different printers like cubes

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.400 
can select different printers like cubes
cone<00:00:24.060> slender<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.160> just<00:00:26.160> tricking<00:00:26.760> cube<00:00:27.420> so

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
cone slender and just tricking cube so

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.529 
cone slender and just tricking cube so
now<00:00:28.529> with<00:00:28.680> cube<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> few<00:00:30.240> ports

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
now with cube for the few ports

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.410 
now with cube for the few ports
management<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.560> movement<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.300> hear<00:00:33.300> you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
management and movement you can hear you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.000 
management and movement you can hear you
can<00:00:33.660> move<00:00:33.870> around<00:00:34.340> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.550> zoom<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.090> zoom<00:00:36.510> out

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
can move around you can zoom in zoom out

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.700 
can move around you can zoom in zoom out
you<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.640> rotate<00:00:39.559> you<00:00:40.559> began<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.390> last

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
you can just rotate you began the last

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.220 
you can just rotate you began the last
button<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.760> change<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.450> few<00:00:45.750> pots<00:00:45.960> into

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
button you can change the few pots into

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.029 
button you can change the few pots into
the<00:00:46.320> 344<00:00:47.219> viewport<00:00:47.820> stock<00:00:48.120> from<00:00:48.510> Android

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
the 344 viewport stock from Android

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.060 
the 344 viewport stock from Android
perspective<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.640> also<00:00:50.789> change<00:00:51.090> them<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.780> in

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.900 

cameras<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.370> camera<00:00:57.980> we<00:00:58.980> are<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.309> leaving

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
cameras and camera we are just leaving

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.340 
cameras and camera we are just leaving
it<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.420> now<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:01.109> their<00:01:01.670> perspective<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.120> put

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
it like now in their perspective you put

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.789 
it like now in their perspective you put
so<00:01:04.350> here's<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.339> cube<00:01:05.610> selected<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.560> we

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
so here's the cube selected so here we

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.920 
so here's the cube selected so here we
see<00:01:08.100> although<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.729> properties<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.720> queue

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
see although the properties of the queue

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.380 
see although the properties of the queue
we<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.130> make<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.460> taller<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:11.939> example<00:01:12.360> here

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
we can make it taller for example here

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.940 
we can make it taller for example here
much<00:01:15.390> taller<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.869> before<00:01:16.500> or<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:18.950> give

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
much taller and before or we can give

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.630 
much taller and before or we can give
you<00:01:20.070> more<00:01:20.100> sickness<00:01:21.229> yes<00:01:22.229> three<00:01:22.770> segments<00:01:23.220> so

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
you more sickness yes three segments so

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.590 
you more sickness yes three segments so
we<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:23.909> more<00:01:24.119> points<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.570> edit<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:26.600> simply

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
we have more points to edit and simply

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.670 
we have more points to edit and simply
move<00:01:28.020> my<00:01:28.170> folks<00:01:28.439> here<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.280> select<00:01:29.700> them

other side no you can lose them both and

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.940 
other side no you can lose them both and
you<00:02:34.350> also<00:02:34.740> can<00:02:35.220> go<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.910> polygon<00:02:36.510> board<00:02:37.290> you

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
you also can go to the polygon board you

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.699 
you also can go to the polygon board you
can<00:02:38.160> still<00:02:38.459> hold<00:02:38.700> polygons<00:02:39.560> scare<00:02:40.560> the

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
can still hold polygons scare the

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:50.449 
can still hold polygons scare the
polygons<00:02:41.340> sake<00:02:41.760> balls<00:02:44.480> x<00:02:45.480> axis<00:02:47.330> y<00:02:48.330> axis<00:02:49.459> and

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
polygons sake balls x axis y axis and

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.210 
polygons sake balls x axis y axis and
you<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.239> also<00:02:51.390> rotate<00:02:51.630> them<00:02:51.959> here<00:02:53.959> so<00:02:55.070> so<00:02:56.070> we

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
you can also rotate them here so so we
