00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 and they see that many people who have 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.510
 respect towards the dead do not respect 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.510
 the living 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.799
 all right 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.650
 and here 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.059
 finished the drawing of the cup of 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.160
 world I think this world is going to be 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.020
 Argentine cold to us we touched the 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.340
 group of death 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.200
 since I do not have a cable, I will be able to see 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.779
 only the Argentine parties that 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.760
 played to play against countries not very 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.710
 globalists that we say I hope you 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.330
 can make a good match even though I 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.070
 I wanted us to be in the group of the 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.510
 death for me I think that the group of 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.949
 death is this 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.899
 On the one hand, we lost a dog that 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.579
 he spoke rarely died because I saw them 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.489
 their cars since when chuck took off 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.079
 norris a tremendous pineapple kept alive what 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.909
 what happens has an explanation is that what 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.070
 floor the car should paul walker was a 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.219
 great racer found the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.079
 deceased deceased dead corpse 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.570
 his death caused commotion in his 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.760
 close people who knew him and 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.739
 also in his fans here we are with one 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.619

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.720
 and how are you leading this 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.400

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.300

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.970
 raul walker stole what you're going to do 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:32.100
 real more than in our sea area 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.100
 that I knew all his subjects and his subjects 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.490
 the muscular skinned suddenly all are 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.710
 fans of a famous by the other end 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.070
 many people say that people are dying 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.049
 every day and even the gunpowder friend who 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.219
 they think he was driving and nobody cries 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.600
 it and good the truth is that those 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.189
 people we did not know them or us 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.899
 we love or anything after you 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.610

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.310
 family but to the people who 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.380
 we knew that we always saw her 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.819

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.740

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:06.219

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.840

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.080
 and it looked very ugly maybe to death 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.820
 burned sometimes death can 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.550
 become quick and furious talking 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.800

 relatives was also in the family of 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.780
 nelson mandela after having passed 28 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.000
 years of jail and he was now induced his 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.070
 family and specifically his daughters are 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.810
 they discussed among themselves to see who 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.880
 they were left with their furniture also for 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.740
 another side the grandson and the clan of the 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.240
 family mandela has its differences 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.940
 with the rest because he wants to take the 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.100
 body of Nelson Mandela to bury him at 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.520
 hotel where he is building for 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.829
 attract tourism and earn more money 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.959
 unfortunate while South Africa 1.094 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.240
 he was democratically elected president 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.190
 here in argentina was also elected 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.600
 another president who starts with m what 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.490
 he did it in five years as 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.320
 presidents there the other stole it and 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.210
 destroyed in ten years in a country with 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.370
 greater resources and equality than for 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.370
 cry and just said it mandela 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.260
 I hope we can leave a clue 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.720
 a marks a step forward in the 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.140
 world and remember us as an example to 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.110
 follow 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.320

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.320
