 you do not have a date you must be in 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:48.000

 so you can go to morocco, but I do not 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.810

 this club of tobi 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.130
 because they cut me like that because I get because 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.350
 they erase the dates because we 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.780
 we have contemplated that you are not going to 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.179
 to qualify is that I have contemplated 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.489

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.079

 enjoy a rating very well 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:22.750
 referees 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.270
 I do not want this to qualify 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.750
 and fixed the story 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.450
 anyone who opposes the laws 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.180
 elementals of the geniuses of the 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.030
 Mexican soccer federation they do 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.490
 of the lives of people who are 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.650
 under his management an authentic use as 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.540
 what are you doing with vucetich what 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.880
 are doing with vucetich is a 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.490
 rogue 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:58.420
 It's a bastard and all for money 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.080
 everything is money we lose 67 million 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.020
 everything is money 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.140
 everything is going against our 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.050
 religious principles of the doctrine of 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.810
 Christ of all everything for money 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:16.330
 money we can split the soul to the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.070
 life of any person 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.290
 I do not see a manager who has 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.879
 resigned 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.439
 I do not see a manager who has 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.439
 resigned because he did things wrong 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.040
 has are the four sides vucetich 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.560
 when the match ends they appear in 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:41.330
 all sports channels one 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:45.320
 number of coaches without work 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:48.230
 that they go like rabid dogs over 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.150
 a victim who is injured and takes out 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.640
 everyone his argument that his 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.760
 arguments are not better than those of 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.360
 any professional writer one side 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.360
 trelles 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.360
 um 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:10.870
 faitelson faitelson are chroniclers 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.810
 professionals but I do not realize that 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.850
 I will say that the coaches do not know more 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.000
 that professional chroniclers do not 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.360
 speak better speak with the stomach 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.450
 because they do not have work if they were so 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.160
 good they would have a job because they would not 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.070
 they invite the tuca because the tuca has to 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.370
 work with tigers like they do not have 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.470
 work they want work and as in the 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.960
 television you are watching some 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.260
 naive managers who say hey what 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.240
 well talk about this truth brings that what 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.449
 treat it and skewer 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:51.520
 because the volpe has no work 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.520
 because you take boy do not have work 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:00.900
 things in life and those that do not have 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.900
 work are the ones that scream the most 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.070
 that few nuts two would ride can not 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.280

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.960

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:24.270
