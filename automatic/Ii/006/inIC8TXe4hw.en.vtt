00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hello everyone, you are welcome to 

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.120
 2015 sake tests and you read 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.920
 has extracted a video for you to see or 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.900
 that you can compare the operation of 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.509
 the representatives in the game and in the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.239
 ps database page good to start 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.460
 we are going to choose 33 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:20.869
 representatives for example link and this 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.730
 under 24 years old we are also going to choose 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.070
 representative league other europe as 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.830
 you will see the motivation and a third 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.250
 that will be strength pass pumped the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.830
 goal is to get a player you go to 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.110
 see how I give to start negotiations 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.120
 we have the player and then we go in the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.920
 base stone page we are going to put the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.100
 same representatives we are going to give to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.440
 like and that player has to go out in 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.870
 the list is going to be done several times 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.870
 so you can see a little bit of 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.969
 we have to check at least for 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.739
 that we verify that the combinations 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.309
 what we do there makes sense 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.230
 that we are not going to put these 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.159
 combinations and we will get it right 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.650
 if you want to be the day 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.570
 a player from South America 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.570
 he is the first player that comes out that 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:20.250
 wichmann 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:23.880
 67 rating experience a little yes 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.070
 but there are three cotton lists to you from 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.140
 funcas cal guilherme 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.910
 good players we do not have to go 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.500
 So ale 31 players have to go a 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.280
 little bit lower and it's much more 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.290
 serious than 32 players and I've had bad 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.080
 lucky because there are 31 points of view the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.750
 combination already selected so that 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.520
 there is no doubt 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.520
 in four years 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.800
 level 66 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.560
 I believe that seven good player let's see 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.280
 which representatives we choose for this 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:13.220
 player links other latin america to 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:18.370
 start position four characteristics 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.810
 and we also choose right good leg 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.810
 who does not come out 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.670
 but what I can use at least in 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.490
 the second team would be very very 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.200
 would be positive would be very positive going 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.709
 Let's see 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.709
 it's a plate 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.060
 I know you, Tucker 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.810
 74 Argentine caracas fc on the page 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.819
 base 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.850
 we have to go good you are going to see 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.570
 first the selected ones 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.570
 before 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.819
 we can go to the pages and number 3 633 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.640
 players is good 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.719
 that has gone quite well the thing is 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.239
 that's hot 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:11.200
 caracas the Argentine club 74 of 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:14.010
 valuation so as you see at the moment 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.010
 the theme works 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.810
 let's see with him 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.709
 to see maybe we can no longer do what 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.709
 I liked it 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.600
 but it seemed a lot to me 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.540
 although we all want to have a 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.150
 Super team 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.709
 with these people you really do not enjoy it 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.360
 or you can not enjoy it because you do not 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.360
 You go between quotes won 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.970
 if you do not make it easy for a game to 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.640
 final you gut it and stop wanting 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.040
 to play the beauty of a game is that 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.870
 show things just like in life 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.319
 when something costs you then you enjoy it 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.680
 do you live 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:01.189
 let's see who gets us here with the 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.760
 silver does not give us a black Ã¡lex 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.709
 lopez 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.189
 this combination of representatives say 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.189
 Spanish 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.460
 midfielder position 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.520
 Mr 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.810
 72 I remember correctly there are 20 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.670
 representatives cell position and the 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.850
 Spanish as a tare and pp was a 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.710
 little bit by isco and right-handed 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.010
 modric any of those that came out 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.120
 but good , it came out 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.120
 Mr. Alex Lopez 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.770
 enemies google game is also 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.660
 pretty good 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.430
 happy pleased I was happy because 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.310
 they are good players even for him 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.200
 ah 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:50.510
 the team of substitutes of this speed 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:55.850
 also the rudder of strength power 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:59.820
 of shooting and player between 25 and 29 years and 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:02.740
 goes a little bit thinking about the players 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.830
 as messi not the powerful powers do not 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.350
 trying a flute and while you 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.710
 I show the subject of the representatives 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.290
 Well , we take it to someone 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.030
 interesting good let's let's try 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.380
 we are going to give you to start negotiations to 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.380
 see what we get 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.230
 sometimes complicated has to be 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.190
 complicated and difficult you have to play 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.190
 many times now 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.610
 everyone would touch the right ones 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.610
 and neither is that 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.240
 and good 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.150
 73 Argentines 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.889
 very fast but it might be fast 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.889
 and do not have much acceleration 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:58.780
 the combination of shooting and speed 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:02.610
 well with this we have that page 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.610
 5 and almost at the end 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:16.630
 certainly the same players so 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.129
 the next player and finally I 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.129
 I think we showed 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:28.649
 quite effectively that you can 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:34.669
 use the web pages the combination 

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:34.669
 that the American 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.060
 I'm the one 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.330
 so anyone can leave and what of 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.580
 the people 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.789
 we offer 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.840
 to give it to start without first seeing first 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:51.449
 the 3rd 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.889
 on the far right we're going to give 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:55.260
 start negotiations to see which player 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:58.770
 it comes out and as I say it already with this a 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.389
 little if the player matches 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.780
 We know we can use the page 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:02.780
 web no 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.870
 or before using it 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.940
 leave how many players are there in that 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.260
 position and if it does not come out profitable for its 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:16.360
 weapons 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:18.160
 with level 72 of Brazilian standard 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.160
 of lieja 21 years old 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.510
 you can see then he is a good player for 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.880
 me and moderately good because he can 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.450
 use in the team comes quite 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.300
 all right 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:32.080
 spent a lot of players are rotating 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:35.020
 too much I'm selling the best and luis 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.000
 Suarez you see interesting players 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.460
 up there that could have come out and 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.780
 you see the combination of nationality 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.680
 American region dexterity attack and 

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:48.040
 right disposition extreme right good 

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.840
 we have to go to page 2 and 

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.600
 we have arauco 

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.220
 there is the standard of the Brazilian axis 21 

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.600
 years of age 72 

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.990
 I think it was more or less proven 

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.460
 that you have seen that the subject works already 

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.560
 we know we do not have them for 

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.030
 one hundred in the 32 percent 

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.310
 the possibility of getting a player 

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.200
 making a smart combination that 

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.700
 It's a lot more fun as I said 

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.980
 before we will enjoy much more in 

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.050
 team they do not go out and it's going to be everything 

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.180
 very much better in the end I hope this 

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:20.440
 has helped you and see you in the 

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.440
 next example see you later
