 ties that plotted occultly fall on them 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.899
 to their own ruin and my soul

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.959
 with you resembles two books 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.319

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.820
 he the wretched and the needy of his 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.070
 supporters 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.650
 rise Nicolas witnesses and 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.950
 diving things I do not know 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.870
 they pay a thousand evil for good, which is desolation 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.170
 to my soul 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:56.010
 but me being sick 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.950
 I was in my clothes 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.430

 prayer repulsed me on my chest for 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.720
 It was as if they were friends and 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.270
 my brothers walked bent over in mourning as 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.540
 who cries for your mother 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.730
 But when I stumbled, they rejoiced and 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:23.310
 they will gather together against me 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:27.690
 the objects that I did not know about her 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:32.910
 I will be relentless as was vizta 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:36.450
 feasts creaked against me teeth to 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.930
 When you get silenced, free 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.990

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.280

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.920
 What they say is the opposite. 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.840
 deceptions against the peaceful of the earth 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.040
 opened against my mouth and say 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.730

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.730
 own eyes 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:23.230

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.710

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:32.540

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:36.060

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.670
 Judge me, Lord God, my second. 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.319

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.660
 do not let them rejoice against me 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:48.950

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.750

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.549
 Say hello 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.430

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:02.930
 covered with vexation those who rejoice with 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.360
 My evil will cover you if you ignore the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.689
 who magnify themselves against me 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.909
 sing of joy and rejoice those who have 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:16.699
 pleasure in my righteousness and always say 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:20.030
 glorified be the lord who delights 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:22.699

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.889
 tongue to celebrate your righteousness and your 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.889
 praise every day
