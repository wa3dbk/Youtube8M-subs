I am back and today I have a tutorial on
another<00:00:05.279> portal<00:00:05.759> farm<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.210> basically

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
another portal farm that basically

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.200 
another portal farm that basically
spawns<00:00:06.960> Pigman<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:08.340> Pigman<00:00:08.760> come<00:00:09.030> in

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
spawns Pigman and the Pigman come in

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.060 
spawns Pigman and the Pigman come in
here<00:00:09.450> they<00:00:09.750> drown<00:00:10.170> like<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.650> because<00:00:10.950> they

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
here they drown like this because they

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.129 
here they drown like this because they
don't<00:00:11.250> know<00:00:11.370> how<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.580> swim<00:00:11.700> right<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.300> then

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
don't know how to swim right and then

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.440 
don't know how to swim right and then
they<00:00:13.259> give<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.559> your<00:00:13.710> gold<00:00:13.950> nuggets<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.880> let's

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
they give you your gold nuggets so let's

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.970 
they give you your gold nuggets so let's
get<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> tutorial<00:00:16.199> it's<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> pretty<00:00:16.650> simple

tutorial 23 by 23 nether portals with a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.200 
tutorial 23 by 23 nether portals with a
couple<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.859> water<00:00:20.039> currents<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.550> between<00:00:20.880> I

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
couple of water currents in between I

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.939 
couple of water currents in between I
will<00:00:21.720> show<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.930> step-by-step<00:00:22.230> how<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.859> it

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
will show you step-by-step how to do it

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.189 
will show you step-by-step how to do it
see<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.310> there's<00:00:23.519> some<00:00:23.779> Pigman<00:00:24.779> right<00:00:24.990> there

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
see if there's some Pigman right there

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.599 
see if there's some Pigman right there
so<00:00:25.590> let's<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:26.130> started

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
so let's get started

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.060 
so let's get started
alright<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.330> from<00:00:27.720> aside<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> materials<00:00:28.949> you

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
alright so from aside the materials you

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.200 
alright so from aside the materials you
might<00:00:29.279> need<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.640> make<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.910> look<00:00:30.060> beautiful

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
might need to make it look beautiful

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.080 
might need to make it look beautiful
like<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.869> my<00:00:31.189> intro<00:00:32.189> video<00:00:32.309> there<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.969> on

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
like in my intro video there that is on

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.760 
like in my intro video there that is on
a<00:00:33.120> personal<00:00:33.600> world<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.870> plan<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.380> couple

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
a personal world I plan with a couple

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.420 
a personal world I plan with a couple
other<00:00:34.890> friends<00:00:35.329> there<00:00:36.329> are<00:00:36.540> some<00:00:36.780> very<00:00:37.260> very

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
other friends there are some very very

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.950 
other friends there are some very very
very<00:00:38.430> simple<00:00:38.969> materials<00:00:39.450> needed<00:00:39.780> just

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
very simple materials needed just

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.330 
very simple materials needed just
obsidian<00:00:40.620> you're<00:00:40.739> going<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> need<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.070> lot<00:00:41.309> of

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
obsidian you're going to need a lot of

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.680 
obsidian you're going to need a lot of
it<00:00:41.550> unfortunately<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.329> better<00:00:42.480> get<00:00:42.660> that

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
it unfortunately so you better get that

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.950 
it unfortunately so you better get that
efficiency<00:00:43.379> 5<00:00:44.309> efficiency<00:00:45.210> 5<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.600> your<00:00:45.719> picks

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
efficiency 5 efficiency 5 on your picks

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.510 
efficiency 5 efficiency 5 on your picks
get<00:00:46.260> all<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.500> good<00:00:46.649> stuff<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.070> need<00:00:47.280> water

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
get all that good stuff you need water

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.340 
get all that good stuff you need water
buckets<00:00:48.090> probably<00:00:48.480> at<00:00:48.570> least<00:00:48.660> two<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.110> make<00:00:49.230> an

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
buckets probably at least two to make an

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.200 
buckets probably at least two to make an
infinite<00:00:49.530> source<00:00:49.890> flint<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.399> steel<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.879> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
infinite source flint and steel and a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.600 
infinite source flint and steel and a
sign<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.379> would<00:00:52.770> start<00:00:52.890> out<00:00:53.039> by<00:00:53.219> measuring

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
sign so I would start out by measuring

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.520 
sign so I would start out by measuring
your<00:00:53.699> 23<00:00:54.210> by<00:00:54.329> 23<00:00:54.390> portals<00:00:55.170> start<00:00:55.379> off<00:00:55.440> with

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
your 23 by 23 portals start off with

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.720 
your 23 by 23 portals start off with
measuring<00:00:55.829> 1<00:00:56.039> 2<00:00:56.430> 3<00:00:56.730> 4<00:00:57.120> 5<00:00:57.390> 6<00:00:57.750> 7<00:00:58.020> 8<00:00:58.350> 9<00:00:58.649> 10<00:00:58.980> 11<00:00:59.190> 12<00:00:59.460> 13

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
measuring 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.119 
measuring 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
14<00:01:00.210> 15<00:01:00.510> 16<00:01:00.840> 17<00:01:01.079> 18<00:01:01.590> 19<00:01:01.949> 20<00:01:02.899> 21<00:01:03.899> 22<00:01:04.320> 23

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.109 
14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
so<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.729> 23<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.540> then<00:01:06.720> go<00:01:06.869> up<00:01:07.020> 23<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.799> 2<00:01:07.860> 3<00:01:08.700> 4

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
so that is 23 and then go up 23 so 2 3 4

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.010 
so that is 23 and then go up 23 so 2 3 4
5<00:01:09.510> 6<00:01:10.110> 7<00:01:10.500> 8<00:01:10.830> 9<00:01:11.400> 10<00:01:11.909> 11<00:01:12.240> 12<00:01:12.689> 13<00:01:13.170> 14<00:01:13.560> 15<00:01:14.189> 16<00:01:14.670> 17<00:01:14.909> 18<00:01:15.509> 19

5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.179 
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20<00:01:16.290> 21<00:01:16.710> 22<00:01:17.130> 23<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.470> then<00:01:19.470> just<00:01:19.770> kind<00:01:20.040> of

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
20 21 22 23 and then just kind of

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.920 
20 21 22 23 and then just kind of
connecting<00:01:20.880> them<00:01:21.000> together<00:01:21.150> which<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
connecting them together which is the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.840 
connecting them together which is the
easiest<00:01:22.560> part<00:01:22.860> because<00:01:23.220> no<00:01:23.250> counting

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
easiest part because no counting

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.499 
easiest part because no counting
required<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:25.170> yay<00:01:25.530> no<00:01:25.950> counting<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
required so yay no counting and this I

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.630 
required so yay no counting and this I
like<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.380> farm<00:01:28.650> design<00:01:28.950> because<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.400> very

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
like this farm design because it's very

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.490 
like this farm design because it's very
expandable<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.479> more<00:01:30.659> obsidian<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.170> get<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
expandable the more obsidian you get the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
expandable the more obsidian you get the
easier<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.009> expand<00:01:32.549> because<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.939> can

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
easier it is to expand because you can

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.210 
easier it is to expand because you can
just<00:01:33.240> make<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.540> longer<00:01:33.810> or<00:01:34.470> taller<00:01:34.770> however

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
just make it longer or taller however

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.490 
just make it longer or taller however
you<00:01:35.280> prefer<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.320> light

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
you prefer to do it and you just light

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.550 
you prefer to do it and you just light
your<00:01:37.650> portal<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.409> that<00:01:40.409> will

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
your portal like this and that will

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.649 
your portal like this and that will
start<00:01:40.770> spawning<00:01:40.950> Pigman<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:41.700> let's<00:01:42.090> not<00:01:42.390> do

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
start spawning Pigman but let's not do

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.539 
start spawning Pigman but let's not do
that<00:01:42.869> right<00:01:43.079> now<00:01:43.110> let's<00:01:43.740> go<00:01:43.950> ahead<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.399> just

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
that right now let's go ahead and just

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.740 
that right now let's go ahead and just
build<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> other<00:01:44.970> ones<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.479> will<00:01:45.600> come

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
build the other ones and I will come

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.149 
build the other ones and I will come
right<00:01:45.869> back<00:01:45.930> when<00:01:46.560> you're<00:01:46.680> building<00:01:47.040> them

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
right back when you're building them

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.920 
right back when you're building them
make<00:01:47.850> sure<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.119> build<00:01:48.299> them<00:01:48.479> side<00:01:48.720> by<00:01:48.750> side

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
make sure you build them side by side

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.410 
make sure you build them side by side
like<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.000> we're<00:01:51.000> probably<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.360> gonna

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
like this so we're probably just gonna

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.080 
like this so we're probably just gonna
do<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> four<00:01:52.200> here<00:01:52.560> yeah<00:01:52.799> let's<00:01:52.950> go<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.670> I

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
do a four here yeah let's go for and I

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.969 
do a four here yeah let's go for and I
will<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.479> build<00:01:54.689> them<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.680> course

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
will just build them like this of course

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.249 
will just build them like this of course
you<00:01:56.219> know<00:01:56.340> connecting<00:01:57.270> them<00:01:57.420> all<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.780> these

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
you know connecting them all and these

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.370 
you know connecting them all and these
just<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.890> be<00:01:59.040> very<00:01:59.780> close<00:02:00.780> with<00:02:00.810> one

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
just have to be very close with one

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.200 
just have to be very close with one
block<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.860> between<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.729> water<00:02:02.939> can

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
block in between so that the water can

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.149 
block in between so that the water can
flow<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.479> between<00:02:03.659> them<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.259> whatnot<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.740> yeah

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
flow in between them and whatnot so yeah

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.380 
flow in between them and whatnot so yeah
let<00:02:05.369> me<00:02:05.430> build<00:02:05.610> those<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.000> come<00:02:06.119> right<00:02:06.240> back

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
let me build those and come right back

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.059 
let me build those and come right back
and<00:02:06.750> there<00:02:07.649> we<00:02:07.770> go

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
and there we go

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.240 
and there we go
there<00:02:08.310> are<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> four<00:02:09.000> nether<00:02:09.509> portals<00:02:09.989> uh<00:02:10.250> of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
there are the four nether portals uh of

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.800 
there are the four nether portals uh of
course<00:02:11.459> they<00:02:11.700> haven't<00:02:11.910> been<00:02:12.000> lit<00:02:12.239> yet<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.690> we

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
course they haven't been lit yet so we

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.390 
course they haven't been lit yet so we
need<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.050> do<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.290> water<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.220> would

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
need to do the water so I would

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.490 
need to do the water so I would
recommend<00:02:14.550> just<00:02:14.970> kind<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.300> digging<00:02:15.690> down<00:02:15.930> one

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
recommend just kind of digging down one

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.380 
recommend just kind of digging down one
all<00:02:16.800> around<00:02:17.099> them<00:02:17.459> because<00:02:17.790> if<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.000> don't<00:02:18.120> dig

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
all around them because if you don't dig

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.820 
all around them because if you don't dig
down<00:02:18.540> one<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.989> water<00:02:19.110> currents<00:02:19.620> will<00:02:19.739> get

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
down one the water currents will get

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.790 
down one the water currents will get
kind<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.069> wonky<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:21.110> yeah<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.410> go<00:02:22.530> ahead<00:02:22.560> and

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
kind of wonky and yeah just go ahead and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.040 
kind of wonky and yeah just go ahead and
dig<00:02:22.950> down<00:02:23.099> one<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.550> between<00:02:23.760> them<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:24.239> it's

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
dig down one in between them it's it's

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.300 
dig down one in between them it's it's
not<00:02:25.470> not<00:02:25.890> hard<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:27.300> know<00:02:27.420> also<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.739> reason<00:02:29.250> I

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
not not hard you know also the reason I

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.740 
not not hard you know also the reason I
like<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.520> design<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.180> can<00:02:30.300> literally<00:02:30.540> do

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
like this design is you can literally do

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.180 
like this design is you can literally do
it<00:02:30.810> anywhere<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:31.349> do<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.680> sky<00:02:31.920> and

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
it anywhere you can do it on the sky and

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.250 
it anywhere you can do it on the sky and
the<00:02:32.250> ground<00:02:32.510> underground<00:02:33.510> it's<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.050> same

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
the ground underground it's the same

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.220 
the ground underground it's the same
thing<00:02:34.910> not<00:02:35.910> underground<00:02:36.599> like<00:02:36.870> I'm<00:02:37.019> doing

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
thing not underground like I'm doing

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.470 
thing not underground like I'm doing
here<00:02:37.440> just<00:02:37.620> kind<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.830> above<00:02:38.160> ground<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.760> mean

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
here just kind of above ground I mean

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.330 
here just kind of above ground I mean
it's<00:02:39.660> just<00:02:39.720> pretty<00:02:40.019> versatile<00:02:40.709> design<00:02:40.950> and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
it's just pretty versatile design and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.160 
it's just pretty versatile design and
that's<00:02:41.489> why<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:42.030> showed<00:02:42.599> you<00:02:42.720> guys<00:02:42.780> how<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.019> do

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
that's why I showed you guys how to do

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.680 
that's why I showed you guys how to do
this<00:02:43.319> one<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.709> let<00:02:43.890> me<00:02:44.040> go<00:02:44.190> ahead<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.519> just<00:02:44.700> dig

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
this one so let me go ahead and just dig

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.210 
this one so let me go ahead and just dig
out<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.080> rest<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.470> these<00:02:46.560> here<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.010> oh<00:02:47.099> it's

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
out the rest of these here and oh it's

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.220 
out the rest of these here and oh it's
pretty<00:02:47.430> boring<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.269> watch<00:02:48.300> but<00:02:48.690> it's<00:02:49.080> pretty

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
pretty boring to watch but it's pretty

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.770 
pretty boring to watch but it's pretty
simple<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:50.550> there<00:02:51.480> we<00:02:51.599> go

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
simple so there we go

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.509 
simple so there we go
here<00:02:52.050> my<00:02:52.170> mouse<00:02:52.379> clicking<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.400> go<00:02:53.459> ahead

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
here my mouse clicking so you go ahead

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.540 
here my mouse clicking so you go ahead
and<00:02:53.670> add<00:02:53.730> your<00:02:53.760> water<00:02:54.300> right<00:02:54.629> here<00:02:55.519> make<00:02:56.519> sure

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
and add your water right here make sure

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.920 
and add your water right here make sure
it<00:02:56.760> doesn't<00:02:57.000> go<00:02:57.090> one<00:02:57.269> back<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.510> can<00:02:57.810> add<00:02:57.900> a

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
it doesn't go one back you can add a

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.899 
it doesn't go one back you can add a
wall<00:02:58.230> around<00:02:58.409> it<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.830> now<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.610> probably

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
wall around it and now you probably

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.190 
wall around it and now you probably
wondering<00:03:00.150> with<00:03:00.300> waters<00:03:00.599> and<00:03:00.810> go<00:03:00.900> far<00:03:01.110> enough

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
wondering with waters and go far enough

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.100 
wondering with waters and go far enough
so<00:03:01.590> this<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.069> where<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.340> signs<00:03:02.640> come<00:03:02.970> in<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.390> go

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
so this is where the signs come in so go

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.170 
so this is where the signs come in so go
ahead<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.260> place<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.530> sign<00:03:04.860> here<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.459> assign

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
ahead and place a sign here and assign

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.490 
ahead and place a sign here and assign
here<00:03:06.480> kind<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.750> making<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:07.019> pattern<00:03:07.319> like<00:03:07.440> that

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
here kind of making a pattern like that

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.050 
here kind of making a pattern like that
and<00:03:07.800> place<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.099> water<00:03:08.340> up<00:03:08.610> here<00:03:08.640> and

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
and place the water up here and

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.000 
and place the water up here and
basically<00:03:09.629> it<00:03:09.810> makes<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.080> continuous<00:03:10.680> stream

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
basically it makes a continuous stream

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.979 
basically it makes a continuous stream
so<00:03:11.459> see<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:11.879> it's<00:03:12.420> kind<00:03:12.569> of<00:03:12.599> weird<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
so see this it's kind of weird of the

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.809 
so see this it's kind of weird of the
water<00:03:13.200> works<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:14.069> don't<00:03:14.220> even<00:03:14.340> have<00:03:14.489> to<00:03:14.610> move

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
water works you don't even have to move

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.000 
water works you don't even have to move
and<00:03:15.120> it'll<00:03:15.330> keep<00:03:15.480> pushing<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.530> that's<00:03:16.920> a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
and it'll keep pushing you so that's a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.910 
and it'll keep pushing you so that's a
little<00:03:17.129> continuous<00:03:17.819> water<00:03:18.030> stream<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.920> just

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
little continuous water stream and just

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.589 
little continuous water stream and just
keep<00:03:20.099> doing<00:03:20.129> those<00:03:20.610> as<00:03:20.940> long<00:03:21.180> as<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.450> need

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
keep doing those as long as you need

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.930 
keep doing those as long as you need
them<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.470> like<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.099> I'm<00:03:23.580> going<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.819> in

thingy around this whole thing so let me

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.170 
thingy around this whole thing so let me
go<00:03:56.040> ahead<00:03:56.099> and<00:03:56.189> do<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.670> come<00:03:56.819> back<00:03:56.939> it's

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
go ahead and do that and come back it's

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.280 
go ahead and do that and come back it's
not<00:03:57.360> hard<00:03:57.569> when<00:03:58.019> you're<00:03:58.140> building

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
not hard when you're building

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.960 
not hard when you're building
underground<00:03:58.650> of<00:03:59.040> course<00:03:59.250> this<00:03:59.519> will<00:03:59.730> be<00:03:59.849> you

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
underground of course this will be you

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.759 
underground of course this will be you
know<00:04:00.090> your<00:04:00.239> actual<00:04:00.480> wall<00:04:00.840> but<00:04:01.470> I'm<00:04:01.560> kind<00:04:01.739> of

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
know your actual wall but I'm kind of

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:02.990 
know your actual wall but I'm kind of
doing<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.010> above<00:04:02.280> ground<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:02.700> can<00:04:02.819> kind<00:04:02.970> of

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
doing it above ground so I can kind of

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.100 
doing it above ground so I can kind of
show<00:04:03.209> how<00:04:03.480> it<00:04:03.599> works

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
show how it works

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.690 
show how it works
so<00:04:04.530> let<00:04:04.680> me<00:04:04.739> do<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.310> will<00:04:05.370> come<00:04:05.549> right

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
so let me do that and I will come right

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.670 
so let me do that and I will come right
back<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.120> on<00:04:06.659> the<00:04:06.780> end<00:04:06.959> we're<00:04:07.230> all<00:04:07.319> the<00:04:07.470> water

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
back and on the end we're all the water

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.960 
back and on the end we're all the water
canals<00:04:08.040> end<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.370> make<00:04:08.489> sure<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.790> keep<00:04:08.909> that

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
canals end to make sure to keep that

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.030 
canals end to make sure to keep that
open<00:04:09.390> so<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:09.870> we<00:04:10.170> can<00:04:10.349> make<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.500> little<00:04:10.709> canal

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
open so that we can make a little canal

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.589 
open so that we can make a little canal
system<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.519> bring<00:04:11.730> them<00:04:11.849> all<00:04:11.909> to<00:04:12.060> one<00:04:12.180> point<00:04:12.450> to

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
system to bring them all to one point to

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.509 
system to bring them all to one point to
be<00:04:12.629> drowned<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.290> killed<00:04:13.560> so<00:04:13.980> let<00:04:14.129> me<00:04:14.189> do<00:04:14.310> that

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
be drowned and killed so let me do that

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.580 
be drowned and killed so let me do that
alright<00:04:15.390> so<00:04:15.569> now<00:04:15.689> that's<00:04:15.959> done<00:04:16.139> I'm<00:04:16.410> going<00:04:16.530> to

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
alright so now that's done I'm going to

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.020 
alright so now that's done I'm going to
go<00:04:16.680> ahead<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:16.949> just<00:04:17.070> dig<00:04:17.250> this<00:04:17.459> down<00:04:17.729> and

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
go ahead and just dig this down and

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.849 
go ahead and just dig this down and
again<00:04:18.269> these<00:04:18.540> will<00:04:18.750> connect<00:04:19.139> but<00:04:19.380> we<00:04:19.470> will<00:04:19.590> fix

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
again these will connect but we will fix

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.949 
again these will connect but we will fix
that<00:04:20.160> shortly<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:21.299> now<00:04:21.389> that<00:04:21.449> those<00:04:21.690> are<00:04:21.840> all

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
that shortly so now that those are all

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.210 
that shortly so now that those are all
connecting<00:04:22.410> go<00:04:22.500> ahead<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.710> place<00:04:22.860> a<00:04:22.889> sign<00:04:23.190> on

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
connecting go ahead and place a sign on

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.900 
connecting go ahead and place a sign on
the<00:04:23.430> end

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
the end

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.280 
the end
like<00:04:24.030> this<00:04:24.240> see<00:04:24.720> how<00:04:24.780> it'll<00:04:24.930> just<00:04:25.110> kind<00:04:25.200> of

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
like this see how it'll just kind of

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.120 
like this see how it'll just kind of
flow<00:04:25.530> into<00:04:25.800> itself<00:04:26.100> and<00:04:26.900> just<00:04:27.900> do<00:04:28.080> that<00:04:28.290> oh<00:04:28.530> no

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
flow into itself and just do that oh no

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.720 
flow into itself and just do that oh no
we<00:04:29.400> got<00:04:29.550> some<00:04:29.700> text<00:04:30.060> on<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.560> so<00:04:31.580> put<00:04:32.580> all<00:04:32.700> of

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
we got some text on it so put all of

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.700 
we got some text on it so put all of
those<00:04:32.940> on<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.330> ends<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:34.200> way<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.500> water

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
those on the ends that way the water

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.220 
those on the ends that way the water
just<00:04:35.040> kind<00:04:35.280> of<00:04:35.430> can't<00:04:36.120> do<00:04:36.300> it<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:36.540> wants<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.990> and

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
just kind of can't do it it wants to and

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.870 
just kind of can't do it it wants to and
now<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.410> water<00:04:37.740> will<00:04:38.010> kind<00:04:38.190> of<00:04:38.220> diffuse<00:04:38.610> and

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
now the water will kind of diffuse and

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.920 
now the water will kind of diffuse and
then<00:04:38.970> you<00:04:39.030> can<00:04:39.150> go<00:04:39.240> ahead<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.390> place<00:04:39.600> a<00:04:39.630> water

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
then you can go ahead and place a water

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.930 
then you can go ahead and place a water
bucket<00:04:40.170> here<00:04:40.470> if<00:04:40.980> it's<00:04:41.160> more<00:04:41.340> than<00:04:41.490> 8<00:04:41.640> long

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
bucket here if it's more than 8 long

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.700 
bucket here if it's more than 8 long
like<00:04:42.270> this<00:04:42.480> for<00:04:42.750> instance<00:04:42.780> then<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:43.440> can<00:04:43.590> just

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
like this for instance then you can just

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.660 
like this for instance then you can just
do<00:04:43.830> another<00:04:44.070> little<00:04:44.340> little<00:04:45.330> sign<00:04:45.540> trick

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
do another little little sign trick

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.690 
do another little little sign trick
actually<00:04:47.670> on<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.840> ends<00:04:49.230> here<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.590> becomes<00:04:50.520> a

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
actually on the ends here it becomes a

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.370 
actually on the ends here it becomes a
bit<00:04:50.820> more<00:04:50.880> complicated<00:04:51.330> I<00:04:51.660> wrote<00:04:51.990> or<00:04:52.110> I<00:04:52.140> would

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
bit more complicated I wrote or I would

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.550 
bit more complicated I wrote or I would
honestly<00:04:52.530> just<00:04:52.950> recommend<00:04:53.280> digging<00:04:53.460> down<00:04:53.790> and

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
honestly just recommend digging down and

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.440 
honestly just recommend digging down and
continuing<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.680> it's<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.250> same<00:04:56.430> thing<00:04:56.670> so<00:04:57.330> now

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
continuing it it's the same thing so now

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.630 
continuing it it's the same thing so now
it's<00:04:57.660> basically<00:04:58.080> up<00:04:58.320> to<00:04:58.530> you<00:04:58.710> where<00:04:59.190> they<00:04:59.430> go

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
it's basically up to you where they go

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.610 
it's basically up to you where they go
you<00:04:59.970> can<00:05:00.120> set<00:05:00.360> it<00:05:00.480> to<00:05:00.510> hard<00:05:00.840> mines<00:05:01.140> on<00:05:01.320> piece

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
you can set it to hard mines on piece

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.510 
you can set it to hard mines on piece
right<00:05:01.860> now<00:05:02.040> I<00:05:02.070> didn't<00:05:02.250> want<00:05:02.370> anything

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
right now I didn't want anything

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.000 
right now I didn't want anything
spawning<00:05:02.940> oh<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:04.410> of<00:05:04.500> course<00:05:04.560> you<00:05:04.770> want<00:05:04.920> to

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
spawning oh and of course you want to

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.560 
spawning oh and of course you want to
light<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.310> portals<00:05:05.700> yeah<00:05:06.000> don't<00:05:06.300> forget

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
light the portals yeah don't forget

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.240 
light the portals yeah don't forget
about<00:05:06.600> that<00:05:06.960> that<00:05:07.620> is<00:05:07.770> probably<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.160> most

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
about that that is probably the most

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.610 
about that that is probably the most
important<00:05:08.790> thing<00:05:09.000> because<00:05:09.210> they<00:05:09.540> each<00:05:10.140> little

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
important thing because they each little

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.960 
important thing because they each little
portal<00:05:10.920> blocks<00:05:11.040> as<00:05:11.220> a<00:05:11.250> chance<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:11.700> spawn<00:05:11.910> a

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
portal blocks as a chance to spawn a

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.790 
portal blocks as a chance to spawn a
Pigman<00:05:12.450> we<00:05:12.840> should<00:05:13.020> see<00:05:13.170> some<00:05:13.320> pigment<00:05:13.680> here

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
Pigman we should see some pigment here

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.770 
Pigman we should see some pigment here
in<00:05:13.890> a<00:05:13.950> second<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.490> we'll<00:05:15.000> know<00:05:15.150> they<00:05:15.360> will<00:05:15.540> all

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
in a second and we'll know they will all

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.660 
in a second and we'll know they will all
conglomerate<00:05:16.560> into<00:05:16.860> this<00:05:17.010> one<00:05:17.250> little<00:05:17.490> point

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
conglomerate into this one little point

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.980 
conglomerate into this one little point
right<00:05:17.910> here<00:05:18.150> so<00:05:18.330> let's<00:05:18.480> go<00:05:18.570> ahead<00:05:18.630> and<00:05:18.750> place<00:05:18.960> a

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
right here so let's go ahead and place a

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.530 
right here so let's go ahead and place a
sign<00:05:19.320> here<00:05:19.740> they<00:05:20.400> will<00:05:20.550> just<00:05:20.700> kind<00:05:20.910> of<00:05:21.000> they'll

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
sign here they will just kind of they'll

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.710 
sign here they will just kind of they'll
come<00:05:22.200> right<00:05:22.320> here<00:05:22.530> I<00:05:22.740> guess<00:05:23.040> we'll<00:05:23.880> see<00:05:24.090> see

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
come right here I guess we'll see see

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.660 
come right here I guess we'll see see
there<00:05:24.960> is<00:05:25.110> a<00:05:25.140> Pigman<00:05:25.560> right<00:05:25.740> there<00:05:25.980> so<00:05:26.280> he<00:05:26.460> fell

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
there is a Pigman right there so he fell

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.370 
there is a Pigman right there so he fell
in<00:05:26.790> the<00:05:26.880> water<00:05:27.030> stream<00:05:27.510> he's<00:05:27.720> not<00:05:27.930> having<00:05:28.110> a

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
in the water stream he's not having a

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.640 
in the water stream he's not having a
great<00:05:29.130> time<00:05:29.720> he's<00:05:30.720> just<00:05:30.780> kind<00:05:31.140> of<00:05:31.290> chilling

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
great time he's just kind of chilling

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.580 
great time he's just kind of chilling
out<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:32.690> eventually<00:05:33.690> he<00:05:33.870> will<00:05:33.990> make<00:05:34.200> his<00:05:34.410> way

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
out and eventually he will make his way

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.400 
out and eventually he will make his way
down<00:05:34.950> to<00:05:35.220> here<00:05:35.640> and<00:05:35.790> land<00:05:36.630> in<00:05:36.810> here<00:05:36.960> so<00:05:37.140> let<00:05:37.380> me

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
down to here and land in here so let me

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.870 
down to here and land in here so let me
wait<00:05:37.620> a<00:05:37.650> little<00:05:37.830> bit<00:05:37.980> and<00:05:38.040> get<00:05:38.280> it<00:05:38.310> functioning

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
wait a little bit and get it functioning

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.430 
wait a little bit and get it functioning
and<00:05:39.000> then<00:05:39.090> I<00:05:39.210> will<00:05:39.390> just<00:05:39.510> kind<00:05:39.660> of<00:05:39.720> show<00:05:39.960> you<00:05:39.990> a

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
and then I will just kind of show you a

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.490 
and then I will just kind of show you a
little<00:05:41.130> bit<00:05:41.280> of<00:05:41.669> a<00:05:41.880> just<00:05:42.480> kind<00:05:42.630> of<00:05:42.690> a<00:05:42.870> teaser<00:05:43.290> of

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
little bit of a just kind of a teaser of

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.040 
little bit of a just kind of a teaser of
what<00:05:43.680> it'll<00:05:43.860> do<00:05:44.180> so<00:05:45.180> here<00:05:45.630> are<00:05:45.750> just<00:05:45.780> a<00:05:46.020> couple

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
what it'll do so here are just a couple

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.570 
what it'll do so here are just a couple
I<00:05:46.500> don't<00:05:46.980> really<00:05:47.130> know<00:05:47.280> what<00:05:47.400> they're<00:05:47.550> doing

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
I don't really know what they're doing

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.730 
I don't really know what they're doing
they've<00:05:48.120> just<00:05:48.360> kind<00:05:48.540> of<00:05:48.810> come<00:05:49.440> over<00:05:49.470> here

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
they've just kind of come over here

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.050 
they've just kind of come over here
those<00:05:49.919> that<00:05:50.190> one<00:05:50.370> is<00:05:50.460> still<00:05:50.730> sitting<00:05:51.030> there

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
those that one is still sitting there

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.670 
those that one is still sitting there
but<00:05:51.270> yeah<00:05:51.419> they<00:05:51.630> you<00:05:52.110> can<00:05:52.260> create<00:05:52.470> a<00:05:52.530> little

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
but yeah they you can create a little

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.350 
but yeah they you can create a little
drop<00:05:52.950> point<00:05:53.220> for<00:05:53.460> them<00:05:53.580> whether<00:05:53.760> all<00:05:54.030> will

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
drop point for them whether all will

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.270 
drop point for them whether all will
where<00:05:54.690> they<00:05:54.960> will<00:05:55.140> all<00:05:55.350> fall<00:05:55.710> down<00:05:55.740> into<00:05:56.100> one

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
where they will all fall down into one

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.800 
where they will all fall down into one
point<00:05:56.490> you<00:05:56.640> can<00:05:56.760> hit<00:05:56.880> them<00:05:57.000> for<00:05:57.150> XP<00:05:57.570> or<00:05:57.660> whatnot

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
point you can hit them for XP or whatnot

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.860 
point you can hit them for XP or whatnot
I<00:05:58.169> usually<00:05:58.860> do<00:05:58.980> it<00:05:59.100> for<00:05:59.280> just<00:06:00.060> a<00:06:00.120> gold<00:06:00.360> farm<00:06:00.630> but
