00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
people can't see where I'm putting the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.000 
people can't see where I'm putting the
hook<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.440> don't<00:02:10.770> know<00:02:10.830> maybe<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.129> shouldn't

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
hook so I don't know maybe I shouldn't

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.369 
hook so I don't know maybe I shouldn't
be<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:12.819> concerned<00:02:13.239> about<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.629> because<00:02:13.959> I<00:02:14.170> do

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
be so concerned about it because I do

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.069 
be so concerned about it because I do
like<00:02:14.680> some<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.159> variegated<00:02:15.519> yarns<00:02:16.329> but<00:02:17.049> I

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
like some of the variegated yarns but I

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.530 
like some of the variegated yarns but I
know<00:02:17.200> they're<00:02:17.439> hard<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.739> see<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:18.400> lot<00:02:19.239> of<00:02:19.269> these

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
know they're hard to see a lot of these

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.350 
know they're hard to see a lot of these
are<00:02:19.989> all<00:02:20.290> projects<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.549> had<00:02:21.849> something<00:02:22.269> in

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
are all projects that I had something in

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.059 
are all projects that I had something in
mind<00:02:22.599> these<00:02:22.840> might<00:02:23.079> be<00:02:23.260> with<00:02:23.409> that<00:02:23.590> with<00:02:23.829> you<00:02:24.040> I

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
mind these might be with that with you I

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.490 
mind these might be with that with you I
think<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.549> was<00:02:24.700> gonna<00:02:24.849> make<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.120> beer<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:26.290> then<00:02:26.439> I

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
think I was gonna make a beer and then I

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.979 
think I was gonna make a beer and then I
realized<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.430> it's<00:02:28.090> gonna<00:02:28.239> be<00:02:28.450> too<00:02:28.629> hard<00:02:28.810> to

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
realized that it's gonna be too hard to

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.839 
realized that it's gonna be too hard to
see<00:02:29.140> on<00:02:29.170> camera<00:02:29.319> so<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.250> then<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.489> gets<00:02:33.670> made

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
see on camera so so then it gets made

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.410 
see on camera so so then it gets made
into<00:02:34.090> hats<00:02:34.500> which<00:02:35.500> which<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.069> good<00:02:36.280> for<00:02:36.610> the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
into hats which which is good for the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.130 
into hats which which is good for the
homeless<00:02:37.780> shelter<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:40.420> last<00:02:40.690> thing<00:02:41.019> I

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
homeless shelter and the last thing I

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.009 
homeless shelter and the last thing I
have<00:02:41.379> here<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:42.849> last<00:02:43.060> thing<00:02:43.299> I<00:02:43.450> have<00:02:43.659> is<00:02:43.689> this

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
have here the last thing I have is this

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.289 
have here the last thing I have is this
really<00:02:44.680> really<00:02:44.859> long<00:02:45.159> it's<00:02:45.609> an<00:02:45.790> infinity

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
really really long it's an infinity

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.569 
really really long it's an infinity
scarf<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.590> thought<00:02:47.799> I<00:02:47.829> don't<00:02:48.069> that'll<00:02:48.489> be

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
scarf so I thought I don't that'll be

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.250 
scarf so I thought I don't that'll be
nice<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.000> warm<00:02:49.030> this<00:02:49.269> is<00:02:49.450> I'm<00:02:49.659> not<00:02:49.780> sure<00:02:49.840> what

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
nice and warm this is I'm not sure what

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.500 
nice and warm this is I'm not sure what
the<00:02:50.409> yarn<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.859> it<00:02:51.069> feels<00:02:51.609> like<00:02:51.879> it<00:02:52.120> could<00:02:52.329> be

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
the yarn is it feels like it could be

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.099 
the yarn is it feels like it could be
Karen<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.340> don't<00:02:54.579> remember<00:02:54.879> exactly<00:02:55.299> but<00:02:56.079> I

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
Karen but I don't remember exactly but I

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.639 
Karen but I don't remember exactly but I
think<00:02:56.409> it<00:02:56.530> might<00:02:56.680> be<00:02:56.739> Karen<00:02:57.310> yard
