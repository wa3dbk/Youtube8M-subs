it's not like an air gun or anything
like<00:00:30.950> that<00:00:31.070> a<00:00:31.400> lot<00:00:31.850> of<00:00:31.880> these<00:00:31.970> guns<00:00:32.210> are<00:00:32.330> really

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
like that a lot of these guns are really

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.330 
like that a lot of these guns are really
heavy<00:00:32.870> for<00:00:33.290> instance<00:00:33.470> when<00:00:33.650> we<00:00:33.739> do<00:00:33.830> the<00:00:34.010> motion

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
heavy for instance when we do the motion

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.040 
heavy for instance when we do the motion

rising<00:00:36.320> we<00:00:36.680> have<00:00:36.770> to<00:00:36.860> go<00:00:36.950> to<00:00:37.010> great<00:00:37.250> lengths<00:00:37.610> to

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
rising we have to go to great lengths to

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.729 
rising we have to go to great lengths to
get<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:37.970> real<00:00:38.150> guns<00:00:38.450> this<00:00:38.660> is<00:00:38.840> because<00:00:39.170> the

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
get the real guns this is because the

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.290 
get the real guns this is because the
weight<00:00:39.950> of<00:00:40.070> these<00:00:40.160> guns<00:00:40.400> can<00:00:40.610> actually<00:00:41.030> affect

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
weight of these guns can actually affect

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.930 
weight of these guns can actually affect
the<00:00:41.480> way<00:00:41.570> that<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.809> animation<00:00:42.350> looks<00:00:42.820> we<00:00:43.820> use

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
the way that the animation looks we use

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.549 
the way that the animation looks we use
military<00:00:44.150> specialists<00:00:44.989> than<00:00:45.110> our<00:00:45.230> motion

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
military specialists than our motion

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.439 
military specialists than our motion
capture<00:00:45.980> sessions<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:46.610> make<00:00:46.790> sure<00:00:47.000> that<00:00:47.210> our

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
capture sessions to make sure that our

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:48.970 
capture sessions to make sure that our
characters<00:00:47.930> in<00:00:48.050> game<00:00:48.230> move<00:00:48.530> with<00:00:48.739> a<00:00:48.800> lot<00:00:48.949> of

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
characters in game move with a lot of

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.160 
characters in game move with a lot of
weight<00:00:49.309> like<00:00:49.909> real<00:00:50.120> soldiers<00:00:50.300> do<00:00:50.659> so<00:00:51.050> we

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
weight like real soldiers do so we

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.660 
weight like real soldiers do so we
actually<00:00:51.290> loaded<00:00:51.830> the<00:00:52.070> motion<00:00:52.370> capture

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
actually loaded the motion capture

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.460 
actually loaded the motion capture
actors<00:00:53.000> up<00:00:53.180> with<00:00:53.449> webbing<00:00:53.780> we<00:00:53.989> put<00:00:54.170> lots<00:00:54.350> of

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
actors up with webbing we put lots of

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.869 
actors up with webbing we put lots of
lead<00:00:54.710> in<00:00:54.860> that<00:00:54.890> webbing<00:00:55.309> to<00:00:55.339> make<00:00:55.640> sure<00:00:55.760> they

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
lead in that webbing to make sure they

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.540 
lead in that webbing to make sure they
move<00:00:56.120> weight<00:00:56.720> and<00:00:57.050> purpose

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
move weight and purpose

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.130 
move weight and purpose
we'd<00:01:00.090> actually<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.510> any<00:01:00.690> bullets<00:01:00.870> or

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
we'd actually have any bullets or

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.780 
we'd actually have any bullets or
remaining<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> guns<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.579> to

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
remaining in the guns and you have to

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.399 
remaining in the guns and you have to
remember<00:01:03.270> how<00:01:03.600> many<00:01:03.780> bullets<00:01:03.930> you're<00:01:04.140> fired

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
remember how many bullets you're fired

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.810 
remember how many bullets you're fired
you<00:01:04.769> get<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> experience<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.610> being<00:01:05.820> soldier

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
you get the experience of being soldier

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.770 
you get the experience of being soldier
so<00:01:08.820> having<00:01:08.940> vehicle<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.450> operation

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
so having vehicle and operation

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.210 
so having vehicle and operation
flashpoint<00:01:09.810> dragon<00:01:10.260> rising<00:01:10.560> has<00:01:10.950> its<00:01:11.100> own

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
flashpoint dragon rising has its own

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.490 
flashpoint dragon rising has its own
characteristics<00:01:11.760> by<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.780> mean<00:01:12.810> handling

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
characteristics by this I mean handling

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.700 
characteristics by this I mean handling
look<00:01:14.040> turn<00:01:14.400> out<00:01:14.610> weaponry<00:01:15.119> etc<00:01:15.630> etc

everything from the smallest Jeep to the
largest<00:01:18.240> chopper<00:01:18.479> you'll<00:01:18.720> find<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.110> completely

largest chopper you'll find a completely

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.020 
largest chopper you'll find a completely
different<00:01:19.740> handling<00:01:20.070> experience<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:20.970> also

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
different handling experience but also

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.609 
different handling experience but also
something<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.450> accessible<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.470> don't

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
ton tank that's going to feel very

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.420 
ton tank that's going to feel very
different<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.509> something<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.320> DP<00:01:31.979> v<00:01:32.009> which

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
different to something like a DP v which

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:50.330 
different to something like a DP v which
is<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:32.610> very<00:01:32.789> light<00:01:33.149> agile<00:01:33.630> there

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.889 

we've<00:01:50.909> spent<00:01:51.149> an<00:01:51.270> awful<00:01:51.390> lot<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.719> time

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
we've spent an awful lot of time

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.419 
we've spent an awful lot of time
researching<00:01:52.049> these<00:01:52.409> vehicles<00:01:52.710> we've<00:01:53.100> had<00:01:53.280> to

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
researching these vehicles we've had to

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:54.950 
researching these vehicles we've had to
capture<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.880> engine<00:01:54.179> sound<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.719> to<00:01:54.810> get

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
capture the engine sound you have to get

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.260 
capture the engine sound you have to get
a<00:01:54.990> right<00:01:55.289> Q<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.799> paint<00:01:56.130> we've<00:01:56.759> also<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.119> course

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
a right Q of paint we've also of course

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.969 
a right Q of paint we've also of course
had<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.600> take<00:01:57.780> me<00:01:57.929> a<00:01:57.960> brand<00:01:58.289> new<00:01:58.439> vehicle<00:01:58.619> and

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
had to take me a brand new vehicle and

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.559 
had to take me a brand new vehicle and
actually<00:01:59.250> beat<00:01:59.460> up<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.819> weather<00:02:00.030> them<00:02:02.539> from<00:02:03.539> a

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
actually beat up the weather them from a

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.149 
actually beat up the weather them from a
tactics<00:02:04.020> point<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.350> view<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.859> very

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
tactics point of view it's very
