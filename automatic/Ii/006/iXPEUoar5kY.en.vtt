completely new engine there's not a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
know used before or anything like that

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.570 
know used before or anything like that
it's<00:01:18.400> a<00:01:18.490> v6<00:01:18.810> its<00:01:19.810> twin-turbo<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:21.370> it's<00:01:21.520> a

it's a v6 its twin-turbo and it's a

it's a v6 its twin-turbo and it's a
petrol<00:01:21.940> engine<00:01:25.170> today<00:01:26.170> is<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.710> first<00:01:26.980> time

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
petrol engine today is the first time

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.680 
petrol engine today is the first time
that<00:01:27.280> we've<00:01:27.790> seen<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.120> engines<00:01:28.480> on<00:01:28.660> a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
that we've seen the engines on a

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.870 
that we've seen the engines on a
simulation<00:01:29.170> of<00:01:29.410> your<00:01:29.560> mom<00:01:29.710> so<00:01:30.130> it's<00:01:30.280> got<00:01:30.520> the

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
simulation of your mom so it's got the

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.750 
simulation of your mom so it's got the
whole<00:01:31.530> mathematical<00:01:32.530> model<00:01:32.890> loaded<00:01:33.430> into<00:01:33.580> the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
whole mathematical model loaded into the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.580 
whole mathematical model loaded into the
dyno<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.810> engine<00:01:35.290> is<00:01:35.410> being<00:01:35.620> places<00:01:36.280> like

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.200 

as<00:01:41.590> we<00:01:41.740> go<00:01:41.860> through<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.190> program<00:01:42.370> we'll<00:01:43.060> add<00:01:43.180> a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
as we go through the program we'll add a

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.450 
as we go through the program we'll add a
box<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.900> it<00:01:43.990> where<00:01:44.140> our<00:01:44.170> curse<00:01:44.590> system<00:01:45.070> and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
box to it where our curse system and

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.830 
box to it where our curse system and
basically<00:01:45.760> you'll<00:01:46.060> have<00:01:46.120> the<00:01:46.420> whole<00:01:46.570> of<00:01:46.780> the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
basically you'll have the whole of the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.390 
basically you'll have the whole of the
drivetrain<00:01:47.110> working<00:01:47.920> before<00:01:48.040> it<00:01:48.280> actually

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
drivetrain working before it actually

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.390 
drivetrain working before it actually
goes<00:01:48.730> in<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.060> car<00:01:49.300> this<00:01:49.990> is<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.740> first<00:01:51.070> real

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
goes in the car this is the first real

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.590 
goes in the car this is the first real
