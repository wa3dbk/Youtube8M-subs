00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
well over 90% will present to me in a

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
dehydrated state first time I see them

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.780 
dehydrated state first time I see them
they're<00:00:39.840> significantly<00:00:40.559> dehydrated<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.760> I

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
they're significantly dehydrated so I

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
they're significantly dehydrated so I
think<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> dehydration<00:00:42.960> has<00:00:43.020> put<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> big

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
think that the dehydration has put a big

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.560 
think that the dehydration has put a big
stress<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> body<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.789> has<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.329> part
