distance<00:01:53.909> short<00:01:54.659> distance<00:01:55.110> whatever<00:01:55.380> works

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
distance short distance whatever works

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.770 
distance short distance whatever works
for<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.880> i<00:01:56.939> figured<00:01:57.240> i'd<00:01:57.329> throw<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.570> grenade

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
for it so i figured i'd throw a grenade

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.730 
for it so i figured i'd throw a grenade
launcher<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.799> see<00:01:58.950> how<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.219> works<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.729> me

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
launcher on and see how it works for me

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.230 
launcher on and see how it works for me
at<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.920> part<00:02:02.250> right<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.520> I'm<00:02:02.850> getting<00:02:03.119> low

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
at this part right here I'm getting low

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.850 
at this part right here I'm getting low
on<00:02:03.270> ammo<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.930> luck<00:02:04.140> out<00:02:04.320> when<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.649> come<00:02:04.829> over

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
on ammo and I luck out when I come over

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.069 
on ammo and I luck out when I come over

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.310 
but anyway the way I lock down this
building<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.450> don't<00:02:18.510> just<00:02:18.810> look<00:02:18.960> at<00:02:19.140> one

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
the building as you probably just saw

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.650 
the building as you probably just saw
there<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.020> got<00:02:40.260> my<00:02:40.410> tat<00:02:40.680> helicopter<00:02:41.460> and<00:02:41.610> set<00:02:42.540> it

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
there I got my tat helicopter and set it

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.880 
there I got my tat helicopter and set it
free<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.620> then<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:44.550> got<00:02:44.730> my<00:02:44.880> chopper<00:02:45.300> gunner<00:02:45.510> I

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
free and then I got my chopper gunner I

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.610 
free and then I got my chopper gunner I
got<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> nice<00:02:47.340> little<00:02:47.550> long<00:02:47.790> shot<00:02:48.320> head<00:02:49.320> shot

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
got a nice little long shot head shot

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.740 
got a nice little long shot head shot
too<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.240> got<00:02:51.390> my<00:02:51.540> gunship<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:53.760> now<00:02:54.510> I'm<00:02:54.630> just

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
too and I got my gunship so now I'm just

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.840 
too and I got my gunship so now I'm just
waiting<00:02:54.900> for<00:02:55.230> my<00:02:55.320> attack<00:02:55.760> helicopter<00:02:56.760> to

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
waiting for my attack helicopter to

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.990 
waiting for my attack helicopter to
leave<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.420> can<00:02:57.540> use<00:02:58.140> them<00:02:58.580> so<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.610> figured<00:02:59.640> I

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
leave so I can use them so I figured I

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.160 
leave so I can use them so I figured I
might<00:03:00.120> as<00:03:00.180> well<00:03:00.270> stay<00:03:00.570> in<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.690> building's

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
might as well stay in the building's

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.750 
might as well stay in the building's
been<00:03:01.350> working<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:01.860> far<00:03:04.040> most<00:03:05.040> people<00:03:05.400> debate

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
been working so far most people debate

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.490

find<00:03:10.680> when<00:03:10.800> you're<00:03:10.950> playing<00:03:11.160> domination<00:03:12.030> that

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
find when you're playing domination that

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.150 
find when you're playing domination that
is<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.660> have<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.900> gunship<00:03:13.350> in<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.650> chopper

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
is you have the gunship in the chopper

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.910 
is you have the gunship in the chopper
gunner<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:15.030> get<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.210> lot<00:03:15.390> more<00:03:15.420> kills<00:03:15.920> winning

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
gunner you get a lot more kills winning

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.470 
gunner you get a lot more kills winning
team<00:03:17.130> deathmatch<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.880> wouldn't<00:03:18.120> have<00:03:18.240> time

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
team deathmatch you wouldn't have time

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.300 
team deathmatch you wouldn't have time
to<00:03:18.540> use<00:03:18.840> both<00:03:19.080> them<00:03:19.350> so<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.680> should<00:03:19.860> use<00:03:20.010> dogs

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
to use both them so you should use dogs

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.920 
to use both them so you should use dogs
with<00:03:20.610> your<00:03:20.730> chopper<00:03:21.120> gunner<00:03:21.330> it<00:03:21.510> makes<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.780> nice

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
with your chopper gunner it makes a nice

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.140 
with your chopper gunner it makes a nice
little<00:03:22.160> combination<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.640> get<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.790> lot<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> lot

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
little combination you get a lot a lot

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.640 
little combination you get a lot a lot
of<00:03:24.570> more<00:03:24.720> kills<00:03:24.990> at<00:03:25.200> once<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:28.140> guy<00:03:28.410> that

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
of more kills at once and that guy that

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.080 
of more kills at once and that guy that
just<00:03:28.830> got<00:03:28.920> away<00:03:29.310> at<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.520> door<00:03:29.550> over<00:03:30.060> there

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
just got away at the door over there

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.760 
just got away at the door over there
like<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:30.690> knew<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:30.900> would<00:03:31.200> not<00:03:31.410> have<00:03:31.560> been<00:03:31.680> able

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
like I knew I would not have been able

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.290 
like I knew I would not have been able
to<00:03:32.040> kill<00:03:32.250> him<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.430> would<00:03:32.610> have<00:03:32.700> just<00:03:32.730> wounded

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
to kill him I would have just wounded

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.020 
to kill him I would have just wounded
them<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.750> maybe<00:03:34.680> got<00:03:34.980> an<00:03:35.100> assist<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:35.760> figure

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
them and maybe got an assist so I figure

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.790 
them and maybe got an assist so I figure
there's<00:03:36.210> no<00:03:36.330> point<00:03:36.720> wasting<00:03:36.930> ammo<00:03:37.440> giving

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
there's no point wasting ammo giving

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.500 
there's no point wasting ammo giving

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
here where I can get some pretty good

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.870 
here where I can get some pretty good
cover<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:49.950> use<00:03:50.190> my<00:03:50.370> chopper<00:03:50.760> gunner<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:52.850> mean<00:03:53.850> a

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
cover to use my chopper gunner I mean a

cover to use my chopper gunner I mean a
gunship<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.780> always<00:03:54.990> get<00:03:55.110> them<00:03:55.290> confused<00:03:55.320> I

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
gunship I always get them confused I

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.230 
gunship I always get them confused I
always<00:03:56.070> think<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.490> got<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.730> chopper<00:03:57.060> gunner

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
always think I got the chopper gunner

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.880 
always think I got the chopper gunner
first<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.810> should<00:03:58.020> use<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.230> first<00:03:58.560> but

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
first so I should use it first but

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.360 
first so I should use it first but
doesn't<00:03:59.700> work<00:03:59.760> that<00:04:00.060> way<00:04:00.860> every<00:04:01.860> time<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.070> fly

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
doesn't work that way every time I fly

doesn't work that way every time I fly
the<00:04:02.430> gunship<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.240> always<00:04:03.510> never<00:04:03.870> used<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.410> be

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
the gunship I always never used to be

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.380 
the gunship I always never used to be
enabled<00:04:05.040> you

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
enabled you

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.559 
enabled you
I<00:04:06.160> can<00:04:07.160> never<00:04:07.250> get<00:04:07.490> the<00:04:07.610> controls<00:04:07.970> right<00:04:08.270> right

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
I can never get the controls right right

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.240 
I can never get the controls right right
away<00:04:08.810> it<00:04:08.990> takes<00:04:09.140> me<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:09.410> second<00:04:09.800> start<00:04:10.010> getting

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
away it takes me a second start getting

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.170 
away it takes me a second start getting
some<00:04:10.400> good<00:04:10.580> kills<00:04:12.430> you'll<00:04:13.430> probably<00:04:13.640> notice<00:04:13.910> i

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
some good kills you'll probably notice i

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.030 
some good kills you'll probably notice i
only<00:04:14.390> use<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.660> rock<00:04:14.870> it's<00:04:15.140> a<00:04:15.230> few<00:04:15.440> times<00:04:15.680> on

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
only use the rock it's a few times on

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.670 
only use the rock it's a few times on
here<00:04:16.430> just<00:04:17.209> because<00:04:17.299> i<00:04:17.480> can<00:04:17.660> never<00:04:17.840> hit

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
here just because i can never hit

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.530 
here just because i can never hit
anybody<00:04:18.980> with<00:04:19.220> them<00:04:19.579> so<00:04:19.820> i<00:04:19.850> never<00:04:20.120> think<00:04:20.359> to

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
anybody with them so i never think to

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.870 
anybody with them so i never think to
shoot<00:04:20.780> them<00:04:20.989> it<00:04:21.739> just<00:04:21.799> seemed<00:04:22.100> for<00:04:22.310> useless<00:04:22.730> to

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
shoot them it just seemed for useless to

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.360 
shoot them it just seemed for useless to
me<00:04:22.910> most<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.390> time<00:04:23.600> but<00:04:24.100> imagine<00:04:25.100> somebody

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
me most the time but imagine somebody

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.130 
me most the time but imagine somebody
who<00:04:25.669> gets<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:26.060> gunship<00:04:26.480> a<00:04:26.600> lot<00:04:26.750> more<00:04:26.960> often

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
who gets the gunship a lot more often

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.880 
who gets the gunship a lot more often
would<00:04:28.720> not<00:04:29.720> that<00:04:29.900> i<00:04:29.930> don't<00:04:30.050> get<00:04:30.320> my<00:04:30.500> share<00:04:30.830> a

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
would not that i don't get my share a

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:39.510 
would not that i don't get my share a
gunship

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.659 

I<00:04:40.379> don't<00:04:41.379> like<00:04:41.590> how<00:04:41.800> in<00:04:41.949> levels<00:04:42.310> like<00:04:42.430> this

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
I don't like how in levels like this

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.430 
I don't like how in levels like this
they<00:04:42.879> just<00:04:42.910> hide<00:04:43.330> behind<00:04:43.360> other<00:04:43.900> buildings

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
they just hide behind other buildings

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.860 
they just hide behind other buildings
just<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:45.610> lot<00:04:45.729> more<00:04:45.759> complicated<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.629> shoot

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
just a lot more complicated to shoot

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.529 
just a lot more complicated to shoot
them<00:04:47.490> luckily<00:04:48.490> though<00:04:48.669> I<00:04:48.699> get<00:04:48.940> a<00:04:48.970> lot<00:04:49.180> of<00:04:49.210> kills

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
them luckily though I get a lot of kills

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:55.050 
them luckily though I get a lot of kills
and<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:51.659> end<00:04:52.659> up<00:04:52.810> at<00:04:53.110> 33<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:53.949> 0<00:04:54.099> with<00:04:54.129> a<00:04:54.520> chopper

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
and I end up at 33 and 0 with a chopper

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.589 
and I end up at 33 and 0 with a chopper
gunner<00:04:55.090> still<00:04:55.569> to<00:04:55.720> go<00:04:55.870> some<00:04:56.800> mo<00:04:57.099> and<00:04:57.340> two<00:04:57.599> ak-47

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
gunner still to go some mo and two ak-47

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:06.119 
gunner still to go some mo and two ak-47
I<00:05:03.960> definitely<00:05:04.960> like<00:05:05.319> the<00:05:05.349> chopper<00:05:05.860> gunner<00:05:06.039> a

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 
I definitely like the chopper gunner a

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.520 
I definitely like the chopper gunner a
lot<00:05:06.370> better<00:05:06.520> than<00:05:06.759> the<00:05:06.879> gunship<00:05:07.389> just<00:05:08.349> because

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
lot better than the gunship just because

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.800 
lot better than the gunship just because
it<00:05:08.680> flies<00:05:08.889> itself<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:09.759> I<00:05:09.879> think<00:05:10.360> it's<00:05:10.479> easier

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
it flies itself and I think it's easier

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.240 
it flies itself and I think it's easier
to<00:05:10.930> shoot<00:05:11.169> and<00:05:11.379> you<00:05:11.440> can<00:05:11.560> also<00:05:11.740> aim<00:05:12.009> down<00:05:12.190> the

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
to shoot and you can also aim down the

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:20.249 
to shoot and you can also aim down the
sights<00:05:17.400> so<00:05:18.400> somehow<00:05:18.729> my<00:05:19.210> body<00:05:19.539> is<00:05:19.750> still<00:05:20.020> alive

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
sights so somehow my body is still alive

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:22.200 
sights so somehow my body is still alive
in<00:05:20.470> that<00:05:20.500> Bush<00:05:20.979> probably<00:05:21.490> not<00:05:21.610> really<00:05:21.880> looking

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
in that Bush probably not really looking

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.050 
in that Bush probably not really looking
for<00:05:22.449> me<00:05:22.720> right<00:05:23.250> here<00:05:24.250> too<00:05:24.550> i'm<00:05:24.699> getting<00:05:24.970> pretty
