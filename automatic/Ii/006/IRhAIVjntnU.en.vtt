00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.870
 a more appropriate time to carry 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.850
 out the peanut ratio is given in 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.100
 when the soft changes its 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.130
 green color of the leaves to a whole 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.890
 organic brownish low indicating that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.720
 is finalizing its vegetative in that 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.029
 moment we are going to cut most of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.520
 the points marked in my case do not 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.110
 community of remembrance before then 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.310
 our circumstances as you can 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.560
 appreciate the plants are 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.180
 practically dry 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.940
 almost completely of leaves 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.070
 what will happen to me when I start 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.900
 lift these plants 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.530
 I will find you witnesses of the pain 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:51.840
 but still hard lioness to mature future 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.789
 they will be starting to finish their seed 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.670
 to give rise to another new plant by 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.010
 what happens this because he 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.120
 the production of the emission of flowers 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.360
 this type of peanut plants is 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.030
 stepped is not homogeneous in a moment 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.810
 of time 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.850
 begins to produce the flowers the plant 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.560
 at the moment although it reaches a 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.240
 certain development 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.190
 throughout the crop cycle 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.500
 it does not stop emitting flowers for that reason 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.500
 we will find as I say fruits 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.930
 between that immature vegetative state 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.729
 because it has not been in the last for the 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.729
 that it emits from the plants and that they have not 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.440
 given time to mature in this part of 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.600
 time until the time of your 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.399
 harvest fully ripe fruits 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.610
 and developed are those that we 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.770
 interest and fruits that are already 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.509
 completely mature and that due to the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.429
 action conditions for navigating 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.280
 temperature on the ground 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.200
 because that embryo is that seed 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.140
 generates a new plant and therefore 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.060
 you are not going to see they are going to be with 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.400
 with the emission of new roots to 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.670
 from that seed 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.250
 as you know the peanut fruit of the 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.770
 peanut plant is under 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.300
 land although flowers are developed in 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.700
 the aerial part as they go 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.350
 maturing and the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.470
 phenomenon maturation and development 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.270
 that fruit go down to the ground and it 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.370
 they hide underground to proceed there 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.140
 at the end of the period of 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.670
 maturation 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.530
 therefore the fruits are under 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.770
 land how am I going to proceed to the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.140
 harvesting of its fruit 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.940
 if we have a soil that is returned is 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.100
 sandy that is not compact at all 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.240
 simply by pulling the plant towards 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.920
 above we can take out the roots and the 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.210
 full plant and it is also a fruit 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.220
 and the losses of those fruits 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.770
 they're going to stay on the floor more to be a 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.230
 little but if you have a floor that is like 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.030
 mine pretty strong and heavy yours 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.730
 is to start the plant 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.310
 by an elevation that I have here to my 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.990
 side to to prevent most of 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.280
 of football are stuck to that land 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.280
 and they want on the ground 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.650
 and here we have the production that we have 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.770
 obtained from this first bench as you see 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.750
 most of the fruits are 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.600
 mature there are also some who have 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.730
 originated new plants or that are in 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.160
 completion period those seeds 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.920
 to originate new plants you can 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.230
 observe and some we have found 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.050
 that were immature were not yet 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.760
 fully formed what comes 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.890
 now it is to let these plants dry 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.370
 completely so that they expel all the 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.680
 water that it contains once it is this 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.550
 drying is complete what we will do 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.620
 separate the fruits of the plant and 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.170
 store them correctly for your 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.290
 later use well for consumption at 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.210
 natural or toasted as we prefer or to 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.310
 use these seeds for the year that 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.310
 comes in another subsequent planting 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.330
 you know which is the most suitable moment 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.380
 for 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:58.200
 boston peanuts 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.200
 is the most appropriate way to approach
