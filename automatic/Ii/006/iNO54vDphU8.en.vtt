00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.780
 it was to learn to eat lose weight

 they are always available to us 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.520
 the busy is far from closed it's all that and we eat everything and without 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.660

 but privately for more than 12 hours 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.330
