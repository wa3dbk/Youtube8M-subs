one<00:00:04.830> of<00:00:04.920> my<00:00:05.010> favorite<00:00:05.340> parts<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.730> rod

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
one of my favorite parts of rod

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.059 
one of my favorite parts of rod
engineering<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.779> kind<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.200> analyzing<00:00:07.650> rod

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
engineering is kind of analyzing rod

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.770 
engineering is kind of analyzing rod
breakage<00:00:08.639> look<00:00:09.330> at<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.540> I'm<00:00:09.629> already

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
breakage look at that I'm already

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.689 
breakage look at that I'm already
getting<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.170> Wobs<00:00:13.010> you'd<00:00:14.010> think<00:00:14.190> when<00:00:14.459> a<00:00:14.490> rod

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:14.699 
getting the Wobs you'd think when a rod

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.790 
getting the Wobs you'd think when a rod
breaks<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.209> know<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:15.539> kind<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.590> bummer

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
breaks you know it's kind of a bummer

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.650 
breaks you know it's kind of a bummer
and<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.220> kind<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.520> move<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:18.539> what

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
and you just kind of move on but what

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.870 
and you just kind of move on but what
I'm<00:00:18.779> looking<00:00:19.109> for<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.500> how<00:00:19.860> the<00:00:19.920> rod<00:00:20.310> broke<00:00:20.610> in

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
I'm looking for is how the rod broke in

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.650 
I'm looking for is how the rod broke in
this<00:00:21.270> situation<00:00:21.900> here<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.380> rod<00:00:22.620> sheared<00:00:23.100> off

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
this situation here this rod sheared off

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.880 
this situation here this rod sheared off
okay<00:00:24.660> that's<00:00:24.900> an<00:00:25.050> indication<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.800> was

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
okay that's an indication that it was

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.820 
okay that's an indication that it was
either<00:00:26.010> injured<00:00:26.610> or<00:00:27.530> there<00:00:28.530> might<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:28.710> been

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
either injured or there might have been

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.640 
either injured or there might have been
a<00:00:29.450> wrinkle<00:00:30.450> in<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.720> graphite<00:00:31.140> fibers

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
a wrinkle in that graphite fibers

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.319 
a wrinkle in that graphite fibers
underneath<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.219> rod<00:00:32.369> that's<00:00:32.669> one<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.059> I'm

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
underneath the rod that's one that I'm

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.020 
underneath the rod that's one that I'm
really<00:00:33.390> concerned<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.620> when<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.400> see<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> rod

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
really concerned with when I see a rod

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.450 
really concerned with when I see a rod
break<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:37.020> did<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.220> an

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
break like this one did here this is an

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.700 
break like this one did here this is an
example<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.970> what<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.210> call<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> complete<00:00:39.780> deal

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
example of what we call a complete deal

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.180 
example of what we call a complete deal
a<00:00:40.980> more<00:00:41.310> failure<00:00:41.790> over<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.540> large<00:00:42.870> area<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.680> know

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
a more failure over a large area I know

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
a more failure over a large area I know
that<00:00:44.370> looks<00:00:44.550> worse<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.210> actually<00:00:45.540> better

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
that looks worse it's actually better

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.979 
that looks worse it's actually better
this<00:00:46.560> is<00:00:46.739> an<00:00:46.829> indication<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.600> amount<00:00:48.899> of

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
this is an indication that the amount of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.350 
this is an indication that the amount of
force<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.440> took<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.770> break<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.040> fly<00:00:50.399> rod<00:00:50.640> was

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
force it took to break a fly rod was

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.350 
force it took to break a fly rod was
distributed<00:00:52.079> over<00:00:52.200> a<00:00:52.320> large<00:00:52.649> area<00:00:53.180> let's<00:00:54.180> talk

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
distributed over a large area let's talk

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.520 
distributed over a large area let's talk
about<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:54.660> happens<00:00:54.930> when<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.079> rod<00:00:55.260> breaks

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
about what happens when a rod breaks

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.100 
about what happens when a rod breaks
let's<00:00:56.130> break<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> couple<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:57.000> when<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> bend<00:00:57.989> a

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
let's break a couple here when I bend a

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.870 
let's break a couple here when I bend a
fly<00:00:58.350> rod<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.860> mean<00:00:59.190> that's<00:00:59.340> already<00:00:59.579> pretty

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
fly rod I mean that's already pretty

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.700 
fly rod I mean that's already pretty
nasty<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.540> is<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> tip<00:01:00.989> section<00:01:01.230> from<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
nasty this is the tip section from the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.740 
nasty this is the tip section from the
eight<00:01:01.860> weight<00:01:02.100> rod<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:03.090> happens<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
eight weight rod what happens is the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.080 
eight weight rod what happens is the
fibers<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> graphite<00:01:04.860> fibers<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> top<00:01:05.880> of

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
fibers the graphite fibers on the top of

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.510 
fibers the graphite fibers on the top of
this<00:01:06.149> rod<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:06.540> being<00:01:06.719> stretched<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:08.100> fibers

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
this rod are being stretched the fibers

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.739 
this rod are being stretched the fibers
on<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.700> bottom<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.179> the<00:01:09.240> rod<00:01:09.420> are<00:01:09.569> being

on the bottom of the rod are being

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:12.559 
on the bottom of the rod are being
compressed<00:01:10.429> we<00:01:11.429> use<00:01:11.639> a<00:01:11.670> blend<00:01:12.209> of<00:01:12.420> different

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569 
compressed we use a blend of different

compressed we use a blend of different
Graphite's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
Graphite's

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.160 
Graphite's
usually<00:01:13.979> intermediate<00:01:14.639> modulus<00:01:15.209> to<00:01:15.840> try<00:01:16.049> and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
usually intermediate modulus to try and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.599 
usually intermediate modulus to try and
achieve<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.619> best<00:01:16.649> strength<00:01:17.219> to<00:01:17.459> weight

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
achieve the best strength to weight

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.749 
achieve the best strength to weight
ratio<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.840> tough<00:01:19.170> durable<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.639> it

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
ratio so it's tough durable but it

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.519 
ratio so it's tough durable but it
allows<00:01:20.999> us<00:01:21.029> to<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.719> rod<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.469> to

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:22.529 
allows us to get a rod that's going to

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:25.370 
allows us to get a rod that's going to
be<00:01:22.709> one<00:01:23.399> that<00:01:23.579> takes<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.999> full<00:01:24.240> Bend<00:01:24.600> without

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
be one that takes a full Bend without

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.459 
be one that takes a full Bend without
breaking<00:01:25.670> now<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.299> situation<00:01:27.539> if<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.139> bend

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
breaking now in this situation if I bend

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.010 
breaking now in this situation if I bend
this<00:01:28.679> rod<00:01:28.979> all<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.999> takes<00:01:30.299> sometimes<00:01:30.569> is<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
this rod all it takes sometimes is a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.059 
this rod all it takes sometimes is a
little<00:01:31.130> extra<00:01:32.599> focus<00:01:33.599> or<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> shear<00:01:34.409> point<00:01:34.709> and

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
little extra focus or a shear point and

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.249 
little extra focus or a shear point and
I<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.729> take<00:01:35.939> what<00:01:36.149> would<00:01:36.270> normally<00:01:36.719> never

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
I can take what would normally never

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.179 
I can take what would normally never
break<00:01:37.709> a<00:01:37.740> rod<00:01:38.069> and<00:01:39.020> I<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.229> snap<00:01:40.499> a<00:01:40.529> rod<00:01:40.859> pretty

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
break a rod and I can snap a rod pretty

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.129 
break a rod and I can snap a rod pretty
easily<00:01:41.459> doing<00:01:42.359> that<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.599> a<00:01:42.659> nine<00:01:42.869> way<00:01:43.020> it's

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:43.139 
easily doing that to a nine way it's

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:45.230 
easily doing that to a nine way it's
actually<00:01:43.469> pretty<00:01:43.679> tough<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.639> take<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.029> tip

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
actually pretty tough if I take the tip

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.419 
actually pretty tough if I take the tip
section<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.719> rod<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.770> snap<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.189> rod

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
section of rod I can just snap this rod

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.599 
section of rod I can just snap this rod
all<00:01:47.609> day<00:01:47.849> and<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.509> same<00:01:48.810> rod<00:01:49.279> we'll<00:01:50.279> just

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
all day and that same rod we'll just

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:53.239 
all day and that same rod we'll just
