00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:21.249
 it's silly people here this leaflet is 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.380
 today we will find ourselves 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:27.039
 for a new video on n'diaye 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:31.210
 touquet fifteen is just that 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:34.600
 will be the membership updates 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.039
 hop a little bit to see so if 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.050
 you want to download it because 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.510
 I'm doing it 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.109
 all that so you're just going 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.679
 here is the menu options you go 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.179
 to change the staff up and you 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.859
 press triangle so what is 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.870
 available on playstation case that one 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.129
 there but after on the other consoles is going 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.780
 you also have the opportunity to 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.210
 find people who do the same 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.489
 so the simplest thing that's it 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.589
 you're going to hop up looking for 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.689
 parisÃ© online it's the most 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.920
 simple if not deceived he had 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.100
 just to type this leaflet 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.299
 these are the ones here and you take this one 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.909
 who has the most updates answered 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.259
 this is the only one named 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.420
 2015-2016 roster more conquered since 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.890
 wade but actually what makes that in 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.140
 this one here there is every rookie there 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.630
 are all the leaflets are getting 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.930
 do so little by little I am 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.369
 just doing it like that 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.200
 at the same time it allows me to follow a 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.450
 little bit the different trade and we 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.430
 it is rather interesting and 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.750
 Toulouse I'm also starting to put a go 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.009
 little bit the wages go I will put 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.750
 not necessarily wages continues 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.090
 showed that it will really 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.119
 time but in any case the updates to 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.700
 day I try to follow a maximum so 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.369
 there for example tonight 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.140
 the kings send us three players 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.090
 little sister here and suddenly 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.740
 the trick is that the players who 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.420
 will in exchange it's guys who 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.280
 go to what seems to be coming from europe 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.340
 what I hope is that I released 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.979
 three places in philadelphia at worst 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.439
 take players who that's who does not 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.860
 will not play for example you are going to be 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.720
 put in swimming liszt and therefore crosses 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.670
 we really are here to release him two 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.069
 players anyway we can 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.700
 recover do not push it's not too much 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.670
 too serious strong winger then course 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.349
 first sophie bout 6 mg bid and or 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.110
 strong winger ok so that even the rest 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.000
 the distillates in quebec must be 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.440
 contain at least thirteen players have 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.450
 no worries then what are we going to do this 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.670
 we will send the players precisely 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.769
 if they were sent to our friends from 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.360
 sixers 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:50.810
 the first one made hop hop hop transferred 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.830
 to another team 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.569
 earlier assigned to another team cdc 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.290
 not the stages that to see it's affected 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.860
 to another team 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.620
 so you're going to leave so he 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.480
 do not put it on the bench after 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.560
 second player is thompson thompson 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.819
 just wait to watch something by 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.379
 report to that ok with you too 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.000
 ok affected but against it is 6 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.930
 hours that I do not understand too much because 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.790
 that wade is too long too much inside 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:31.590
 it's not the interiors that are the 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:33.480
 assigned priority transferred ah yeah but 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.840
 suddenly papapapa these initials 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.940
 it does not matter the worst case we get 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.310
 plug 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.220
 walt then we will put at worst 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.500
 the other as a free agent has not 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.519
 associate is not at all a problem and 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.650
 after that there is still one left to ska 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:56.340
 tosca this podcast of the witch all case 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.220
 if he's there for beefy ska assigned to 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.610
 another team 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:06.160
 and we will assign it to the workforce 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:09.620
 again philadelphia sixers 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.760
 that's perfect so by cons just a 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.590
 thing that I'm going to have to change his 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.340
 two guys that I just put there 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.980
 should be put in free agents 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.010
 because of the blow wood of the blow of juice 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:31.129
 all of a sudden we are not good at 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:35.209
 level of that we are not good at all 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:37.369
 here you see people released this at at 

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:39.739
 where are we going to let them do what at 

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:40.909
 worst case is not that going 

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:43.610
 change the game 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:46.009
 good after that it's little players 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.139
 do it after I'll change that at 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.159
 as all the traits of 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.729
 it's done because it takes a minimum 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:56.149
 players in each squad 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.509
 so here is a minimum of 13 

00:04:56.149 --> 00:05:01.490
 players 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:05.630
 so before we leave we do not 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:09.800
 we will continue our emir spahic is 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.210
 by the way they signed davis for 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.610
 I believe the biggest contract of 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.740
 the story suddenly like that really not 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.950
 badly or worse you do your here it is a 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.860
 future of the franchise is 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.140
 the present the future all you want 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.300
 but yeah and suddenly there they proposed 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:30.620
 a contract also 60 million out of five 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:34.120
 years for Turkish omer asik so yes if 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.370
 I want to see where you were 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.970
 would arrange me aumeyras tiki them 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.390
 teams 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:44.480
 am I the name of victor is this 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.360
 that I have already transferred not if I have 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.300
 already 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.129
 so we can throw I have not even caught 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.169
 in the epic type of peace of the heart that 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:54.639
 ok okay he's already here and I 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.469
 I already did it I already had 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.870
 does the frattini six transfer agreement 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:01.300
 month no worry so in the 6 that was 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.060
 past is that aldridge what is sure 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.080
 it will not be on the side of 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.740
 lakers so there are a lot of chances 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.819
 that he has on the side of the spurs it is 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.860
 really excellent because they have a 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:15.120
 Hockey Canada 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.669
 to keep a little bit different 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.259
 transfers but that's so low for the 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.419
 moment we are going to leave small such 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:23.849
 that they see there in backups so 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.800
 again if you want the name 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:28.289
 you type in ideas online you 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.409
 just tap that flyer and you take 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:33.360
 the 2015 2016 workforce and that's it and suddenly 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:35.280
 you will have updated numbers after 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.379
 anyway yeah change them even if 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.939
 you ever find that I'm not the 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:41.219
 quote all but in any case that's it 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:43.590
 I hope this little video you 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:47.810
 will have pleased you to tell the next 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.810
 do you wear well and you have salvation 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.550
 Oh 

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:02.639
 m
