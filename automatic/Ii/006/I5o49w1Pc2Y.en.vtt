00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 worth guys and welcome back to my channel 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:10.200
 back to made man not on maden 15 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.590
 i bought it finally i 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.880
 video on mazen 16 and also starts at 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.369
 career this time 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.490
 I will try to finish at least one season 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.140
 damn it and let's start immediately with 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.630
 tell you that they have really changed 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.359
 lots of things there is also an ultimate in 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.189
 much more pompous a lot more 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.529
 significantly more fun there 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.809
 they will also be challenges to do 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.000
 to buy points and then buy 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.100
 uncles package and make challenges 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.719
 really interesting but maybe of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.239
 we'll talk about it later or not 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.789
 nor we will talk and I own a attimino 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.450
 what to do later but let's start with the 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:52.489
 career guys get started and get started 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.489
 I chose the san louis rams 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.010
 therefore 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.970
 here you guys practically go 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.040
 with being practically the coach 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.240
 the coach but just go to change 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.040
 role select player and leave 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.810
 with a custom player why 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.210
 however, you can also start with a 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.670
 player that has already been created then 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.070
 one practically takes the body of 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.000
 player already exists and starts with 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.540
 a new career 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.670
 but I was the player this year 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.820
 I want to do it again from then on 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.970
 orient ourselves again and 4 is the role 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.840
 certainly more important above all 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.369
 then when a young man of great hopes 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.729
 is taken and put there 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.250
 he practically puts himself on his shoulders 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.470
 a team is given a responsibility 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.119
 here is the very great this 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.950
 nice to have this possibility 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.270
 to become a star from the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.240
 very young indeed my player 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.880
 will start twenty years that will have one 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.950
 veraldi 77 if I'm not mistaken then we will go 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.989
 to see well why it could also 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.600
 change but I decided to do a 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.910
 mobile quaterback so it wo n't be strong 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.430
 he wo n't have a very strong arm to do 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.940
 long runs but will be very fast and 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.730
 will do some very good short or medium runs 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.739
 here are three guys 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.810
 choice then how the career will start 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.730
 of our player he will have the 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.320
 practically possibility of being 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.730
 immediately chosen so it will be immediately 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.739
 considered a great player there 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.290
 they will be great expectations but will start 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.230
 even with a real high an over al 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.780
 medium, however, will start with some decent ones 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.430
 good speed expectations 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.940
 in learning then in increasing 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.760
 the work is also a good good over 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.230
 at the beginning 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.970
 here instead guys line draft that 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.890
 practically there will be low 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.680
 expectations will start with an over all 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.320
 even lower so you can do it 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.410
 very very slowly grow 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.200
 player with time without just having to 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.000
 win by force or big 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.650
 expectations just as you see written 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.989
 there under the tag 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.209
 I will choose the leit round pick then 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.519
 an average choice where there is enough 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.519
 quietly there are expectations but 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.829
 they are not even very high 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.650
 here is the first part of the 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.930
 creation is over then name the 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.750
 position number of knit the hand with 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.909
 which you will throw the ball but from the college and 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.640
 then the nannies 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.989
 let's move on to the more complicated why 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.430
 you have to choose the height of the 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:46.639
 player 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:47.900
 we are on the 6 and 2 well guys at the end 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.940
 how chosen face that is 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.310
 simple enough 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:57.370
 the build for now I would say of 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.370
 keep this looking pretty good 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.180
 I'd say it's pretty good we see a 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.480
 At the moment there are other things to change 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.450
 no i would say no it's good enough 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.639
 rai obviously I don't want I don't want 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.980
 overdo it too much but I think it goes 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:18.099
 pretty well come on 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:20.690
 ok let's see the revolution helmet 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:24.320
 revolution speed that becomes in a bit 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.870
 the bigger I don't like very much we see yes 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.669
 increases a little 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.500
 so guys for now how is the 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.150
 chosen method this the viewer 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.030
 obviously I didn't do it completely 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.919
 dark but it's a bit faded then we'll see 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.430
 so much these things here can 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.320
 change later 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.699
 on the other side we modify the sleeves 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.460
 that you can choose between long 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:49.039
 I would say very short court averages 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.700
 I do not want but those bands there do not me 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.700
 like 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.790
 these I finally here is so it is 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.340
 really if I can do the 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:03.770
 gold right cuff 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.770
 ok ok 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:15.650
 for me it is fine so the stockings ok 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:17.750
 You don't see bulky shoes but me 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.730
 I would say that it can absolutely go like this 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.960
 the player to start so much then the 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.360
 most things can be done 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:28.550
 change later but I have to say that 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:34.550
 so it is a great player from is 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:36.530
 good enough from the start so there is 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.310
 this is just one of the little force 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.990
 we say negative traits of the del 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.330
 mobile quaterback here is what I have 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.880
 chosen the quaterback that mobile this 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.990
 it was one of the downside good guys 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.250
 I would say that the creation of 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.200
 character can end up like this 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.670
 we will start with the preseason so there 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.710
 will be four games of preparation 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.000
 at the real season they will be 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.340
 of the kind of friendly of 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.380
 preparation where I will have to try to 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.200
 earn the post as a visa holder 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.750
 that however the reds already have a 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.030
 quarterback who should have the 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.950
 my same energy my own verile 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.050
 so already in the first four games 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.930
 if I can doha to earn some 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.060
 experience point increase over al 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.550
 of my player I should be able to 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.560
 let's play it so let's start the 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.270
 season with this quaterback just 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.490
 arrived in the team very young just 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:29.680
 arrived from the schools he wants 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.680
 become a new star of the neshat
