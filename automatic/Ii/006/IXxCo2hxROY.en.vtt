gamebreaking<00:00:40.320> type<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.890> thing<00:00:41.100> instead<00:00:41.280> of

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
gamebreaking type of thing instead of

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
gamebreaking type of thing instead of
like<00:00:41.879> tryharding<00:00:42.600> trying<00:00:42.989> hard<00:00:43.260> isn't
