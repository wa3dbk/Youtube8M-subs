frequency case for the blackberry q10
this<00:00:14.320> is<00:00:14.440> the<00:00:14.559> case<00:00:14.769> here<00:00:15.009> so<00:00:15.070> you<00:00:15.339> can<00:00:15.460> see

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.830 
this is the case here so you can see
it's<00:00:15.759> not<00:00:15.879> really<00:00:16.180> anything<00:00:16.360> more<00:00:16.660> than<00:00:16.810> a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
it's not really anything more than a

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.990 
it's not really anything more than a
simple<00:00:17.140> skin<00:00:17.439> case<00:00:17.680> but<00:00:18.520> it's<00:00:18.700> actually<00:00:18.970> a

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
simple skin case but it's actually a

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.359 
simple skin case but it's actually a
good<00:00:19.119> one<00:00:19.300> it's<00:00:19.570> made<00:00:20.380> of<00:00:20.470> this<00:00:20.560> semi<00:00:21.189> rigid

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
good one it's made of this semi rigid

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.070 
good one it's made of this semi rigid
plastic<00:00:21.970> so<00:00:22.150> you<00:00:22.240> can<00:00:22.360> see<00:00:22.510> how<00:00:22.599> its<00:00:22.779> bendy

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
plastic so you can see how its bendy

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.550 
plastic so you can see how its bendy
here<00:00:23.289> but<00:00:23.410> it's<00:00:23.500> not<00:00:24.090> silicone<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:26.109> it<00:00:26.380> gives

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
here but it's not silicone so it gives

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.050 
here but it's not silicone so it gives
you<00:00:26.650> a<00:00:26.679> little<00:00:26.949> bit<00:00:27.160> more<00:00:27.279> protection<00:00:27.490> it's<00:00:27.970> a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
you a little bit more protection it's a

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.140 
you a little bit more protection it's a
little<00:00:28.300> harder<00:00:28.630> and<00:00:28.840> it<00:00:29.439> doesn't<00:00:29.679> have<00:00:29.800> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
little harder and it doesn't have the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.910 
little harder and it doesn't have the
lint<00:00:31.150> picker-upperer<00:00:31.840> ability<00:00:32.259> like<00:00:32.559> regular

stuff up it's got a kind of slick feel
to<00:00:40.900> it<00:00:41.049> so<00:00:41.409> it<00:00:41.500> makes<00:00:41.559> it<00:00:41.769> good<00:00:41.949> for<00:00:42.309> sliding<00:00:42.670> in

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
to it so it makes it good for sliding in

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.250 
to it so it makes it good for sliding in
and<00:00:43.059> out<00:00:43.150> of<00:00:43.210> your<00:00:43.330> pocket<00:00:43.690> but<00:00:43.870> at<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.080> same

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:45.549 
time you still have a decent amount of

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:47.460 
time you still have a decent amount of
grip<00:00:45.760> so<00:00:46.030> it's<00:00:46.239> good<00:00:46.900> for<00:00:46.960> that<00:00:47.170> and<00:00:47.320> then<00:00:47.409> you

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
grip so it's good for that and then you

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.710 
grip so it's good for that and then you
can<00:00:47.589> see<00:00:47.710> that<00:00:47.860> this<00:00:48.010> funky<00:00:48.420> frequency<00:00:49.420> design

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.420 
can see that this funky frequency design
here<00:00:50.019> just<00:00:50.680> more<00:00:50.860> you<00:00:51.129> know<00:00:51.220> a<00:00:51.250> little

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.280 
in and super simple just snaps in there
and<00:01:07.150> then<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.299> can<00:01:07.420> see<00:01:07.689> how<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:07.990> kind<00:01:08.110> of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
and then you can see how it kind of

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.830 
and then you can see how it kind of
wraps<00:01:08.500> up<00:01:08.710> around<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.130> sides<00:01:09.369> here<00:01:09.850> if<00:01:10.689> your

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
wraps up around the sides here if your

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.230 
wraps up around the sides here if your
openings<00:01:11.170> free<00:01:11.320> reports<00:01:11.679> and<00:01:11.920> your<00:01:12.729> headphone

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
openings free reports and your headphone

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.539 
openings free reports and your headphone
jack<00:01:13.270> up<00:01:13.630> top<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:14.200> then<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.619> lock<00:01:14.979> button<00:01:15.340> and

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
jack up top and then the lock button and

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.029 
jack up top and then the lock button and
the<00:01:16.210> volume<00:01:16.450> buttons<00:01:16.479> are<00:01:16.810> covered<00:01:17.079> up<00:01:17.229> and

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
the volume buttons are covered up and

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.560 
the volume buttons are covered up and
then<00:01:18.280> that's<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:18.640> so<00:01:18.939> it<00:01:19.060> wraps<00:01:19.240> up<00:01:19.359> around

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
then that's it so it wraps up around

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.090 
then that's it so it wraps up around
your<00:01:19.719> corners<00:01:20.079> so<00:01:20.259> this<00:01:20.380> is<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.679> this<00:01:20.859> is<00:01:20.979> kind

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
your corners so this is it this is kind

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.560 
your corners so this is it this is kind

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
drops on the pavement I've had a couple

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.090

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
pull your phone out and it ends up in

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.529 
pull your phone out and it ends up in
the<00:01:42.100> parking<00:01:42.399> lot<00:01:42.609> so<00:01:42.850> this<00:01:42.999> is<00:01:43.119> good<00:01:43.270> for<00:01:43.420> that

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
the parking lot so this is good for that

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:44.999 
the parking lot so this is good for that
because<00:01:43.659> it'll<00:01:43.899> keep<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.200> corners<00:01:44.469> protected

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
it does wrap up a little bit on the side

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.139 
it does wrap up a little bit on the side
so<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.439> can<00:01:47.530> put<00:01:47.710> your<00:01:47.740> device<00:01:47.920> face<00:01:48.249> down<00:01:48.520> and
