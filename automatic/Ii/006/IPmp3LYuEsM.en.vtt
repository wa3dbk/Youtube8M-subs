you<00:01:25.560> know<00:01:25.680> they're<00:01:25.860> pretty<00:01:26.189> decent<00:01:26.729> size<00:01:26.939> is

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
you know they're pretty decent size is

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.469 
you know they're pretty decent size is
they're<00:01:27.509> pretty<00:01:27.750> big<00:01:28.189> but<00:01:29.189> as<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> pilot<00:01:30.060> which

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
they're pretty big but as a pilot which

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.760 
they're pretty big but as a pilot which
is<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.810> people<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:32.250> really<00:01:33.210> can't<00:01:34.020> run<00:01:34.560> out

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
is the people you really can't run out

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.700 
is the people you really can't run out
in<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.979> open<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.820> too<00:01:36.540> long<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.110> you're<00:01:37.619> gonna

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
in the open for too long or you're gonna

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.280 
in the open for too long or you're gonna
get<00:01:37.950> destroyed<00:01:38.130> by<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:39.540> other<00:01:39.750> pilots

get destroyed by you know other pilots
that<00:01:40.409> are<00:01:40.560> positioning<00:01:41.490> themselves<00:01:41.520> better

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
that are positioning themselves better

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.149 
that are positioning themselves better
than<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:42.509> or<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> Titan<00:01:43.439> who<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.950> you

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
than you are or a Titan who is just you

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.530 
than you are or a Titan who is just you
know<00:01:44.280> walking<00:01:44.610> around<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.000> map<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.329> they

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
know walking around the map because they

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.240 
know walking around the map because they

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
call it so as a pilot you really need to

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.020

your<00:01:59.880> way<00:01:59.969> around<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.390> map<00:02:00.600> without<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:01.320> you

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
your way around the map without just you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.289 
your way around the map without just you
know<00:02:01.740> running<00:02:02.070> down<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> street<00:02:02.610> head<00:02:03.090> first

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
know running down the street head first

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.300 
know running down the street head first
cuz<00:02:03.630> it's<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:04.200> usually<00:02:04.619> doesn't<00:02:04.890> end<00:02:05.070> too<00:02:05.280> well

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
the map or to the best position for a

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.370 
the map or to the best position for a
pilot<00:02:24.440> is<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.400> try<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.640> find<00:02:25.970> high<00:02:26.300> ground<00:02:26.380> so

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
pilot is to try and find high ground so

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
which is I had enough fun and which

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:24.499 
which is I had enough fun and which
sucks<00:05:23.400> because<00:05:23.550> I<00:05:23.699> really<00:05:23.729> want<00:05:24.060> to<00:05:24.120> try<00:05:24.389> out

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
sucks because I really want to try out

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.869 
sucks because I really want to try out
the<00:05:24.599> sniper<00:05:24.870> but<00:05:25.469> with<00:05:26.129> the<00:05:26.249> connection<00:05:26.729> that

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:26.879 
the sniper but with the connection that

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:30.110 
the sniper but with the connection that
we<00:05:26.969> have<00:05:26.999> it's<00:05:27.629> so<00:05:27.900> hard<00:05:28.830> for<00:05:29.099> me<00:05:29.339> to<00:05:29.909> use<00:05:30.089> a

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
we have it's so hard for me to use a

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.179 
we have it's so hard for me to use a
sniper<00:05:30.539> it's<00:05:31.139> probably<00:05:31.319> a<00:05:31.529> combination<00:05:31.770> of

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:32.189 
sniper it's probably a combination of

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:34.070 
sniper it's probably a combination of
you<00:05:32.460> know<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:32.729> connection<00:05:33.029> as<00:05:33.449> well<00:05:33.599> as<00:05:33.839> may

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
you know the connection as well as may

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.839 
you know the connection as well as may
not<00:05:34.259> being<00:05:34.500> used<00:05:34.680> to<00:05:34.919> using<00:05:35.310> that<00:05:35.550> sort<00:05:35.759> of

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
not being used to using that sort of

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.600 
not being used to using that sort of
sniper<00:05:36.139> but<00:05:37.139> yeah<00:05:37.589> you<00:05:37.650> have<00:05:37.949> to<00:05:37.979> sort<00:05:38.400> of<00:05:38.460> like

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
sniper but yeah you have to sort of like

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.300 
sniper but yeah you have to sort of like
i'ma<00:05:38.879> head<00:05:39.210> of<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.419> person<00:05:39.900> to<00:05:40.139> get<00:05:40.949> the<00:05:41.129> kill

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
i'ma head of the person to get the kill

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.189 
i'ma head of the person to get the kill
with<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.580> sniper<00:05:41.789> and<00:05:42.180> its<00:05:42.719> really

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
with the sniper and its really

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.480 
with the sniper and its really
frustrating<00:05:43.409> so<00:05:43.889> i<00:05:43.919> don't<00:05:44.219> think<00:05:44.399> i'll<00:05:44.460> be

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
frustrating so i don't think i'll be

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.219 
frustrating so i don't think i'll be
doing<00:05:44.669> any<00:05:44.879> sniper<00:05:45.270> game<00:05:45.419> plays<00:05:45.599> for<00:05:45.810> you<00:05:46.020> guys

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
doing any sniper game plays for you guys

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.129 
doing any sniper game plays for you guys
because<00:05:46.979> I<00:05:47.069> just<00:05:47.370> can't<00:05:47.639> get<00:05:48.270> any<00:05:48.449> kills<00:05:48.779> of<00:05:48.990> it

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
because I just can't get any kills of it

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.829 
because I just can't get any kills of it
because<00:05:49.740> it's<00:05:50.159> it's<00:05:50.520> very<00:05:50.759> hard<00:05:51.029> to<00:05:51.120> sort<00:05:51.779> of

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:51.839 
because it's it's very hard to sort of

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:54.619 
because it's it's very hard to sort of
judge<00:05:52.110> that<00:05:52.409> lag<00:05:52.649> because<00:05:53.610> we<00:05:54.330> don't<00:05:54.509> have

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:54.629 
judge that lag because we don't have

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.399 
judge that lag because we don't have
servers<00:05:55.409> which<00:05:55.649> really<00:05:55.979> bums<00:05:56.310> me<00:05:56.460> out<00:05:56.580> but

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
servers which really bums me out but

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:59.559 
servers which really bums me out but
hopefully<00:05:58.409> hopefully<00:05:58.740> there<00:05:59.039> comes<00:05:59.189> soon

00:05:59.559 --> 00:05:59.569 
hopefully hopefully there comes soon

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.820 
hopefully hopefully there comes soon
probably<00:06:00.569> won't<00:06:00.839> it's<00:06:01.229> probably<00:06:01.500> gonna<00:06:01.740> be

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
probably won't it's probably gonna be

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.339 
probably won't it's probably gonna be
until<00:06:02.189> the<00:06:02.279> end<00:06:02.430> of<00:06:02.490> the<00:06:02.550> year<00:06:02.610> but<00:06:03.300> oh<00:06:03.599> uh<00:06:03.899> it's
