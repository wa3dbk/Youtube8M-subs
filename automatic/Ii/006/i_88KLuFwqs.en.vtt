00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.930
 no car 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.000
 we have an engine 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.049
 they move 4 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.930
 at 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.119
 there was a bad symptom and form 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.990
 bad traction 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:30.500
 vibration dips in general tripling overall 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.780
 everything in the world was replaced candles in general 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:39.140
 as if the result did not give decided 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:46.160
 check the coils and strictly speaking 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:48.140
 checked how to check check 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.879
 easy enough 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.059
 then translate the multimeter here it is 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.059
 position 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:01.140
 200 he can not observe the polarity 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.700
 we connect the red wire 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.770
 than to two extremely creamy vodka this 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.780
 Extremely and here's how to connect the screen 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.070
 We look indications given the error 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.520
 Of course there is a multimeter there somewhere 0508 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.660
 there he has to show it as 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.660
 margo limits 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:29.610
 that is, it works the primary winding 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:37.160
 more exhibit river winding if us 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:43.770
 need to translate to 2000 kilo 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:47.610
 multimeter red red wire we 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:52.369
 we catch on the spring here on black 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.729
 spray behind the center and center ears 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.369
 cleat 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.970
 glue and somewhere has to show there is not 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.989
 I remember the waves there 345 kilo or there the whole 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.560
 45 there a student and so here I have on 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:09.830
 one of the four coils on the secondary on 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.610
 check when checking the secondary winding 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.650
 did not show 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.870
 nothing at all silence 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:22.829
 and everything from here goes to Ukraine 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:29.629
 fuel everyone else is connected and so 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:31.470
 what do you mean there is such a general 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.879
 ignition module 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.840
 ignition coil to be replaced all 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.840
 Thanks for attention
