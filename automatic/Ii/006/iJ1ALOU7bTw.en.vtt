00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
tricky doing the stuff it could be way

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.000 
tricky doing the stuff it could be way
more<00:02:52.700> difficult<00:02:53.120> than<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.750> really<00:02:54.010> Trek

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
more difficult than that really Trek

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.280 
more difficult than that really Trek
crap<00:02:57.880> they're<00:02:58.880> still<00:02:59.210> managed<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.660> actually

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
crap they're still managed it actually

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
and we've got it next is jump and stop

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.680 
and we've got it next is jump and stop
you<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:06.110> think<00:03:06.200> this<00:03:06.500> is<00:03:06.650> already<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.010> last<00:03:07.340> one
