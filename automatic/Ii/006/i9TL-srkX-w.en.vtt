write essays about but I think the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.750 
write essays about but I think the
learning<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:01.079> actually<00:01:01.440> happen<00:01:01.649> only<00:01:02.309> when

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
learning can actually happen only when

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.600 
learning can actually happen only when
you<00:01:02.879> go<00:01:03.210> there<00:01:03.480> that's<00:01:04.320> where<00:01:05.039> the<00:01:05.070> growth

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
you go there that's where the growth

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.560 
you go there that's where the growth
occurs<00:01:06.149> the<00:01:06.390> most<00:01:07.399> you<00:01:08.399> don't<00:01:08.610> realize<00:01:08.910> how

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
occurs the most you don't realize how

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.389 
occurs the most you don't realize how
important<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.259> you<00:01:10.560> until<00:01:10.950> afterward

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
important it is to you until afterward

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.580 
important it is to you until afterward
it's<00:01:12.000> kind<00:01:12.179> of<00:01:12.209> like<00:01:12.360> conquering<00:01:12.899> things<00:01:13.259> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
it's kind of like conquering things and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.710 
it's kind of like conquering things and
then<00:01:13.950> by<00:01:14.729> doing<00:01:14.759> that<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.179> kind<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.420> conquer

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
then by doing that you kind of conquer

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.380 
then by doing that you kind of conquer
something<00:01:15.929> in<00:01:16.170> yourself

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.180

that what you're doing with something
that's<00:01:33.760> what<00:01:34.030> makes<00:01:34.210> it<00:01:34.330> worth<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:38.820> takes

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
that's what makes it worth it takes
