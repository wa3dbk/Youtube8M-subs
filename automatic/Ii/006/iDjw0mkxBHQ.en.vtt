00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
of a pita if you want to call it that so

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.039 
of a pita if you want to call it that so
video<00:01:38.159> light<00:01:38.430> bracket<00:01:38.790> light<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.780> camera

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
video light bracket light the camera

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.660 
video light bracket light the camera
goes<00:01:40.140> right<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.409> here<00:01:40.710> i<00:01:40.860> assume<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> light

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
goes right on here i assume the light

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
goes right on here i assume the light
goes<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.060> somewhere<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.869> don't<00:01:43.140> know<00:01:43.229> we'll

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
goes on somewhere I don't know we'll

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.960 
goes on somewhere I don't know we'll
find<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.430> now<00:01:44.520> we'll<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.729> go<00:01:44.909> ahead

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
find it but for now we'll just go ahead

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.649 
find it but for now we'll just go ahead
and<00:01:45.060> take<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.329> out<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.630> package<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
and take this out of the package and

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.139 
and take this out of the package and
here<00:01:48.659> we<00:01:48.720> go<00:01:48.750> pretty<00:01:49.290> straightforward<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:51.060> it

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
here we go pretty straightforward so it

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.399 
here we go pretty straightforward so it
looks<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.570> guy<00:01:51.750> screws<00:01:52.110> into<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
looks like this guy screws into the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.319 
looks like this guy screws into the
bottom<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.860> camera<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.520> light<00:01:54.299> is

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
bottom of the camera and the light is

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.719 
bottom of the camera and the light is
somehow<00:01:54.689> mounted<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.350> these<00:01:55.590> guys<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.189> i'll<00:01:56.340> go

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
somehow mounted on these guys so i'll go

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.830 
somehow mounted on these guys so i'll go
ahead<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.909> figure<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.299> out<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
ahead and figure that out in just a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.359 
ahead and figure that out in just a
minute<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.860> now<00:01:58.920> i'm<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.280> go<00:01:59.340> ahead

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
minute but for now i'm going to go ahead

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.310 
minute but for now i'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:59.490> all<00:01:59.759> this<00:01:59.909> out<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.240> way<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.750> we'll

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
and all this out of the way and we'll

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.870 
and all this out of the way and we'll
bring<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> star<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.280> show<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.640> once

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
bring in the star of the show here once

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.450 
bring in the star of the show here once
again<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> CN<00:02:03.630> 126<00:02:04.530> i<00:02:04.710> think<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.159> was<00:02:05.340> like

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
again the CN 126 i think this was like

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.219 
again the CN 126 i think this was like
30<00:02:05.820> bucks<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.270> amazon<00:02:06.390> or<00:02:06.750> something<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.079> was<00:02:07.170> a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
30 bucks on amazon or something it was a

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.749 
30 bucks on amazon or something it was a
pretty<00:02:07.380> good<00:02:07.560> deal<00:02:07.740> for<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.459> amount<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.700> light

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
pretty good deal for the amount of light

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.969 
pretty good deal for the amount of light
that<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.209> thing<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.450> put<00:02:09.690> off<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.679> i<00:02:10.800> highly

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that this thing can put off and i highly

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.350 
that this thing can put off and i highly
doubt<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.310> are<00:02:11.489> we<00:02:11.580> gonna<00:02:11.670> be<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:11.940> like<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.090> full

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
doubt it are we gonna be in like a full

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.940 
doubt it are we gonna be in like a full
night<00:02:12.720> situation<00:02:13.379> where<00:02:13.470> I'm<00:02:13.530> going

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
night situation where I'm going

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.490 
night situation where I'm going
huge<00:02:14.250> light<00:02:14.520> like<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.879> but<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.330> really<00:02:16.110> didn't

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
huge light like this but I really didn't

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.320 
huge light like this but I really didn't
get<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.709> really<00:02:16.860> know<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.129> full<00:02:17.459> LED<00:02:17.730> effect

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
get this really know the full LED effect

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.119 
get this really know the full LED effect
but<00:02:18.569> really<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.170> can<00:02:19.319> like<00:02:19.980> i<00:02:20.040> said

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
but really just so I can like i said

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.710 
but really just so I can like i said
this<00:02:20.370> does<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.790> probably<00:02:21.239> can't<00:02:21.450> see<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.629> in

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
this does you probably can't see it in

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.320 
this does you probably can't see it in
the<00:02:21.810> picture<00:02:21.840> barely<00:02:22.709> but<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.459> does<00:02:23.610> have<00:02:23.790> in

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
the picture barely but it does have in

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.610 
the picture barely but it does have in
fact<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.569> little<00:02:24.780> dimmer<00:02:24.989> on<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.410> i<00:02:25.470> don't

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
fact a little dimmer on it so i don't

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.660 
fact a little dimmer on it so i don't
have<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.769> have<00:02:25.920> these<00:02:26.040> at<00:02:26.190> full<00:02:26.459> brightness

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
have to have these at full brightness

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.910 
have to have these at full brightness
the<00:02:27.090> whole<00:02:27.209> time<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:28.170> it'll<00:02:28.319> be<00:02:28.349> nice<00:02:28.590> for<00:02:28.620> my

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
the whole time so it'll be nice for my

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.190 
the whole time so it'll be nice for my
videos<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:30.300> actually<00:02:30.420> think<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.810> does<00:02:31.019> come

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
videos so actually think this does come

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.270 
videos so actually think this does come
with<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.349> battery<00:02:31.500> looks<00:02:31.830> like<00:02:31.980> this<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.220> a

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
with a battery looks like this is a

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.580 
with a battery looks like this is a
battery<00:02:32.610> charger<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:36.330> enjoy<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.440> light

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
battery charger and enjoy the light

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.789 
battery charger and enjoy the light
itself<00:02:38.420> taking<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.510> out<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.110> bag<00:02:40.290> so

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
itself taking it out of the bag so

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.170 
itself taking it out of the bag so
that's<00:02:40.950> where<00:02:41.099> your<00:02:41.190> big<00:02:41.370> battery<00:02:41.730> pack<00:02:41.910> goes

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
that's where your big battery pack goes

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.910 
that's where your big battery pack goes
here's<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.900> little<00:02:43.049> dimmer<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.530> was<00:02:43.769> just

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
here's that little dimmer I was just

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.820 
here's that little dimmer I was just
talking<00:02:44.340> about<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.879> this<00:02:45.269> low<00:02:45.450> dude<00:02:45.660> can<00:02:46.620> come

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
talking about and this low dude can come

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.860 
talking about and this low dude can come
off<00:02:46.980> giving<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> full<00:02:47.819> LED<00:02:48.090> effect<00:02:48.660> I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
off giving you a full LED effect I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.390 
off giving you a full LED effect I
believe<00:02:49.380> there<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.680> hundred<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.130> twenty

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
believe there is a hundred and twenty

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.370 
believe there is a hundred and twenty
six<00:02:50.730> LEDs<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.209> think<00:02:51.450> that's<00:02:51.569> what<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.750> 126

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
six LEDs I think that's what the 126

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.559 
six LEDs I think that's what the 126
stands<00:02:52.620> for<00:02:52.890> in<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.040> model<00:02:53.310> number<00:02:53.549> but<00:02:54.390> I

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
stands for in the model number but I

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.069 
stands for in the model number but I
believe<00:02:54.780> are<00:02:54.930> 126<00:02:55.680> LED<00:02:56.160> lights<00:02:56.370> on<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:56.790> guy

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
believe are 126 LED lights on that guy

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.300 
believe are 126 LED lights on that guy
so<00:02:58.079> actually<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.440> don't<00:02:58.530> think<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.040> comes

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
so actually I don't think this comes

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.400 
so actually I don't think this comes
with<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.670> battery<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.660> anyway<00:03:00.989> moving<00:03:01.170> on

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
with the battery but anyway moving on

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.990 
with the battery but anyway moving on
here<00:03:01.980> we<00:03:02.160> just<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.430> some<00:03:02.640> more<00:03:02.819> like

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
here we just have some more like
