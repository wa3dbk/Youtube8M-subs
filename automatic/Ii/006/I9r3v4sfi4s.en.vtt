00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.909
 A) Yes 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.109
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.300
 trick of the week today 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.029
 let's see something very simple but that 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.710
 sometimes it can cause some problem about 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.930
 all for users who have already 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.219
 enough time in mac this has changed 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.770
 with the new version of u s10 mountain 

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:35.900
 layer so let's explain how 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.580
 remove icons from the dock 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.860
 to start we have here some icons 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.440
 of the dock and we're going to explain two methods 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.850
 before, simply doing so has already been 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.260
 removed 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.260
 but now this does not happen 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.820
 as we can see it returns to your site like this 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.770
 that we are going to explain two methods the 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.700
 first is simply drag the 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.370
 icon to the trash what it says remove 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.770
 of the dock let's go and we already have it 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.840
 eliminated and the other method although 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.620
 It seems silly is that we can not 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.580
 do this gesture too quickly 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:17.960
 we have to do it slowly for 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.030
 that the delete and 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.920
 we also can not do it very little 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.160
 separated because if we separate it very little 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.960
 that icon will never appear if 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.040
 let's separate more will come a moment 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.810
 that if not and if then those are both 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.880
 methods first drag to the trash 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.149
 to eliminate the dock and second 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.460
 drag up slowly and quite 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.130
 separated from the bar so that you can 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.550
 eliminate once we have eliminated the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.350
 icons then we have finished 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.030
 so this trick was very simple 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.910
 but we preferred to do it in video 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.320
 so everything is clearer so if 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.450
 You liked the video, I like it 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.460
 share it and follow us in the presence 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.560
 dotcom for new and new videos 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.730
 articles about apple we'll see you in a 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.730
 next trick of the week
