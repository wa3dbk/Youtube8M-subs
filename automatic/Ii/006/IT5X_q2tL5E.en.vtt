megapixels<00:00:43.890> which<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.790> bump<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.150> from<00:00:45.390> 16

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
megapixels which is the bump up from 16

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.710 
megapixels which is the bump up from 16
that's<00:00:46.620> about<00:00:47.190> twenty<00:00:48.000> twenty<00:00:48.420> two<00:00:48.570> percent

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
that's about twenty twenty two percent

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.140 
that's about twenty twenty two percent
increase<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.350> pixels<00:00:49.949> on<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> length<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
increase in pixels on the length and the

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.469 
increase in pixels on the length and the
width<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:52.140> goes<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.589> from<00:00:52.979> just<00:00:53.850> under<00:00:54.059> five

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.700 
six thousand pixels across on the d7
d100<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.510> are<00:01:03.600> getting<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.260> little<00:01:04.470> more

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
d100 so you are getting a little more

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.700 
d100 so you are getting a little more
resolution<00:01:05.750> nikon<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.930> really<00:01:07.229> pushing<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
resolution nikon is really pushing the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.950 
resolution nikon is really pushing the
limits<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.220> their<00:01:08.580> their<00:01:09.090> sensors<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.780> terms

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
limits of their their sensors in terms

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.540 
limits of their their sensors in terms
of<00:01:10.050> cost<00:01:10.290> small<00:01:10.620> dick<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.920> make<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.160> pixels

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
of cost small dick and make the pixels

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.950 
of cost small dick and make the pixels
but<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.660> far<00:01:12.870> every<00:01:13.260> camera<00:01:13.710> its<00:01:13.950> work<00:01:14.280> great

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
but so far every camera its work great

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.630 
but so far every camera its work great
to<00:01:15.960> squeeze<00:01:16.230> out<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.440> little<00:01:16.680> more<00:01:16.920> detail<00:01:17.400> they

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
to squeeze out a little more detail they

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.150 
to squeeze out a little more detail they
have<00:01:17.820> completely<00:01:18.330> removed<00:01:19.050> what's<00:01:19.650> called<00:01:19.890> an

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
have completely removed what's called an

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.430 
have completely removed what's called an
alias<00:01:20.880> filter<00:01:21.470> from<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> camera<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:24.110> that<00:01:25.110> did

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
alias filter from the camera to that did

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.400 
alias filter from the camera to that did
a<00:01:25.560> slight<00:01:25.920> amount<00:01:26.190> of<00:01:26.340> blurring<00:01:27.410> nikon

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
a slight amount of blurring nikon

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.170 
a slight amount of blurring nikon
probably<00:01:28.980> feels<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.370> this<00:01:29.520> filter<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:29.910> no

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
probably feels that this filter is no

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.240 
probably feels that this filter is no
longer<00:01:30.450> needed<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.020> they<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.290> do<00:01:31.470> any<00:01:31.830> any

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
longer needed that they can do any any

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.000 
longer needed that they can do any any
changes<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.940> end<00:01:33.210> software<00:01:33.560> which<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.740> great

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
changes the end software which is great

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.970 
changes the end software which is great
so<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.300> a<00:01:36.330> new<00:01:36.510> camera<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.710> more

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
so you have a new camera with with more

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.300 
so you have a new camera with with more
Maxim<00:01:38.340> megapixels<00:01:39.030> which<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.230> think<00:01:40.500> macro

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
Maxim megapixels which I think macro

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.280 
Maxim megapixels which I think macro
photographers<00:01:41.940> will<00:01:42.390> notice<00:01:42.690> is<00:01:42.870> the<00:01:43.020> best

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
photographers will notice is the best

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.490 
photographers will notice is the best
I'm<00:01:43.830> not<00:01:44.250> sure<00:01:44.520> if<00:01:44.820> underwater<00:01:45.810> shooting

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
I'm not sure if underwater shooting

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.870 
I'm not sure if underwater shooting
through<00:01:46.800> water<00:01:47.010> if<00:01:47.250> you'll<00:01:47.400> be<00:01:47.490> able<00:01:47.550> to<00:01:47.670> see

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
through water if you'll be able to see

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.910 
through water if you'll be able to see
that<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.330> extra<00:01:48.690> detail<00:01:49.080> with<00:01:49.350> wide<00:01:49.590> angle

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
that that extra detail with wide angle

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.460 
that that extra detail with wide angle
lenses<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.550> will<00:01:50.700> find<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:52.110> biggest

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
lenses but we will find out the biggest

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.560 
lenses but we will find out the biggest
change<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.920> me<00:01:53.190> is<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.120> autofocus

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
change to me is is in the autofocus

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.960 
change to me is is in the autofocus
because<00:01:55.110> i<00:01:55.140> had<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.440> d300<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.400> when<00:01:56.490> i<00:01:56.520> moved<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
because i had a d300 and when i moved to

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.290 
because i had a d300 and when i moved to
the<00:01:57.170> d7000<00:01:58.170> i<00:01:58.290> felt<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.800> autofocus

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
the d7000 i felt like the autofocus

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.899 
the d7000 i felt like the autofocus
what's<00:02:00.300> not<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.659> good<00:02:00.840> now<00:02:01.229> there's<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.560> new

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
what's not as good now there's a new

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.390 
what's not as good now there's a new
51-point<00:02:02.909> autofocus<00:02:03.780> system<00:02:04.170> built<00:02:04.950> into<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
51-point autofocus system built into the

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.109 
51-point autofocus system built into the
d70<00:02:06.090> 100<00:02:06.680> in<00:02:07.680> addition<00:02:08.280> they<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.489> this<00:02:08.849> one

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
d70 100 in addition they have this one

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.369 
d70 100 in addition they have this one
low<00:02:10.080> light<00:02:10.319> sensor<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.190> center<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.970> is

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
low light sensor in the center that is

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.780 
low light sensor in the center that is
supposed<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.440> be<00:02:13.530> very<00:02:13.800> good<00:02:14.010> at<00:02:14.130> focusing<00:02:14.310> in

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
supposed to be very good at focusing in

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.940 
supposed to be very good at focusing in
low<00:02:14.940> light<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.500> hopefully<00:02:16.500> for<00:02:16.770> low<00:02:16.920> light

with<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.110> 60<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.650> 105<00:02:20.069> millimeter<00:02:20.370> lens<00:02:20.849> that

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
with the 60 the 105 millimeter lens that

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.390 
with the 60 the 105 millimeter lens that
the<00:02:21.330> d70<00:02:21.930> 100<00:02:22.409> will<00:02:22.530> be<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> nice<00:02:22.920> improvement

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
the d70 100 will be a nice improvement

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.930 
the d70 100 will be a nice improvement
over<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.170> d7000<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.319> is<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:26.489> me<00:02:26.640> what<00:02:26.849> I'm

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
over the d7000 this is to me what I'm

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.729 
over the d7000 this is to me what I'm
hoping<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.450> best<00:02:27.840> feature<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.319> this<00:02:28.530> new

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
hoping is the best feature of this new

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.009 
hoping is the best feature of this new
camera<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.819> also<00:02:29.970> has<00:02:30.299> a<00:02:30.330> great<00:02:30.599> new<00:02:30.780> feature

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
camera it also has a great new feature

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.759 
camera it also has a great new feature
called<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.470> 1.3<00:02:32.370> x<00:02:32.519> crop<00:02:32.879> mode<00:02:33.120> now<00:02:34.049> you<00:02:34.620> can

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
called a 1.3 x crop mode now you can

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.380 
called a 1.3 x crop mode now you can
always<00:02:35.010> take<00:02:35.190> an<00:02:35.340> image<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.819> crop<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.269> in

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
always take an image and crop it in

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.330 
always take an image and crop it in
post-processing<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.620> nice<00:02:37.799> thing<00:02:38.010> about<00:02:38.040> an

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
post-processing the nice thing about an

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.220 
post-processing the nice thing about an
in-camera<00:02:38.700> crop<00:02:39.150> mode<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.079> actually

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
in-camera crop mode is that you actually

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.750 
in-camera crop mode is that you actually
see<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.680> cropped<00:02:40.950> image<00:02:41.129> in<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.549> viewfinder

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
see the cropped image in the viewfinder

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.539 
see the cropped image in the viewfinder
that's<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.720> focus<00:02:42.959> mode<00:02:43.440> focus<00:02:43.950> points<00:02:44.340> are

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
that's the focus mode focus points are

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.830 
that's the focus mode focus points are
on<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.360> new<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:46.230> new<00:02:46.379> cropped<00:02:46.739> image<00:02:47.840> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
on the new the new cropped image the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.160 
on the new the new cropped image the
videos<00:02:49.200> on<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.560> cropped<00:02:49.829> image<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.640> it's<00:02:51.170> it's

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
videos on the cropped image so it's it's

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.319 
videos on the cropped image so it's it's
really<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> nice<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:53.160> nice<00:02:53.430> feature<00:02:53.730> for<00:02:53.910> getting

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
really a nice a nice feature for getting

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.789 
really a nice a nice feature for getting
a<00:02:54.390> little<00:02:54.510> extra<00:02:55.019> reach<00:02:55.230> with<00:02:55.440> all<00:02:55.620> your

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
a little extra reach with all your

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:56.930 
a little extra reach with all your
lenses<00:02:56.129> and<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.430> think<00:02:56.640> it'll<00:02:56.819> be<00:02:56.849> really

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
lenses and I think it'll be really

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.500 
lenses and I think it'll be really
useful<00:02:57.359> for<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.019> tokina<00:02:58.379> 10<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.829> 17<00:02:59.480> when<00:03:00.480> you

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
useful for the tokina 10 to 17 when you

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.509 
useful for the tokina 10 to 17 when you
have<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.019> fish<00:03:01.440> or<00:03:01.650> sharp<00:03:01.890> that's<00:03:02.129> not<00:03:02.310> that

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
have a fish or sharp that's not that

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.360 
have a fish or sharp that's not that
close<00:03:03.049> that<00:03:04.049> you<00:03:04.079> want<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.530> get<00:03:04.709> that<00:03:05.010> little

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
close that you want to get that little

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.000 
close that you want to get that little
extra<00:03:05.609> reach<00:03:06.030> with<00:03:06.239> your<00:03:06.269> lens<00:03:06.690> it'll<00:03:07.680> it'll

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
extra reach with your lens it'll it'll

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.009 
extra reach with your lens it'll it'll
help<00:03:08.250> they<00:03:08.430> have<00:03:08.579> that<00:03:08.700> 1.3<00:03:09.150> expert<00:03:09.599> mode<00:03:09.810> and

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
help they have that 1.3 expert mode and

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.990 
help they have that 1.3 expert mode and
you're<00:03:10.500> still<00:03:10.709> getting<00:03:10.829> 15<00:03:11.310> mega<00:03:11.519> pixels

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
you're still getting 15 mega pixels

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000 
you're still getting 15 mega pixels
which<00:03:12.239> is<00:03:12.420> way<00:03:12.930> more<00:03:13.170> than<00:03:13.349> almost<00:03:13.500> anyone

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
which is way more than almost anyone

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.750 
which is way more than almost anyone
needs<00:03:14.250> for<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.519> photo<00:03:14.819> so<00:03:15.659> the<00:03:15.959> 1.3<00:03:16.560> crop<00:03:17.489> mode

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
needs for a photo so the 1.3 crop mode

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.920 
needs for a photo so the 1.3 crop mode
isn't<00:03:18.299> going<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.540> be<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.629> really<00:03:18.810> useful

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
isn't going to be a really useful

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.690 
isn't going to be a really useful
feature<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.739> think<00:03:20.040> people<00:03:20.190> are<00:03:20.400> going<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.609> be

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
feature I think people are going to be

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.059 
feature I think people are going to be
using<00:03:20.849> a<00:03:21.120> lot<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.959> has<00:03:22.079> some<00:03:22.319> improvements<00:03:22.919> to

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
using a lot it has some improvements to

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.699 
using a lot it has some improvements to
the<00:03:23.220> auto<00:03:23.400> ISO<00:03:24.030> feature<00:03:24.329> which<00:03:24.780> which<00:03:25.109> people

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
the auto ISO feature which which people

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.620 
the auto ISO feature which which people
probably<00:03:26.069> don't<00:03:26.220> use<00:03:26.549> enough<00:03:26.700> especially<00:03:27.180> for

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
probably don't use enough especially for

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.039 
probably don't use enough especially for
topside<00:03:28.079> sports<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.739> wildlife<00:03:29.130> photography

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
topside sports and wildlife photography

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.330 
topside sports and wildlife photography
generally<00:03:31.049> when<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.230> have<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.410> zoom<00:03:31.680> lens<00:03:31.739> like

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
generally when you have a zoom lens like

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.610 
generally when you have a zoom lens like
say<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:32.760> 82<00:03:33.180> four<00:03:33.389> hundred<00:03:33.780> or<00:03:33.900> 200<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.379> 400

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
say the 82 four hundred or 200 to 400

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.280 
say the 82 four hundred or 200 to 400
zoom<00:03:35.010> lens<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:36.209> want<00:03:36.389> to<00:03:36.480> use<00:03:36.629> faster<00:03:37.049> shutter

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
zoom lens you want to use faster shutter

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.409 
zoom lens you want to use faster shutter
speeds<00:03:37.650> for<00:03:37.859> longer<00:03:38.250> zoom<00:03:38.459> lights<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.150> their

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
speeds for longer zoom lights so their

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.530 
speeds for longer zoom lights so their
new<00:03:39.569> auto<00:03:39.870> is<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:40.590> feature<00:03:40.980> allows<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.239> set

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
new auto is so feature allows you to set

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.539 
new auto is so feature allows you to set
faster<00:03:43.109> shutter<00:03:43.379> speed<00:03:43.709> limits<00:03:44.040> for<00:03:44.190> longer

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
faster shutter speed limits for longer

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.059 
faster shutter speed limits for longer
zooms<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:45.090> think<00:03:45.269> it'll<00:03:45.389> be<00:03:45.450> really<00:03:45.540> nice<00:03:46.019> for

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
zooms I think it'll be really nice for

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.710 
zooms I think it'll be really nice for
for<00:03:47.069> bird<00:03:47.250> photography<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:48.180> for<00:03:48.419> for

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
for bird photography and for for

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.080 
for bird photography and for for
wildlife<00:03:49.139> photography<00:03:49.799> and<00:03:49.949> sports<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.910> has<00:03:51.060> a

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
wildlife photography and sports it has a

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.849 
wildlife photography and sports it has a
new<00:03:51.329> spot<00:03:51.599> white<00:03:51.840> balance<00:03:52.230> feature<00:03:52.470> which

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
new spot white balance feature which

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.949 
new spot white balance feature which
could<00:03:53.160> be<00:03:53.280> very<00:03:53.609> useful<00:03:53.699> for<00:03:54.060> video<00:03:54.510> shooters

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
could be very useful for video shooters

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.629 
could be very useful for video shooters
instead<00:03:55.349> of<00:03:55.680> using<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.980> whole<00:03:56.190> screen<00:03:56.370> for

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
instead of using the whole screen for

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.460 
instead of using the whole screen for
video<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:57.030> can<00:03:57.299> designate<00:03:57.480> just<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.139> center

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470
