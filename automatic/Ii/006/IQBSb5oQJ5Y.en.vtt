rowboat level three

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.610 
rowboat level three
I<00:00:47.010> mean<00:00:47.280> armor<00:00:47.579> level<00:00:47.879> three<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.329> will<00:00:49.200> not<00:00:49.440> be

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
I mean armor level three you will not be

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.930 
I mean armor level three you will not be
able<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.129> without<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.550> armor<00:00:50.850> at

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
able to do this without the armor at

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.939 
able to do this without the armor at
level<00:00:51.210> three<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.690> then<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.320> need<00:00:52.500> level

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
level three and then you need level

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.760 
level three and then you need level
three<00:00:53.219> even<00:00:53.760> either<00:00:54.059> damage<00:00:54.840> for<00:00:55.050> harpoons<00:00:55.469> or

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
three even either damage for harpoons or

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.799 
three even either damage for harpoons or
a<00:00:55.800> harpoon<00:00:56.250> storage<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.300> will<00:00:57.449> not<00:00:57.629> be

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
a harpoon storage it will not be

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.049 
a harpoon storage it will not be
possible<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.320> do<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:58.920> one<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.789> those<00:00:59.879> is

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
possible to do this if one of those is

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.420 
possible to do this if one of those is
at<00:01:00.210> least<00:01:00.449> not<00:01:00.690> level<00:01:01.079> three<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.309> have

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
at least not level three and if you have

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.280 
at least not level three and if you have
level<00:01:02.609> three<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.030> everything<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.140> will

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
level three for everything and this will

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.280 
level three for everything and this will
that'll<00:01:04.949> definitely<00:01:05.159> make<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.700> much<00:01:06.030> easier

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
that'll definitely make this much easier

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.810 
that'll definitely make this much easier
so<00:01:07.290> basically<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.369> any<00:01:08.580> other

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
so basically just like any other

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.880 
so basically just like any other
harpooning<00:01:09.540> experience<00:01:10.110> you're<00:01:10.260> gonna<00:01:10.350> need

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
harpooning experience you're gonna need

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.580 
harpooning experience you're gonna need
to<00:01:11.070> throw<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> initial<00:01:11.909> rope<00:01:12.170> harpoon<00:01:13.170> at<00:01:13.409> it

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
to throw the initial rope harpoon at it

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.010 
to throw the initial rope harpoon at it
and<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:14.250> basically<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.880> chug<00:01:15.240> harpoons<00:01:15.750> at

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
and then basically just chug harpoons at

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.960 
and then basically just chug harpoons at
that<00:01:16.200> will<00:01:16.380> try<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.040> hit<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.400> head<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.790> much<00:01:17.909> as

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
that will try to hit the head as much as

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.320 
that will try to hit the head as much as
you<00:01:18.180> possibly<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.820> make<00:01:20.820> sure<00:01:21.090> that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you possibly can and make sure that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.800 
you possibly can and make sure that
you're<00:01:21.509> always<00:01:21.810> holding<00:01:22.560> back<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.810> harpoon

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you're always holding back the harpoon

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.660 
you're always holding back the harpoon
throw<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.590> make<00:01:25.710> sure<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> maximum

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
throw to make sure you get the maximum

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.670 
throw to make sure you get the maximum
amount<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.939> damage<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.500> white

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
amount of damage that is the white

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.390 
amount of damage that is the white
whale's<00:01:28.920> tail<00:01:29.310> attack<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.159> be

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
whale's tail attack and it can be

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.640 
whale's tail attack and it can be
prevented<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.150> hit<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> tail<00:01:33.840> before<00:01:34.439> it

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
prevented if you hit the tail before it

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.170 
prevented if you hit the tail before it
hits<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.509> will<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.700> amount<00:01:39.060> of

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
hits you it will do that amount of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.030 
hits you it will do that amount of
damage<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.780> seemed<00:01:40.079> unseen<00:01:40.619> right<00:01:40.829> now

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
damage that you seemed unseen right now

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.510 
damage that you seemed unseen right now
every<00:01:42.030> time<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.890> I<00:01:43.890> believe<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.399> only

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
every time and I believe you can only

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.060 
every time and I believe you can only
survive<00:01:44.939> at<00:01:45.149> about<00:01:45.360> four<00:01:45.689> times<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.829> want

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
survive at about four times so you want

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.200 
survive at about four times so you want
to<00:01:47.130> make<00:01:47.220> sure<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.460> get<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.729> whale<00:01:47.909> kill

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
to make sure you get the whale kill

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.470 
to make sure you get the whale kill
before<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.840> hits<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.229> four<00:01:49.740> times

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
before it hits you four times

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.820 
before it hits you four times
that<00:01:52.480> was<00:01:52.600> actually<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:52.960> mess-up<00:01:53.410> right<00:01:53.620> there

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
that was actually a mess-up right there

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.000 
that was actually a mess-up right there
and<00:01:54.070> this<00:01:54.760> happens<00:01:55.330> every<00:01:55.630> time<00:01:55.660> you<00:01:56.020> re<00:01:56.290> throw

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
and this happens every time you re throw

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.100 
and this happens every time you re throw
the<00:01:57.190> rope<00:01:57.400> on<00:01:57.610> it<00:01:57.790> it<00:01:57.940> will<00:01:58.090> basically<00:01:58.780> make

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
the rope on it it will basically make

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.610 
the rope on it it will basically make
you<00:01:59.410> stagger<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:02.110> try<00:02:02.290> to<00:02:02.350> make<00:02:02.590> sure

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
you stagger and just try to make sure

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.920 
you stagger and just try to make sure
you're<00:02:03.070> getting<00:02:03.400> as<00:02:03.880> close<00:02:04.180> to<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.450> head<00:02:04.690> as

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
you're getting as close to the head as

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.920 
you're getting as close to the head as
you<00:02:04.960> possibly<00:02:05.530> can<00:02:06.180> but<00:02:07.180> you<00:02:07.300> also<00:02:07.480> want<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.810> be

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
you possibly can but you also want to be

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.510

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
able to be ready to aim for the tail

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.460 
able to be ready to aim for the tail
like<00:02:09.940> right<00:02:10.210> there<00:02:10.479> whenever<00:02:10.840> he's<00:02:11.110> going<00:02:11.350> to

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
like right there whenever he's going to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.620 
like right there whenever he's going to
attack<00:02:11.740> you<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.400> you'll<00:02:12.940> be<00:02:13.090> able<00:02:13.210> to<00:02:13.390> stay<00:02:13.600> on

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
attack you and you'll be able to stay on

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.330 
attack you and you'll be able to stay on
him<00:02:13.900> for<00:02:14.080> one<00:02:14.260> more<00:02:14.410> shot<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:14.980> then<00:02:15.100> he<00:02:15.190> goes

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
him for one more shot and then he goes

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.200 
him for one more shot and then he goes
underwater

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
underwater

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.650 
underwater
and<00:02:17.310> now<00:02:18.310> once<00:02:18.610> he's<00:02:18.790> underwater<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.480> got<00:02:19.630> a

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
and now once he's underwater you got a

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.660 
and now once he's underwater you got a
way<00:02:19.840> for<00:02:20.050> him<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.260> come<00:02:20.470> back<00:02:20.650> up<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:23.370> I'm<00:02:24.370> not

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
way for him to come back up and I'm not

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.220 
way for him to come back up and I'm not
gonna<00:02:24.790> lie<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.240> scared<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.570> crap<00:02:25.780> out<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.050> me

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
gonna lie that scared the crap out of me

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.530 
gonna lie that scared the crap out of me
the<00:02:26.350> first<00:02:26.530> time<00:02:26.770> so<00:02:27.280> basically<00:02:27.760> what<00:02:28.390> you've

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
the first time so basically what you've

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.390 
the first time so basically what you've
just<00:02:28.570> seen<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:28.959> he<00:02:29.380> comes<00:02:29.620> up<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:29.920> attacks<00:02:30.280> you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
just seen is he comes up and attacks you

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.880 
just seen is he comes up and attacks you
that<00:02:31.060> only<00:02:31.270> happens<00:02:31.870> whenever<00:02:32.050> your<00:02:32.320> harpoon

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
that only happens whenever your harpoon

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.910 
that only happens whenever your harpoon
level<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.459> at<00:02:33.760> strength<00:02:34.690> level<00:02:35.020> too<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.560> believe

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
level is at strength level too I believe

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.650 
level is at strength level too I believe
that<00:02:36.370> once<00:02:36.550> it's<00:02:36.730> at<00:02:36.820> level<00:02:37.060> three<00:02:37.330> whenever

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
that once it's at level three whenever

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.530 
that once it's at level three whenever
you<00:02:37.780> attack<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.800> tail<00:02:39.100> it'll<00:02:39.940> prevent<00:02:40.330> the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
you attack the tail it'll prevent the

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.120 
you attack the tail it'll prevent the
whale<00:02:40.750> from<00:02:40.959> actually<00:02:41.260> coming<00:02:41.410> up<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:41.920> that

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
whale from actually coming up like that

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.610 
whale from actually coming up like that
at<00:02:42.400> least<00:02:43.090> that's<00:02:43.270> what<00:02:43.420> I've<00:02:43.540> read<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:43.900> IGN<00:02:44.350> I

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
at least that's what I've read on IGN I

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.920 
at least that's what I've read on IGN I
do<00:02:44.920> not<00:02:45.160> know<00:02:45.400> for<00:02:45.610> sure<00:02:45.670> because<00:02:46.240> I<00:02:46.510> only<00:02:46.660> have

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
do not know for sure because I only have

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.830 
do not know for sure because I only have
harpoon<00:02:47.320> level<00:02:47.620> strength<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.420> really

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
harpoon level strength to so I really

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.140 
harpoon level strength to so I really
can't<00:02:49.959> test<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.380> out<00:02:50.410> myself<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:51.220> could<00:02:52.000> be

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
can't test that out myself I could be

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.070 
can't test that out myself I could be
wrong<00:02:52.360> on<00:02:52.570> that<00:02:52.630> just<00:02:53.380> saying<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:55.510> basically

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
you just want to continue attacking the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.660 
you just want to continue attacking the
whale<00:02:57.900> chugging<00:02:58.900> those<00:02:59.050> harpoons<00:02:59.500> at<00:02:59.769> it<00:02:59.950> it's

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
whale chugging those harpoons at it it's

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.090 
whale chugging those harpoons at it it's
gonna<00:03:00.850> become<00:03:01.239> very<00:03:01.570> tiresome<00:03:02.200> as<00:03:02.739> you<00:03:02.950> can

doing this without with the only harpoon
level<00:03:15.280> one<00:03:15.459> it<00:03:16.060> is<00:03:16.269> impossible<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.019> do<00:03:17.170> this

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
level one it is impossible to do this

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.460 
level one it is impossible to do this
with<00:03:17.590> harpoon<00:03:18.100> strength<00:03:18.459> level<00:03:18.790> one<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:20.320> will

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
with harpoon strength level one you will

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.170 
with harpoon strength level one you will
never<00:03:20.709> do<00:03:21.130> any<00:03:21.400> damage<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:21.970> this<00:03:22.090> whale<00:03:23.940> as<00:03:24.940> you

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
never do any damage to this whale as you

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.150 
never do any damage to this whale as you
can<00:03:25.360> see<00:03:25.570> that<00:03:25.810> was<00:03:26.050> I<00:03:26.320> believe<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.860> third

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
can see that was I believe the third

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.670 
can see that was I believe the third
attack<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:27.790> made<00:03:27.970> on<00:03:28.180> me<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:28.600> I<00:03:29.140> am<00:03:29.320> almost

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
attack it made on me and I am almost

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.490 
attack it made on me and I am almost
dead<00:03:29.920> so<00:03:30.700> it's<00:03:31.300> either<00:03:31.540> three<00:03:32.140> or<00:03:32.170> four

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
dead so it's either three or four

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.740 
dead so it's either three or four
attacks<00:03:32.920> either<00:03:33.670> four<00:03:33.940> or<00:03:34.120> five<00:03:34.299> attacks<00:03:34.630> I

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
attacks either four or five attacks I

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.350 
attacks either four or five attacks I
mean<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:36.280> whale<00:03:36.459> will<00:03:36.760> take<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.180> out

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
mean and the whale will take you out

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.509 
mean and the whale will take you out
regardless<00:03:38.200> of<00:03:38.470> however<00:03:38.620> much<00:03:39.070> armor<00:03:39.370> you

regardless of however much armor you

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.610 
regardless of however much armor you
have<00:03:39.760> if<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.570> only<00:03:40.720> have<00:03:40.959> row<00:03:41.200> boat<00:03:41.410> level

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
have if you only have row boat level

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.039 
have if you only have row boat level
over<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:43.090> will<00:03:43.239> take<00:03:43.480> down<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.810> third

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
over to that it will take down the third

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.509 
over to that it will take down the third
hit

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.539 

all<00:03:47.519> right<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.150> after<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:48.989> gets<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.439> big<00:03:50.249> hit

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
all right so after it gets that big hit

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.309 
all right so after it gets that big hit
on<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:50.909> you<00:03:51.060> want<00:03:51.239> to<00:03:51.329> continue<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.989> make<00:03:52.139> sure

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
on you you want to continue to make sure

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.229 
on you you want to continue to make sure
you<00:03:52.469> keep<00:03:52.709> chugging<00:03:53.069> those<00:03:53.370> harpoons<00:03:53.939> at<00:03:54.060> it

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
you keep chugging those harpoons at it

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.629 
you keep chugging those harpoons at it
trying<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.230> hit<00:03:55.530> as<00:03:55.709> close<00:03:56.069> to<00:03:56.219> the<00:03:56.310> head<00:03:56.489> as

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
trying to hit as close to the head as

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:57.830
