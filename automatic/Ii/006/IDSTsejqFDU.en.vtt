00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
that's making me mad is that it has a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.960 
that's making me mad is that it has a
very<00:00:48.800> short<00:00:49.310> battery<00:00:49.640> life<00:00:50.090> it's<00:00:50.300> ridiculous

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
very short battery life it's ridiculous
