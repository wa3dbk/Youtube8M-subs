has a yellow hood hunt which i'm not
sure<00:01:06.780> i<00:01:08.270> guess<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.450> made<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.780> up<00:01:09.960> finger<00:01:10.680> one

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
sure i guess they made it up finger one

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.870 
sure i guess they made it up finger one
of<00:01:11.010> them<00:01:11.159> i<00:01:11.280> thought<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.640> they<00:01:11.820> were

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
of them i thought that they were

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.340 
of them i thought that they were
supposed<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.689> yellow<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.110> front

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
supposed to have the yellow in the front

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.200 
supposed to have the yellow in the front
but<00:01:14.159> i<00:01:14.280> guess<00:01:14.430> they<00:01:14.580> made<00:01:14.729> sure<00:01:14.880> your<00:01:15.030> run<00:01:15.180> of

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
but i guess they made sure your run of

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.230 
but i guess they made sure your run of
them<00:01:15.590> around<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:17.479> oh<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:20.460> blade<00:01:20.729> does<00:01:20.909> not<00:01:21.090> go

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
them around but oh the blade does not go

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.620 
them around but oh the blade does not go
out<00:01:21.360> very<00:01:21.390> far<00:01:22.520> um<00:01:25.400> I'll<00:01:26.400> put<00:01:26.580> trash<00:01:27.420> well

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
out very far um I'll put trash well

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:36.370

really<00:01:28.020> smooth<00:01:34.040> I'll<00:01:35.040> probably<00:01:35.280> fix<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.060> so

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
really smooth I'll probably fix it so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.569 
really smooth I'll probably fix it so
take<00:01:37.380> off<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> two<00:01:37.829> things<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.250> side<00:01:38.400> so

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
take off the two things on the side so

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.969 
take off the two things on the side so
the<00:01:38.700> Blake<00:01:38.880> goes<00:01:39.030> up<00:01:39.150> farther<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
the Blake goes up farther and so that it

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.889 
the Blake goes up farther and so that it
goes<00:01:41.100> down<00:01:41.310> deeper<00:01:41.759> imma<00:01:42.659> tilts<00:01:43.159> doesn't<00:01:44.159> tilt

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
goes down deeper imma tilts doesn't tilt

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.520 
goes down deeper imma tilts doesn't tilt
yeah<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.079> tilts<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.799> little<00:01:47.130> bit<00:01:48.500> not<00:01:49.500> too

yeah it tilts a a little bit not too
much<00:01:49.710> yeah<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.310> sounds<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.640> distance<00:01:51.350> and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
much yeah it sounds like a distance and

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.459 
much yeah it sounds like a distance and
then<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.799> should<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.250> turned<00:01:54.240> sideways

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
removing the river and i think i'll

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.780 
removing the river and i think i'll
remove<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.590> ripper<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:56.070> just<00:04:56.490> leave<00:04:56.670> that
