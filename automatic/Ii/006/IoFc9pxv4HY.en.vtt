00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.020
 Yup 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.240
 all good guys that does that speaks 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.580
 today I'm here with a new video on 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.470
 clash of france forgive me if I don't have you 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.279
 still brought minecraft but it will come well 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.750
 soon and also to do it with a friend of mine 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.939
 which has recently opened a channel then 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.369
 maybe I'll be able to sponsor a little one 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.710
 bit to lend a hand to grow anyway 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.110
 back on the clash we are here with a new one 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.489
 episode of Michael Moore but also the 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.690
 rather particular bag ie 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.710
 very special because we lost 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.210
 by now almost a constant the fact that we 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.010
 we lost and we lose the world 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.140
 unfortunately we have a clan that is 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.439
 is slowly crumbling among people who 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.330
 he goes to people who no longer play 

00:00:54.439 --> 00:01:00.080
 etc. for which we make a little effort 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.420
 however we try to resist anyway 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.949
 guys first of all I want to say goodbye 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.900
 matteo who asked me to greet a 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:11.740
 video is unfortunately less forgotten 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:15.710
 so hello matteo and congratulations for 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.690
 follow the aforementioned tula therefore not 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.130
 I could say more are you a big one 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.700
 bomber like all those who follow me 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.720
 on the other hand and let's not get lost in 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.340
 Chatter 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.860
 so let's go take a look or 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.600
 defeat view the map 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.400
 we look at some of the events 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.570
 first the war but the slight defense 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.740
 defense guys I can't do it either 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.479
 see I show you only a 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.400
 available for those who do not already have 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.380
 view first attack only dragons 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.540
 unfortunately only made two stars though 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.850
 the lens was strong enough you see 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.490
 only dragons in the elkann castle 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.010
 i had i had it would not be the trainers 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.140
 if I'm not mistaken e 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.810
 rhubarb two portions of the fury in 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.160
 a cure now only true d attack only 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:07.940
 so here I release my handsome tamers 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.040
 in the end the only used to do or 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.690
 they did very little as you can 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.000
 see maybe he could improve troops 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.710
 different, however , I did not get out of it 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.160
 so the castle troops here at least 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.200
 we didn't have any trouble when it was there 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.180
 all the brothel but my done with 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.820
 calm on the barbarian launcher there on the side 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.170
 here fortunately my dragons have 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.760
 took the fury well e 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.500
 year they attacked well here unfortunately 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.330
 they did a bit of trouble because of the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.410
 defenses were all close then one 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.620
 dies others succumb to the blows 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.660
 of defending va well could go 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.120
 better here the less I do the town hall 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.280
 and now I do the day more now 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.650
 equal in the two stars besides here 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.950
 I was really hoping to do even three 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.989
 stars to be honest though there is 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.730
 the archers still held the tesla 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:06.700
 almost and mixed between protecting us 9 tesla 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.160
 at 3 or 4 if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.500
 the archers and towers of the sorcerer 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.510
 defense was so it was still so many 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.640
 defended and as much stuff as you can 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.560
 see we are only at 73 so now 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.180
 disgust you see that here the tower of the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.190
 not a sorcerer, however, does it much 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.890
 together with the head from together to defense 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.660
 it was more like some good neighbor 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.540
 quite bad here it ends 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.269
 battle 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.160
 I could do better, however, 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.200
 let's say that after all it's not gone 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.459
 not even very badly in the newsroom 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.410
 here now is a look instead at the second 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.250
 attack because it comes right after the 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.440
 defense indeed we have immediately after the first 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.799
 now let's take a look at the defense 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.109
 guys I scroll the video though 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.030
 I will not dwell on this attack 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.950
 which in my opinion is the best defense 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.680
 I must be honest the best defense 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.720
 from the town hall level 8 you can use 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.209
 in the clowns because it is very very much 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.680
 good especially on the account the attacks 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.720
 only dragons 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.200
 do as you see only made me 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.480
 two stars is this was not put here 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:19.120
 bad as troops the archers queen 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.700
 all 8 so it seems not very effective 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.400
 but trust that his strong point 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.539
 is that the dragons or otherwise the troops 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.669
 first they move outwards and 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:33.250
 therefore and lire defense have all the 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.440
 time than their life to throw them 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.539
 then down the troops from the clanica the 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.460
 castle is good at the center unfortunately like 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:42.539
 the tv throws 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.400
 you, however, to tell you that here too the tesla 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.870
 before dragons destroy the heads 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.910
 before going to his town hall and on 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.000
 air defenses then the latter have 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.509
 all the time to throw them down with 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.860
 much tranquility here so there I 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.750
 made a video on purpose 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.539
 if you want to take a look at the only thing 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.009
 that changes and that mortars added 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.110
 deadly new because the video enough 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.419
 old for all home position as 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.610
 you saw at the beginning when everything was 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.139
 so let's say so 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.870
 and finally we have one of his last attacks 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.610
 last attack that by now a war 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.870
 over 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:23.009
 certainly no longer the attack 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:27.419
 heroic lay ok not that it was over 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.680
 here is the war but we would have struggled 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.169
 really much to recover that 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.699
 tried and tried to use like 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.220
 see rituals and how you read 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.690
 probably the hot air balloons title 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.880
 boys was the first time that 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.099
 I used the balloons in war and the 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.509
 I used very few times even not in 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:46.710
 war a village quite similar to the 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:50.729
 my here is regarding the 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.669
 disposition and also this is not easy 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.599
 to be conquered 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.699
 especially when experimenting 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:58.889
 new hot air balloon techniques here 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.199
 which perhaps could be improved is not 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.780
 that is, according to me it could have been better 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:07.380
 but if I set it better 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.009
 it would have gone maybe I would have done 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.139
 two stars 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.449
 I have to be honest but now let's see you 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:15.930
 the video you see that releases all the 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:18.659
 hot air balloon if more than that it will have so much if 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:22.530
 freed a bomb of those bombs 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:24.000
 unfortunately all fell 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.130
 he had the clan troops I would have 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.680
 had to break down because they make me one here 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.740
 massacre throws down mortar maybe and then 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.319
 ours too fall 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.520
 last montgolfier here is failure 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.139
 total of hot air balloons 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.550
 if you have the fact if he had let out 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.340
 the castle might have gone 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.470
 surely better you see here that you drop 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.720
 magicians and that they do from the ground anyway 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.349
 enough also give the momentum 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:52.030
 rhubarb that gradually turns into a spin 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:54.410
 around and the dragons continue to enter 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.650
 do less of a star with dragons is 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.770
 difficult here is consolo dry naturally 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:04.190
 because you stick with a dragon alone 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:06.949
 so it wasn't too much of an undertaking 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:10.130
 however difficult it was it could go 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:12.530
 definitely much better than this 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.289
 attack and would not have changed the fortunes 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:18.169
 of the war however I would have anyway 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:20.870
 given the opportunity to learn new 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:24.110
 technical and maybe even of the 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:26.120
 they improve in the future and I will be though 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:29.210
 we lost this war here 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.500
 let's put it this way 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.819
 no guys to do everything and 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.169
 I hope you enjoyed the video there 

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:35.180
 remember to take a look at my videos 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:36.860
 precedents on the provisions because me 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.599
 I often ask for the videos I have them 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.280
 facts are a bit back just go there 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:43.509
 to be dear in my channel is not that 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.509
 then they are proposed again and so on 

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:48.169
 I also remind you of the video on how 

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:50.090
 earn gems for free and for a while 

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:53.090
 but I don't need to sponsor it 

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.409
 so much is served so I hope that 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.320
 also help you, take a look 

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:58.729
 because quite helpful in doing everything 

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.050
 I hope the video you enjoyed it 

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:02.050
 see you at the next hello
