blow through its 100 square inches of
port<00:03:49.980> area<00:03:50.360> it's<00:03:51.360> probably<00:03:51.629> going<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.810> be

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
port area it's probably going to be

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.500 
port area it's probably going to be
about<00:03:51.930> 16<00:03:52.890> inches<00:03:52.920> long<00:03:53.459> that's<00:03:54.239> going<00:03:54.450> to

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
about 16 inches long that's going to

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.430 
about 16 inches long that's going to
give<00:03:54.659> us<00:03:54.689> a<00:03:54.900> 42

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440

give us a 42
Hertz<00:03:55.680> tuning<00:03:56.220> which<00:03:57.180> once<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:57.600> gets<00:03:57.780> in<00:03:57.960> the

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
Hertz tuning which once it gets in the

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.670 
Hertz tuning which once it gets in the
car<00:03:59.030> with<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.210> core<00:04:00.480> cabin<00:04:00.960> being<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:01.410> big

car with that core cabin being so big

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.770 
car with that core cabin being so big
it's<00:04:02.160> just<00:04:02.430> going<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.700> punish<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.210> Louvre<00:04:03.450> I

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
it's just going to punish the Louvre I

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.350 
it's just going to punish the Louvre I
can<00:04:04.140> tell<00:04:04.290> you<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:04.590> already<00:04:04.770> I<00:04:05.310> behind<00:04:06.120> it's

can tell you that already I behind it's

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.830 
can tell you that already I behind it's
going<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.570> be<00:04:06.660> tuned<00:04:06.930> at<00:04:07.110> 42<00:04:07.850> but<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:09.180> mean

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
going to be tuned at 42 but I mean

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.680 
going to be tuned at 42 but I mean
probably<00:04:10.170> at<00:04:10.290> around<00:04:10.550> 29<00:04:11.550> or<00:04:11.760> 30<00:04:11.970> Hertz<00:04:12.330> I<00:04:12.570> mean

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
probably at around 29 or 30 Hertz I mean

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.660 
probably at around 29 or 30 Hertz I mean
it's<00:04:12.780> just<00:04:12.840> going<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.110> be<00:04:13.170> bone-crushing<00:04:16.670> let

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
it's just going to be bone-crushing let

seams there's actually about two or

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.660 
seams there's actually about two or
three<00:05:23.750> layers<00:05:23.990> of<00:05:24.350> what<00:05:24.860> I<00:05:24.890> look<00:05:25.160> the<00:05:25.310> way<00:05:25.340> I<00:05:25.490> do

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
three layers of what I look the way I do

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.900 
three layers of what I look the way I do
it<00:05:26.030> I'll<00:05:26.630> take<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.080> gorilla<00:05:27.440> glue<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:28.070> i'll

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
it I'll take the gorilla glue and i'll

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.420 
it I'll take the gorilla glue and i'll
rub<00:05:29.450> a<00:05:29.480> layer<00:05:29.720> on<00:05:29.990> there<00:05:30.170> with<00:05:30.350> my<00:05:30.470> finger<00:05:30.920> i'll

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
rub a layer on there with my finger i'll

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.420

let<00:05:31.640> that<00:05:31.700> tack<00:05:32.180> up<00:05:32.210> a<00:05:32.600> little<00:05:32.840> bit<00:05:33.250> then<00:05:34.250> i'll

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
let that tack up a little bit then i'll

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.450 
let that tack up a little bit then i'll
put<00:05:34.610> another<00:05:34.850> layer<00:05:35.120> on<00:05:35.270> there<00:05:35.800> and<00:05:36.800> I<00:05:37.070> let<00:05:37.310> it

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
put another layer on there and I let it

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.040 
put another layer on there and I let it
stick<00:05:37.730> up<00:05:37.910> just<00:05:38.150> a<00:05:38.270> little<00:05:38.420> bit<00:05:38.570> and<00:05:38.840> let<00:05:39.020> it

tack up a little bit okay then i'll

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.880 
tack up a little bit okay then i'll
squeeze<00:05:43.640> my<00:05:44.270> final<00:05:44.750> layer<00:05:44.960> and<00:05:45.350> while<00:05:45.710> it's
