this<00:00:05.440> is<00:00:05.590> the<00:00:05.650> beginning<00:00:05.800> of<00:00:06.040> making<00:00:06.520> a<00:00:06.580> batch

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:06.730 
this is the beginning of making a batch

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.850 
this is the beginning of making a batch
of<00:00:06.760> biodiesel<00:00:07.360> all<00:00:07.779> right<00:00:08.050> I'm<00:00:08.260> doing<00:00:08.530> a<00:00:08.620> test

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
of biodiesel all right I'm doing a test

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.090 
of biodiesel all right I'm doing a test
one<00:00:09.100> liter<00:00:09.309> batch<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:10.630> determine<00:00:11.110> the<00:00:11.260> proper

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100 
one liter batch to determine the proper

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.810 
one liter batch to determine the proper
proportions<00:00:12.730> of<00:00:12.970> lie<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:14.440> nothin<00:00:15.070> all<00:00:15.190> great

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
proportions of lie to nothin all great

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.580 
proportions of lie to nothin all great
you<00:00:16.000> use<00:00:16.240> to<00:00:16.420> make<00:00:16.540> it<00:00:16.750> help<00:00:17.349> me<00:00:17.439> determine

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
you use to make it help me determine

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.890 
you use to make it help me determine
that<00:00:18.010> by<00:00:18.070> doing<00:00:18.220> a<00:00:18.490> titration<00:00:18.670> test<00:00:19.330> very

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
that by doing a titration test very

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.150 
that by doing a titration test very
first<00:00:20.140> so<00:00:21.180> now<00:00:22.180> the<00:00:22.240> by<00:00:22.869> volume<00:00:23.380> how<00:00:23.529> much<00:00:23.710> oil

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
first so now the by volume how much oil

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.980 
first so now the by volume how much oil
do<00:00:24.610> you<00:00:24.699> have<00:00:24.850> in<00:00:25.029> that<00:00:25.060> that's<00:00:25.449> a<00:00:25.539> leader<00:00:25.750> did

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
do you have in that that's a leader did

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.930 
do you have in that that's a leader did
you<00:00:26.110> say<00:00:26.320> or<00:00:26.500> yes<00:00:26.859> there's<00:00:27.100> one<00:00:27.250> liter<00:00:27.490> in<00:00:27.699> here

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
you say or yes there's one liter in here

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.580 
you say or yes there's one liter in here
and<00:00:28.090> I'll<00:00:28.210> beating<00:00:28.570> it<00:00:28.720> up<00:00:28.810> and<00:00:29.050> stirring<00:00:29.320> it

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
and I'll beating it up and stirring it

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.260 
and I'll beating it up and stirring it
all<00:00:29.770> right<00:00:30.070> I've<00:00:30.310> already<00:00:30.520> taken<00:00:30.820> one

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
all right I've already taken one

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.049 
all right I've already taken one
milliliter<00:00:32.050> of<00:00:32.320> this<00:00:33.160> oil<00:00:33.370> and<00:00:33.640> put<00:00:33.790> it<00:00:33.910> in

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
milliliter of this oil and put it in

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.380 
milliliter of this oil and put it in
this<00:00:34.180> container<00:00:34.420> okay<00:00:35.260> with<00:00:35.500> this<00:00:35.620> eyedropper

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
this container okay with this eyedropper

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.680 
this container okay with this eyedropper
graduated<00:00:37.390> in<00:00:37.540> milliliters<00:00:37.899> hi<00:00:39.360> I'm<00:00:40.360> going<00:00:40.630> to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
graduated in milliliters hi I'm going to

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.920 
graduated in milliliters hi I'm going to
have<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.079> 10<00:00:41.290> milliliters<00:00:41.829> of<00:00:41.860> methanol

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
have the 10 milliliters of methanol

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.160 
have the 10 milliliters of methanol
required<00:00:43.930> to<00:00:44.079> do<00:00:44.200> clay<00:00:44.469> tration<00:00:49.110> now<00:00:50.110> the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
required to do clay tration now the

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.799 
required to do clay tration now the
titration<00:00:50.890> you<00:00:51.579> have<00:00:51.940> to<00:00:52.149> determine<00:00:52.480> that

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
titration you have to determine that

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.459 
titration you have to determine that
because<00:00:53.590> what<00:00:54.370> does<00:00:54.489> that<00:00:54.610> do<00:00:54.850> Dave<00:00:55.200> it<00:00:56.200> tells

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
because what does that do Dave it tells

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.569 
because what does that do Dave it tells
you<00:00:56.739> how<00:00:57.610> Sydney<00:00:58.360> the<00:00:58.719> oil<00:00:58.870> is<00:00:59.170> okay<00:00:59.770> so<00:01:00.430> that

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
you how Sydney the oil is okay so that

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.939 
you how Sydney the oil is okay so that
you<00:01:00.670> can<00:01:00.789> get<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:01.000> proper<00:01:01.180> mixture<00:01:01.690> of<00:01:02.020> lye

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
you can get the proper mixture of lye

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.790 
you can get the proper mixture of lye
and<00:01:03.309> ethanol<00:01:03.879> to<00:01:04.239> do<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.570> chemical<00:01:05.350> reaction

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
and ethanol to do the chemical reaction

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.480 
and ethanol to do the chemical reaction
to<00:01:05.950> convert<00:01:06.430> it<00:01:06.550> from<00:01:08.280> triglycerides<00:01:09.280> to

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
to convert it from triglycerides to

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.059 
to convert it from triglycerides to
methyl<00:01:09.759> esters<00:01:10.119> I<00:01:10.360> see<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:11.020> then<00:01:11.530> as<00:01:11.800> I

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:12.069 
methyl esters I see and then as I

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:15.150 
methyl esters I see and then as I
understand<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:13.030> it<00:01:13.330> separates<00:01:13.929> the<00:01:14.319> the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
understand it it separates the the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.669 
understand it it separates the the
glycerin<00:01:15.670> away<00:01:15.940> from<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.539> method<00:01:17.200> esters

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
glycerin away from the method esters

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.309 
glycerin away from the method esters
right<00:01:17.979> yes<00:01:18.459> okay<00:01:19.060> it<00:01:19.390> strips<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.929> glycerin

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:20.319 
right yes okay it strips the glycerin

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:22.020 
right yes okay it strips the glycerin
molecule<00:01:20.830> away<00:01:21.130> from<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.459> three<00:01:21.700> extra

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
molecule away from the three extra

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.999 
molecule away from the three extra
chains<00:01:22.330> okay<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:23.289> replaces<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:23.770> with<00:01:23.890> a

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
chains okay and replaces it with a

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.630 
chains okay and replaces it with a
methanol<00:01:24.459> molecule<00:01:25.450> hence<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.640> terminology

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
methanol molecule hence the terminology

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.389 
methanol molecule hence the terminology
methyl<00:01:28.030> esters<00:01:28.420> okay<00:01:29.039> glycerin<00:01:30.039> is<00:01:30.160> what

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
methyl esters okay glycerin is what

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.770 
methyl esters okay glycerin is what
settles<00:01:30.759> to<00:01:30.849> the<00:01:30.940> bottom<00:01:31.060> if<00:01:31.509> we<00:01:31.630> have<00:01:31.750> a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
settles to the bottom if we have a

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.010 
settles to the bottom if we have a
successful<00:01:32.259> reaction<00:01:33.069> I<00:01:33.250> see<00:01:33.700> so<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.599> the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
successful reaction I see so the the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.620 
successful reaction I see so the the
esters<00:01:35.530> are<00:01:35.890> there<00:01:36.250> alone<00:01:36.819> and<00:01:36.849> yes<00:01:37.330> they're

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
esters are there alone and yes they're

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.540 
esters are there alone and yes they're
waiting<00:01:37.899> for<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.200> methanol<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.099> join<00:01:39.340> them

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
waiting for the methanol to join them

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.910 
waiting for the methanol to join them
and<00:01:39.640> then<00:01:39.759> become<00:01:40.179> mestres<00:01:40.899> correct<00:01:41.410> we<00:01:41.679> got

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
and then become mestres correct we got

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.040 
and then become mestres correct we got
it<00:01:42.099> I'm<00:01:42.310> putting<00:01:42.610> in<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.789> solution<00:01:43.090> this<00:01:43.899> is

which<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.590> made<00:02:14.800> up<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:15.100> 11<00:02:15.610> gram<00:02:16.570> of<00:02:16.600> live<00:02:17.050> per

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
which is made up of 11 gram of live per

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.850 
which is made up of 11 gram of live per
liter<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.550> distilled<00:02:19.420> water<00:02:19.990> I'm<00:02:20.530> going<00:02:20.740> to

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
liter of distilled water I'm going to

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.250 
liter of distilled water I'm going to
drop<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.250> in<00:02:21.490> in<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:22.540> measure<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:23.020> measure

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
drop that in in a measure to measure

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.010 
drop that in in a measure to measure
amounts<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:24.100> tenths<00:02:24.490> of<00:02:24.670> milliliters<00:02:25.020> and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
amounts of tenths of milliliters and

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.540 
amounts of tenths of milliliters and
that's<00:02:26.170> how<00:02:26.290> I'll<00:02:26.500> ultimately<00:02:26.950> determine<00:02:27.430> how

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
that's how I'll ultimately determine how

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.910 
that's how I'll ultimately determine how
much<00:02:27.730> I'm<00:02:28.030> going<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.420> need<00:02:28.630> okay<00:02:29.290> let's<00:02:29.680> start

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
much I'm going to need okay let's start

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.000 
much I'm going to need okay let's start
out<00:02:30.100> with<00:02:30.130> three<00:02:30.610> milliliters<00:02:31.260> icing<00:02:32.260> and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
out with three milliliters icing and

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.310 
out with three milliliters icing and
each<00:02:33.310> milliliter<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.270> a<00:02:34.300> percentage<00:02:35.020> then

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
each milliliter is a percentage then

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.750 
each milliliter is a percentage then
correct<00:02:35.740> okay<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:37.410> put<00:02:38.410> five<00:02:38.650> tents<00:02:39.340> in<00:02:39.520> there

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
correct okay I put five tents in there

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.720 
correct okay I put five tents in there
shake<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.330> up<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.630> little<00:02:40.780> bit<00:02:41.310> no<00:02:42.310> there's<00:02:42.580> no

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
shake it up a little bit no there's no

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.699 
shake it up a little bit no there's no
change<00:02:43.090> now<00:02:43.570> I'll<00:02:43.690> go<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.930> one<00:02:44.350> full

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
change now I'll go to one full

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.229 
change now I'll go to one full
milliliter<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.700> you're<00:02:45.850> looking<00:02:46.090> for<00:02:46.209> that

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
milliliter so you're looking for that

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.680 
milliliter so you're looking for that
color<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.750> chance<00:02:47.020> yep<00:02:47.880> there<00:02:48.880> goes<00:02:48.910> one<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.630> a

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
color to chance yep there goes one and a

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.270 
color to chance yep there goes one and a
half<00:02:50.880> still<00:02:51.880> not<00:02:52.060> there<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:55.590> start<00:02:56.590> notice

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
half still not there to start notice

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:12.380 
half still not there to start notice
just<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.550> little<00:02:57.790> bit<00:02:57.940> there<00:02:58.530> two<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.190> half

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.410 

2.3<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.690> 2.8<00:03:14.500> there<00:03:15.430> we<00:03:15.580> got<00:03:15.670> that<00:03:15.910> change<00:03:16.210> and

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
2.3 a 2.8 there we got that change and

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.890 
2.3 a 2.8 there we got that change and
you<00:03:16.480> can<00:03:16.660> see<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.930> now<00:03:16.990> totally<00:03:17.950> cream<00:03:18.190> okay

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
you can see it now totally cream okay

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.610 
you can see it now totally cream okay
that<00:03:19.900> was<00:03:20.050> at<00:03:20.200> 2.8<00:03:22.950> no<00:03:23.950> leaders<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:25.530> once<00:03:26.530> that

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
that was at 2.8 no leaders and once that

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.390 
that was at 2.8 no leaders and once that
color<00:03:27.090> changes<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.330> that<00:03:28.360> sort<00:03:28.960> of<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:29.400> pinkish

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
color changes to that sort of a pinkish

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.520 
color changes to that sort of a pinkish
roses<00:03:31.030> color<00:03:31.300> then<00:03:31.660> you<00:03:31.900> know<00:03:32.110> that<00:03:32.140> that's

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
roses color then you know that that's

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.620 
roses color then you know that that's
got<00:03:33.040> your<00:03:33.280> percentage<00:03:33.880> of<00:03:34.860> titration<00:03:36.540> now<00:03:37.540> i'm

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
got your percentage of titration now i'm

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.880 
got your percentage of titration now i'm
going<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:37.870> record<00:03:38.020> it<00:03:38.640> 2.8<00:03:39.640> i<00:03:40.710> have<00:03:41.710> determined

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
going to record it 2.8 i have determined

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.810 
going to record it 2.8 i have determined
i'm<00:03:42.370> going<00:03:42.580> to<00:03:42.640> use<00:03:42.910> seven<00:03:43.390> point<00:03:43.690> eight<00:03:43.930> grams

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
i'm going to use seven point eight grams

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.360 
i'm going to use seven point eight grams
of<00:03:45.820> lie<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:47.650> 200<00:03:49.410> well<00:03:50.410> that<00:03:50.560> will<00:03:50.680> do<00:03:50.860> a<00:03:50.890> one

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
of lie to 200 well that will do a one

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.160 
of lie to 200 well that will do a one
liter<00:03:51.550> batch<00:03:51.850> without<00:03:52.330> rattling<00:03:52.780> off<00:03:52.900> right

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
liter batch without rattling off right

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:14.660 
liter batch without rattling off right
now<00:03:53.350> so<00:03:53.950> I'll<00:03:54.250> go<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.490> my<00:03:54.580> scale

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.949 

so<00:04:15.670> this<00:04:15.819> is<00:04:15.849> all<00:04:16.150> based<00:04:16.449> on<00:04:16.720> that

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
so this is all based on that

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.409 
so this is all based on that
mathematical<00:04:17.769> equation<00:04:18.310> yes<00:04:18.850> that's<00:04:19.150> the

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
mathematical equation yes that's the

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.420 
mathematical equation yes that's the
percentage<00:04:19.780> by<00:04:20.169> which<00:04:20.410> you<00:04:20.560> titrate<00:04:20.829> it<00:04:21.220> in

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
percentage by which you titrate it in

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.689 
percentage by which you titrate it in
and<00:04:21.790> you've<00:04:22.620> figured<00:04:23.620> out<00:04:23.919> how<00:04:24.190> much<00:04:24.400> lie

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
and you've figured out how much lie

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.909 
and you've figured out how much lie
you're<00:04:25.000> supposed<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.389> add<00:04:25.510> right<00:04:26.229> this<00:04:26.710> is

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
you're supposed to add right this is

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.219 
you're supposed to add right this is
going<00:04:27.070> to<00:04:27.160> determine<00:04:27.370> per<00:04:28.360> liter<00:04:28.690> how<00:04:28.990> much

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
going to determine per liter how much

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.030 
going to determine per liter how much
lie<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:30.280> I'll<00:04:30.520> ultimately<00:04:30.940> convert<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:31.570> to

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
lie and I'll ultimately convert that to

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.740 
lie and I'll ultimately convert that to
gallons<00:04:33.040> to<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:33.970> gallon<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.479> amount<00:04:34.630> of

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
gallons to the gallon the amount of

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.900 
gallons to the gallon the amount of
gallons<00:04:35.110> of<00:04:35.350> vegetable<00:04:36.100> i'm<00:04:36.280> going<00:04:36.520> to<00:04:36.669> die<00:04:36.850> to

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
gallons of vegetable i'm going to die to

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.560 
gallons of vegetable i'm going to die to
earth<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.360> mix<00:04:37.660> how<00:04:37.930> come<00:04:38.169> you<00:04:38.199> act<00:04:39.389> so<00:04:40.389> we've

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
earth to mix how come you act so we've

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.350 
earth to mix how come you act so we've
got<00:04:40.720> seven<00:04:41.020> point<00:04:41.320> eight<00:04:41.440> grams<00:04:41.860> lie<00:04:42.360> i'm

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
got seven point eight grams lie i'm

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.270 
got seven point eight grams lie i'm
going<00:04:43.540> to<00:04:43.600> add<00:04:43.720> 200<00:04:44.199> milliliters<00:04:44.740> of<00:04:44.770> methanol

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
going to add 200 milliliters of methanol

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.980 
going to add 200 milliliters of methanol
which<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:51.580> 200<00:04:52.000> milliliters<00:04:52.479> of<00:04:52.510> methanol

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
which the 200 milliliters of methanol

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.620 
which the 200 milliliters of methanol
represents<00:04:53.650> twenty<00:04:53.979> percent<00:04:54.400> by<00:04:54.610> volume<00:04:55.180> of

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
represents twenty percent by volume of

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.560 
represents twenty percent by volume of
the<00:04:56.290> 1000<00:04:56.950> milliliters<00:04:57.220> of<00:04:57.490> oil<00:04:57.880> got<00:04:58.419> it

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
the 1000 milliliters of oil got it

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.840 
the 1000 milliliters of oil got it
better<00:04:58.750> react<00:04:59.470> so<00:04:59.950> that<00:05:00.160> is<00:05:00.340> irrespective

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
better react so that is irrespective

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.909 
better react so that is irrespective
does<00:05:01.300> nothing<00:05:01.660> to<00:05:01.690> do<00:05:01.900> with<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.290> percentage

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
does nothing to do with the percentage

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:04.950 
does nothing to do with the percentage
that's<00:05:03.190> just<00:05:03.550> by<00:05:03.760> volume<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.450> amount<00:05:04.630> of<00:05:04.720> lye

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
that's just by volume the amount of lye

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.629 
that's just by volume the amount of lye
is<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.320> only<00:05:05.470> thing<00:05:05.710> to<00:05:05.830> change<00:05:06.100> I<00:05:06.310> see<00:05:06.729> okay
