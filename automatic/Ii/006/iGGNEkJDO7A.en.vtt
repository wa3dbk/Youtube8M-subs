00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.279
 hello friends with you the sun and look 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.400
 rubric question-answer 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.500
 and the first question asks me what region 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.689
 I can give advice to those who want to be 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.589
 like me and advice years he 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.990
 simple enough just be yourself and 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:32.480
 I started talking poems and just remember 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.090
 one great phrase cheap copy always 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.470
 worse than the original so be yourself 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.230
 be original 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.170
 Nastya asks who was my hero in 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.180
 childhood and who is my hero now generally not 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.120
 much has changed that in childhood that 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.100
 now my hero is dad i am you 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.469
 I will say more dad where I was not easy 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.929
 hero folder for me is a super hero 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.640
 when i was little i was sick me and dad 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.829
 asked me what to bring me 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.739
 please, I would ask to bring 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.769
 attention beautiful horse do not get sick 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.490
 dad traveled all over Moscow but brought me 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.710
 This is the smallest red horse 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.939
 but how then not to call dad 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.369
 even a hero 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.610
 18 years old seems to me to find 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.159
 red in horse is just impossible 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.670
 dad managed it so the folder for me 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.250
 is a hero go on 5 asks 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.530
 How many cosmetics do I have? 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.939
 take so let's just show you 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.430
 shelf with my makeup 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.350
 that's exactly what my wand looks like 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.780
 With cosmetics you have opened a big secret to me 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.860
 I don't even use one third of that 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.170
 what is standing here 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.329
 Perhaps at first it may seem that 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.260
 Cosmetics me really much but 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.850
 most of the shelves are engaged huskies and 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.270
 for lips that i use pretty 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.680
 rarely but by the way there is no lip gloss and varnish 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.950
 for nails it is the most demanded 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.690
 part of this shelf but if i use 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.760
 lip gloss then i use some 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.370
 one certain everyone else is just 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.900
 cost the same situation develops from 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.490
 varnishes 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.230
 so cosmetics are not so my 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.360
 a lot for daily makeup me 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.280
 practically nothing is needed yes and on 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.170
 There are really days when I just don’t 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.540
 I am painted because without makeup and 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.560
 somehow not particularly freaks 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.500
 and so I try not to spoil my 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.660
 skin if i even experiment with 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.990
 make up and most often i just do 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.570
 wash away the dirt then I am doing a speech 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.280
 in ordinary life, I do not dye marina 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.680
 asks how to stop jealous 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.780
 to other people, I think that in order to 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.459
 stop jealous of other people need 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.070
 make these people jealous 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.260
 you and principle and you will be carried away 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.480
 by this process and you will already forget that 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.040
 such envy and do not envy each other 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.380
 a friend hung a really bad feeling 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.660
 just remember what we do ourselves 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.820
 all around you if you something 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.120
 envy then you are completely calm 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:59.170
 can do it in your life or she 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.290
 asks how many rays of the sun so but 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.330
 assuming my fans 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.540
 call themselves rays and on my channel 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.000
 Now 27000 51 followers 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.489
 beyond that it is so much in sheaves 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.980
 the sun but I was lucky every day 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.680
 the number of my rays is growing therefore I 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.790
 I think that when I post this video of you 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:25.590
 there will already be more than 27,000 51 people 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.959
 besides bears hello sweets sunshine 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.209
 charm and asks to bring 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.959
 took on a desert island of candy and 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.150
 livents 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.060
 kamilla you want me to go to heaven 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.769
 during the life of genital if such an island 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.769
 really existed and I would 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.900
 He had the opportunity to go to the well, 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.970
 and the first over 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.670
 with a few extra pounds a 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.459
 secondly I would take with me this 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.340
 island drink well because when there is 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.069
 candy lollipops then you want to drink everything 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.280
 just anastasia asks that i am more 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.709
 I hate it altogether quite complicated 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.409
 question I think about him for a long time and 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.890
 came to the conclusion that I hate such 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:10.109
 small in harmful things such as 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.739
 gaining law in the region but there is only 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.349
 one thing 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.229
 which i really just hate 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.630
 as a video blogger, this is when I am long, long 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.600
 we mount video I put in it soul 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.870
 all by force and already starting to save and here 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.270
 starts a video on the stone product on 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:32.190
 in fact it's just terrible because 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.860
 redo work somehow well I do not like 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.349
 I immediately got used to doing well and when 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.370
 Here are such force majeure 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.860
 i just hate them 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.690
 Well, the last question for today if 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.509
 make a rating of the most frequently asked 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.060
 mini questions this question will take 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.949
 honorable third place immediately after 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.260
 questions what kind of video editor am I 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.099
 I process my videos and when will 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.160
 new release 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:58.680
 this question asks nastyuha 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.710

 no one is calling at all i don't know how 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.750
 my life will turn so if i 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.550
 marry 19 or 20 years then actually 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.979
 saying why no I think that I 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.150
 I can shoot video but if I'm going to marry 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.370
 closer to 30 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.020
 then of course I will not shoot 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.639
 video 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.919
 sinful at that time three days will be 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.080

 and shleyki and video already 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.190
 that is why all 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:31.310
 will depend on what age 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.800
 I will marry I do not worry I am from you 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.889
