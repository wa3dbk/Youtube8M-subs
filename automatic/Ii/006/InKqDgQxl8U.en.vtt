 gert-jan dennekamp gert-jan what do we know

 so far the device and where it 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.120
 has happened 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.820
 well there is a flight tracker so one 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.009
 and signal from the aircraft and 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.649
 engines internet sites is followed and 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.920
 which indicates the last signal 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.869
 what is issued somewhere between donetsk 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.780
 and Lugansk was that see here on one 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.960
 map and that means in the area 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.820
 where the last few weeks and even 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.229
 call is a fierce battle 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.060
 delivered 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.770
 between the Ukrainian army and the 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.040
 separatists who have a particular presence 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.509
 entrenched in donetsk and loegansk and we 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.170
 have been in that area in the past 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.700
 planes shot down but they were 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.820
 aircraft of the Ukrainian army 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.530
 and not planes on such a large one 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.540
 height as where this aircraft would be 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.530
 have sat who knows 10 km just themselves 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.900
 also talked about and that is this with in the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.619
 afar a big plume of smoke 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.390
 thick gray plume of smoke on the horizon 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.310
 You will not quite see what is there 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.380
 happens 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.009
 but most likely this is the place 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.610
 where the aircraft of alicia airlines 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.220
 mh17 flight departed from Amsterdam on 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.979
 way to I hear 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.940
 it is very likely crashed 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.450
 brought down but that is not yet certain 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.580
 and whoever is behind it is not 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.210
 known at the moment 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.610
 the young yes it for a bit further 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.310
 flight information is about 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.770
 a daily scheduled flight to and from 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.170
 kuala lumpur and it's about one 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.930
 combined flight of klm and 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:42.000
 malaysian airlines 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.760
 thick kl410 3 and the mh17 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.620
 so have always been about the mh17 but 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.780
 people might know him from 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.690
 the kl410 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.620
 3 the coaching by them yes they did 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:01.070
 the codes yes and it is a boeing 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:05.070
 777 there can be 305 to 550 people 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:08.820
 passengers in some Ukrainian media 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.830
 report that in this case there are 280 people 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.920
 would have been on the plane and 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.200
 15 crew members 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.480
 parafango is cited by 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.010
 Ukrainian media that is the president of 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.980
 Ukraine 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.519
 and he says he doesn't rule that out 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.340
 the plane was shot and he 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.840
 also says that the Ukrainian army here 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.840
 has nothing to do with it
