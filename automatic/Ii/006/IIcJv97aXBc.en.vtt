to time i'll try to switch and watch two
streams<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:40.020> once<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.820> it's<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.300> just

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
streams at once but it's just it's just

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.090 
streams at once but it's just it's just
kind<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.600> hard<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.840> do<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:43.920> I

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
kind of hard to do it's just like I

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.590 
kind of hard to do it's just like I
can't<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:44.730> into<00:00:44.760> any<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> games<00:00:45.420> I

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
can't really get into any of the games I

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.549 
can't really get into any of the games I
can't<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:45.899> pay<00:00:46.079> attention<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.469> what

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
can't really pay attention to what

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.990 
can't really pay attention to what
anyone<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.920> doing<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.670> gets<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
anyone is doing and it gets to be a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.970 
anyone is doing and it gets to be a
little<00:00:48.180> bit<00:00:48.390> too<00:00:48.930> much<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.379> generally<00:00:49.800> tend

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
little bit too much so I generally tend

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.889 
little bit too much so I generally tend
to<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.190> watch<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.700> stream<00:00:51.120> or<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.719> other

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
to just watch one stream or the other

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.229 
to just watch one stream or the other
and<00:00:52.410> then<00:00:52.920> I'll<00:00:53.039> kind<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.309> switch<00:00:53.730> back<00:00:54.000> every

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and then I'll kind of switch back every

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.430 
and then I'll kind of switch back every
now<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.449> then<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> see<00:00:54.960> who's<00:00:55.140> playing

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
now and then just to see who's playing

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.639 
now and then just to see who's playing
on<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.129> other<00:00:56.160> stream<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:57.390> uh<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:58.079> MLG

to<00:04:37.320> be<00:04:37.380> pretty<00:04:37.560> aggressive<00:04:37.980> here<00:04:38.130> looks<00:04:38.460> like

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
to be pretty aggressive here looks like

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.710 
to be pretty aggressive here looks like
you<00:04:38.640> might<00:04:38.910> be<00:04:38.940> able<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.270> pick<00:04:39.360> up<00:04:39.420> that<00:04:39.480> one

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
you might be able to pick up that one

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.600 
you might be able to pick up that one
stalker<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:40.140> soccer<00:04:40.350> is<00:04:40.470> only<00:04:40.920> at<00:04:41.130> three<00:04:41.430> hit

sauce a going to try to get aggressive
this<00:04:47.310> early<00:04:47.550> in<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:47.670> game<00:04:47.730> as<00:04:47.910> we<00:04:48.000> can<00:04:48.120> see

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
this early in the game as we can see

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.940 
this early in the game as we can see
bombers<00:04:48.660> definitely<00:04:49.350> trying<00:04:49.530> to<00:04:49.620> be<00:04:49.710> a<00:04:49.740> little

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
bombers definitely trying to be a little

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.560 
bombers definitely trying to be a little
bit<00:04:50.100> aggressive<00:04:50.490> here<00:04:50.640> as<00:04:50.790> he's<00:04:51.120> pushing<00:04:51.450> out

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
bit aggressive here as he's pushing out

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.930 
bit aggressive here as he's pushing out
rather<00:04:51.870> far<00:04:52.290> from<00:04:52.530> his<00:04:52.680> base<00:04:52.860> he<00:04:53.430> only<00:04:53.670> has

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
rather far from his base he only has

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.750 
rather far from his base he only has
five<00:04:54.210> Marines<00:04:54.540> in<00:04:54.690> a<00:04:54.780> marauder<00:04:55.250> right<00:04:56.250> now<00:04:56.460> but

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
five Marines in a marauder right now but

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.190 
five Marines in a marauder right now but
I<00:04:56.970> connect<00:04:57.450> should<00:04:57.570> be<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.690> deadly<00:04:57.900> little

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
I connect should be a deadly little

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.570 
I connect should be a deadly little
force<00:04:58.380> especially<00:04:58.590> once<00:04:58.950> you<00:04:59.010> have<00:04:59.160> stem<00:04:59.430> as

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
force especially once you have stem as

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.220 
force especially once you have stem as
you<00:04:59.700> can<00:04:59.820> see<00:05:00.000> looks<00:05:00.420> like<00:05:00.540> bombers<00:05:00.870> preparing

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
you can see looks like bombers preparing

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.600 
you can see looks like bombers preparing
some<00:05:01.380> kind<00:05:01.560> of<00:05:01.620> a<00:05:01.710> stim<00:05:01.920> timing<00:05:02.340> is<00:05:02.430> use

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
some kind of a stim timing is use

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.420 
some kind of a stim timing is use
reaches<00:05:03.030> researching<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:03.870> stim<00:05:04.260> tech<00:05:04.530> he

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
reaches researching that stim tech he

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.890 
reaches researching that stim tech he
does<00:05:05.550> have<00:05:05.700> a<00:05:05.730> second<00:05:06.060> tech<00:05:06.210> lab<00:05:06.390> as<00:05:06.540> well<00:05:06.570> on

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
does have a second tech lab as well on

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.120 
does have a second tech lab as well on
another<00:05:07.320> barracks<00:05:07.590> these<00:05:07.710> producing

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
another barracks these producing

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.010 
another barracks these producing
Marauders<00:05:08.520> with<00:05:08.670> Marauders<00:05:09.090> obviously<00:05:09.990> a

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
Marauders with Marauders obviously a

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.350 
Marauders with Marauders obviously a
very<00:05:10.200> good<00:05:10.710> choice<00:05:10.890> against<00:05:11.550> protoss<00:05:11.880> gateway

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
very good choice against protoss gateway

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.270 
very good choice against protoss gateway
units<00:05:12.690> and<00:05:12.810> that<00:05:12.900> is<00:05:13.050> exactly<00:05:13.470> what<00:05:13.920> saw<00:05:14.070> say

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
units and that is exactly what saw say

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.280 
units and that is exactly what saw say
is<00:05:14.400> going<00:05:14.730> for<00:05:14.970> right<00:05:15.150> now<00:05:15.180> as<00:05:15.360> we<00:05:15.450> can<00:05:15.540> see<00:05:15.600> in

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
is going for right now as we can see in

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.660 
is going for right now as we can see in
the<00:05:16.410> base<00:05:16.530> of<00:05:16.680> saw<00:05:16.830> say<00:05:17.010> we<00:05:17.130> currently<00:05:17.490> have

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
the base of saw say we currently have

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.940 
the base of saw say we currently have
five<00:05:18.110> warp<00:05:19.110> gates<00:05:19.350> out<00:05:19.500> right<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:19.770> so<00:05:19.860> it

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
five warp gates out right and so it

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:20.930 
five warp gates out right and so it
looks<00:05:20.100> like<00:05:20.160> it's<00:05:20.340> going<00:05:20.430> to<00:05:20.520> be<00:05:20.580> some<00:05:20.730> kind<00:05:20.850> of

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
looks like it's going to be some kind of

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.540 
looks like it's going to be some kind of
a<00:05:21.030> five<00:05:21.330> warp<00:05:21.690> gate<00:05:21.900> timing<00:05:22.350> push<00:05:22.530> here<00:05:22.800> as<00:05:22.919> he

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
a five warp gate timing push here as he

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.700 
a five warp gate timing push here as he
is<00:05:23.760> not<00:05:24.300> continuing<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:24.930> produce<00:05:25.080> workers<00:05:25.530> he

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
is not continuing to produce workers he

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.500 
is not continuing to produce workers he
has<00:05:25.830> stopped<00:05:26.160> producing<00:05:26.520> workers<00:05:27.000> at<00:05:27.180> his

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
has stopped producing workers at his

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.930 
has stopped producing workers at his
natural<00:05:27.870> expansion<00:05:28.169> a<00:05:28.530> bomber<00:05:29.250> of<00:05:29.700> course

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
natural expansion a bomber of course

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.370 
natural expansion a bomber of course
still<00:05:30.180> making<00:05:30.540> workers<00:05:30.870> at<00:05:30.990> his<00:05:31.110> expansion

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
still making workers at his expansion

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.750 
still making workers at his expansion
want<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.740> get<00:05:31.860> that<00:05:31.919> economy<00:05:32.370> up<00:05:32.460> let's<00:05:32.610> check

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
want to get that economy up let's check

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.760 
want to get that economy up let's check
out<00:05:32.850> that<00:05:33.000> harvester<00:05:33.510> tab<00:05:33.720> we've<00:05:34.350> seeded<00:05:34.530> saw

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
out that harvester tab we've seeded saw

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.740 
out that harvester tab we've seeded saw
say<00:05:34.950> is<00:05:35.010> just<00:05:35.280> a<00:05:35.370> smidgen<00:05:36.030> ahead<00:05:36.270> 36

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
say is just a smidgen ahead 36

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.260 
say is just a smidgen ahead 36
harvesters<00:05:37.140> to<00:05:37.260> the<00:05:37.350> 34<00:05:37.980> and<00:05:38.280> yeah<00:05:38.970> I<00:05:39.000> don't

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
harvesters to the 34 and yeah I don't

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.000 
harvesters to the 34 and yeah I don't
think<00:05:39.600> he's<00:05:39.780> yeah<00:05:40.050> he's<00:05:40.080> definitely<00:05:40.470> krona

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
think he's yeah he's definitely krona

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.440 
think he's yeah he's definitely krona
boosting<00:05:41.370> all<00:05:41.550> these<00:05:41.730> gateways<00:05:41.970> now<00:05:42.240> it<00:05:42.390> is

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
boosting all these gateways now it is

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.909 
boosting all these gateways now it is
gonna<00:05:42.570> be<00:05:42.660> some<00:05:42.840> kind<00:05:43.020> of<00:05:43.050> a<00:05:43.140> five<00:05:43.350> gate<00:05:43.590> timing

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
gonna be some kind of a five gate timing

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.409 
gonna be some kind of a five gate timing
this<00:05:44.280> is<00:05:44.400> going<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.550> be<00:05:44.669> very<00:05:44.880> very<00:05:45.030> strong

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
this is going to be very very strong

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.120 
this is going to be very very strong
he's<00:05:45.600> got<00:05:45.780> one<00:05:45.990> forward<00:05:46.320> pile<00:05:46.500> on<00:05:46.680> here<00:05:46.860> but

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
he's got one forward pile on here but

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.740 
he's got one forward pile on here but
he's<00:05:47.250> placing<00:05:47.490> a<00:05:47.700> few<00:05:47.910> more<00:05:48.090> all<00:05:48.300> around<00:05:48.630> the

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
he's placing a few more all around the

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.080 
he's placing a few more all around the
map<00:05:48.930> and<00:05:49.169> a<00:05:49.560> 5k<00:05:49.950> timing<00:05:50.340> push<00:05:50.490> can<00:05:50.640> be<00:05:50.730> very

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
map and a 5k timing push can be very

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.600 
map and a 5k timing push can be very
very<00:05:51.360> very<00:05:52.080> strong<00:05:52.470> against<00:05:53.010> terran<00:05:53.310> as<00:05:53.490> you

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
very very strong against terran as you

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.460 
very very strong against terran as you
can<00:05:53.730> see<00:05:53.910> bomber<00:05:54.180> he<00:05:54.630> thinks<00:05:54.900> something<00:05:55.260> fishy

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
can see bomber he thinks something fishy
