 this rule when buying a new 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.869
 now few people use the phone 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.939
 popular multifunctional devices 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.610
 They are not cheap but for a loved one 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.449

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.770
 apple iphone is truly a cult gadget 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.000
 amazing story happened recently 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.370
 in Vladivostok 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.650
 Olga acquired the fifth iphone in one of 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.080
 stores in Vladivostok after some 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.239
 time went on vacation to france she 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.610
 contacted the service center to change 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.040
 SIM cards and there she was advised to replace 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.050
 her new phone reason 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.239
 their gadget is doubtful 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.910
 domestic experts were 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.619
 say the same opinion you see 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:08.700
 the difference between the two iPhones 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.060
 there is enough difference in the tap 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.920
 there is what is visible 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 but you phones are not exactly worth the button 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.370
 home visible breakdowns on the bolt slots then 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.770
 have he already spun 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.390
 in sight and so I did 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.530
 the phone was repaired before that 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.350
 smolyaninov 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.040
 Yes, that is not the fact that it was repaired 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.920
 tom plan that nimbus some sort of breakdown but 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.000
 Replacing parts was exactly the same button 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:45.000
 touched that is she stuck there that her 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 opened and rearranged as if on the face 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.670
 case of sale to the consumer goods without 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.180

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.009

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.259
 consumer has the right to demand 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.470
 termination of the contract of sale from 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.149
 seller if voluntarily 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.229
 the seller refuses to satisfy 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:10.450
 legal customer requirements 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.430
 consumer has the right to appeal to 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.580

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.080

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.070
 supervision 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.769
 to attract the seller to 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.720
 administrative responsibility 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.910
 I must pay tribute to the iphone store 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.250
 replaced without additional questions and 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.420
 even a protective film stuck true 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:38.910
 refused to comment on the situation here 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.560
 my old new phone look 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.200

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.640
 by the way warranty period for products 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.850

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.769
 device + 90 days for transportation 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.260
 to the point of sale production date 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.260
 stored in the apple database when 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.090
 the seller is obliged to sell the goods 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.140
 document everything to issue exactly the checks and 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.540
 warranty card 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.730

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.890
 warranty service authorized 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.980
 service center manufacturer company 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.440
 apple 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.849
 shops all give a guarantee of strength because 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.349
 as officially in Russia there is practically no 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.799
 stores that would issue a guarantee 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.590
 by type 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.530
 Well, Russia does not have services that plan 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.379
 generally serviced can eat well 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.569
 armies in the far east so 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.580
 We get a warranty from the seller and with 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.440
 claims we go to him 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.760
 but in Russia not only difficulties with 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.129
 world warranty apple 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.500
 but because of the price of the company's products the difference 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.280
 between buying iphone 5 official 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.140
 distributor 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.690
 and an ordinary seller often 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.299
 amounts to a decent amount and almost 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.859
 every phone from hong kong american 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:52.470
 iphone and find it harder for Russia tantalum 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.120
 major stores they ask are they 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.629
 an order of magnitude easier because they can 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.110
 throw 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:01.100
 growth 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:04.160
 just do not have them better than muddy all have 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:09.140

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.460

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.060

 on not fresh apple than proving it 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:39.350

 they were not set by the consumer 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.790
 the moment of the conclusion of the contract of sale 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.160
 possible when conducting expert 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.950
 conclusions when carrying out some 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.500
 investigative activities of other 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.200
