here<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:00.979> I'm<00:02:01.979> gonna<00:02:02.159> throw<00:02:02.399> down<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.640> portable

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
here but I'm gonna throw down a portable

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.800 
here but I'm gonna throw down a portable
radar<00:02:03.329> why<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:04.549> okay

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810

these<00:02:13.040> workers<00:02:13.640> way<00:02:14.950> around<00:02:15.950> here<00:02:16.480> let's<00:02:17.480> try

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
these workers way around here let's try

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.600 
these workers way around here let's try
a<00:02:17.840> netbook<00:02:18.200> not<00:02:18.410> get<00:02:18.620> caught<00:02:18.890> off<00:02:19.040> guys<00:02:19.280> it's<00:02:19.550> a

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
a netbook not get caught off guys it's a

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.420 
a netbook not get caught off guys it's a
really<00:02:19.970> massive<00:02:20.150> map<00:02:20.510> though<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:22.250> guy's

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
really massive map though that guy's

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.810 
really massive map though that guy's
done<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.700> good<00:02:22.910> job<00:02:22.970> helping<00:02:23.510> out<00:02:23.780> our<00:02:23.810> team<00:02:24.820> or

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
would you get a UAV up my portal radars

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.980 
would you get a UAV up my portal radars
doing<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.200> very<00:02:30.500> good<00:02:30.590> job<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:32.180> hopefully<00:02:32.510> you

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
think we work our way towards that side

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.330 
think we work our way towards that side
of<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.910> map<00:02:38.090> again<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:39.620> guy<00:02:39.830> managed<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.190> get

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
of the map again that guy managed to get

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.290 
of the map again that guy managed to get
away<00:02:40.540> from<00:02:41.540> my<00:02:41.750> prayer<00:02:42.080> like<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.350> lucky<00:02:42.710> boy<00:02:43.300> see

if we can cool in this pred and

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.320 
if we can cool in this pred and
hopefully<00:02:45.980> pick<00:02:46.160> up<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.370> few<00:02:46.550> kills<00:02:46.880> that's

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
hopefully pick up a few kills that's

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
set a two or three kdv good game to be

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.150 
set a two or three kdv good game to be
honest<00:05:02.789> so<00:05:02.940> on<00:05:03.440> this<00:05:04.440> consider<00:05:04.889> this<00:05:05.010> is<00:05:05.099> the

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
honest so on this consider this is the

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.860 
honest so on this consider this is the
first<00:05:05.400> game<00:05:05.639> on<00:05:05.699> the<00:05:05.910> map<00:05:06.150> let's<00:05:06.479> see<00:05:06.599> if<00:05:06.660> I<00:05:06.750> can

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
first game on the map let's see if I can

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.379 
first game on the map let's see if I can
actually<00:05:06.990> find<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:08.930> UAV<00:05:09.930> is<00:05:10.080> a<00:05:10.110> bit<00:05:10.259> too<00:05:10.470> many

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
actually find the UAV is a bit too many

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.180 
actually find the UAV is a bit too many
okay<00:05:12.389> I<00:05:12.419> can<00:05:12.570> hear<00:05:12.960> someone<00:05:13.139> yeah<00:05:13.889> I<00:05:13.919> could

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
okay I can hear someone yeah I could

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.770 
okay I can hear someone yeah I could
just<00:05:14.580> hear<00:05:14.789> the<00:05:14.940> hunt<00:05:15.120> dammit<00:05:15.479> now<00:05:15.570> I<00:05:15.599> know

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
just hear the hunt dammit now I know

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.420 
just hear the hunt dammit now I know
this<00:05:16.470> is<00:05:16.590> where<00:05:16.740> we<00:05:16.770> really<00:05:17.130> have<00:05:17.400> a

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
this is where we really have a

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.980 
this is where we really have a
disadvantage<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:18.240> I'd<00:05:18.360> recommend<00:05:18.570> walking

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
disadvantage and I'd recommend walking

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.110 
disadvantage and I'd recommend walking
around<00:05:19.320> of<00:05:19.440> assassin<00:05:19.979> when<00:05:20.849> the<00:05:20.940> game<00:05:21.090> first

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
around of assassin when the game first

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.219 
around of assassin when the game first
comes<00:05:21.660> out<00:05:21.840> but<00:05:22.370> again<00:05:23.370> let's<00:05:23.639> see<00:05:24.050> it's<00:05:25.050> just

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
comes out but again let's see it's just

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:26.990 
comes out but again let's see it's just
going<00:05:25.349> to<00:05:25.440> be<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.530> game<00:05:26.070> of<00:05:26.220> luck<00:05:26.460> at<00:05:26.610> this<00:05:26.729> point

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
going to be a game of luck at this point

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.420 
going to be a game of luck at this point
because

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.640 

really<00:05:31.450> we<00:05:32.450> have<00:05:32.570> no<00:05:32.810> idea<00:05:33.200> where<00:05:33.350> anyone<00:05:33.620> is

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
really we have no idea where anyone is

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.040 
really we have no idea where anyone is
and<00:05:34.070> they<00:05:34.250> do<00:05:34.310> I<00:05:34.820> think<00:05:35.090> that<00:05:35.420> UAV<00:05:35.810> should<00:05:35.990> be

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
and they do I think that UAV should be

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.300 
and they do I think that UAV should be
down<00:05:36.200> now<00:05:36.410> though<00:05:36.530> to<00:05:36.590> be<00:05:36.770> honest<00:05:37.010> I<00:05:37.130> can't

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
down now though to be honest I can't

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.420 
down now though to be honest I can't
stop<00:05:37.490> complaining<00:05:37.970> and<00:05:38.740> I<00:05:39.740> spotted<00:05:40.190> someone

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
stop complaining and I spotted someone

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.820 
stop complaining and I spotted someone
