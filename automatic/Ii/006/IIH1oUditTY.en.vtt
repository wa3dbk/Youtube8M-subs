00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.820
 we are now with loops the 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.930
 mud cover of samsung that will be 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.390
 available in five colors as you 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.099
 can see it and so a white template 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.300
 that we have here before us so 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.529
 this mud cover looks like a 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.470
 element that will cover both 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.390
 the screen but also the back of 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.120
 the device allowing access to all 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.969
 elements of the pigeon on the camera the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.809
 Button is also the speaker at 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.190
 the front so this loop cover comes 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.480
 with a loving element and who will come 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.030
 turn on the screen when you open it 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.950
 like that you will only have to case either 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.110
 ip for for to unlock but 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.180
 you will not need to press the 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.850
 button turn on the clubs to turn on 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.050
 the screen with this mud mates and we have 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.840
 also two presented on the stand 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.329
 samsung to a new style and who 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.190
 is called the bts pen which is so a 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.649
 style is bigger than the one that is 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.540
 available with the with the product that 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.950
 is not who is not available to and 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.200
 so it's really going to look like this 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.710
 to it looks like a pencil the most 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.600
 conventional 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.780
 so it will allow you to navigate 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.909
 on the samsung interface is 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.380
 also answer calls and you 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.200
 have a vibration feedback from elsewhere 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.350
 sure 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.700
 on the on the pencil you also have 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.659
 a speaker and pickups for 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.000
 save like that you can 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.009
 really answer the phone with 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.509
 only this element we continue 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.950
 our little trick the accessories with 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.060
 that come with galaxy note more 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.409
 and we have before you now a 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.000
 bluetooth keyboard 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.950
 we will be able to connect to the galaxy a 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.509
 you're going to really use it to use 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.200
 his product as a like a real 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.869
 netbook 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.819
 in the end we also have a base to which 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.530
 allow to pose the galaxy nature and 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.360
 so we imagine for example by car 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.819
 why not to use the tablet 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.610
 as gps also a battery 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.179
 which will allow to recharge the 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.009
 Tablet 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.220
 so this extra battery comes 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:08.030
 with an autonomy of a power of 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.269
 9000 milliamps hours and so she 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.130
 is connected by bluetouff by usb 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.930
 to the tablet 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.220
 so we have now completed 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.590
 our little tour of accessories that 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.540
 will be available at the Galaxy Note 8.0 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.829
 which should be available at the second 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.870
 quarter and we imagine that the 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.680
 almost all accessories will be 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.680
 also at the same time
