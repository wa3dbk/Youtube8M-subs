00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.800
 today we are going to make some towel bears 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.080
 very funny to do we're going to 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.820
 need towels first I'm going to 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.250
 make a small facial towel 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.039
 and the second with a sink also 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.920
 we are going to need mobile eyes gomitas and 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.680
 the black tro or black eva rubber and yours 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.480
 good imagination we start to look at myself 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.789
 buy these towels in primark are 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.369
 Facial towels are small and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.620
 this pack that comes in three because it costs 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.680
 ie three euros you off the towel 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.860
 a good euro, so let's go, let's open 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.360
 this towel as you see is a towel almost 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.730
 square I like them a little more 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.320
 rectangular but good let's cut a 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.030
 little this label so it does not look 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.670
 ugly 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.579
 and once we've cut it we're going to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.879
 fold the towel as in three pieces is 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.610
 say let's double you see this would be the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.860
 half then something less say we divide it 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.110
 in interests now let's do the same 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.300
 that in the puppy video if you have not 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.909
 seen this video I leave it here in the 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.680
 label on the cards above 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.049
 we bend inwards making a 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.729
 rollito we also doubled on the other 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.570
 side so that the rolls are left 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.490
 same 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.860
 eye because one of the two is wider 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.890
 It has a good double towel because 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.110
 we leave the same and now fix so that 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.090
 be easier and do not let go of what 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.720
 I do is put a rubber band there and then 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.450
 remove that just to help me 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.190
 so it does not open to me and I also go 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.110
 to put one in the center once 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.060
 press again the rolls I put another 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.630
 in the center so that it does not fall apart either 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.909
 when I'm working well 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.880
 so now I'll take a look 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.990
 finger in the center to guide me turn my 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.610
 towel you see what I do turn the towel and the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.880
 I put up 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.320
 it's like a change of direction and you see 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.560
 once I have it up what 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.740
 you start to give a little bit of form 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.150
 below are going to be the paws of the bear and 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.580
 the part is up I just 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.550
 fold the arms the suit and the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.430
 head so that the head is better I 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.720
 I put a little cotton there are people 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.660
 that does not put anything to me I like that 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.910
 is a little more chubby then you see 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.220
 I put a little something not and now what 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.410
 I do is give it a little shape and I'll go there 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.840
 to put a rubber band that separates the head 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.880
 of the body now at the bottom in 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.739
 the head we are going to put a rubber of those 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.810
 that we use for children's pigtails 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.970
 stronger than we used for 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.330
 gummies bracelets because you have to 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.980
 to be well tight once put 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.370
 to the rubber what I do be a bit of 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.739
 way to all that is those parts and a 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.020
 Once this is done, what I do is form the 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.790
 ears for that you see now yes I'm 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.040
 using gums that we used to 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.680
 bracelets I used a blue so that it 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.080
 disguise with one side and the other the other 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.120
 beige on the sides of the head 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.820
 in so little the finger to form the ear 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.940
 You see how it's going well since you start 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.440
 see where we will continue to 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.450
 follow what we are going to do is remove the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.010
 gummy that we had put down for 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.350
 that will help us get the job done 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.620
 without problems but it is already there if the 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.420
 legs a little looser and now what 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.640
 we make is to conceal we have put a 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.340
 pearl necklace are not more than a 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.310
 pearl bracelet and we will put 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.230
 a little heart of black eva rubber and 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.720
 we have put a little note in your eyes 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.810
 mobile like we just did not like 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.520
 so the harley without eyes is better 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.180
 well now let's continue and 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.709
 let's use a washbasin towel myself 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.560
 He believed that with no hand towels 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.180
 It looked good but I was wrong us 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.440
 let's do the same process with this 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.380
 towel is still also from 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.330
 Primark is a finite towel is much 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.459
 better because being finite is working 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.190
 easier because we have done the same 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.770
 we have doubled one side to two thirds and the 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.420
 Furthermore winds it now moss fijaros 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.790
 so that it does not unravel and is not 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.530
 holding it as long as I put a weight 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.140
 I have put my ipad 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.600
 over so it does not move now I do 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.720
 the other side as before I roll the 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.550
 another good part now let's put the 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.459
 gummies that we had put one in the 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.269
 side of the end of the legs and the truth 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.190
 is that in the center there is no need 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.570
 fix you scroll well and now like 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.330
 before I put my finger more or less in the 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.220
 half turn a little and I put 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.650
 ahead 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.390
 You see like we did before when I was 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.820
 the small towel I open a little stood up 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.550
 and once I do this I put it back 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.800
 cotton although in this case as the 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.240
 towel is big, I started mind in 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.520
 a little ball because I put four or five 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.050
 you will see it has to be a little the 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.050
 morrito of our bear 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.740
 because once the cotton was put on 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.930
 a little what are the arms and I put the 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.660
 rubber just like before I put a rubber that 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.880
 I separated what is the face of the body 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.720
 and this rubber like before 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.390
 I tighten well the next is to put sun and 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.130
 you are in the ears as before 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.930
 I will also put a little stronger 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.940
 because this towel is bigger if 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.740
 I put gummies on the wristband because 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.240
 they are going to blow me up I put them the same 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.240
 type of rubber on the ears 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:33.199
 or not 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.050
 now I put the other one on the other side and one 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.910
 Once it has finished fixing you I can 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.650
 disguise the rubber before we put a 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.440
 pearl necklace I can put a piece 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.840
 of a tie and I'm just as cute with a 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.620
 little loop and I put it behind stuck 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.620
 with hot glue 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:06.479
 Well, I hide the rubber and it does not look bad 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:07.979
 because it stands out could do the same 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.049
 also with the ears putting the loop 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.649
 very finite of course but not even 

00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:12.509
 lack 

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:14.909
 I'm going to put a big bow on it and that's how I'm going to 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.299
 cover also a little to make the loop 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:21.719
 see how I do it I do as two 

00:06:17.299 --> 00:06:24.539
 you turn that loop and the one loop and 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:26.609
 It's that easy, I just need to adjust 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.849
 the loop to the size of my head 

00:06:26.609 --> 00:06:28.849
 Teddy 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.099
 cut the ends with the scissors of 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:45.410
 zigzag and I'm going to put it in the 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:48.830
 center trying to end the tapes 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:51.229
 a little the rubber bands of the ears and now 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.930
 he only has to put the bow a 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:56.020
 little stuck with very little glue and 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.610
 also our little heart of eva rubber 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.979
 Well, today's greetings are for 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.490
