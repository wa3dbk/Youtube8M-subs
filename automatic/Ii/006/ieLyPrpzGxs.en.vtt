00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 a week ago in belgium italy 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.960
 was crowned European Champion of 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.880
 futsal karim chaibai o'mara or wilson du 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.230
 remains of griots and valentin du jacquier 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.429
 are four of the five players from 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.429
 chÃ¢telineau to have participated 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.710
 we had a long preparation we did 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.250
 a lot of friendlies and it was 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.419
 very difficult 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.079
 the preparation was very hard we had 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.300
 spain brazil 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.220
 we played against croatia also a 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.410
 very good preparation worked 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.510
 a lot to get to a stadium 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.250
 the problem is that we showed two 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.440
 faces during the euro I think 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.660
 we missed on the first lap 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.970
 we thought we were good although it is 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.879
 a little stress is also your envy 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.930
 We were a bit stressed a little bit 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.300
 do not know what happened 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.880
 the first game we've been there maybe 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.170
 the fear of wanting to do too well 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.600
 and here we went a little near 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.960
 our face match of karim chabi that I 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.790
 Mark 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.190
 I liked it a lot but here I have a 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.620
 little more experience and I believe it 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.360
 have been the stars at the level of stars 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.040
 the heroes at the level of the days we were 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.720
 not good in the match him too I 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.820
 think that people were in the 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.080
 maquis have been patrick almost i 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.280
 think that's part of it now 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.370
 that's the experience 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.420
 for sure we have a fairly young group 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.300
 maybe with some who have a little 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.180
 less experience but 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.710
 it was mostly finally we passed a 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.600
 important did not make a bad 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.980
 first period but we wanted too much 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 to do well we absolutely wanted to win 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.710
 I think we have lost 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.290
 they took advantage at the level of the big is 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.290
 like that a match that will kill tsetse over 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.540
 what I believe is motivation 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.060
 part of coach directly i believe 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.380
 that she did her job well every 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.500
 three like lingerie cauet and the case 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.870
 help that he has motivated us so 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.730
 the troop pattern leaves the team 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.810
 second match I think we did a 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.030
 very good match against Ukraine which has 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.090
 a big futsal nation the match 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.400
 against lokeren we have from the beginning 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.710
 we invented we were concentrated we were 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.980
 motivated and I believe that even at the 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.350
 half time cdvr 3 0 for us we missed 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.050
 full of opportunities because the second 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.030
 match there we played against horsehair I 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.460
 think we made the perfect match but 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.640
 I had you a 3 0 but almost perfect 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.890
 if we were more teeth was really 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.920
 concentrated there we saw that we saw that we 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.030
 had the opportunity to win the match 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.550
 as we play and I wanted that on the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.130
 field we missed we missed I have faith who 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.230
 frankly it was a shame if we had to 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.030
 spend a 12th all I think the team 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.550
 it was different who sees his 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.140
 concessions meaning qualifies there I'm talking to 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.870
 next match against russia at 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.670
 portugal counter at paca we were in 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.530
 train of power not it was 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.600
 a tournament with a lot of experience 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.850
 players who are professional 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.220
 public debt level I think that 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.050
 it was great i cracked i had 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.330
 in a room only five thousand people 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.800
 I think was a dream for all of me 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.360
 personally it was also a dream of 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.360
 play the euro especially in belgium 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.239
 good as a porter it takes 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.070
 advertising it was I think was fine I 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.330
 can accept a good image on all 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.730
 the matches they put on the TV 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.200
 but 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.670
 in Brazil for example go there 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.170
 family to watch games 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.940
 there what I think it was 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.890
 really good compared to that 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.280
 extraordinary experience I mean 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.910
 we had this chance to organize it and 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.220
 to participate 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.959
 necessarily now we have seen that the 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.010
 world answered present there was not bad 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.860
 of world for both matches monaco 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.840
 could not play it was good it was good 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.030
 organized 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.980
 I think that to support themselves 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.599
 and I think it was beautiful 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.090
 we are here to work we learn 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.790
 with with the older ones those who have 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.760
 more experience and I hope we will 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.110
 still there for the next round of a 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.700
 world cup or europe 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.500
 they already showed police you are 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.030
 able there is a lot of talent 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.720
 now we have to do something 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.640
 a good group welded for a lot of 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.500
 victories and the important date hood 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.450
 they are there but there is still a lot to 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.690
 work what I see I think he 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.670
 Five years ago here there was better 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.349
 generation who if today now 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.549
 in belgium to stay feet on 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.250
 earth and continue to work as 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.840
 they darken and I think that's the 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.639
 secret of success working 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.970
 always work to achieve 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.090
 summits 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.450
 the sport is very lucky I 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.810
 mean the record 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.600
 the previous record they were 200 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.560
 selections it's karim buying 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.820
 now I'm coming to 105 I hope 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.530
 put the bar as high as possible 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.120
 and here's hoping for a day dethroned by 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.840
 a young duo talented precisely the 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.730
 new generation 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.030
 I think the next race in 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.690
 serbia in 2016 and one has to cure it 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.150
 participate so we will do everything to 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.340
 coding yes I think that's it 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.530
 first part it must come from the union 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.950
 Belgian to change at the level of 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.920
 structure 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.230
 try evidence professionalize the 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.570
 beige futsal now it's a 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.850
 adaptation question in relation to 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.040
 the belgian union versus a help with 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.810
 the clubs and if you see I think they 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.240
 feed here in belgium 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.640
 when you go all the open accounts in 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.280
 Spain in Russia to all federations 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.800
 who is in the nails of 6.3 now 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.000
 I think that it is necessary to speak between the 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.050
 cno bella belgian union 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.050
 these festivities
