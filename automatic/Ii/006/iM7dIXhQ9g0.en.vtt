00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.100 

and<00:02:10.220> you<00:02:10.460> can<00:02:10.640> see<00:02:12.850> 330<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:14.110> significantly

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
and you can see 330 is significantly

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.520 
and you can see 330 is significantly
smaller<00:02:15.230> all<00:02:16.010> side<00:02:16.670> by<00:02:16.700> side<00:02:19.780> with<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.900> three

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
smaller all side by side with the three

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:30.310 
smaller all side by side with the three
countries<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:27.980> 330<00:02:28.820> on<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.090> left<00:02:29.420> 300<00:02:30.110> on<00:02:30.200> the

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
countries so 330 on the left 300 on the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:51.940 
countries so 330 on the left 300 on the
right<00:02:36.310> profile<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:45.470> behind<00:02:50.740> profile<00:02:51.740> from

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
right profile and behind profile from

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.199 
right profile and behind profile from
the<00:02:52.100> left<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.990> smaller<00:02:56.990> and<00:02:57.940> also<00:02:58.940> I

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
the left so it is smaller and also I

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:08.410 
the left so it is smaller and also I
like<00:02:59.540> to<00:03:02.590> stuff<00:03:03.590> like<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.950> kind<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.489> fact<00:03:07.420> she

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:36.010 
know it is really really light it feels
almost<00:03:29.480> like<00:03:32.110> like<00:03:33.110> one<00:03:33.290> uh<00:03:33.340> mega<00:03:34.340> zoom<00:03:35.020> and

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
almost like like one uh mega zoom and

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.949 
almost like like one uh mega zoom and
shoot<00:03:38.050> for<00:03:39.050> those<00:03:39.230> who<00:03:39.350> 103<00:03:39.890> in<00:03:40.580> the<00:03:40.820> Hama<00:03:41.030> 300

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
shoot for those who 103 in the Hama 300

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.890

lenses i come off my own little also

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.790 
lenses i come off my own little also
from<00:04:10.670> here<00:04:11.140> else<00:04:12.140> is<00:04:12.320> in<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.530> ball<00:04:14.650> goes<00:04:15.650> the

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
from here else is in the ball goes the

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:38.820 
from here else is in the ball goes the
way<00:04:16.480> this<00:04:20.530> 18<00:04:21.530> 25<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:35.720> battery<00:04:37.030> charger

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
way this 18 25 and battery charger

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.090 
way this 18 25 and battery charger
actually<00:04:39.830> it<00:04:40.220> looks<00:04:40.760> surprisingly<00:04:42.100> plugs

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
actually it looks surprisingly plugs

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.290 
actually it looks surprisingly plugs
into<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.580> wall<00:04:43.700> so<00:04:44.330> that's<00:04:44.540> pretty<00:04:45.050> good<00:04:45.170> a

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
into the wall so that's pretty good a

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.880 
into the wall so that's pretty good a
convenient<00:04:47.300> space<00:04:47.780> they<00:04:48.080> ought<00:04:48.230> to<00:04:48.260> a<00:04:48.470> mess<00:04:48.740> of

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
convenient space they ought to a mess of

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:57.460 
convenient space they ought to a mess of
wires<00:04:51.040> eyepiece<00:04:52.040> cover<00:04:55.810> shoulder<00:04:56.810> strap<00:04:57.140> next

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
wires eyepiece cover shoulder strap next

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:04.560 
wires eyepiece cover shoulder strap next
craft<00:04:59.290> and<00:05:00.550> all<00:05:01.550> this<00:05:01.730> the<00:05:01.850> better<00:05:02.060> actually

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.310 

now<00:05:05.570> it<00:05:05.750> is<00:05:05.870> a<00:05:05.930> different<00:05:06.380> battery<00:05:08.320> compared

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
now it is a different battery compared

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.970
