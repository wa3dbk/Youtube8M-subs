00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.040
 snowboard is a platform game 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.870
 traded in the year 1990 the games were 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.430
 originally launched for mayors but 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.950
 also counts conversions for others 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.690
 platforms like mega drive convoy nes and 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.010
 mobile phones 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.050
 the game is to eliminate the 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.880
 enemies throwing snow at them the 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.860
 we turn into balls and we throw ourselves 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.090
 roll to keep knocking down the others 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.220
 enemies that cross us on the way 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.720
 of game we also have four 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.329
 types of emotions which give us 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.190
 some benefits like for example the 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.780
 Red position increases the speed of 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.120
 displacement possibly in which 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.040
 more let's use the blue position 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.480
 increases the amount of snow and so 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.430
 both the firing power that the 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.970
 project is so agile if we freeze 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.590
 we received much faster to press 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.050
 the yellow increases the distance in 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.700
 the one that we throw and angel the green emotion 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.590
 it was a special position that 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.570
 appears only on selected screens 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.470
 and it only works during the screen in 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.239
 the one that appears 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.610
 returning the character to normal 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.229
 after a few moments I agree only to give 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.909
 10 levels has always seemed like a 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.770
 boss which could be killed by throwing it 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.689
 the little creatures that he created or 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.340
 appeared next to this in some 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.460
 game choices 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.520
 drive had many more clues and with 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.679
 this much more following end of 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.569
 all versions the arcade version the 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.399
 version more known to the public and is 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:30.490
 the most difficult of all but they do not have 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.289
 a story the nintendo version is 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.810
 the easiest of all besides that it brings 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.200
 less enemy items and also lacks 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.420
 of the story mode 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.340
 the gameboy version is slower without 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.840
 However they also give some bonuses the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.670
 amount of enemies on screen is usually 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.350
 be inferior and rarely exceed 5 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.270
 making it easier than the version 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.610
 of recreational the good thing is that it has two 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.100
 exclusive extra levels and has mode 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.020
 history the sega version is the most 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.960
 long of all having 20 levels 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.329
 exclusive extras in addition to having the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.429
 mode history the phone version 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.170
 mobile is the most recent there is so much 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.729
 for android like for iphone is a 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.950
 simple version in imitation of the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.830
 recreational version but it does not go 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.970
 according to the story 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.160
 snow bros is a very funny game 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.810
 especially in its arcade version so 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.040
 If you have not played it, I invite you to play 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.360
 this great little game 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.490
 as always I invite you to leave your 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.030
 opinions in the comment box we 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.030
