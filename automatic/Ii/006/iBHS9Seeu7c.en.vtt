00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.790
 I hope you understand 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.089
 Become uncrowned 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.089
 Tweety 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.110
 car 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.530
 cyber- 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:34.550
 Stay tuned for a stay on the propellant tank and also for large thrusters . 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:42.530
 It is a pedestal It will make a pedestal for fixation 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:44.100
 So it 's structurally that's an action-based structure, which is for height fixing 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.219
 This is a flight 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.699
 You see or did it move 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.970
 I feel like this I peeled off the movement of the slide 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:01:00.070
 It is said to turn off and fix the height 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:04.449
 Now you're ready to put your feet under it, yes 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:11.800
 Of course I made two stays, but I was very surprised 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:12.400
 It has been well designed I look Hey 9 if there is a part that can scaffold I dare a little inclined 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.960
 you know 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.680
 Leaning Tower of Pisa like the little it keeps time difference 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.190
 It is a place where I put this pedestal 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.980
 Here 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:31.140
 Look professional Guraguragura would have you know can 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:34.470
 I'm inclined a little, I was designed to lean 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.720
 It means that this one becomes stable 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:43.140
 Well then , the frame for this wearing is huge. 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.790
 I will build a frame for mounting thruster 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.220
 It's strangely huge 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:58.180
 It formed a Well Yusho crunch and the unique shape of the frame Ikuyo 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:03.640
 Now and then I that Yeah Yes plug inserted into this plug is also on this side Yes 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:06.850
 Come on, and that's what it feels like feeding unicorn Gundam main body 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.570
 Attached to the backpack this way 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:17.200
 It's like this, I'm off the brush right away 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:18.170
 Now'm in it behind we formed a frame for stick a Gatling gun 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.600
 This is also dark 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:27.200
 I think I'm a gray color you shop 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:32.269
 It looks like Do would be this part for reinforcement Yone 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:37.170
 Now I it in what wear black to individual parts of the Gatling 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.890
 Good good luck Gatling how to do how I should stick together 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.590
 A little trouble 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:50.800
 Come on like this cool long beam gatling gun gold stuck together 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:54.300
 By the way, I'm going to stick to this backpack to ease 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.850
 First of all put on a joint or chat here 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:05.670
 Hah-like this I attached a backpack and a gatling gun 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:08.450
 At this point it's pretty tight and you ca n't miss it by shaking it anymore 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.450
 feel well 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.310
 Now at home f 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.930
 I'm going to wear it 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.030
 It's Oyama 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:27.549
 Well, do you mean that Hyper Bazooka is here ? 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:33.040
 As we put the Gatling gun and shield both arms it a Sahoi 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:36.920
 Well then I will put a shield on the back side 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:42.490
 The shield is the seal behind this 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.490
 There appears to be no need to awaken the psycho frame 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:54.840
 It's about cool rice, it 's cool! 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:04:02.370
 Now it seems that we will put on hand grenade unit foot 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:08.069
 Oh well this hole this hole I did was for the Uehonto 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.830
 Some even by great it was armed as long-held also in real like a the and commands from the main Haretere 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.220
 Up to my daughter 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:17.110
 I will paste it for my daughter 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:22.000
 Come on now, it is super dodeca thruster, isn't it? 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:26.780
 I'm going to put this back behind me when I decorate it already 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.580
 I job even if in the manner without any lived longer I'm Toka removed usually 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:34.630
 You can go the last minute also even in the absence of a Taha This stand 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.920
 It's a bit dangerous, but I 'll cut it and break it 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:42.970
 You can't adjust the height now. 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:46.390
 On the other hand , I have to raise it 4 times to the maximum 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:51.730
 I can't say if I'm an abandoned child but my voice 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:54.650
 It's a great love for this too long distance movement For long distance movement at a very fast speed 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:05:00.979
 In order to get out of the waiting body because it is the difference with the specialist 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:04.490
 This I think there was also when I was fighting only for Toka such kana in the Now this server Sea 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:08.960
 Clearly, mobility worse What Now whether that time is disconnected 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:14.639
 When I was fighting with Banshee, I did not separate it, so I did not donate this . 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:19.979
 Oh Then this glad I firmly ward through the vibrant Ehora you have forgotten 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:24.360
 The part of that fixed meeting manipulator finger that can be lip is included with this kit 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:28.949
 I 'm holding it tight enough now and it's not movable. 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.310
 Well manipulator movable It is really Porori of that heavy weapons is that poses 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:36.130
 Since we sometimes have Porori often 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.130
 This fixed manipulator is very helpful 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.780
 tan tan 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.780
 It was with Tei
