00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.170
 hello good today let's see how 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.640
 convert a gpt disk into mode 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.290
 previous or oldest that would be lmr 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.790
 well for that we will use minitour 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.090
 from a wizard 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.700
 we started from scratch we closed and we opened it 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.740
 again we say yes we allow 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.670
 the changes are going to measure the partition 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.310
 wizard 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.529
 and when you have loaded 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.250
 we can check that there are three discs 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.239
 hard two of them very small 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.300
 expressly created for these 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.309
 tutorials the two are in the defense and 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.699
 you can check here below that they are 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.660
 gpt discs this disc however that 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:48.089
 would be the system is on disk mdr 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.920
 let's say we want to because yes because 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.860
 we need something to convert the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.030
 gp disk 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.120
 a disk mdr then with minitour partition 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.690
 wizard we can easily do it 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.140
 I remember that the gpt discs are fine 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.330
 for discs from two fabrics of 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.930
 size to be able to partition 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.220
 larger than 20 since the mmr does not 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.900
 It allows 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.540
 well now let's say we want 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.080
 convert this disk disk 2 that the 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.820
 axis pt to mdr how good to use the 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.960
 mini tour wizard partition is that although 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.210
 we have data and a partition within 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.619
 of the disc allows us to do the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.110
 conversion of both gta mmr and mdr 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.780
 to the gp thing that windows at least 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.340
 until windows 7 will allow us if not 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.510
 is the hard drive empty and without 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.180
 partitions 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.920
 alright now let's go where is the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.770
 We draw the hard disk 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.570
 secondary button of the mouse and we put 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:58.950
 we convert gp to the disk mdr we press 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.840
 and now we apply the changes 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.329
 as I have already told you in others 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.289
 tutorials should be careful with 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.330
 what is indicated here that is the 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.819
 energy management since yes 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.459
 when you are doing a conversion one 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.280
 copy or some operation with partitions 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.530
 if the energy management comes in 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.019
 You can cut it and you may lose all 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.019
 data as well as when you do operations 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:29.970
 with type partitions expand shrink 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:32.310
 copy conversion to gpt or mdr always 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.220
 It is recommended that you have all the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.519
 important data safeguarded in another 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.150
 device well we apply the changes 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.560
 pending and we say that if this with a 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.620
 Larger hard drive with more data 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.510
 It should take a lot longer but as 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.750
 they are very small hard drives 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.000
 creators for this take very little 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.840
 click on ok and we have the disk 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.319
 hard that was gp before we have it in 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.659
 mdr 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:05.969
 and nothing more with respect to the conversion 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:08.939
 from gp to mdr a greeting and even another if you 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:11.290
 you liked this video, like it if you do not 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:14.349
