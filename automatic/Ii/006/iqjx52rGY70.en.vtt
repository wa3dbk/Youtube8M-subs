need to wait also about to understand
that<00:02:38.379> the<00:02:38.560> level<00:02:38.829> of<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:38.980> bites<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.599> 2010<00:02:40.599> but

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
that the level of the bites of 2010 but

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.319 
that the level of the bites of 2010 but
I<00:02:41.409> think<00:02:41.739> all<00:02:42.189> the<00:02:42.340> three<00:02:42.519> riders<00:02:42.939> will<00:02:43.299> be

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
I think all the three riders will be

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.800 
I think all the three riders will be
very<00:02:44.200> difficult<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.769> beat<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:46.239> have<00:02:46.450> made<00:02:46.629> no

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
very difficult to beat you have made no

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.210 
very difficult to beat you have made no
secret<00:02:47.049> of<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.440> fact<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:47.769> you<00:02:47.950> are<00:02:48.069> not

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
secret of the fact that you are not

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.710 
secret of the fact that you are not
happy<00:02:48.489> about<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:49.000> new<00:02:49.150> engine<00:02:49.329> rule

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
happy about the new engine rule

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.240 
happy about the new engine rule
restricting<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.409> amount<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.799> engines<00:02:51.190> that

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
restricting the amount of engines that

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.339 
restricting the amount of engines that
can<00:02:51.519> be<00:02:51.639> used<00:02:51.849> in<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.120> season<00:02:52.329> how<00:02:53.049> would<00:02:53.200> you

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
can be used in a season how would you

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.309 
can be used in a season how would you
change<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.799> if<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.040> could<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.690> think<00:02:55.690> will<00:02:56.170> be<00:02:56.290> a

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
change it if you could I think will be a

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.979 
change it if you could I think will be a
difficult<00:02:56.560> rule<00:02:57.400> for<00:02:58.239> everybody<00:02:58.629> because

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
difficult rule for everybody because

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.890 
difficult rule for everybody because
just<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.590> 6<00:02:59.829> n<00:02:59.980> gs<00:03:00.340> for<00:03:00.819> one<00:03:00.970> season<00:03:01.299> is<00:03:01.690> not

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
just a 6 n gs for one season is not

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.979 
just a 6 n gs for one season is not
enough<00:03:02.170> is<00:03:02.409> very<00:03:02.620> tight<00:03:02.940> if<00:03:03.940> we<00:03:04.150> have<00:03:04.299> eight<00:03:04.690> or

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
enough is very tight if we have eight or

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.449 
enough is very tight if we have eight or
ten<00:03:05.379> is<00:03:05.680> more<00:03:06.549> easy<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.420> less<00:03:08.260> risky<00:03:08.739> but<00:03:09.310> this

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
ten is more easy and less risky but this

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.970 
ten is more easy and less risky but this
is<00:03:09.609> a<00:03:09.639> rule<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.389> all<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.079> manufactures<00:03:11.739> have

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
is a rule so all the manufactures have

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.479 
is a rule so all the manufactures have

asked to be made to the m1 for this
season<00:04:08.099> we<00:04:09.099> try<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.370> work<00:04:09.639> to<00:04:10.030> improve<00:04:10.209> them

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
season we try to work to improve them

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.050 
season we try to work to improve them
one<00:04:10.720> in<00:04:10.900> two<00:04:11.109> in<00:04:11.590> two<00:04:11.769> ways<00:04:11.919> the<00:04:12.250> first<00:04:12.609> one<00:04:12.849> is

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
one in two in two ways the first one is

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.710 
one in two in two ways the first one is
the<00:04:13.629> chasis<00:04:14.019> we<00:04:14.409> try<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:15.479> improve<00:04:16.479> the

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
the chasis we try to improve the

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.990 
the chasis we try to improve the
stability<00:04:16.989> of<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.560> m1<00:04:17.889> and<00:04:18.159> create<00:04:18.669> a<00:04:18.760> better

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
stability of the m1 and create a better

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.580 
stability of the m1 and create a better
grip<00:04:19.269> and<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:20.590> second<00:04:20.979> one<00:04:21.340> is<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.789> engine

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
grip and the second one is the engine

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.760 
grip and the second one is the engine
because

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.590 

we<00:04:26.770> need<00:04:26.919> a<00:04:27.280> little<00:04:27.430> bit<00:04:27.610> more<00:04:27.820> horsepower<00:04:27.940> but

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
we need a little bit more horsepower but

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.640 
we need a little bit more horsepower but
at<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.050> same<00:04:29.229> time<00:04:30.479> we<00:04:31.479> need<00:04:31.630> to<00:04:31.930> work<00:04:32.350> just

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
at the same time we need to work just

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.860 
at the same time we need to work just
with<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:32.979> six<00:04:33.160> engine<00:04:33.610> for<00:04:33.850> 18<00:04:34.120> races<00:04:34.300> so<00:04:34.720> we

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
with the six engine for 18 races so we

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.070 
with the six engine for 18 races so we
need<00:04:35.020> a<00:04:35.889> little<00:04:36.340> bit<00:04:36.550> more<00:04:36.850> power<00:04:37.509> but<00:04:37.810> at<00:04:37.960> the

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
need a little bit more power but at the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.469

year<00:06:08.740> I<00:06:09.060> did<00:06:10.060> another<00:06:10.630> test<00:06:10.900> with<00:06:11.169> the<00:06:11.229> Ferrari

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
year I did another test with the Ferrari

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.939 
year I did another test with the Ferrari
Formula<00:06:11.710> One<00:06:11.979> in<00:06:12.570> Barcelona<00:06:13.570> it<00:06:14.229> was<00:06:14.349> great

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:14.949 
Formula One in Barcelona it was great

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:18.719 
Formula One in Barcelona it was great
I<00:06:14.979> enjoy<00:06:15.940> a<00:06:15.970> lot<00:06:16.240> quite<00:06:17.229> good<00:06:17.470> lap<00:06:17.680> times<00:06:17.949> but<00:06:18.699> I

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
I enjoy a lot quite good lap times but I

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.689 
I enjoy a lot quite good lap times but I
think<00:06:19.030> will<00:06:19.210> be<00:06:19.360> very<00:06:20.050> difficult<00:06:20.260> to<00:06:20.979> see<00:06:21.490> me

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
think will be very difficult to see me

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:24.990 
think will be very difficult to see me
in<00:06:22.120> Formula<00:06:22.659> One<00:06:23.400> what<00:06:24.400> do<00:06:24.490> you<00:06:24.580> think<00:06:24.880> about

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
in Formula One what do you think about

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.920 
in Formula One what do you think about
Schumacher<00:06:25.659> returning<00:06:26.260> to<00:06:26.409> f1<00:06:27.389> yeah<00:06:28.389> I<00:06:28.720> think

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
Schumacher returning to f1 yeah I think

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.689 
Schumacher returning to f1 yeah I think
would<00:06:29.169> be<00:06:29.289> quite<00:06:29.590> interesting<00:06:30.190> to<00:06:30.280> understand

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
would be quite interesting to understand

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:34.709 
would be quite interesting to understand
the<00:06:31.030> the<00:06:31.720> speed<00:06:32.590> of<00:06:32.889> Michael<00:06:33.580> after<00:06:34.479> three

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:34.719 
the the speed of Michael after three

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:36.900 
the the speed of Michael after three
three<00:06:35.169> years<00:06:35.409> stop

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
three years stop

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.210 
three years stop
is<00:06:37.480> what<00:06:37.870> Schumacher<00:06:38.410> is<00:06:38.650> doing<00:06:38.950> something

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
is what Schumacher is doing something

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.400 
is what Schumacher is doing something

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
you could see yourself doing that is

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.860 
you could see yourself doing that is
leaving<00:06:41.890> MotoGP<00:06:42.820> for<00:06:43.060> a<00:06:43.090> few<00:06:43.300> years<00:06:43.540> and<00:06:43.750> then

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
leaving MotoGP for a few years and then

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.020 
leaving MotoGP for a few years and then
returning<00:06:44.440> or<00:06:44.800> do<00:06:45.010> you<00:06:45.100> think<00:06:45.400> that<00:06:45.610> when<00:06:45.880> you

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 
do decide to retire it will be for good

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.530 
do decide to retire it will be for good
is<00:06:49.660> a<00:06:49.720> difficult<00:06:50.200> question<00:06:50.320> I<00:06:50.650> don't<00:06:50.710> know<00:06:51.480> mmm
