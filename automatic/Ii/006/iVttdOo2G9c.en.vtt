00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
think of using it as a second a

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.490 
think of using it as a second a
refresher<00:02:23.030> for<00:02:23.120> my<00:02:23.300> curls<00:02:23.630> if<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.900> came<00:02:24.110> out<00:02:24.320> as

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
refresher for my curls if it came out as

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.940 
refresher for my curls if it came out as
a<00:02:24.580> spray<00:02:25.580> spray<00:02:25.940> but<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.080> comes<00:02:27.290> out<00:02:27.500> as<00:02:27.680> like<00:02:27.920> a

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
a spray spray but it comes out as like a

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.810 
a spray spray but it comes out as like a
stream<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.840> really<00:02:30.140> feel<00:02:30.350> like<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.650> can't<00:02:30.980> put

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
stream so I really feel like I can't put

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.300 
stream so I really feel like I can't put
that<00:02:32.350> like<00:02:33.350> in<00:02:33.500> my<00:02:33.590> hair<00:02:33.860> like<00:02:33.890> it's<00:02:34.190> just

had anyway if my hair's already dry so I

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.220

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
was like okay that's kind of silly so

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.030 
was like okay that's kind of silly so
how<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.620> used<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:53.170> was<00:02:54.170> just<00:02:54.470> used<00:02:54.650> like<00:02:54.830> my

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
how I used it I was just used like my

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.460 
how I used it I was just used like my
leave-in<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.970> then<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:56.540> used<00:02:56.870> my<00:02:56.960> Darcy's

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
leave-in and then I used my Darcy's

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.880 
leave-in and then I used my Darcy's
botanicals<00:02:58.160> coiling<00:02:58.730> or<00:02:59.540> what<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.440> coils

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
botanicals coiling or what the coils

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.940 
botanicals coiling or what the coils
curling<00:03:01.760> jelly<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.900> then<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.470> would<00:03:03.590> put<00:03:03.740> this

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
curling jelly and then I would put this

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.220 
curling jelly and then I would put this
on<00:03:04.280> top<00:03:04.700> is<00:03:05.000> like<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.330> finisher<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:06.860> mean

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
on top is like the finisher and I mean

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.290 
on top is like the finisher and I mean
it<00:03:09.230> didn't<00:03:09.590> do<00:03:09.770> anything<00:03:10.070> bad

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
it didn't do anything bad

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.280 
it didn't do anything bad
but<00:03:11.570> I<00:03:11.840> feel<00:03:12.170> like<00:03:12.200> if<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.950> was<00:03:13.070> supposed<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.520> be

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
but I feel like if it was supposed to be

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.710 
but I feel like if it was supposed to be
like<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.320> refresher<00:03:15.860> like<00:03:16.400> more<00:03:16.700> water<00:03:17.090> base<00:03:17.450> I

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
like a refresher like more water base I

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.800 
like a refresher like more water base I
wanted<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.320> maybe<00:03:18.980> soften<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.210> hold<00:03:20.450> of

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
wanted it to maybe soften the hold of

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.270 
wanted it to maybe soften the hold of
the<00:03:20.870> curling<00:03:21.320> jelly<00:03:21.560> because<00:03:21.830> I<00:03:22.100> feel<00:03:22.250> like

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
the curling jelly because I feel like

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.640 
the curling jelly because I feel like
that<00:03:22.459> can<00:03:23.330> often<00:03:23.780> make<00:03:24.110> people's<00:03:24.500> hair

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
that can often make people's hair

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.130 
that can often make people's hair
crunchy<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.550> we<00:03:26.120> don't<00:03:26.300> like<00:03:26.510> crunchy<00:03:26.900> here

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
crunchy and we don't like crunchy here

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.190 
crunchy and we don't like crunchy here
we<00:03:27.320> like<00:03:27.500> soft<00:03:27.830> no<00:03:28.700> hair<00:03:29.350> so<00:03:30.350> um<00:03:31.810> but<00:03:32.810> yeah<00:03:33.020> my

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
we like soft no hair so um but yeah my

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.320 
we like soft no hair so um but yeah my
hair<00:03:33.410> was<00:03:33.800> still<00:03:34.040> pretty<00:03:34.430> crunchy<00:03:34.790> after<00:03:35.300> I

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
hair was still pretty crunchy after I

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.880 
hair was still pretty crunchy after I
think<00:03:35.780> one<00:03:36.400> time<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.640> wasn't<00:03:37.850> crunchy<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:38.890> I

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
think one time it wasn't crunchy and I

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.320 
think one time it wasn't crunchy and I
don't<00:03:40.760> know<00:03:41.209> why<00:03:41.540> exactly<00:03:42.130> but<00:03:43.130> any<00:03:44.120> other

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
don't know why exactly but any other

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.220 
don't know why exactly but any other
time<00:03:44.450> uses<00:03:44.959> definitely<00:03:45.380> crunchy<00:03:45.709> still<00:03:45.950> and

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
time uses definitely crunchy still and

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.410 
time uses definitely crunchy still and
it<00:03:48.230> I<00:03:48.650> mean<00:03:49.040> I<00:03:49.430> feel<00:03:49.760> like<00:03:49.940> my<00:03:50.060> hair<00:03:50.270> wasn't

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
it I mean I feel like my hair wasn't

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.880 
it I mean I feel like my hair wasn't
that<00:03:50.600> frizzy<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.050> begin<00:03:51.290> with<00:03:51.470> so<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:51.680> don't

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
that frizzy to begin with so I don't

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.680 
that frizzy to begin with so I don't
really<00:03:52.040> think<00:03:52.130> it<00:03:52.490> like<00:03:52.700> decrease<00:03:53.120> frizz<00:03:53.420> or

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
really think it like decrease frizz or

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.650 
really think it like decrease frizz or
anything<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.890> I<00:03:55.250> mean<00:03:55.490> it<00:03:55.700> was<00:03:55.820> fine

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
anything so I mean it was fine

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.080 
anything so I mean it was fine
but<00:03:57.380> it<00:03:57.590> just<00:03:57.620> wasn't<00:03:57.890> anything<00:03:58.400> to<00:03:58.940> write

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
but it just wasn't anything to write

gonna say it's terrible like it didn't

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.340 
gonna say it's terrible like it didn't
it<00:04:07.490> didn't<00:04:07.760> make<00:04:07.910> my<00:04:08.209> hair<00:04:08.450> frizzy<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.080> didn't

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
it didn't make my hair frizzy it didn't

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.760 
it didn't make my hair frizzy it didn't
make<00:04:10.010> my<00:04:10.340> hair<00:04:10.580> dry<00:04:11.150> per<00:04:12.140> se<00:04:12.410> but<00:04:12.470> it<00:04:12.680> was

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
make my hair dry per se but it was

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.280 
make my hair dry per se but it was
basically<00:04:13.130> just<00:04:13.280> like<00:04:13.520> I<00:04:13.670> hadn't<00:04:14.150> used<00:04:14.330> it<00:04:14.570> so

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
basically just like I hadn't used it so

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.770 
basically just like I hadn't used it so
um<00:04:16.040> I<00:04:16.100> guess<00:04:16.640> it's<00:04:16.940> not<00:04:17.120> you<00:04:17.419> know<00:04:17.540> it's

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
um I guess it's not you know it's

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.150 
um I guess it's not you know it's
probably<00:04:17.900> not<00:04:18.080> stick<00:04:18.380> enough<00:04:18.620> for<00:04:18.830> my<00:04:18.919> hair

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
probably not stick enough for my hair

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.099 
probably not stick enough for my hair
cuz<00:04:19.430> my<00:04:19.580> look<00:04:20.150> at<00:04:20.270> my<00:04:20.390> hair<00:04:20.600> it's<00:04:20.750> like<00:04:20.810> getting

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
cuz my look at my hair it's like getting

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.040 
cuz my look at my hair it's like getting
big<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.910> is<00:04:22.910> he's<00:04:23.570> doing<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:23.930> lot<00:04:24.110> so
