00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
this particular guy right here this big

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.899 
this particular guy right here this big
tree<00:01:39.780> if<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:39.960> start<00:01:40.350> attacking<00:01:40.590> him<00:01:40.979> he<00:01:41.549> will

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
tree if you start attacking him he will

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
tree if you start attacking him he will
slap<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.320> out<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.530> you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
slap the out of you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.730 
slap the out of you
and<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.520> will<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.750> pretty<00:01:46.020> much<00:01:46.170> die<00:01:46.470> right

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and you will you pretty much die right

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.530 
and you will you pretty much die right
away<00:01:46.860> he<00:01:47.250> hits<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.670> few<00:01:47.909> times<00:01:48.119> you're<00:01:48.270> done

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
away he hits you a few times you're done

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.300 
away he hits you a few times you're done
he<00:01:48.930> also<00:01:49.170> slows<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.649> down<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.189> really

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
he also slows you down so it's really

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.039 
he also slows you down so it's really
difficult<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.790> get<00:01:50.880> away<00:01:51.090> from<00:01:51.149> him<00:01:51.509> now<00:01:51.689> I'm
