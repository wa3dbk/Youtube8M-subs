00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.400
 and 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.400
 and 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.410
 Y 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.890
 Hello friends today we do 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.770
 a puff filled with cream in pieces 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.560
 Individuals that are very good and already 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.360
 you will see that they are very easy to do 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.570
 we will need to make this puff pastry 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.730
 naturally two puff pastry plates in 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.710
 our channel the sign of alella you can 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.110
 find how the puff pastry is made 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.940
 You can also buy it in the 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.800
 supermarkets that also sell it already 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.530
 prepared and it's much more comfortable 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.660
 pinions need that now 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.250
 we will put in water 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.730
 water to paint a little sugar and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.690
 gloss icing sugar or ground sugar and 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.780
 Special cream for riding with 35% 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.160
 fat and an egg for later 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.160
 also paint over 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.020
 first of all we will put the oven in 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.570
 march because as you do not need 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.520
 fragmentation we have to know ourselves a 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.700
 Once they are finished I have put the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.250
 oven to warm to 250 degrees and then 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.490
 we will lower it to 200 we have also put 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.670
 in water the pine nuts so that we are not 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.890
 burn inside the oven 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.450
 we started 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.860
 we will paint with water 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.860
 one of the two plates 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.789
 well all 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.369
 so that it sticks to us we go because with 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.850
 a single plate would be very 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.850
 short 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.950
 and now 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.950
 one 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.909
 we tighten the dough well 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.310
 To do that, they stick and we despise 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.780
 so that we are well squared 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:17.560
 the songs because the puff pastry is nice 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.130
 who wants very regular part 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.610
 Exterior 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.610
 so we choose everything that is left over 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.390
 more or less we put them of 16 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.390
 centimeters 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.720
 we already have sides 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.720
 our cable 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.510
 now we will pass them in another can 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.510
 because we have to leave a separation 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.140
 we have beaten an egg 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.260
 especially that they are well chafa ditos 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.960
 well rinsed that they stick a layer of 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.710
 one or the other 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.710
 we painted 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.840
 we expose the pine nuts 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.270
 and we will now put over 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.270
 our puff pastry plates 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.390
 once we have put the pine nuts 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.970
 we will manage a little bit so that we 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:36.310
 stick well because many times the 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:39.500
 pine nuts fall off and so they stick together with 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.069
 the egg and the dough 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.770
 go 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.290
 to bake 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.610
 250 oven 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.610
 above and below 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.010
 and now 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.390
 we lower it 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.060
 to 190 or so because he speaks the first 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.670
 heat like it's not too hot to 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.170
 that the dough takes off and 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.470
 then the culture has to be more 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.260
 soft 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.470
 while we have the puff pastry in the oven 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:20.070
 now let's ride the cream 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.070
 remember 35% minimum fat 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.500
 the bucket that we are going to use we have 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.190
 had about 5 or 10 minutes in the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.199
 runner and cream or milk cream 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.259
 also about 10 minutes a quarter of 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:41.599
 time for it to be cool for 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.599
 ride it takes very cold we start 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.190
 once we have the whipped cream 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.480
 now we will put the sugar 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:04.350
 illustrious thus undoes rather 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:08.150
 can be put in grains and the amount 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.150
 it's a little bit to taste 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:12.810
 and now we just removed with a 

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:17.350
 spatula 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.969
 with more rods what you want is like this 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.269
 integrating all the sugar 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:26.149
 and we have the cream ready we have covered 

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:28.610
 the cream with plastic film by cabal 

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:30.979
 we will reserve in the refrigerator while 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.869
 the buttonholes that already have 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.849
 be ready in the oven 

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:37.009
 he has us puff pastry 18 minutes 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.160
 inside the oven we go to any other 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.100
 exit 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.180
 Fantastic kuala 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.180
 Madrid unit 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:53.050
 Authentic baker's shop 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.630
 we have rivers and what we are going to do 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.600
 is to split the 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.370
 by one 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.370
 and the parties in half 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.110
 let's try to leave the lid come 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.020
 one corresponding 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:15.430
 to know what stage 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.430
 it's up to each one 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.620
 remember and 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.550
 we will put the cream in a pastry bag 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:40.050
 I invent this power but very well 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.990
 and so we do not leave them 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.040
 the move 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.190
 best of curl 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.490
 so that we are more beautiful is from 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.490

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:03.729
 all right 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.690
 we are going to cover 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:17.300
 and finally 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:19.590
 we will put sugar luster sugar ground 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.300
 as a final 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.720
