00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.050
 i 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.670
 hello girls that such another day nor with 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.640
 you yes 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.160
 super rainy with the storm 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.960
 Awesome 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.430
 five days trying to record but the 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 time does not improve 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.310
 sybase you want 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.740
 I have here a focus that you see above 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.090
 do not 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.470
 As for the hairstyle then good 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.100
 You have seen or seen it in the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.769
 miniature 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.120
 simple and it serves us so much for some 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.550
 ceremony as for 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.550
 for us 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.440
 so that's pretty let's say versatile and 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.750
 come and without more we begin 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.140
 Well, as you can see, I have it ready for you 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.539
 I have put the stripe very little next 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.390
 but only up to here let's say up 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.390
 the height of the ear and then the other 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.280
 side even stretching to more or less 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.180
 I have separated that we are going to work with the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.350
 after 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.350
 once 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.290
 and now we comb are curtains 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:18.000
 and to take us or not to this part of 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:22.640
 here in more or less and we're going to take a 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.360
 strand to start a radius braid 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.190
 normal and current and in this case I'm going 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.190
 to make pretty loose 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.640
 we leave 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.890
 the first stretch of ranges 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:45.290
 normal shrinks 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.980
 nothing and now we would take 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:53.760
 a lock and we had it 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:56.330
 on top we cojemos another lock 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.330
 and we had it 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.890
 from above you see me like this in strange postures 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.490
 because I have a table here and 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.000
 I can not look at myself 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.000
 we passed 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.869
 now live 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.010
 and so 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.760
 but as you can see I have arrived 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.770
 I had separated 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.350
 and I will continue 3 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.350
 this time normal day 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.000
 with now I have finished and we are going to 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:02.890
 open it 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.890
 first all and how we want 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.340
 and we're going to do it, I think in this 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.550
 address 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.550
 we could take out 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.819
 even a little more 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.870
 from January 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.870
 and now 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.920
 yes 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:35.390
 do not put me on ants in a 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.390
 and watching to see how you like more 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.390
 d 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:48.120
 but let's see 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.430
 and since it does not look pretty and so on 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.680
 well this more or less I have 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.310
 exceeded yet not usually held well 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.640
 well well 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.760
 this is not worth 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.240
 and now we would work on this other 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.240
 side 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.540
 and from there I could not 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.780
 appreciate us also today the storm 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.650
 that is falling right now is 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.650
 Awesome 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.820
 well we are going to make another braid in 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.990
 this case will no longer give us almost my 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.150
 father 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:31.889
 ok we're going to start like this 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.870
 and up to then go back to making another 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.790
 mount and we would follow 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.460
 well cheat him to determine 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.070
 smile I will be directed a little bit 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.280
 toward 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.850
 now we could do several things from 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.130
 another doll up here if you feel like it or 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:54.130
 let's say unite it later then 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.130
 we perfect a little bit the one we have 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.229
 that in my case is what I'm going to do 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.939
 look at this you see that the press had a 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.210
 shorter strand and it has not arrived by 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:06.210
 that 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.750
 and me 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.630
 I would simply go looking to see 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.030
 where do we put it and other 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.520
 good as you see I have not gotten here and 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.380
 now 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.230
 something like that 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.230
 - and now it would start 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:50.069
 does not have a 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.810
 of the braid 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.350
 a little bit because you see that this has 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:09.500
 stayed art 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.500
 and now we have to paste what we say 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.800
 this 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.020
 ah 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.100
 A) Yes 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.750
 Well that's how it's been more or 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:35.360
 less is going to perfect all of these 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.800
 Experts I always tell you in all 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.800
 the videos the wenzhao humidity but 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:43.040
 good with this simple of bristles by 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.050
 example or with forgiving this little brush 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.350
 earrings that you only use for 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.880
 this you throw a little bit of lacquer or 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.249
 brush or the other 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.050
 you go with the long 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:58.389
 and that was super perfected 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:02.020
 especially if you put face to make it 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:04.810
 a little bit strong now 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:08.139
 because also good the long the storm 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:12.490
 the water can not go out to take care of 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:15.560
 poor creature good as she looked 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:18.139
 so you can see it 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.669
 what you want to look on this side 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:21.669
 it is also super simple 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.789
 with her 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.790
 the video I hope you liked it 

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:37.650

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.650

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.750
 i 

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.990
 Y 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.990
 to 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.680
 i 

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.680
 ah
