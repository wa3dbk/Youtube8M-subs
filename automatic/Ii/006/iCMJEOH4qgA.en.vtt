00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.080
 February 10 in the village of cells 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.330
 Middle Akhtuba district of Volgograd 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.789
 the heating season ends 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.289
 two months before the deadline in 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.150
 the local boiler room will be completely 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.340
 spent and all stocks stove 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.140
 fuel supply disruptions led 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.119
 to the fact that during the past week 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.579
 the village was not supplied with heat 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.350
 The school and kindergarten of 400 inhabitants worked 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.020
 tenements rescued from 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.600
 cold using electrical appliances 12 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.440
 degrees is after from apple after 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.630
 how was the air conditioner turned and walk 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.730
 falls at home wearing a medal but my 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.160
 can see the headdress in shawls 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.170
 warm robe 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.410
 raspberry in a different way and so 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.680
 during the month of January we go dressed 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.820
 and spin well now here 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:10.170
 have adjusted then generally sidil fold dead and 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:14.040
 of course you see me cool 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.880
 hip joints on the fence lives 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.939
 so he warmed all my height sent 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.359
 because the cold can show even I 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.549
 all the rooms began to get dark well it is 1 2 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.950
 money will not start the garden does not work 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:34.340
 children for a week someplace even you 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.340
 school went on friday on thursday why 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.880
 start from vacation time to 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.220
 rather than water but a thought is warm as you save 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:51.430
 but the rooms tolerate nothing stone 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.790
 red-hot turn on what's there how much 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.540
 nothing dressed difficulties big 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.700
 utilities are very big especially this winter 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.460
 money difficulties with finances not for 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.330
 what to buy from them even fuel oles them 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.350
 Someone who is somewhere there is not your own 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.180
 pockets fold as you can and 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.730
 will bring it bring bad give such 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.310
 what he says is bad and we are waiting for the heat 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.450
 our study type night is no longer here 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.280
 Today dash do everything for Christ’s sake 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.760
 let them give money let them buy 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.980
 good fuel live until spring Herman 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.380
 Romanovich sahabov could lead the dawn 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.150
 2012 since the situation 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.160
 heat supply only worsened 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.050
 exacerbation of the situation was not connected 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.150
 only with full deterioration of heat networks 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.920
 and extremely low efficiency of old 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.450
 boilers from last year regional 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.430
 the government has ceased to allocate force 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.200
 February heating subsidies 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.570
 debt to fuel suppliers 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.280
 exceeded 10 million rubles of fuel 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.350
 released on security of property 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.299
 laid house life administrative 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.190
 building two land plots as well 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.049
 personal property of the head of the village council and 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.239
 director mup dawn what's needed 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.830
 authorities who have made you help 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.390
 get these subsidies overbearing 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.530
 which we at least get the money 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.210
 who came last year at 3 4 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.400
 quatre that we have not paid, you can 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.710
 more or less a bit of highs to reach 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.450
 the end and buy any season german room 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.850
 on only for a few months 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.100
 tried to reach officials he 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.690
 wrote letters to the district and regional 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.700
 the administration even addressed the reception 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.830
 President of Russia for the most part 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.580
 appeals officials have not responded well 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.440
 besides the answer of the subscription which were but 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.650
 formal replies are basically what we mean 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.020
 the fourteenth year will be according to plan 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.760
 built by gas boiler to 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:47.240
 move on to gas heating 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:50.240
 as a heating season 13-14 year should 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.280
 survive about this not a word the village is brought 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.370
 4 tons or 4 cubes 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.230
 fuel judge from the flow rate by temperature 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.210
 which is now on the street somewhere and a half 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.350
 tons per day that is enough somewhere on 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.140
 two and a half three days 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.780
 I understand that this is really enough 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.250
 Today we have already delivered another 7 tons and are 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.650
 negotiations with other suppliers then 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.630
 there is to bring more fuel then 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.580
 there is a thought for now the problem is still 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.410
 on remains but it is controlled by 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.910
 the government at the ministry we have it 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.710
 keep and control do not remove 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.430
 Responsibility without heat 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.799
 defend 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.870
 all technical aviation activities 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.150
 muddy dawn were taken correct 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.250
 therefore not allowed enough 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.530
 global and big that's the trouble which 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.330
 could be depending on natural 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.000
 conditions the cost of heating the village 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.650
 cod per season ranges from 14 to 15 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.240
 million rubles due to the fact that 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.310
 regional government appoints 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.500
 tariffs are significantly lower than actual 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.060
 cost arises large debt 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.039
 for repayment of which earlier the same 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.630
 regional authorities issued a township 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:50.660
 administration funds to pay off 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.940
 credit debt in 2014 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.789
 receiving such subsidies is under 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.560
 big issue in the draft budget for 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.599
 the fourteenth year these subsidies were not 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.669
 provided for or provided for their full 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.289
 volume but also that this project 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.210
 budget which was presented to the regional 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.039
 Duma was developed was proposed precisely 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.169
 government including ministry 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.930
 fuel and energy economy and so 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.490
 beyond this are our fraction budget 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.930
 no votes in a fraction of which not 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.009
 support including due to the fact that 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.060
 municipalities 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.979
 it is not only a situation 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.139
 Middle Akhtuba district it concerns 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.599
 most municipalities 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.159
 who are now not up to receive subsidies 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:28.010
 which are laid by the sun 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:29.990
 compensation in drop-down income 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.669
 heating season and so on there 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.990
 such problems are actually very 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.060
 a lot but these problems 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.610
 unites one big problem this 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.479
 problem budget budget leaky budget 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.659
 terrible budget formed but i don't 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:47.510
 know about ah some on sticks 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.400
 calculating and the biggest problem of this 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.620
 budget that there is no prospect for what 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.720
 Now this is exactly this situation. 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.699
 But I think that this is not an isolated case. 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.550
 many simply don’t know where 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.440
 handle affect this doom regional 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.240
 probably in the current composition on it can 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.870
 I said a year or two ago that 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.759
 current thought 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.070
 she too bankrupt to the ball circle 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.360
 political and pens does not perform 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.240
 main functions protect interests 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.370
 population which people are elected 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.009
 according to information obtained from the district 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.229
 Administration in 2014 boiler room 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:20.030
 settlement cells will be reconstructed with 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.949
 translation and to gas fuel 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.190
 this is done with a view to energy efficient 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:26.320
 and stable provision of thermal amir 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.570
 villagers if these plans are 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.960
 performed a heating collapse in this 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.830
 the village 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.830
 will not take place
