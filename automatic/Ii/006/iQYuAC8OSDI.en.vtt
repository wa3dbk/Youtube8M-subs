00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
fertilizers fertilizer with this this

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.469 
fertilizers fertilizer with this this
product<00:01:00.100> has<00:01:00.339> a<00:01:00.370> built<00:01:00.609> in<00:01:00.729> lime<00:01:00.999> coating

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
product has a built in lime coating

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:02.969 
product has a built in lime coating
around<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.989> seed<00:01:02.229> some<00:01:02.469> of<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:02.649> seeds<00:01:02.859> are

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
around the seed some of the seeds are

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.399 
around the seed some of the seeds are
encapsulated<00:01:03.219> in<00:01:03.729> lime<00:01:04.720> so<00:01:05.019> that<00:01:05.170> helps<00:01:05.379> with

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
encapsulated in lime so that helps with

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.530 
encapsulated in lime so that helps with
initial<00:01:05.860> termination<00:01:06.460> as<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:07.090> line<00:01:07.270> melts

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
initial termination as that line melts

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.240 
initial termination as that line melts
off<00:01:07.840> it<00:01:08.020> neutralizes<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.650> sole<00:01:08.890> that's<00:01:09.100> right

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
off it neutralizes the sole that's right

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.040 
off it neutralizes the sole that's right
there<00:01:09.430> against<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.850> seed<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.570> helps<00:01:10.840> it<00:01:10.960> get

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
there against the seed and helps it get

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.210 
there against the seed and helps it get
started<00:01:11.320> so<00:01:11.740> they<00:01:11.830> don't<00:01:11.980> think<00:01:12.130> they're

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
started so they don't think they're

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.800 
started so they don't think they're
really<00:01:12.340> going<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.640> fertilize<00:01:12.910> and<00:01:13.450> lime<00:01:13.630> just

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
really going to fertilize and lime just

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.410 
really going to fertilize and lime just
break<00:01:14.080> it<00:01:14.290> spread<00:01:15.100> this<00:01:15.250> out<00:01:15.490> break<00:01:15.880> over<00:01:16.210> it

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
break it spread this out break over it

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.180 
break it spread this out break over it
with<00:01:16.780> it<00:01:16.930> with<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.260> ideal<00:01:17.530> situation<00:01:18.160> would

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
with it with the ideal situation would

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.770 
with it with the ideal situation would
be<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.640> actually<00:01:18.730> go<00:01:19.060> in<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.360> do<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.600> little

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
be to actually go in and do a little

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.900 
be to actually go in and do a little
lining<00:01:20.200> in<00:01:20.680> these<00:01:20.860> tight<00:01:21.100> areas<00:01:21.130> like<00:01:21.610> we

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
lining in these tight areas like we

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.490 
lining in these tight areas like we
can't<00:01:22.150> get<00:01:22.300> in<00:01:22.420> with<00:01:22.840> anything<00:01:23.290> but

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
can't get in with anything but

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.490 
can't get in with anything but
pelletized<00:01:24.070> lime<00:01:24.160> so<00:01:24.940> therefore<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:26.320> does

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
pelletized lime so therefore it does

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.680 
pelletized lime so therefore it does
help<00:01:26.860> fertilize<00:01:27.670> it<00:01:28.120> if<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.300> guy<00:01:28.450> could<00:01:28.510> throw

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
help fertilize it if a guy could throw

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.660 
help fertilize it if a guy could throw
