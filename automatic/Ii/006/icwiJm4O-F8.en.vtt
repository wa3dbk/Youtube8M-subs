is<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.359> add<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> new<00:00:18.930> field<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.800> they<00:00:19.920> can

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
is to add a new field so that they can

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.429 
is to add a new field so that they can
