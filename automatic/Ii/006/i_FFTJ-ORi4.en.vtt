00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.510
 and they invoke stove wanted that commenting I 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.820
 I'm with a gameplay of move warfare 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.620
 3 You see that I'm going with the hacr with point of 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.970
 looks and expandable chargers 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.820
 silencer and good is a game a 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.320
 little curious because we started 4 for 4 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.230
 a domain like in terminal as you see 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.929
 but nothing else almost start with two of 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 Your equipment and voice is quite slow 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.089
 but that does not mean it's 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.119
 boring because I study the time looking 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.800
 your support and going for them no longer 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.689
 you will see how there are a couple of occasions 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.099
 that I'm moving around a lot 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.119
 map because I do not know exactly where 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.410
 they are born because I have the three flags 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.930
 but good 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.250
 first of all tell you that you will see that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.430
 lately the best and rising are 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.290
 with weapons that are good as a type to cr7 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.420
 and the reasons because as you know I have 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.770
 the white two if someone does not know by 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.750
 what do I have it then explain it in both 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.550
 videos yesterday and the day before yesterday and how 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.920
 you will understand I do not have in sad 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.960
 reserve and it hurts a lot or is it months of 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.059
 vélez as he said this is also that neither 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.290
 a part of the questions that 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.150
 they responded things hurt me a lot 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.070
 have both and like not having 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.570
 modern warfare gameplays 3 take out the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.580
 good record not only remove the disc 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.110
 change console and have to get 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.820
 play this game online no longer 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.460
 Tired apart, people are very mobile 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.600
 is for example because as I tell you, it is 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.100
 kind of those weapons to get me more 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.470
 Quick play as little as possible and 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.750
 dedicate myself to playing warfare will be the preserves 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.039
 sorry to check weapons and all that 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.509
 that I have left and unlearn a little 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.390
 maps to attract the guides as soon as possible 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.420
 of map maps and weapons then 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.520
 good 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.680
 can continue playing with good weapons and 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.180
 try to get the new ones quick so 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.549
 same the previous game of giving it by 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.990
 teams more fucked a lot more killed a 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.970
 very fast woman not the positive thing is with 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.439
 the same as it is now but it is 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.930
 more fucked 2 a guy who was buying 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.520
 in mission a bush and he fucked me a lot 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.200
 with the penalty sale I fall his dead is 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.220
 a little but good nothing happens and as 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.899
 you see this is the time of departure 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.060
 which they are already two and so we is a 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.620
 little stuck and good did not move rolled 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.270
 it's in the gameplay theme 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.580
 I'm going to talk to you about what was coming to 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.380
 tell you what is the special 10,000 voucher 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.380
 first before announcing the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.600
 special thank you all this 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.770
 support and your subscription and your 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.190
 visits to your videos 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.230
 comments I do not know I never thought I was going 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.630
 to reach 10,000 and less so soon 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.580
 because right now he is young 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.990
 I was jewel the not so good thing 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.220
 always the thing is really screwed 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.930
 to start on youtube not 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.220
 normally the later you start a 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.560
 little worse but it's never too late to 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.240
 start so good I started 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.250
 a very long time three years ago or four 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.890
 houses and uploading gameplays from sniper 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.570
 gameplays no more montages and then 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.400
 then also upload gameplays sometimes from 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.200
 with music not although they are all mud 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.940
 channel by copyright case is 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.380
 has skipped the copyright and such because 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.730
 then you get a foul and you have 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.140
 problems with your account then good 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.350
 I deleted everything just in case before 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.690
 make him 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.920
 this book I had with fine and all and as 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.050
 sting and more so good is everything 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.150
 erased but good the first one in 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.160
 comment you already have it in the channel and 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.600
 Well, I did it because he suggested a 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.430
 my friend does not subscribe to it a friend of mine 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.160
 and several besides that they also told me 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.750
 that you can try it and not me 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.910
 It's good to comment but little by little and with 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.160
 practice you are learning to do the 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.680
 things like everything is never born 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.150
 learned and you have to put is to do the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.760
 things to come out then good 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.520
 I think I really like doing it 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.470
 and that's why I bring you gameplays is not 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.430
 every day because I like to do it and 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.810
 aside then 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.280
 I think you like it too 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.690
 so I also encourages more 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.480
 upload gameplays then good too 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.600
 thank you again and tell you that the 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.520
 special 10,000 as you know is going to be a 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.280
 compilation of one thousand 100 first fashions 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.260
 in the channel I have more I have 102 103 in 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.269
 hotels but with this one 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.860
 and then some qualities an assembly 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.329
 quite curious I do not know when it will be 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.980
 ready surely for when I'm 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.260
 He talks short but nothing happens because I 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.629
 I think it will not affect much the 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.769
 subject of being white because it is a 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.030
 very good assembly is still not 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.069
 edited or anything but good both the 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.599
 made clips and everything so do not you 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.280
 you worry about it, I'll upload it when 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.230
 can and I'm going to announce to you what 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.610
 I plan to upload these days, not as 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.170
 are a few days a little strange because in 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.909
 tomorrow I have to upload an imply 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.680
 competitive to make a valuation 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.629
 general competitive occasion for me 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.609
 for my team this year and for what it's going 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.440
 to be or what we intend to be 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.049
 or my opinion about what the 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.519
 two targets both competitive weapons and 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.500
 all that is not how it will work and what 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.470
 we have thought we do and then 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.359
 well tomorrow or tomorrow for forgiveness 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.070
 so upload some imply of live be of 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.579
 Bounce targets bounce some of that 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.019
 then on Sunday I plan to go up 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.970
 slam or make whites so you can see how 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.090
 will be michèle employees two and by 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.440
 last on monday i have think is convenient 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.180
 one equal each in its channel with its 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.850
 gameplay you're talking about on every channel 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.930
 on various subjects but good and 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.419
 you will see the topics that we will deal with 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.460
 and, as you can see, this implies 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.770
 that is quite finished already or is 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.360
 a streak of love just because then 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.770
 the game is a bit disgusting 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.560
 volumes of the game and it is more than 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.110
 same and happened with love it's already worth it so 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.970
 well again thank everyone 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.289
 I already tell you that is more or less that I have 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.520
 plan in these days then on Tuesday then 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.680
 of course to upload the first live 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.090
 the complete one that makes the first game 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.349
 and a light of zombies that I'm going to record 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.900
 in this afternoon or tomorrow surely so 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.490
