00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello to you, aero news is broadcasting 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.540
 Today you will learn how to accelerate 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.790
 the work of android smartphone this video will be 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.620
 divided into two parts for teapots and 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.670
 for advanced users who already have 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.000
 have root rights 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.039
 let's start with first hi kids or those 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.580
 who needs laziness of captions just to 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.680
 faster 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.650
 accelerate the smartphone, you can work with 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.410
 using three things first use 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.119
 third-party launcher is the best new he 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.099
 convenient fast have big 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.440
 tools for customization that is 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.040
 settings for yourself download it in 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.100
 google play click on the home button and 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.010
 choose but by default now we go 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.370
 in the launcher settings change it under 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.500
 myself 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.810
 for this we have a working item 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.030
 table of applications menu dock bar folders 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.610
 Your gestures ok google button 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.910
 counters new applications and the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.940
 like that is the choice is very wide but 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.120
 we are interested in registration here 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.810
 set the scroll speed to 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.590
 value is faster than the speed of light and 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.640
 animation speed 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.640
 destination is faster than the speed of light now 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.590
 when opening any folder or menu 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.290
 applications we will not be displayed 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.310
 animation that will reduce the load on 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.310
 graphics processor 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.440
 second point and 3 only relevant for 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.910
 weak devices that even when 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.909
 normal use palpable 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.460
 undermining the second item will be 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.590
 disable system animation for this 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.050
 open settings select section o 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.360
 phone and find here the item number 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.600
 build bye go for it several times 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.270
 until you see the inscription do not need you already 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.280
 the developer goes back to the menu and 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.250
 we see that a menu has opened for us 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.030
 developers 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.600
 find items in it 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.210
 window scale transition scale and speed 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.200
 animations set all values ​​to 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.200
 disable animation 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.550
 now when you open the application you do not 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.070
 you will see a beautiful effect but 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.960
 decrease the load on the graphic 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.970
 CPU 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.970
 let's check on let's say salt texture 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.010
 third in the same paragraph for developers 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.180
 set limits on background 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.950
 processes for this we return to the point 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.280
 Scroll through the bottom and see the limit background 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.590
 processes we put restrictions on no more 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.110
 four processes can of course be less 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.630
 but then if you're using a browser 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.670
 come for example in eco when returning 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.940
 back all tabs will load 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.540
 again it was the three most simple 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.450
 way to speed up the device 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.300
 now move on to a deeper blog 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.880
 optimization experienced users can 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.600
 waking up now is interesting but before 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.640
 beginning attention author video site 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.130
 developer bear no 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.360
 liability for damage 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.970
 resulting from the subsequent 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.340
 action on your device is all you 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.330
 do with a smartphone you do on your 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.549
 fear and risk 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.090
 so make sure you really 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.910
 need it if you are so fearless 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.070
 then we continue if you have root 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.269
 right then three of these are open to you 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.489
 programs and the first is green farm what is it 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.680
 I will explain with an example if for example you 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.690
 set yourself a wedge master program and 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.430
 cleared her RAM 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.530
 deep processes soon again 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.340
 start and you will have everything again 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.530
 redo 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.690
 agrin and fay completely put to sleep 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.140
 application it means that the process is not 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.700
 will run until you contact him 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.700
 using this application is very simple 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.370
 after launch click on the plus sign and see 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.260
 aha the background works for us 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.470
 for example the walkman application 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.420
 I don't need her, I select it 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.810
 the tick is the same for me 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:12.290
 item will be us open and after 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.799
 screen off and at the application point 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.380
 walkman 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.489
 I do not want to wait for the screen to turn off and I 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.190
 just click 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.019
 I do not put all the key on the z key 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.910
 now until I turn to him 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.210
 it will not turn on and work in 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.940
 background second program is 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.400
 with demoyan usually users are pretty 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.430
 often install and remove various 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.169
 applications to clean 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.870
 trash left by them or system cache 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.569
 you can use this program just 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:46.780
 go into it and click update 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:49.909
 garbage and the system can still database 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.539
 further from the program will handle all that u 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.630
 she is 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:56.720
 will find all the trash and you can click 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.780
 remove this long enough process he 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.229
 takes more than a minute so i will leave 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.150
 I think you will understand and last 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:08.000
 program which i would like to tell 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.300
 this is a setcpu program with which 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.819
 can adjust the frequency of the processor 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.590
 slowing it down for slower work 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:18.349
 but more careful 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.150
 battery or for faster 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.099
 work time which respectively 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.729
 battery runs out faster 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:27.620
 for this there are these two meanings 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:31.280
 maximum and minimum 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.460
 what do they do max value you 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.320
 expose the maximum speed 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.469
 CPU i.e. maximum clock 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.409
 the maximum frequency that you 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:44.389
 can you put it will be the maximum 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.180
 limiting your processor to me 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:51.219
 since i have a snapdragon s4 processor 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:54.080
 pro is one and a half gigahertz if you want 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:56.900
 make your smartphone work 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.630
 slightly slower but show showed 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.300
 big indicators on autonomy then 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:06.530
 reduce this figure to 1 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.409
 and 2 and hertz then your smartphone will be 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:12.770
 take care of the battery to 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:15.469
 do you want if you want a smartphone 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.710
 worked faster then you bet 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:20.340
 the minimum parade parameter on let's say 1 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.169
 gigahertz 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:27.870
 and then your smartphone will work 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:29.540
 faster but you will be wrong 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.290
 careful use of resources 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.139
 the battery will be discharged 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.570
 much faster as well the problem will be 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.040
 strong heating of the device so i don't 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:43.620
 I recommend doing this on a permanent basis. 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:45.180
 basis for you to be 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.090
 more comfortable to use this application 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.740
 there are profiles we can click on 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:54.060
 plus and choose enable profile when 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.400
 choose some resource capacious 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.460
 the application in my case is not enough 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.910
 so I will choose the first one 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.669
 For example, chess will imagine such 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:08.280
 I have a weak smartphone situation and I have 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:13.080
 quiver even chess i press 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:15.780
 next and select the threshold is valid at 700 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.010
 megahertz and now when working with 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.039
 chess application 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:22.919
 my processor will work on 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:26.430
 frequencies from 702 megahertz to one and a half 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:27.840
 gigahertz that will speed up his work but again 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.300
 the battery will be 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.889
 discharge faster everything is possible 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.690
 adjust settings for others 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:37.710
 applications are valid when you listen 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:39.810
 you don't need music too high 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.690
 work processors you can install 

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.960
 clock frequency up to 1 gigahertz and from 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:47.729
 do not lose their performance 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.560
 In this video I described all known to me 

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:51.690
 ways to speed up smartphones 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.280
 I hope it was interesting for you 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:59.160
 vocal chords reef tregubov 

00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:01.200
 Good luck to everyone, and I’m thinking how 

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.020
 it would be cool if such a good person 

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:08.660
 how would you like and subscribe to 

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.660
 my channel is just a dream
