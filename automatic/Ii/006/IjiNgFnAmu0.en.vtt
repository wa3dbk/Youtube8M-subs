metal<00:02:11.980> force<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:13.450> that's<00:02:13.870> even<00:02:14.350> weird<00:02:14.920> but

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
metal force and that's even weird but

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.479 
metal force and that's even weird but
what's<00:02:16.209> really<00:02:16.840> really<00:02:17.230> weird<00:02:17.709> is<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.010> I

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
what's really really weird is that I

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.850 
what's really really weird is that I
really<00:02:19.150> like<00:02:19.450> these<00:02:19.690> figures<00:02:20.170> they're<00:02:20.530> so

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
really like these figures they're so

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.120 
really like these figures they're so
different<00:02:21.340> they're<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.530> imaginative<00:02:23.530> they're

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
different they're so imaginative they're

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.310 
different they're so imaginative they're
so<00:02:24.370> weird<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.299> I<00:02:25.390> love<00:02:26.260> them<00:02:26.560> for<00:02:26.590> that

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
so weird and I love them for that

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.740 
so weird and I love them for that
honestly<00:02:29.320> these<00:02:30.010> would<00:02:30.220> look<00:02:30.370> really<00:02:31.150> cool<00:02:31.540> on

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
honestly these would look really cool on

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.319 
honestly these would look really cool on
my<00:02:31.780> shelf<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:32.470> that's<00:02:32.680> kind<00:02:32.920> of<00:02:33.010> occupied<00:02:33.549> at

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
my shelf but that's kind of occupied at

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.620 
my shelf but that's kind of occupied at
the<00:02:34.390> moment<00:02:34.630> by<00:02:35.200> sonic<00:02:36.180> pac-man<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.420> some

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
the moment by sonic pac-man and some

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.350 
the moment by sonic pac-man and some
tom-toms<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.799> line<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.430> kind<00:02:39.579> of<00:02:39.730> hated<00:02:40.090> upon

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
tom-toms this line is kind of hated upon

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.569 
tom-toms this line is kind of hated upon
think<00:02:40.570> it's<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:41.019> weird<00:02:41.500> but<00:02:41.920> really<00:02:42.370> if<00:02:42.459> you

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
think it's so weird but really if you

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.060 
think it's so weird but really if you
find<00:02:42.940> these<00:02:43.090> guys<00:02:43.150> on<00:02:43.510> eBay<00:02:43.989> for<00:02:44.230> something

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
find these guys on eBay for something

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.479 
find these guys on eBay for something
less<00:02:45.340> than<00:02:45.370> like<00:02:45.750> $40<00:02:46.750> go<00:02:47.530> for<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.160> these<00:02:48.370> are

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
less than like $40 go for it these are

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.060 
less than like $40 go for it these are
actually<00:02:48.970> really<00:02:49.709> interesting<00:02:50.709> figures

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
actually really interesting figures

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.740 
actually really interesting figures
that's<00:02:51.549> something<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.269> doesn't<00:02:52.570> make<00:02:52.690> sense

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
that's something that doesn't make sense

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.199 
that's something that doesn't make sense
obviously<00:02:53.320> toy<00:02:53.860> island<00:02:54.280> figures<00:02:54.700> are<00:02:54.880> kind<00:02:55.120> of

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
obviously toy island figures are kind of

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.990 
obviously toy island figures are kind of
expensive<00:02:55.720> now<00:02:55.959> but<00:02:56.650> these<00:02:56.920> guys<00:02:57.250> are<00:02:57.519> really

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
expensive now but these guys are really

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.569 
expensive now but these guys are really
hard<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:58.359> come<00:02:58.540> across<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:59.170> they're<00:02:59.950> really

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
hard to come across and they're really

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.900 
hard to come across and they're really
expensive<00:03:01.000> most<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.660> time<00:03:01.840> even<00:03:02.340> tiles<00:03:03.340> he

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
expensive most of the time even tiles he

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.569 
expensive most of the time even tiles he
breaks<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.299> lot<00:03:04.480> so<00:03:05.230> that's<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.769> really<00:03:06.040> quick

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
breaks a lot so that's a really quick

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.400 
breaks a lot so that's a really quick
