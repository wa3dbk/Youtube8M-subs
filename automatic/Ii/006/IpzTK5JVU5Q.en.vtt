 very rich vegetation since 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.490
 here is a peculiar 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.580
 the microclimate therefore grow here very 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.440
 many tropical plants and cypresses and 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.580

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.800
 my lisa 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:16.180
 because of one of the bars there and in my

 mini golf can be seen 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:26.630
