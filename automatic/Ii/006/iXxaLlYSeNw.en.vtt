 Thank you, sir, for the area that is 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:05.280
 I ended up adopting a tactic that 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.770
 year of trying to get right tries 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.140
 arrive slowly at the peak 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.880
 respecting everyone and thank god 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.350
 That tactic worked, I got two 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.270
 good waves 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.570

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.670

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.710
 This one you're coming to like me, I like this time. 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.030
 It's my fourth season so 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.370

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.170

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.900
 adds grandson is learning 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.860
 learning by learning and now 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:53.010
 finer work and how 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.720
 was on the 71st of that day was Saturday 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.030
 so ended the championship in which 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.750
 it was decreed the end of the day of competition 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.810
 huh 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.580
 because of the ivory conditions it was 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.770
 difficult to see a lot series 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.600
 big and made everything white and the guys 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.060
 the team found it better not to put the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.849
 athletes in the water do not start where stretch 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.370
 Right after you 've finished you're already signed in. 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.200
 I ask the spleen and I stayed 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.989
 knowing that when you put the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.640
 hot site was all very complimenting 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.650
 especially in my Brazil, how come 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.860

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.540
 praises to the i &amp; d of avaianos face and with a 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.090
 of weight 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.709
 the apple was outdone that day was a day 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.000
 That I got better for myself, it's super. 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:39.329
 tired destroyed and the capital at home 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.629
 lying in bed and then Bruno called me there 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.590
 It will give you a 20 minute break to come 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.450
 here 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.720
 The stop is too big, it kills the way. 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.220
 How do I say ready 25 in total in 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.859

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.299
 then I came here today is a poor family 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.269
 You will not even be looking at the 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.370
 terminal time was in that I entered as soon as I 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.030
 I sat outside the giant killer series 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.280

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.430

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.379

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.569
 inside a jeep he released me 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.090
 I was on the wave, it's going very well. 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.220
 James Brown passed the tube door with 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.569
 hand up high and now when he went 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.879

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.280
 also then was the super way image 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.200

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.810

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.680
 the world's best and now it received 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.489
 His praise for me is the best thing about 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.599
 world 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:46.139
 show ii where I beat the rock is from the village 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.209

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:51.959
 to see there from saquarema has heavy waves 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.010
 have large waves and 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.569
 powder 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.010
 The village gives me a very 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.690
 large in tubes 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.970
 so much so that I have a photo similar to 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.040
 she is not pretty here, but with the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.479
 mothers is also missing on the beach . 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.090
 this year's village and put it 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:11.459
 experience account 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.669
 And how is this new moment? 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.459
 of your career is expensive with these two 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:20.849
 performances here you gave an interview there for 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:24.900
 Wow, whats the point? 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:27.110
 tvs there website like as soffin laine 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.400
 making you the highlight of the season 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.229
 How is this the moment that you 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.479
 are you thinking you are without sponsorship 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.060
 also what is going through your head 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.419
 I think the question of me being without 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.920
 sponsorship is affecting somewhat 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.170
 but it is not 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.940
 but this is an issue that I am taking 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:52.200
 enough and to seek sponsorship 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.720
 to help it 's a matter of putting 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.880
 appearing very much this is fruit of the 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.260
 work that I presented walking thanks to 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.510
 God is doing everything right and for not having 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.430
 what to say is to appear on the sport globe 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:12.510
 tv on sbt on everything it's site pon 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.920
 For me, it's all glory and piss. 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:20.000
 super happy do not have to talk 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.290
 Hey, man, you can talk to me. 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.170
 that guy who's watching us here 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.140
 dreams or daddy pipe line that says 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.810
 You can give it to him. 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:35.940
 so are three words no respect 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.620
 attitude and courage because you get into 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.370
 peace you have to respect the places that 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:45.000
 are people who were born here and could 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:48.060
 the waves are theirs in the face and attitude 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.610
 because to get you into the giant wave 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.590
 certain attitude but you ball from above and 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.690
 Courage because you're in there right? 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.370
 because you can win a local sporre 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:02.280
 sunbathe on the head get hurt in the reef 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.180
 mask will plan a wave from another 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.120
 level 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.980

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.880

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.070

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.200
 beaches and squares failed even talking about 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:26.040

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.830

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.110

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:45.120

 Like, you want to catch a wave? 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.240
 People have to respect their moment. 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:54.410
 and they respect us like that day 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.410
 already had a very good wave 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.760
 I want my turn but it's okay but 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.890

 but it's quiet and it came out of - where it comes 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.500
 at all times it is better to keep the 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.380
 clean the anger that the brand 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.900
