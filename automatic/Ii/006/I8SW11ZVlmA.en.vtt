00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 like jumper 15 or 25 I think they were down 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.850
 in which you already know is similar to the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:15.430
 career and those things 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:17.699
 We are on the golf course but it has 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.699
 gone well 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:34.390
 and I stay inside the lake under everything 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.750
 the world knows if I think guilt something I say if 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.750
 you want 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.540
 my mother the point is important in 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.640
 these cases to see here but but 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.000
 but but because it's so weird this 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.000
 career 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:04.680
 and we go to eighths 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.860
 and walk 3 I'm missing because it happened to you 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.440
 here 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.440
 but if I need it, I need to 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.310
 because of that I'm going to see to see to see 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.310
 see to see how that is done 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.080
 I had not loaded this come but what an end 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.000
 of career uncle I had not loaded this 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.000
 I had missed a piece of slope 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.200
 but I have fallen for lack of 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.140
 texture you know daring voucher worth voucher 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.380
 I think I get it how you get into that 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:56.259
 my mother's zone my mother not if I'm not going to 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:59.289
 enter concentrates uncle look uncle I take 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.289
 dt a 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.940
 what a rat you are going down 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.370
 and also tried 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.240
 I also tried 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:22.220
 I always have something like that 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.450
 more something like that always some you keep 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.450
 there in half so there I go kid 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.650
 I accept something super weird I do not know I do not know to see 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.650
 sometimes no no no no no no 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.500
 we are looking good 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.500
 let's go let's go 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.040
 I lost the connection seriously 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:57.450
 my mother, the god inside, we are there 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.400
 well at least at least you know the highs 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.440
 Well, nothing will I put where 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.490
 quote 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.490
 so you're going to abandon me 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.430
 do not leave me there goes me what the 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.430
 textures 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.319
 the theme of textures does not cool anything 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.240
 because I have twice with the 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.660
 It costs half to make 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.960
 this seventh but he spent what 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.280
 same as me 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.280
 if they do not run out of money 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:37.630
 - It 's stained to me, it did not come 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.630
 I have not arrived 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.840
 I can not but not to the game 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.470
 moan I can not rejoin you to the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.470
 true departure 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.140
 because those things should be able to be the 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.140
 true yes, but it is a bitch 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.300
 now there is 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.970
 and to the perfect point or point caught 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.420
 stop good try this does not cool me cool 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.680
 and it's going very well before I do not know if it's 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.170
 that this is left without textures again 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.170
 or that it has already happened 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.259
 what a bad day 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.110
 because he is stronger than me 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.800
 animals well well well well recovering 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.509
 positions 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.979
 here it gives me that it has cost in brief 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.979
 but it has not loaded me at all 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:42.999
 the turow I think I think it's the turn 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.999
 to return 

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:48.049
 true 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.670
 rafa very much for my taste for me 

00:04:48.049 --> 00:04:54.030
 I do not like it 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:57.330
 said I'm playing tennis with michael 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:03.990
 you know but throwing me with x square 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:06.570
 ay round square god retreats from 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.470
 here assaulting iva they just 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.300
 advance 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.300
 here are people still jumping you know 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.260
 there is no going 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.010
 I got caught I had put fourth 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.010
 of a moment you know 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:28.620
 Come on let's go run Let's go ninth 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:37.080
 eighth without moving forward I put 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:39.320
 I think the tree a tree against a 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.320
 tree 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.780
 the only thing that the tree can not doubt 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:48.870
 tenth 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.870
 the ninth come, come, come, come 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.199
 so now if every finest lotina 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.790
 off the track of the tennis court 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.480
 but the brightness to the point e waved that 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.249
 catch the point 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.959
 it's the perfect fifth 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:15.440
 I hope the slopes do not hurt anymore 

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:17.060
 those that do not appear 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.310
 to see this cost that has brought me 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.260
 before 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.970
 and ended up trolling the one in front I just 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.970
 to see and he's going to bring me 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.000
 it stayed there without reappearing you know 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.090
 to see to see people are this afternoon 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.530
 background we liked 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.530
 it's the good troll knows 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.240
 we are not to complicate and we are going to go to 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.240
 match 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.970
 villa pointed villa pointed to yes sir 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.210
 perfect let's reappear let's go let's go 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.210
 we go 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.400
 quito 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.410
 fifth fifth I'm going 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.970
 I'm going to 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.529
 see it now come come fourth quarter 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.059
 fourth quarter fourth quarter 

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:06.510
 we are recovering positions we are going 

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:08.250
 recovering positions 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.510
 in this rank degrees I have been able to play 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.510
 here is the easy game 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:18.190
 let's go ahead, just ahead of me 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:21.840
 final advances me right at the end not what 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:23.800
 quito quito removes because fifth 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.600
 I think that the wrong one I think it takes 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.070
 I think I'm going to win, I do not win 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.040
 I do not win 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:37.570
 fourth quito no 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:39.790
 or if you do not get ahead right at the end I think 

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.130
 that the point of the goal 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.170
 to see and see, let's see, let's go 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.180
 see it deepen the classification as 

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.430
 does it show the marker I have been 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:51.190
 good room 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.690
 perfect and there are people still going to say 

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:55.410
 in the first round, but not almost 

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.410
 tiny 

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.510
 Y 

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.010
 and
