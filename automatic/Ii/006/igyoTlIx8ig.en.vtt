00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
excited tease I'm going to start off

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.350 
excited tease I'm going to start off
with<00:00:31.989> a<00:00:32.230> superset<00:00:32.739> the<00:00:33.610> reason<00:00:33.880> I<00:00:33.940> starts<00:00:34.270> off

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
with a superset the reason I starts off

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.750 
with a superset the reason I starts off
with<00:00:34.480> a<00:00:34.570> superset<00:00:35.079> is<00:00:35.290> because<00:00:35.980> it<00:00:36.309> hits<00:00:36.519> the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
with a superset is because it hits the

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.930 
with a superset is because it hits the
muscle<00:00:37.120> really<00:00:37.539> nice<00:00:38.019> and<00:00:38.289> hard<00:00:38.530> also<00:00:39.399> if<00:00:39.760> the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
muscle really nice and hard also if the

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.150

tease<00:00:40.180> it<00:00:40.420> a<00:00:40.600> lot<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:41.079> capable<00:00:41.379> start<00:00:41.710> off<00:00:41.949> and

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
tease it a lot of capable start off and

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.979 
tease it a lot of capable start off and
doing<00:00:42.309> chat<00:00:42.550> with<00:00:42.910> really<00:00:43.480> having<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:43.809> bench

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
press well I've been training for quite

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.790 
press well I've been training for quite
some<00:00:45.879> time<00:00:45.910> the<00:00:46.539> last<00:00:46.780> thing<00:00:46.929> I<00:00:47.079> need<00:00:47.350> to<00:00:47.379> do<00:00:47.559> is

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
some time the last thing I need to do is

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.009 
some time the last thing I need to do is
get<00:00:47.980> injured<00:00:48.399> so<00:00:48.760> I<00:00:48.789> like<00:00:49.030> to<00:00:49.149> put<00:00:49.300> a<00:00:49.480> parcel

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
get injured so I like to put a parcel

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.500 
get injured so I like to put a parcel
first<00:00:50.320> so<00:00:51.039> they<00:00:51.250> have<00:00:51.370> 1<00:00:51.550> i'll<00:00:51.670> use<00:00:52.179> less

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
first so they have 1 i'll use less

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.410 
first so they have 1 i'll use less
weight<00:00:52.870> where<00:00:53.410> they've<00:00:53.530> come<00:00:53.679> to<00:00:53.800> the<00:00:53.890> heavy

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
weight where they've come to the heavy

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.579 
weight where they've come to the heavy
powerlifting<00:00:55.420> failures<00:00:55.960> of<00:00:56.019> the<00:00:56.199> routine

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
powerlifting failures of the routine

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.250 
powerlifting failures of the routine
therefore<00:00:57.460> I'm<00:00:57.730> less<00:00:58.239> likely<00:00:58.269> to<00:00:58.929> injure

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
therefore I'm less likely to injure

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.680 
therefore I'm less likely to injure
yourself<00:00:59.379> so<00:00:59.980> first<00:01:00.760> superset<00:01:01.329> man<00:01:01.539> we're

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
yourself so first superset man we're

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.500 
yourself so first superset man we're
going<00:01:01.780> to<00:01:01.839> start<00:01:02.109> off<00:01:02.350> with<00:01:02.409> an<00:01:03.370> incline<00:01:03.999> then

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
going to start off with an incline then

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.290 
going to start off with an incline then
chest<00:01:05.050> press<00:01:05.340> and<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.430> reason<00:01:06.580> I<00:01:06.760> do<00:01:06.880> this<00:01:06.909> is

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
chest press and the reason I do this is

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.390 
chest press and the reason I do this is
because<00:01:07.840> it's<00:01:08.500> still<00:01:08.770> quite<00:01:09.070> a<00:01:09.100> powerful

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
because it's still quite a powerful

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.600 
because it's still quite a powerful
movement<00:01:09.880> but<00:01:10.660> it<00:01:11.350> just<00:01:11.590> gets<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:12.040> right<00:01:12.070> into

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
movement but it just gets you right into

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.210 
movement but it just gets you right into
it<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.000> then<00:01:13.120> you<00:01:13.210> can<00:01:13.360> attach<00:01:13.690> a<00:01:14.080> nice<00:01:14.830> easy

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
it and then you can attach a nice easy

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.860 
it and then you can attach a nice easy

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
down breathe it in the ad hoc phase

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.280 
down breathe it in the ad hoc phase
breathing<00:01:58.840> in<00:01:59.760> that<00:02:00.760> out<00:02:01.060> on<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.690> power<00:02:01.930> fades

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
breathing in that out on the power fades

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.600 
breathing in that out on the power fades
so<00:02:02.770> bring<00:02:03.010> me<00:02:03.040> on<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.430> negative<00:02:05.310> haven't<00:02:06.310> on

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
so bring me on the negative haven't on

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.660 
so bring me on the negative haven't on
the<00:02:06.700> power<00:02:06.880> phase<00:02:07.180> one<00:02:07.930> more<00:02:08.170> oh<00:02:10.650> and<00:02:11.650> then<00:02:12.129> put

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
the power phase one more oh and then put

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.150 
the power phase one more oh and then put
it<00:02:12.760> down<00:02:13.650> you've<00:02:14.650> got<00:02:14.800> you

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
it down you've got you

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.420 
it down you've got you
you<00:02:17.160> always<00:02:17.580> ready<00:02:18.030> straightaway<00:02:19.040> trait<00:02:20.040> into

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
you always ready straightaway trait into

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.700 
you always ready straightaway trait into
it<00:02:21.200> flies<00:02:22.200> again<00:02:23.300> nice<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.600> wide<00:02:24.750> don't<00:02:25.320> bend

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
it flies again nice and wide don't bend

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.680 
it flies again nice and wide don't bend
and<00:02:26.160> press<00:02:26.720> take<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.870> wide<00:02:28.520> why<00:02:29.520> feel<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.450> and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
and press take it wide why feel it and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.560 
and press take it wide why feel it and
power<00:02:31.410> up<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.550> breathe<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:34.580> I'm<00:02:35.580> power<00:02:36.360> out

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
power up so breathe in I'm power out

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:44.900 
power up so breathe in I'm power out
hope<00:02:37.050> our<00:02:37.320> breathing<00:02:43.460> then<00:02:44.460> you<00:02:44.580> can<00:02:44.700> show<00:02:44.820> you

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
hope our breathing then you can show you

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.440 
hope our breathing then you can show you
feel<00:02:45.180> real<00:02:45.630> expanse<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.680> rib<00:02:46.860> cage<00:02:47.450> take

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
feel real expanse of that rib cage take

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:58.670 
feel real expanse of that rib cage take
it<00:02:48.600> down<00:02:49.910> or<00:02:50.910> more<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.810> then<00:02:55.650> up<00:02:56.040> so<00:02:57.500> we<00:02:58.500> let

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
it down or more and then up so we let

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.290 
it down or more and then up so we let
the<00:02:58.800> upper<00:02:58.980> back<00:02:59.160> with<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.430> nice<00:02:59.700> powerful

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
the upper back with a nice powerful

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.810 
the upper back with a nice powerful
movement<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.380> then<00:03:01.470> we<00:03:01.560> let<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.860> size<00:03:02.250> more

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
movement and then we let the size more

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.270 
movement and then we let the size more
the<00:03:02.970> shaping<00:03:03.270> movement<00:03:03.990> we<00:03:04.470> can<00:03:04.680> really<00:03:04.980> think

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
the shaping movement we can really think

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.490 
the shaping movement we can really think
because<00:03:05.520> you<00:03:05.610> want<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:06.000> pectoral<00:03:06.390> muscle<00:03:07.110> to

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
because you want that pectoral muscle to

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.680 
because you want that pectoral muscle to
be<00:03:07.620> really<00:03:07.950> nice<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.310> firm<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.820> as<00:03:09.450> some

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
be really nice and firm and as some

be really nice and firm and as some
definite<00:03:10.110> shape<00:03:10.320> to<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:11.090> then<00:03:12.090> what<00:03:12.270> we're

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
definite shape to it then what we're

the<00:04:33.200> 5210<00:04:34.040> and<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:35.030> 264<00:04:35.870> you<00:04:36.530> should<00:04:36.770> have

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
the 5210 and a 264 you should have

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.850 
the 5210 and a 264 you should have
absolute<00:04:37.130> failure<00:04:37.880> at<00:04:38.270> last<00:04:38.660> set<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.230> you

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
absolute failure at last set and you

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.810 
absolute failure at last set and you
wait<00:04:40.190> will<00:04:40.910> dictate<00:04:41.150> that<00:04:41.690> so<00:04:42.610> every<00:04:43.610> time<00:04:43.640> you

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
wait will dictate that so every time you

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.640 
wait will dictate that so every time you
go<00:04:44.030> into<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.300> gym<00:04:44.510> right<00:04:44.990> what<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.440> weight

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
go into the gym right what the weight

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.490 
go into the gym right what the weight
was<00:04:45.950> down<00:04:46.340> so<00:04:46.940> therefore<00:04:47.150> you<00:04:47.810> don't<00:04:48.020> forget

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
was down so therefore you don't forget

back walks are really hits the triceps

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.670 
back walks are really hits the triceps
which<00:05:16.970> are<00:05:17.150> moving<00:05:17.630> anyways<00:05:17.990> I'm<00:05:18.200> literally

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
which are moving anyways I'm literally

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.700 
which are moving anyways I'm literally
if<00:05:19.220> I'm<00:05:19.370> need<00:05:19.490> a<00:05:19.520> tricep<00:05:20.120> exercise<00:05:20.810> in<00:05:21.500> the

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
if I'm need a tricep exercise in the

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.740 
if I'm need a tricep exercise in the
week<00:05:21.890> I'm<00:05:22.100> going<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.340> double<00:05:22.550> try<00:05:23.479> some

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
week I'm going to double try some

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.060 
week I'm going to double try some
exercise<00:05:24.110> because<00:05:24.350> it's<00:05:24.500> a<00:05:24.590> smaller<00:05:24.710> muscle

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
exercise because it's a smaller muscle

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.590 
exercise because it's a smaller muscle
group<00:05:25.430> you're<00:05:26.090> probably<00:05:26.270> cook<00:05:26.890> faster<00:05:28.479> and<00:05:29.479> if

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
group you're probably cook faster and if

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.390 
group you're probably cook faster and if
so<00:05:29.810> sick<00:05:30.020> if<00:05:30.110> you<00:05:30.200> really<00:05:30.650> live<00:05:30.800> in<00:05:30.950> heavy<00:05:31.160> will

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
so sick if you really live in heavy will

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.930 
so sick if you really live in heavy will
find<00:05:31.700> that<00:05:32.539> your<00:05:32.660> triceps<00:05:33.350> fatigue<00:05:34.280> so

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
find that your triceps fatigue so

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.850 
find that your triceps fatigue so
therefore<00:05:35.180> all<00:05:35.840> you<00:05:36.050> do<00:05:36.289> we<00:05:36.410> just<00:05:36.590> got<00:05:36.770> the

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
therefore all you do we just got the

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:43.260 
therefore all you do we just got the
tricep<00:05:37.280> movement<00:05:37.669> or<00:05:38.229> just<00:05:39.229> finish<00:05:39.530> off<00:05:39.680> or

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.480 

before<00:05:44.270> I<00:05:44.300> bus<00:05:44.600> member<00:05:44.990> nice<00:05:45.590> and<00:05:45.979> deep<00:05:46.190> in

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
before I bus member nice and deep in

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:54.490 
before I bus member nice and deep in
control<00:05:47.120> and<00:05:47.419> power<00:05:48.380> up<00:05:49.840> so<00:05:51.039> John<00:05:53.500> superset

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
control and power up so John superset

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.340 
control and power up so John superset
start<00:05:54.860> off<00:05:55.100> with<00:05:55.310> with<00:05:56.240> incline<00:05:56.960> press

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
start off with with incline press

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
start off with with incline press
followed<00:05:58.280> by<00:05:58.460> inclined<00:05:59.300> flies<00:05:59.770> now<00:06:00.770> you<00:06:01.250> can

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
followed by inclined flies now you can

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.180 
followed by inclined flies now you can
swap<00:06:01.640> out<00:06:01.789> over<00:06:01.970> and<00:06:02.479> do<00:06:02.930> incline<00:06:03.590> crash<00:06:03.860> first

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
swap out over and do incline crash first

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.350 
swap out over and do incline crash first
and<00:06:04.610> then<00:06:05.000> do<00:06:05.150> you<00:06:05.180> flies<00:06:05.600> with<00:06:06.560> you

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
and then do you flies with you

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.779 
and then do you flies with you
dress<00:06:07.840> with<00:06:08.650> ended<00:06:09.009> by<00:06:09.129> Express<00:06:09.460> which<00:06:09.669> have

dress with ended by Express which have

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:11.580 
dress with ended by Express which have
just<00:06:10.000> said<00:06:10.210> you<00:06:10.330> can<00:06:10.449> substitute<00:06:10.629> as<00:06:11.530> a

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
just said you can substitute as a

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.219 
just said you can substitute as a
superset<00:06:12.340> the<00:06:12.909> next<00:06:13.180> time<00:06:13.330> you<00:06:13.479> do<00:06:13.599> so<00:06:14.139> you

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
superset the next time you do so you

it to the gym do so if you can take it

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:43.379 
it to the gym do so if you can take it
within<00:06:40.810> 40<00:06:41.500> minutes<00:06:41.710> of<00:06:41.889> training<00:06:42.389> absolute
