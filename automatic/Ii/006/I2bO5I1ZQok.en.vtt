 new video and now you finally see 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.189

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.849
 I have such a little new one here 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.740
 TV 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.050
 it just runs here the pc 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.830
 test system how easy now 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.740
 can recognize 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.290
 and yes this is a 65 inch tv if you are 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.520
 then want to have more data then 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.960
 I'll just grab you the Amazon 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.730
 link in the description if it is the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.930
 otherwise somehow gives the others 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.719
 data or something is for a samsung 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:48.469
 hub 8290 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:50.989
 a very nice hdtv why uhd that 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.820
 I once field in a separate 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.750
 Video times explain whether clock hd already 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.449
 worth it or not 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.910
 jo here from the side with me 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.550
 get on the sofa then you see the 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.559
 sometimes you can see that very well the 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.670
 that is in there that is already one 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.410
 curved tv her pulling it sad 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.830
 but not much offered so I thought 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.540
 in the old days it is really who he is 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.960
 once the back looks very bad 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.370
 out pretty chic is actually but 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.790
 Not much weight when watching TV 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.810
 You do not notice this bend at all 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.400
 but the picture really just looks 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.440
 somehow better with every pixel 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.050
 right next to my eye, I say 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.700
 now times so the first time to a 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.470
 nice stand here I have that 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.110
 ever posted on facebook exactly 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.570
 this picture here where you see the hd 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.060
 Yes, that's why we should be today too 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.040
 do not go because it's times today 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.990
 to this small test system here only for 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.370
 info i have is now selling this 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.710
 means you do not need to be yourselves anymore 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.510
 there are still some more people 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.970
 reported the then wanted to have 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.520
 and yes, unfortunately, then has difficulty 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.020
 reported and that love you now 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.820
 Lemon is called then I believe here 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.400
 youtube somehow something lemon pc or 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.229
 so the war is the test system here has 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.000
 he already paid and I am now or 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.950
 was just doing all the programs and 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.109
 to delete something and my user too 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.959
 delete and the testers as well yes 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:20.239
 factory condition and now I just wanted 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.939
 let's show where he's growing 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.439
 is how fast the colleague down here 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.109
 and booting up so special now 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.930
 were actually high and indeed do 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:33.489
 I always out as soon as an error message 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.799
 blabla does not matter explorer point real like that 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.689
 because you see me somehow in 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.730
 kÃ¶ddingen are pretty fat 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.340
 I have to say well so what do we do 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:50.090
 the whole again s.TV says no 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:51.859
 connection and 3 2 1 that is too 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.659
 Quite quietly at first he turns the 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.989
 fan once briefly that it just yes 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.599
 in the bios come change something 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:06.769
 but otherwise it is actually 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:07.730
 pretty loud and so much better 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.590
 booted 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.269
 now you can see how many 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.980
 seconds I had habs now, unfortunately, 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.030
 not counting the so is ready 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.459
 with loading of course that is a ssd 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.900
 and no hdd I guess that were 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.239
 the two are maybe ten eleven twelve 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.499
 seconds or so you can like in 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:29.290
 to write the comments 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:33.980
 there you see now a 200 32 gb ssd 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.469
 or 240 gb yes otherwise the 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.999
 pc is ready now so if you have that 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.549
 video is I will now only here 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:43.150
 Let's get in here and then I will 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.349
 to send the 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.480
 oh so still to the television 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.939
 you may see that is one now 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.680
 full hd resolution so i stop 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.950
 further believes that is now necessary to 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.680
 I have the symbols on one 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.049
 reduced to full hd resolution, so to speak 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.469
 that's the idea the size of the desktop 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.810
 is just about 200% think I can zoomed 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:09.230
 that is, it looks like a full 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.400
 hd resolution is but uhd I can do it 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.829
 you also like to show 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.810
 there you see it samsung 3840 x 2160 is 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.239
 recommended that is uhd that fits everything 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.950
 and how you see the whole super mega 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.000
 sharp 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.200
 what can I to talk, I start 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.160
 I always have nothing 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.080
 not even internet in here 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.410
 Just put the text out here 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.930
 normal distance he is already 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.520
 spicy but you can really great there 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.590
 approach and that is and he becomes 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.480
 just sharp then you realize already 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.960
 this is not going to be a full hd resolution 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.970
 can 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.800
 now you can see the pixel that is clear 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.040
 but I am also I say the camera 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:54.230
 sits 15 inches from the monitor 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.940
 removed yes i would say that was it 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.620
 my new tv seen this 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.350
 testsystem disappears here now 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.450
 unfortunately or luckily me too always me 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.520
 then have a bit more space because 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.530
 I also wanted to have a look at my pc 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.700
 I have to screw around a bit further 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.980
 no longer done 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.150
 I'll say so fan control fan 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.310
 I wanted to attack man soon 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.100
 take and also overclock more et 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.450
 cetera pp and there has the test system 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.550
 achieve times but time just 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.140
 disturbed 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.970
 why did i have the test system at all 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.010
 I have the housing so to speak 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.490
 get paid or to test 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.350
 to get 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.140
 unfortunately I can not do that anymore 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.640
 test but I tested myself but 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.120
 so as a video test I can do that 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.220
 not doing anymore is really very 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.470
 well I like the housing very much 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.090
 nice would be the exterior of the housing market 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.730
 he'll make friends with that too 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.500
 I can stand as I said more so 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.660
 as simple as the corsair housing 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.400
 but everyone has to do that for themselves 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.169
 decide 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.940
 ok then I would say until the next 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.940
 skin in and ciao 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.550
 a
