00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
sounds features that's a little bit

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.789 
sounds features that's a little bit

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
and it doesn't seem to go off as much as

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.809 
and it doesn't seem to go off as much as
the<00:02:12.680> other<00:02:12.830> one<00:02:13.010> did<00:02:13.040> just<00:02:13.280> we're<00:02:13.670> going

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
around you have to push it back so it

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.400 
around you have to push it back so it
does<00:02:17.060> seem<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.330> little<00:02:17.630> bit<00:02:17.720> better<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.200> way

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410
