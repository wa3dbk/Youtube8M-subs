00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.340
 one with each other while weeks in 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.050
 quotes is because I can 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.690

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.380
 lifestyle and therefore always has 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.430
 I improvise something together 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.949
 make something calorie conscious or 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.300
 Carbohydrate is reduced protein rich 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.560
 and so continue to go hard then 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.689
 I will continue to help you but 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.380

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.660
 Milk coffee the fitness milk coffee 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.489
 For this he only needs one glass 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.140
 yannik you can too if he is too 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.629

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.730
 or in their morning this 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.379

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.910
 I'm getting in here for better 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.770

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.240

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.799

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.570
 and all we need is ice cubes 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.850

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.360
