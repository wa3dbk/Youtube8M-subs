promising<00:05:20.900> young<00:05:21.170> keeper<00:05:21.710> I<00:05:21.890> mean<00:05:22.460> you<00:05:22.610> will

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
promising young keeper I mean you will

struggle<00:05:23.030> to<00:05:23.180> sign<00:05:23.480> him<00:05:23.630> from<00:05:23.750> Chelsea<00:05:24.200> just

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
struggle to sign him from Chelsea just

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.990 
struggle to sign him from Chelsea just
by<00:05:24.530> having<00:05:24.680> a<00:05:24.830> low<00:05:24.980> market<00:05:25.340> value<00:05:25.670> I<00:05:25.700> think

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
by having a low market value I think

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.280 
by having a low market value I think
because<00:05:26.240> they<00:05:26.420> will<00:05:26.570> want<00:05:26.690> to<00:05:26.840> hold<00:05:26.990> on<00:05:27.170> to

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
because they will want to hold on to

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.410 
because they will want to hold on to
their<00:05:27.440> best<00:05:27.590> prospects<00:05:28.130> being<00:05:28.400> such<00:05:28.610> a<00:05:28.790> such<00:05:29.300> a

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
their best prospects being such a such a

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.340 
their best prospects being such a such a
big<00:05:29.600> club<00:05:31.150> but<00:05:32.150> they've<00:05:32.660> got<00:05:32.690> that<00:05:32.960> call<00:05:33.200> to

big club but they've got that call to
his<00:05:33.530> fellow<00:05:33.680> and<00:05:34.010> I<00:05:34.070> think<00:05:34.280> he<00:05:34.430> could<00:05:34.670> be<00:05:34.700> them

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970
