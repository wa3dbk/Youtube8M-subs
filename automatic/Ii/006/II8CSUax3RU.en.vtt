 a lot thanks for a bride 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.910

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.690
 will wear less willingly for a day 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.210

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.670
 tutorial first of all opens with mine 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.809
 moisturizer I leave it to act for 5 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.399
 minutes 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.820
 then started with the base takes mine 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.719
 corrector of the medium stirrer of 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.700
 mark of the correctors nem out three e 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.700
 start by covering the dark circles in me 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.280
 I use my fingers a lot on customers 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.840
 or on other people however I use 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.420
 brushes because it's a little more 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.900
 professional for the heat they give 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.110
 fingers and products has no equal therefore 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.979
 if I can use private fingers with 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.820
 my bottom that the mineralize of but mine 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.860
 lnc color 25 at this time and it 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.369
 I apply with my hands and this with the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.030
 hands to work in a way 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.030
 quite homogeneous 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.730
 if you have to make up, have yours 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.310
 marriage a very important thing e 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:02:00.350
 just that the bottom is comfortable or hard 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:02.330
 but above all be comfortable with the 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.920
 professional pupa shoulder da da 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.020
 fix my makeup 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.360
 if you have oily skin you can fix it 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.520
 in another step also the corrector 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.380
 then fix concealer then put the 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.970
 at the end of the trip then fix the foundation in 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.070
 this case I chose to fix 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.720
 only the foundation then I take how 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.900
 basis for eyeshadow this merit of 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.150
 pupa which is very very nice of 0 0 5 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.150
 of the latest collection parise spears 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.780
 takes complains of pupa and I take the 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.510
 darker color with a brush from 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.450
 shades directly and I'm going to create 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.850
 a darker corner a shadow in the eye 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.030
 in the outer corner keeping me not enough 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.130
 going beyond the crease of the shooting eye 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.590
 the eye shadow towards the inside of the eye 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.450
 to create the illusion of one 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.730
 fold a little higher than I have 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.300
 and tilt it outwards to stretch 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.819
 the eye then with a pointed brush 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.560
 had to apply the same land in the 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.670
 lower part in the lower eyelid 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.550
 to give depth to the eye multi 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.100
 pupa play number 65 of the last 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.819
 collection paride spears is a blue 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.380
 really really nice very lit. 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.390
 with some leaders inside that 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.269
 they help to give light to the look and therefore 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.050
 dark color the definition and lengthen 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.870
 the eye while little letters give a little 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.150
 light and important to blend well for not 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:37.269
 have traits too defined to have 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:39.060
 a more delicate result I apply since 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.720
 my multiplayer than in the lower rhyme 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.720
 slightly and faded 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.600
 then that my manga pencil browse of 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.740
 snow cosmetics arranges the eyebrows 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.240
 suppressions are a sore point among 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.240
 many brides because sometimes they are not 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.310
 used to putting on makeup and seeing each other 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.880
 change your eyebrows a little 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.090
 shock 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.190
 so I advise you to go slowly 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:10.470
 especially if you make up yourself not 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.960
 you've never done it important to have them 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:18.090
 then he was piled and combed then 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.850
 filling to a little to taste I take the 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.460
 my livestream mascara of essence lo 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.670
 I apply abundantly of course 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.010
 it's better to use a waterproof one in the 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:33.210
 in case a few tears come down it 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.880
 I also apply below then take it again 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.740
 my earth pupa and I'm going to create some 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.370
 of shading the shadings in 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.160
 every person is different for me is 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.620
 important to darken on my face 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.750
 the part below the cheekbones for 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.700
 however, pulling a little further out is one 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.350
 something that goes a lot to tastes and had to 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.180
 also analyze the key face goes 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.680
 forward if you have a round face you must 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.320
 do it shades to make that 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.870
 it looks the most elongated if you have a face 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.940
 square you have to search given the cycle 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.130
 with shadows instead of quadraro as I am 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.470
 doing right now with the lights 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.750
 I'm going to give you some 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.520
 color to the cheekbones as always for 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.490
 connect the africo makeup a little bit 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.950
 even on the front nose won a lot 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.830
 slightly then with illuminating of the 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:26.550
 collection poles stevens dance illuminate 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:28.890
 of strategic areas nose chin up 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.940
 lips to make it look fleshier 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:36.410
 the eyebrow arch and the upper part 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:39.000
 of the cheekbone creating this v between 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.090
 the eyebrow arch part of the 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.010
 bunting that I like very much 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.790
 I'm going to get my lipstick 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.740
 collection parisi always pushes 0 0 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.750
 among the darkest color of the collection 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.750
