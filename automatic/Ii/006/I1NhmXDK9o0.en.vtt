00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.210 

and<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.900> like<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:01.230> they<00:02:01.470> did<00:02:01.620> a<00:02:01.680> good<00:02:01.800> job<00:02:01.860> they

improve<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.640> cap<00:02:02.820> construction<00:02:03.030> because<00:02:03.630> you

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
improve the cap construction because you

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.300 
improve the cap construction because you
don't<00:02:04.080> see<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.350> ear<00:02:04.500> tabs<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:04.980> the<00:02:05.100> side

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
don't see the ear tabs on the side

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.220 
don't see the ear tabs on the side
anymore<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:06.060> hair<00:02:06.270> now<00:02:06.450> comes<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.110> way

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
anymore the hair now comes all the way

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.820 
anymore the hair now comes all the way
around<00:02:07.440> it<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.190> that's<00:02:08.430> really<00:02:08.640> good<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.830> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
around it so that's really good and the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.580 
around it so that's really good and the
hair<00:02:11.040> is<00:02:11.190> super<00:02:11.460> super<00:02:12.080> straight<00:02:13.080> like<00:02:13.350> very

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
hair is super super straight like very

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.620 
hair is super super straight like very
silky<00:02:13.920> straight<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.430> doesn't<00:02:14.460> hold<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.060> curl<00:02:15.390> I

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
silky straight it doesn't hold a curl I

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.900 
silky straight it doesn't hold a curl I
think<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.470> works<00:02:16.680> for<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.070> style<00:02:17.400> because

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910

think it works for this style because
it's<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.180> really<00:02:18.390> straight<00:02:18.720> style<00:02:19.050> it's<00:02:19.950> pretty
