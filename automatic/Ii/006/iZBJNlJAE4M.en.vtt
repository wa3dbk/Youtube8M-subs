the<00:01:57.060> engine<00:01:57.360> without<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> supercharger<00:01:58.409> as<00:01:58.560> you

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
the engine without a supercharger as you

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.710 
the engine without a supercharger as you
can<00:01:59.310> see<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.610> putting<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> original<00:02:00.509> turbo

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
can see like putting the original turbo

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.420 
can see like putting the original turbo
chargin<00:02:01.049> will<00:02:01.290> add<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.740> her<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:01.920> 26<00:02:02.310> horsepower

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
chargin will add to her in 26 horsepower

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.399 
chargin will add to her in 26 horsepower
but<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.939> are<00:02:03.030> taking<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.479> away<00:02:03.720> by<00:02:04.020> buying

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
but you are taking that away by buying

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.590 
but you are taking that away by buying
another<00:02:04.650> one<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.040> then<00:02:05.460> selling<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.970> so

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
another one and then selling it so

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.789 
another one and then selling it so
basically<00:02:06.900> it's<00:02:07.110> not<00:02:07.140> putting<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
basically it's not putting in the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.229 
basically it's not putting in the
default<00:02:08.159> turbocharger<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.880> you<00:02:08.970> initially

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
default turbocharger that you initially

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.089 
default turbocharger that you initially
bought<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.349> now<00:02:10.470> as<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.649> can<00:02:10.770> see<00:02:10.830> at<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
bought so now as you can see at the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.150 
bought so now as you can see at the
bottom<00:02:11.190> left<00:02:11.550> my<00:02:12.180> silene<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.020> actually<00:02:13.290> at<00:02:13.380> 516

performance<00:02:14.610> points<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:15.480> way<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.690> could

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
performance points this way I could

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.870 
performance points this way I could
actually<00:02:16.050> use<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.560> legit<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.370> class<00:02:17.610> tag

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
actually use it in a legit a class tag

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.700 
actually use it in a legit a class tag
or<00:02:18.090> something<00:02:18.330> like<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.380> could<00:02:19.530> put

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
or something like that and I could put

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.470 
or something like that and I could put
like<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.190> could<00:02:20.340> put<00:02:20.460> tires<00:02:20.700> on<00:02:20.820> my<00:02:21.030> car<00:02:21.060> here

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
like I could put tires on my car here

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.850 
like I could put tires on my car here
we'll<00:02:21.840> go<00:02:21.960> with<00:02:22.110> sports<00:02:23.040> tires<00:02:23.880> right<00:02:24.240> here

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
we'll go with sports tires right here

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.290 
we'll go with sports tires right here
you<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:26.040> make<00:02:26.130> them<00:02:26.280> fatter<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.670> bit<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.150> could

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
you can make them fatter a bit you could

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.910 
you can make them fatter a bit you could
put<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.480> little<00:02:27.900> bit<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.110> engine<00:02:28.380> tuning<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.800> it

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
put a little bit of engine tuning in it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.850 
put a little bit of engine tuning in it
or<00:02:29.040> anything<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:30.020> could<00:02:31.020> put<00:02:31.260> some

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
or anything like that I could put some

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.230 
or anything like that I could put some
of<00:02:31.890> these<00:02:32.010> make<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.430> just<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.880> couple<00:02:33.120> of

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
of these make it's just a couple of

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.670 
of these make it's just a couple of
wings<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.930> stuff<00:02:34.020> like<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.380> make<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.560> go

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
wings and stuff like that to make it go

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.650 
wings and stuff like that to make it go
faster<00:02:35.100> around<00:02:35.670> turns<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.210> stuff<00:02:36.330> like<00:02:36.510> that

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
faster around turns and stuff like that

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.450 
faster around turns and stuff like that
but<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:37.380> like<00:02:37.620> that's<00:02:37.800> this<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.220> easiest

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
but that like that's this the easiest

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.340 
but that like that's this the easiest
way<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.700> get<00:02:38.910> any<00:02:39.060> car<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.510> tag<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.050> I'm<00:02:40.140> just

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
way to get any car and tag and I'm just

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.530 
way to get any car and tag and I'm just
trying<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.670> not<00:02:41.670> trying<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:41.970> go<00:02:42.060> over<00:02:42.090> right

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
trying to not trying to go over right

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.990 
trying to not trying to go over right
now<00:02:42.660> here<00:02:42.900> 598<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.800> we'll<00:02:43.950> just<00:02:44.160> put<00:02:44.850> that

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
now here 598 and we'll just put that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.560 
now here 598 and we'll just put that
make<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.300> 600<00:02:45.540> now<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.760> as<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.120> see<00:02:48.180> like

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
make it 600 now so as you can see like

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.600 
make it 600 now so as you can see like
it's<00:02:48.810> not<00:02:48.960> like<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.440> hack<00:02:49.800> or<00:02:49.980> anything<00:02:50.160> it's<00:02:50.460> a

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
it's not like a hack or anything it's a

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.340 
it's not like a hack or anything it's a
it's<00:02:50.850> just<00:02:51.000> not<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.420> glitch<00:02:51.810> but<00:02:52.020> it's<00:02:52.140> like<00:02:52.320> a

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
it's just not a glitch but it's like a

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.070 
it's just not a glitch but it's like a
bug<00:02:52.650> where<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.310> don't<00:02:53.910> think<00:02:54.060> they<00:02:54.330> intended<00:02:54.990> on

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
bug where I don't think they intended on

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.160 
bug where I don't think they intended on
this<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.590> work<00:02:56.130> like<00:02:56.520> that<00:02:56.550> but<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.510> does<00:02:57.780> which

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
this to work like that but it does which

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.940 
this to work like that but it does which
I<00:02:58.500> find<00:02:59.130> it's<00:02:59.280> very<00:02:59.310> useful<00:03:00.020> so<00:03:01.020> if<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.500> do<00:03:01.680> go

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
I find it's very useful so if you do go

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.280 
I find it's very useful so if you do go
to<00:03:01.980> upgrade<00:03:02.730> shop<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.270> then<00:03:03.390> go<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.960> selection

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
to upgrade shop and then go a selection

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.570 
to upgrade shop and then go a selection
on<00:03:04.410> thing<00:03:04.590> you'll<00:03:04.740> see<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.220> performance

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
on thing you'll see that the performance

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.040 
on thing you'll see that the performance
points<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:05.880> 600<00:03:06.330> at<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.510> top<00:03:06.660> right<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:06.990> can

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
points is 600 at the top right you can

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.910 
points is 600 at the top right you can
see<00:03:07.290> at<00:03:07.740> 510<00:03:08.520> horsepower<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:10.140> if<00:03:10.410> we<00:03:10.560> go<00:03:10.710> back

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
see at 510 horsepower so if we go back

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.940 
see at 510 horsepower so if we go back
and<00:03:11.160> check<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.520> stock<00:03:11.850> I'll<00:03:12.810> go<00:03:12.960> to<00:03:13.020> cars<00:03:13.410> buy

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
and check it stock I'll go to cars buy

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.380 
and check it stock I'll go to cars buy
cars<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.490> then<00:03:15.140> find<00:03:16.140> Slean<00:03:16.590> oh<00:03:17.190> yeah<00:03:18.120> Porsche
