competing for a growing space so I've
got<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.200> soil<00:01:19.470> laid<00:01:19.800> down<00:01:20.040> I'm<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.340> gonna

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
got this soil laid down I'm just gonna

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.970 
got this soil laid down I'm just gonna
add<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> little<00:01:20.970> bit<00:01:21.300> of<00:01:21.420> water<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:21.860> just<00:01:22.860> a

touch and I have some pea seeds here I'm
using<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:29.010> variety<00:01:29.190> called<00:01:29.760> Thomas<00:01:30.210> Laxton<00:01:31.460> I'm

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
using a variety called Thomas Laxton I'm

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.360 
using a variety called Thomas Laxton I'm
using<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.910> tablespoon<00:01:33.330> of<00:01:33.660> peas<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:35.100> I'm<00:01:35.190> just

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
using a tablespoon of peas so I'm just

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.620 
using a tablespoon of peas so I'm just
gonna<00:01:37.250> put<00:01:38.250> those<00:01:38.430> down<00:01:38.730> and<00:01:39.030> kind<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.330> spread

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
gonna put those down and kind of spread

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.210 
gonna put those down and kind of spread
them<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:42.170> they<00:01:43.170> all<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.590> plenty<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.010> room

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
them out so they all have plenty of room

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.820 
them out so they all have plenty of room
to<00:01:44.250> grow<00:01:44.610> once<00:01:45.240> you've<00:01:45.390> got<00:01:45.570> those<00:01:45.830> situated

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
to grow once you've got those situated

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.570 
to grow once you've got those situated
you<00:01:47.070> want<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.030> grab<00:01:48.300> a<00:01:48.330> little<00:01:48.420> more<00:01:48.810> soil<00:01:49.580> go

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
you want to grab a little more soil go

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.380 
you want to grab a little more soil go
ahead<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:50.970> cover<00:01:51.480> those<00:01:51.780> up<00:01:52.820> if<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.060> peas<00:01:54.270> are

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
ahead and cover those up if the peas are

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.360 
ahead and cover those up if the peas are
exposed<00:01:54.840> they<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> tendency<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.100> develop

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
exposed they have a tendency to develop

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.220 
exposed they have a tendency to develop
mold<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:59.540> covering<00:02:00.540> them<00:02:00.690> with<00:02:00.720> plenty<00:02:01.140> of

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
mold so covering them with plenty of

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.050 
mold so covering them with plenty of
soil<00:02:01.440> will<00:02:01.740> help<00:02:02.010> counteract<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.850> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
soil will help counteract that and it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.170 
soil will help counteract that and it
will<00:02:03.180> also<00:02:03.330> help<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.020> peas<00:02:04.670> develop<00:02:05.670> strong

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
will also help the peas develop strong

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.460 
will also help the peas develop strong
robust<00:02:06.990> stems<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.970> I've<00:02:09.300> covered<00:02:09.869> my<00:02:10.200> peas

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
robust stems so I've covered my peas

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.250 
robust stems so I've covered my peas
with<00:02:10.950> soil<00:02:11.280> I'm<00:02:12.030> now<00:02:12.269> just<00:02:12.510> gonna<00:02:12.720> top<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.019> off

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
with soil I'm now just gonna top it off

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.240 
with soil I'm now just gonna top it off
with<00:02:13.319> some<00:02:13.560> water

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
with some water

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.570 
with some water
and<00:02:14.959> that<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.260> here<00:02:16.920> we<00:02:16.950> have<00:02:17.310> some

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
and that is it here we have some

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.270 
and that is it here we have some
examples<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:18.510> pea<00:02:19.230> shoots<00:02:19.499> that<00:02:19.799> are<00:02:20.129> in

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
examples of pea shoots that are in

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.330 
examples of pea shoots that are in
different<00:02:20.519> stages<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.329> growth<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:22.650> hair<00:02:23.099> was

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
different stages of growth this hair was

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.980 
different stages of growth this hair was
planted<00:02:23.790> three<00:02:23.969> days<00:02:24.150> ago

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
planted three days ago

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.570 
planted three days ago
so<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.140> can<00:02:25.560> see<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.010> hasn't<00:02:26.190> quite

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
so you can see that it hasn't quite

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.910 
so you can see that it hasn't quite
broken<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.060> soil<00:02:27.300> yet<00:02:27.600> this<00:02:28.380> was<00:02:28.590> planted
