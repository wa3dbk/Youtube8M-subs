00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.000
 this video, I propose to sew a backpack 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.070
 for the doll we need paper for 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.760
 patterns 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.610
 pencil or pen scissors felt two 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.379
 colors or other material similar 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.270
 by properties 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:10.280
 small sewing button thin braid 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.860
 matching and sewing threads 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.410
 pins take a doll that will sew 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:22.310
 the backpack is applied to a piece of paper and 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:30.759
 note the size of the back and the width of the future 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.759
 backpack draw a rectangle 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.430
 round bottom corners 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:48.850
 add about a centimeter and draw 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.850
 backpack flap top 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:09.220
 cut out the cut pattern is cut into 2 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.190
 parts like this taking advantage of our 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.519
 patterns cut two large parts and 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.500
 one smaller detail besides cut out 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.170
 detail 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.629
 1 cm wide and sufficient length 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:28.049
 in order to embrace our item 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:32.140
 we also need a sewing pocket 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:34.000
 its size can be arbitrary well 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.970
 of course they should be less than 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.819
 here this detail it will pocket it 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:47.799
 pocket flap now we pocket pocket on 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:50.579
 detail using a thread of the withers sew 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.579
 seam over the edge 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:03:01.209
 first we sew a pocket then we sew 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:05.909
 the valve we got here is such a 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.909
 detail of the pocket is quite functional 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:19.419
 prepare the rear part take two parts 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:26.849
 take the tape cut a small piece 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:29.939
 for pen and two pieces for shlek 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.939
 pinning pins 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.490
 now we impose this detail 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.970
 a bit overlap about the floor 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.970
 centimeter 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.209
 tea from the side and start sewing 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.819
 seam back needle knot hide between 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.819
 in two details so that it is not visible 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.049
 back from the needle back 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.030
 go ahead come back a little 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:17.350
 backwards 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.150
 go ahead come back a little bit 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.340
 backwards 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.150
 we go ahead we try to do stitches 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.590
 small so they are strong enough 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.910
 or if you have a sewing machine 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.910
 can be stitched on a typewriter 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.470
 we need two for strength 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.620
 lines at first I spend one line 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:44.360
 I will make one more parallel line 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:48.500
 so that my part is tighter 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:51.560
 details are sewn handles attached 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:56.140
 now i take a doll attached to her 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:05:01.550
 backpack measure the required distance 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:05.590
 I pin the second strap I measure 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:12.580
 1 each so that it is the same size 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.580
 likewise pinned down 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:22.160
 Now I sew here this part I her 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:29.060
 I attach the edge and sew seam through 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:33.400
 I hide the edge of the knot between the parts to 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.400
 did not stick out and sew 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.370
 after the item is sewn on 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.830
 perimeter 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.800
 start flashing the front parts on 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:54.530
 which sews pocket in the same way 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:56.840
 over the edge in the same way we hide the bundle 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:03.460
 between the panels 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:03.460
 and sew around the perimeter of this item 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.140
 after the item is sewn on 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.510
 perimeter 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:20.330
 Sew a button and so for Derek 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:23.510
 decorate the seams with a winter heart 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:27.160
