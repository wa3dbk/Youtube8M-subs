00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.680
 and done 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.160
 so loud welcome to a small farm 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.200
 in fact not really 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.910
 was planned but that is just times 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.230
 because I did it that way 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.390
 drove a bit on the side yesterday 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.349
 night there where I just certain times 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.390
 There is a sign on the sofa 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.430
 bit gambled we'll see each other 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.610
 now last attack an hour 28 so 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.949
 not quite 90 minutes passed again 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.809
 We were with the blood bonus 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.989
 together it was about 2.3 million 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.059
 plus still dark you have to 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.470
 say it was okay 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.640
 actually, and we just want times 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.220
 look at the attacks and times 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.260
 Watch why it makes such a sense 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.489
 to drive in crystal three as a town hall 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.470
 now i can only recommend to anyone before 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.670
 It's a relative thing in the evening 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.830
 small bonus to take back 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.909
 we can be here now 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.070
 I had a few more kobolde left 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.830
 first send my train afterwards and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.729
 then I sit behind the barbarians 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.320
 moment moment now I set the 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.840
 archers of the then yes one 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.799
 bit protected by that 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.530
 human barbarian shield 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.840
 Of course , then the plan is 22,000 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.329
 gold and how much 224,000 do we take 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.799
 still important with alex here anytime 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.539
 you have the possibility of 50 pistols 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.579
 take every case explained 35,000 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.640
 bonus still of both plus 100 more 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.859
 it's dark and it lolls 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.630
 Of course in the end also seen more if 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.429
 you still have to take 4000 bonus with you 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.770
 why can not you do that yet 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:41.789
 just as are moreover I've gang 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.600
 nine left has a little left 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.520
 but I'll do that, of course 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.090
 Immediately no longer put I leave now 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.890
 in Roman 12 seconds but still is okay 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.679
 you can definitely work in any case 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.450
 and yes was definitely for the first 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.710
 raid was the whole thing you can see 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.999
 Of course, an inactive player is the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.789
 xbox are not loaded he only has 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:05.409
 you can also have three mine throwers 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.659
 always recognize very well to it 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.280
 a player is no longer active 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.670
 has in the four dates would not be 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.140
 built 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.670
 that means a bit longer 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.670
 actually did not play anymore 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.110
 I do not know now but well the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.150
 oman 108 and I do not have it now 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.379
 seen or still has it somewhere outside 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.299
 there was a build the wise is natural 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:28.060
 not so we see around 900 1990 cups 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.260
 crystal 3 as I said the advice of the new 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.640
 time will definitely try 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.620
 if your city hall 8 since tried yet 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.720
 my gold 1 I have with me from the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.090
 Clan also saw a few people 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.500
 drive there and have told me 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.290
 would definitely be worthwhile there too 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.239
 driving as a city hall eighth also get 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.940
 as a cool bonus maybe is still 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.840
 a bit high I do not know yet 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.190
 maybe I'll try my crystal 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.079
 two but if the opponents then stop too 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.250
 again something stronger there you have 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.989
 maybe not so lucky 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.129
 that I find the whole inactive like 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.450
 I have done that here now that is 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.849
 something we should always pay 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.709
 and here was a lot of kobolde 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.329
 forgot I had the kobolde with me 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.859
 and they have not set because I have them 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:07.660
 not because I knew her but I did 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.760
 they just do not have them 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.680
 I simply did not perceive 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.079
 perceived 190000 and 196 1000 yes that 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.000
 is okay you can definitely 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.519
 with work so the next attack the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.510
 you want to look at it now 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.310
 It's about time it gets something 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.980
 less what the what the booty terms 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.000
 But do not worry about the bonus 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.549
 you can definitely something with 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.380
 I started here so now 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.720
 I would have the choir friends here 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.819
 just as not set and therefore 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.130
 I could now put here and 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.599
 I have to say I have none 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.940
 Barracks are not pushed otherwise 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.049
 planned to drive that 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.230
 that just came like that I just got it 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.150
 a bit without a boost without 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.280
 everything 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.430
 there would have been more in it is clear but 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.579
 if it somehow from 100000 with the 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.659
 bonus I always take with me there 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.280
 does not even stand up for me 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.599
 ask that not to take with you and now 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.140
 we'll see the town hall right away 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.700
 it still made it off and 160,000 from 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.430
 both of which is okay you can on 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.280
 cooperate in every case 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.230
 Now he is still setting the town hall 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.790
 still get caught 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.889
 that is very important now I have one 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.489
 a bit too late actually I know 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.829
 I am abandoned 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.870
 The king has to do is still survives 854 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.220
 still doing that too okay so yes 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:30.910
 one on the good kia and yes that was 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.190
 another attack with 160,000 and 180,000 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.570
 so also some blood what I then 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.250
 always like to take it with you 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.490
 because you can sometimes we do it here 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.690
 exceptions in it 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.360
 he also has no clear troop and 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.639
 Something else, however, a two 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.830
 Collector still inside or was still 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.010
 what the drill is still in one 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.240
 behind a wall and another elixir 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.650
 collectors also behind a wall 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.340
 okay but of course I want the 50th 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.660
 percent like to take 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.880
 Simply because we look at that 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.020
 sir and the 5000 too 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.610
 a very important, I know now too 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.840
 I do not have the bon bon now 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.330
 more so in mind for the other leagues 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.710
 but I know it's off master 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.820
 I think already gives 100,000 and that is 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.169
 of course we have really oil 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.360
 you still try the 50 percent 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.699
 pick up 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.000
 I also have 142,000 and 114,000 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.979
 Of course, elixir is not that much 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.090
 what we have here now but it will be 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.919
 will still be there I have only with 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.970
 lured away the kite so up there so 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.560
 a bit annoying 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.599
 it was straight back up now 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.680
 I could still sacrifice my king 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.449
 then a little something to pick me up 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.650
 I really wanted to get those 50,000 off 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.860
 the collector did not quite have it 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.139
 120,000 are enough each time 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.750
 The fund 30,000 is at, is true 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.210
 marginal but okay I just hope 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.169
 You have now seen through the video 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.180
 that it definitely worthwhile in 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.030
 To grow crystal 2008 I have a cup 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.560
 Now I'm pretty easy now 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.820
 in crystal three then take course 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.500
 even with and if you in between 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.000
 and also in the town hall have been just since 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.980
 in colors and have between city ​​hall something 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.140
 you can do 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.390
 Sniper still has the town hall 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.340
 with simply because you then 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.080
 you could get the bonus with one 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.190
 troop could just or remember with a 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.920
 troop maybe not with 23 dead ones 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.170
 one might just have to take even 5000 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.850
 the search costs also covered again and 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.350
 the troop cost, therefore, I would 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.760
 And that's what it definitely does 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.010
 and yes, I 'm really a real one 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.569
 a bit hoarse and really sorry but me 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:32.439
 wanted to say 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.580
 if you have any ideas, where did you find 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:34.779
 just with which troops advised 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.270
 I could write my comments 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:37.869
 drive currently with butch we see 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.869
 now also because I'm still a bit 

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:43.419
 at the instructor always a barracks with 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:45.879
 archers a barracks with barbarians 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:48.189
 and thank you very much 

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:50.349
 that you watched this video over 

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:51.729
 I would like to receive criticism and tips 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:53.699
 look in the comments about one 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:56.559
 Thumbs up, I'm happy too 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:59.080
 So you really have to say we see 

00:06:56.559 --> 00:07:00.399

 ins with the medium fred and hopefully 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.729
 is my voice then again halfway there 

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:08.469
 I really must say that currently 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:09.819
 to take up a fight because I always 

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:12.039
 hot wind and sometimes cough 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:14.169
 must always cut that out yes 

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:16.300
 so thank you in any case for 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.709
