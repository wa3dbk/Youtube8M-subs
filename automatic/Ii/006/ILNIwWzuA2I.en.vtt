 always small 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.580
 I think that comes the aesthetics and 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.740
 then afterwards also the food clearly 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.920
 benefit and it is also much more fun 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.270

 Add and send that too 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.940
 cut it as small as possible afterwards 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.899
 not some giant stripes 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:41.259
 has and exactly that gives it all up in the end 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.119
 the bowl and about a kilo cinema 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.099
 In the end, here is your salad sauce 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.200

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:48.610
 that you do not need anything in the end 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.420
 but not at all 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.890

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.170

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.099
 a little bit of pepper and after that 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.869
 I've already mixed that 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:06.759
 chickens and then extend that 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.050

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.030
 chicken to cut small 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.770

 a bit of pepper, a few more herbs 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.890
