00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
wanderings tend to be down dirt roads

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.350

not<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.070> say<00:01:05.220> there<00:01:05.430> isn't<00:01:05.549> some<00:01:05.790> great<00:01:06.060> rides

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
not to say there isn't some great rides

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.649 
not to say there isn't some great rides
around<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:07.250> some<00:01:08.250> twists<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.000> turns<00:01:09.240> and

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
around here some twists and turns and

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.560 
around here some twists and turns and
great<00:01:09.900> highways<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.560> go<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:11.060> but<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.119> want<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> be

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
great highways to go on but I want to be

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.420 
great highways to go on but I want to be
able<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.780> go<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> mountains<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.799> so

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
able to go up to the mountains and so

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.830 
able to go up to the mountains and so
that<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.030> basically<00:01:15.799> handing<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.890> off<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
that is basically handing this off to a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.929 
that is basically handing this off to a
family<00:01:19.170> friend<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.740> we're<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.729> look

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
family friend and we're going to look

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.050 
family friend and we're going to look
into<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.509> adventure<00:01:21.930> bike<00:01:22.430> series<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
into the adventure bike series that

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.510 
into the adventure bike series that
would<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.330> more<00:01:24.509> advantageous<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:25.520> bugging

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
would be more advantageous for bugging

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.060 
would be more advantageous for bugging
out<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.479> just<00:01:27.689> better<00:01:27.960> suited<00:01:28.409> for<00:01:28.470> this

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
out but it's just better suited for this

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.249 
out but it's just better suited for this
environment<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:30.479> thing<00:01:30.689> treated<00:01:30.960> me<00:01:31.079> well

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
environment this thing treated me well

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.120 
environment this thing treated me well
through<00:01:31.560> seattle<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:33.229> it's<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.500> time<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.950> pass

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
through seattle and it's a time to pass

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.840 
through seattle and it's a time to pass
on<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:35.729> even<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.750> warm<00:01:36.900> weather<00:01:37.130> always<00:01:38.130> wear
