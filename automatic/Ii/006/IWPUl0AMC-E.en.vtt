00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
ok a couple of things we can do to

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.279 
ok a couple of things we can do to
improve<00:01:38.619> that<00:01:38.680> situation<00:01:39.509> now<00:01:40.509> how<00:01:40.840> high<00:01:41.079> your

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
improve that situation now how high your

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:42.810 
improve that situation now how high your
body<00:01:41.469> is<00:01:41.649> going<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.829> go<00:01:42.009> will<00:01:42.219> depend<00:01:42.609> on<00:01:42.759> a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
body is going to go will depend on a

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.719 
body is going to go will depend on a

number of factors supporting leg will be

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.429 
number of factors supporting leg will be
a<00:01:45.759> factor<00:01:46.240> specially<00:01:46.719> the<00:01:46.810> strength<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:47.380> the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
you saw the kick ok so right now we're

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.310

bring<00:03:15.939> both<00:03:16.150> legs<00:03:16.180> up<00:03:17.129> and<00:03:18.129> down<00:03:18.189> this<00:03:18.970> is<00:03:19.150> not

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
bring both legs up and down this is not

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.360 
bring both legs up and down this is not
to<00:03:19.510> say<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.900> your<00:03:20.079> abductors<00:03:20.829> or<00:03:21.220> your

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
to say that your abductors or your

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.580 
to say that your abductors or your

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
adductors are not working they up but

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.140 
adductors are not working they up but
you<00:03:23.709> also<00:03:23.889> work<00:03:24.220> in<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.489> midsection<00:03:24.849> okay<00:03:27.150> if

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
you also work in the midsection okay if

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.119 
you also work in the midsection okay if
you<00:03:28.329> can't<00:03:28.629> look<00:03:28.810> self<00:03:29.079> about<00:03:29.379> it<00:03:29.530> this<00:03:29.949> is

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
you can't look self about it this is

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:49.400 
you can't look self about it this is
better<00:03:30.370> option<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:32.769> demonstrate<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.400> now

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.040 

it<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.250> better<00:03:50.520> carry<00:03:50.970> over<00:03:51.240> into<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.720> actual

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
it is better carry over into the actual

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.010 
it is better carry over into the actual
kick<00:03:53.240> once<00:03:54.240> you<00:03:54.360> have<00:03:54.540> worked<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:54.930> the

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
kick once you have worked in the

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.900 
kick once you have worked in the
exercises<00:03:55.560> lying<00:03:55.950> down<00:03:56.160> on<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.520> side<00:03:56.730> of<00:03:56.760> his

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
exercises lying down on the side of his

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.150 
exercises lying down on the side of his
body<00:03:57.120> now<00:03:57.930> we<00:03:57.990> can<00:03:58.260> actually<00:03:58.410> take<00:03:58.770> a<00:03:58.830> real

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
body now we can actually take a real

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.010 
body now we can actually take a real
exercise<00:03:59.640> and<00:04:00.000> carry<00:04:00.270> it<00:04:00.420> over<00:04:00.510> into<00:04:00.840> the

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
exercise and carry it over into the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.160 
exercise and carry it over into the
actual<00:04:01.320> kick<00:04:01.620> okay<00:04:02.550> the<00:04:03.090> basic<00:04:03.390> exercise<00:04:03.930> is

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
actual kick okay the basic exercise is

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.580 
actual kick okay the basic exercise is
to<00:04:04.290> put<00:04:04.470> your<00:04:04.590> foot<00:04:04.800> on<00:04:04.830> something<00:04:05.400> okay<00:04:06.590> lean

back lean away and come back what you
doing<00:04:13.320> here<00:04:13.530> essentially<00:04:14.010> is<00:04:14.190> you're

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
line and then you laterally flexing it

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.270 
line and then you laterally flexing it
okay<00:04:20.000> if<00:04:21.000> this<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.360> too<00:04:21.540> easy<00:04:21.810> for<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.170> I<00:04:22.530> do

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
okay if this is too easy for you I do

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.130

here we're working primarily on the

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.140 
here we're working primarily on the
midsection<00:04:37.650> that's<00:04:38.280> our<00:04:38.580> goal

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
midsection that's our goal

okay the strength of the midsection not

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.670 
okay the strength of the midsection not
flexibility<00:04:42.360> at<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:42.480> moment<00:04:42.870> working<00:04:43.590> in

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
flexibility at the moment working in

flexibility at the moment working in
strength<00:04:43.980> to<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.160> midsection

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
strength to the midsection

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.140 
strength to the midsection
okay<00:04:45.600> now<00:04:46.560> if<00:04:46.860> this<00:04:47.100> is<00:04:47.220> too<00:04:47.370> easy<00:04:47.430> couple<00:04:48.060> of

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
okay now if this is too easy couple of

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.090 
okay now if this is too easy couple of
options<00:04:48.510> we<00:04:48.630> can<00:04:48.780> raise<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.200> leg<00:04:49.440> or<00:04:49.680> we<00:04:49.920> can

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
options we can raise the leg or we can

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.680 
options we can raise the leg or we can
use<00:04:50.130> extra<00:04:50.610> resistance<00:04:52.610> okay<00:04:56.690> sidekick

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
use extra resistance okay sidekick

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:07.240 
use extra resistance okay sidekick
position<00:04:58.310> extra<00:04:59.310> resistance

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.450 

one<00:05:08.120> option<00:05:08.330> another<00:05:09.320> option<00:05:09.920> is<00:05:10.070> to<00:05:10.100> place<00:05:10.430> a
