joking<00:02:26.069> that's<00:02:26.550> exactly<00:02:27.300> what<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.510> smells

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
joking that's exactly what it smells

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.510 
joking that's exactly what it smells
like<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.140> coconuts<00:02:28.650> she<00:02:29.190> could<00:02:29.310> definitely

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
like it's coconuts she could definitely

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.120

smell<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:29.910> coconut<00:02:30.590> but<00:02:31.590> then<00:02:31.769> there's<00:02:32.069> that

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
smell the coconut but then there's that
