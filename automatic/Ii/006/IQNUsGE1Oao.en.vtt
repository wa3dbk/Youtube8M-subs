00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.759
 this is the so-called classic 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.799
 the spoon is true the size is big and I 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.740
 was going to do less but how 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:17.170
 It turned out well, so let's see, it means 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.340
 stainless steel stainless steel enough 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:24.580
 fine well i play and here it is just smooth 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.390
 flavone spins here it turns me 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:32.890
 I especially like it as I have not tried 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:35.200
 tried going to cling skirt on this 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.200
 on the hook to a little and 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.510
 stabilize but the effect does not give much 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.120
 anyway she has such a game now we 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.640
 could 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.030
 here is this second spoon I made after this 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.060
 stainless steel it is double sided made with 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.220
 one side copper adult tyrants brass 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.070
 between them is a tin layer 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.200
 this is purely to weight, I tried 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.180
 rate played poorly had to be put 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.100
 her stabilizer such that a little bit 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.379
 it will delay and stabilize it in 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.030
 horizontal position yar turned out 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.880
 great i liked that too on 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.609
 light she smoothly and 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.600
 start up with the slightest go with the slightest 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:25.149
 suspenders and immediately starts now and immediately 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:28.299
 start yelling about vodka pretty 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:33.969
 quickly and because enough 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:35.950
 hard baubles here a little further 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.520
 wall worms to better 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.979
 stabilize here and go smoothly and 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.679
 fluctuations are just what you need and then at least 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.450
 fast wiring move slow anyway 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.789
 if you panic it turns out the same and 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.549
 it does not spin like the previous light 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.159
 spoon it does not rotate does not tangle on 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.329
 fishing line well, therefore I can 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.679
 get rid of both the tip and the carbine 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.490
 but this is the next lure 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.450
 it already has an s-shape here with 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.389
 slight bend 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.990
 but again stainless steel graph paper a 

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:12.280
 need to 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.400
 exactly light and without the edge without these 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.410
 worms yara turns immediately pops up 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.330
 and almost no hesitation begins 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.190
 it does not suit me to spin 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.700
 so a little cannon stood 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.709
 what a p it turned out 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.480
 already completely arranged even on the very 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.930
 easy wiring at the slowest she 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:38.459
 Immediately begins to yell that tree-stick 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.989
 now you will be great to play 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.410
 imitating 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:48.810
 the fish market in general is not this game already 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.280
 really like 1 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.140
 again such a smog was very hard 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.720
 throw so I had to do it 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.530
 again two-part and notice and 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.049
 brass and in the middle of them pour and lead 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.720
 for weighting now the dishes will 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:09.130
 play this spirit compound spinners 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:13.780
 s-shaped well, that's how it turned out 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.420
 two - piece s-shaped lure but here 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.870
 turned fill 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.070
 center of gravity falls at the very bottom and 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.630
 could be more heart 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.170
 add but I still liked 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.709
 this game 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.690
 here's a look how it starts up well 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.700
 literally from the very first centimeter 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.190
 even on slow wiring she 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.359
 he instantly starts as zigzags 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.640
 I really liked to draw straight 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.640
 so what it is not in vain see if you 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.170
 I liked such a thing 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.170
 copy get your hands
