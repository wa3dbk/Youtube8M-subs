00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.760
 very good to everyone including this new 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:10.740
 grand theft video car in which you 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.960
 I bring to episode 4 of rare vehicles 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.509
 of the saga gta a new route with a 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.910
 total of 9 vehicles many more than in 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.309
 previous episodes of the strangest 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.439
 of the most curious ones even from the 

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:23.910
 saga and that's what we're going to review in 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.770
 this video is what it is and nothing more than 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.010
 I would do the message trick 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.010
 Y 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.580
 and little willies first of all we have 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.500
 this coastal turn of grand theft auto 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.390
 vice city with a pretty good handling and 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.940
 a really high speed to be a 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.680
 small propeller vehicle what can we 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.750
 find after the mission going up as 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.340
 the foam to which the unsj banch gives us 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.989
 and the one that rewards us with a suite 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.940
 at the hotel milan will be at your heliport 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.710
 where we can find the turn 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.629
 coastal is not just about a vehicle 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.519
 very different from everything seen in the saga 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.410
 but also complemented by a 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.910
 powerful machine gun that helps us to 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.920
 take away the enemies from above 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.080
 Logically if it were necessary to fly 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.280
 and attack at the same time apart its 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.260
 name refers to the helicopter 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.440
 coming out in the James Bond film 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.450
 you only live twice tornado in 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.950
 second place we have this low rider that 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.870
 great pictures come out andres in grand 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.090
 theft auto 5 although many people thought 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.159
 that many more gta came out is just the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.930
 case of these two games in general 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.250
 all its benefits are normal but 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.080
 the interesting part of this vehicle the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.909
 we found in its mariachi version this 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.530
 tornado mariachi that appears in a large photo 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.689
 5 we can find it from different 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.310
 ways but maybe the simplest one is 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.409
 go to the location that you are 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.450
 watching on screen at 7 o'clock in the afternoon and 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.550
 steal it because at this time a 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.320
 internet that makes use of this vehicle 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.120
 curiosities in the vehicle we find 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.980
 several guitars and a sticker with the 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.990
 Mexican flag also in missions 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.940
 of civil border patrol we will have 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.710
 to chase and catch two mariachis 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.940
 that drive this vehicle without a doubt that 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.830
 It will be the moment when we can 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.420
 make the most of the essence of 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.790
 vehicle 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.619
 aitor it is a boat that goes out in 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.840
 all the big cars from big 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.880
 photo 3 and maybe it is one of the vehicles 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.439
 most representative of the game by this 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.270
 reason we can see it whenever 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.860
 let's be in some kind of persecution and 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.170
 let's end up in the water as it will come 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.630
 Quickly for us 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.550
 and unfortunately from big picture 4 this 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.380
 vehicle does not possess machine guns what 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.450
 makes it lose functionality but still 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.250
 well its great design huge speed and 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.410
 definitely for being the police 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.099
 makes in each game a vehicle 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.780
 We want to try hot dog in the room 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.550
 place we have this grand vehicle 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.260
 theft auto san andreas just from 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.150
 this game that stands out for its particular 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.950
 function and its particular design of 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.019
 hot dog on technical issues 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.610
 it is a disastrously slow vehicle 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.590
 although in his favor is the one that we can 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.510
 to touch us a lot with him since it costs 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.950
 enough that it breaks as functions 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.510
 curious but also obvious 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.370
 we found the fact that they can 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.140
 buy hot dogs for a dollar 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.610
 although if we steal the truck we can not 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.350
 be we who sell the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.120
 products completely losing their 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.560
 function the min vehicle would have to know 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.390
 that this vehicle is directly 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.470
 based on the puppies truck 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.700
 hot big car 2 reggina 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.739
 stuffed it's about a sedan that comes out 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.630
 in vice city by city stories san andreas 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.760
 of lost and damned and grand theft auto 5 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.380
 is manufactured by the brand is Andrei 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.030
 and it is perhaps one of the cars that most 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.860
 appear in the streets of each of 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.540
 dgt maps your speed is normal and 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.200
 It also has a moderate resistance 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.390
 if in a vehicle 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.010
 indicated for persecution or assault in 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.840
 I change the vehicle that is in 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.879
 the list is a variant of the retina whose 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.440
 name is retina alien it is no more 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.959
 no less than the abandoned car that 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.640
 we found in area 53 and its 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.470
 particularity is that in addition to 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.300
 be painted in strange ways and 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.550
 mysterious has a UFO added to its 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.019
 roof and does not have wheels of course not 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.700
 it can be handled although it would have been 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.800
 really interesting that rockstar 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.530
 I would have implemented that function 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.849
 pony you put a van that appears 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.590
 in all the great photos from grand 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.540
 theft auto '3 although it has modified a lot 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.370
 its design with the passage of time being 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.900
 at the beginning a pretty big van and 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.120
 currently in grand theft auto 5 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.010
 a simple van is a vehicle with 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.290
 a moderate speed a resistance 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.670
 decent and a very simple design but in 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.410
 the version that interests us leads us to 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.880
 grand theft auto in liberty city â€‹â€‹stories 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.920
 it's about the pony that appears in the 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.810
 dme mission also known by the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.849
 dead meat name in Spanish that 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.099
 Send us Mrs. Ciprian and mother toni 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.810
 cipriani and in it we go to the restaurant 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.310
 and the plot takes us behind the head of 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.290
 giovanni house here we will kill 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.570
 we dismember and we will throw all the 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.280
 result if you can say that in the 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.500
 van once we're driving it 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.150
 we can see those kart parts 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.830
 as a curiosity at the end of the mission 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.810
 when we deliver that meat to one's own 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.340
 butchery of giovanni house one of the 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.230
 employees the test and says it's very 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.080
 good though you do not know that it's about 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.900
 the remains of his boss 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.580
 flassbeck is about a truck that comes out 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.439
 in the whole saga grand theft auto 'except 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.479
 in big cars and it's a vehicle with 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:41.490
 limited capabilities proper to a 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.349
 heavy truck at zero speed will be 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.240
 adds a very bad spin skill it 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.860
 it opposes a great resistance in 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.509
 change is a vehicle that has a 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.340
 good skill because in certain 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.750
 moments we can carry a load and 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.219
 this is exactly what happens in the 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.960
 mission that interests us where we can 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.729
 get the flat bed variant with 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.469
 bombs is in grand theft auto 4 the 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.419
 mission rick is your maikel blog 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:02.550
 Faustino takes care that we carry a flat 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.379
 full of explosives to a warehouse 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.909
 bojan and after thinking that it can be a 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.830
 good way to get a payment for 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.509
 Faustino we will listen to him and drive 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.729
 carefully this truck with the load 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.280
 absolutely full of explosives up 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.960
 get to the store buoys once there 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.699
 We will leave the truck and activate the 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.569
 explosives resulting in the 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.569
 destruction of the warehouse 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.110
 tribute in this fourth episode in 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.879
 eighth place we have high it is about 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.589
 some more mythical airplanes of all the saga 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:30.419
 and it has a very big peculiarity and 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.969
 is that the plane known as everything in 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:35.459
 big photo 53 is in san andreas and pai 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.229
 city â€‹â€‹we knew as corner in reality 

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:38.969
 the true everything was a small plane 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.409
 that I could barely fly a few meters in 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:42.209
 grand theft auto ' 3 and liberticidio 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.159
 stories and it is that little we tried 

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:46.319
 fly the plane that there down and 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.789
 we crashed or sank though 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:49.619
 she in san andreas and that you could catch 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.719
 a good speed instead the whole of 

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:53.490
 large photo 5 is the corner which in 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:55.259
 the fund is a modified whole for 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.999
 to be able to take off and land from the water 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.349
 which we talked about in another chapter 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:00.330
 previous we all know the 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.490
 feature is an easy seaplane 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.559
 fly and now come back big picture 5 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.860
 referring to the old plane 

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:06.860
 all 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.940
 x 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.940
 brother there are means that finally 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.610
 mothership the last place and more 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.530
 important we have one of the vehicles 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.150
 most mysterious of the whole saga is not 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.890
 It is nothing more or less than the ship 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.540
 wet vehicle that leaves only in 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.370
 grand theft auto san andreas and which 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.560
 it is a simple camper but with 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.820
 a huge amount of modifications 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.620
 unique is the vehicle of the stranger 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.940
 character known as the truck and 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.620
 we can see the mother ship in 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.840
 whatever the missions he sends us 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.220
 as for example the well-known body mission 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.900
 harvest in which we must steal a 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.090
 harvester vehicle which also 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.530
 we talked about in a previous episode the ship 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.270
 does not use is a van with a 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.130
 really low speed and a 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.420
 resistance just as badly doing that 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.340
 simply stand out for your 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.170
 aesthetic modifications a painting 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.730
 unique hippie style covers all the 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.380
 vehicle and apart from other details 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.210
 aesthetics we also observe their 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.580
 special license plate in which we read out 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.100
 here or out there in Spanish although the 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.020
 we see upside down as a curiosity if 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.640
 we hit the license plate the content of 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.770
 it will change completely if it is 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.300
 intentional or if it is a bug is already in 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.130
 the mystery well so far this 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.540
 fourth episode of rare vehicles in 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.640
 that there has been talk of nine other cars 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.560
 boats helicopters planes and 

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.490
 vans but before I say goodbye 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.990
 I would like to come back and ask you if you will see 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.550
 a contribution for the people that in 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.470
 previous episodes some of you have 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.180
 commented that vehicles that reid that 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.919
 come out and of course I've had them 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.479
 in mind but I've also seen that there 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:32.160
 some rare vehicles that you have not yet 

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:33.750
 nobody said so I encourage you from here 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.460
 to give me a comment with the 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.500
 which is for you a vehicle that 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.599
 should be in the next episode and 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.710
 may i hope you liked it and greetings 

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:43.490
 and until next time 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.490
 goodbye 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.870
 Y
