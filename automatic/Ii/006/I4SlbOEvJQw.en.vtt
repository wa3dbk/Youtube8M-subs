00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
don't know why but I think it's great

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.450 
don't know why but I think it's great
the<00:00:20.369> damage<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.300> very<00:00:21.330> good<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:23.160> rate

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the damage is very good on this the rate

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.450 
the damage is very good on this the rate
of<00:00:23.580> fire<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.210> it's<00:00:24.689> fine<00:00:24.990> for<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.529> crossbow<00:00:26.010> it's

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
of fire is it's fine for a crossbow it's

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.540 
of fire is it's fine for a crossbow it's
not<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.449> good<00:00:27.660> as<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:29.070> rate<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.400> fire

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
not as good as the the rate of fire

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.810 
not as good as the the rate of fire
isn't<00:00:29.880> as<00:00:30.000> good<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.300> where<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:34.160> here<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
isn't as good as where is it here the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.150 
isn't as good as where is it here the
rate<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.059> fire<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:37.079> better<00:00:37.469> than<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> magic

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
rate of fire is is better than the magic

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.479 
rate of fire is is better than the magic
bow<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.350> I<00:00:40.350> personally<00:00:40.739> think<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.219> should

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
bow and I personally think you should

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.889 
bow and I personally think you should
get<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.700> before<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.270> get<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> magic<00:00:42.780> bow

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
get it before you get the magic bow

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.430 
get it before you get the magic bow
because<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.890> better<00:00:44.180> you<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.440> first

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
because it's better you have to first

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.500 
because it's better you have to first
get<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> steel<00:00:47.070> bow<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.430> upgrade<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.879> twice<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
get a steel bow and upgrade it twice to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.770 
get a steel bow and upgrade it twice to
get<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.829> it's<00:00:49.829> mobility<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.340> great<00:00:50.550> um<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.449> its

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
get it it's mobility is great um and its

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.209 
get it it's mobility is great um and its
capacity<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.350> infinite<00:00:52.770> I'm<00:00:52.860> gonna<00:00:53.010> lie<00:00:53.160> it

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
capacity is infinite I'm gonna lie it

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.720 
capacity is infinite I'm gonna lie it
says<00:00:53.460> one<00:00:53.640> again<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.719> yeah<00:00:55.170> let's<00:00:55.440> go<00:00:55.559> play<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
says one again but yeah let's go play a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.040 
says one again but yeah let's go play a
survival<00:00:57.420> mode<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.649> how<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.039> works<00:01:00.050> your

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
survival mode to see how it works your

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.290 
survival mode to see how it works your
grant<00:01:01.320> you're<00:01:01.649> guaranteed<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.030> one

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
grant you're guaranteed to have a one

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.810 
grant you're guaranteed to have a one
shot<00:01:03.510> kill<00:01:03.979> using<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:07.650> first<00:01:08.010> levels

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
shot kill using this in the first levels

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.300 
shot kill using this in the first levels
of<00:01:09.119> survival<00:01:09.659> mode<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.979> get<00:01:11.070> into

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
of survival mode but as you get into

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.520 
of survival mode but as you get into
later<00:01:11.549> levels<00:01:13.490> you<00:01:14.490> won't<00:01:14.810> have<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:16.320> shot

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
later levels you won't have one shot

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.230 
later levels you won't have one shot
kills<00:01:16.830> anymore<00:01:17.250> which<00:01:17.460> makes<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.060> difficult

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
kills anymore which makes it difficult

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.530 
kills anymore which makes it difficult
to<00:01:18.689> use<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.170> survival<00:01:20.159> because<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:21.270> want<00:01:21.450> to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
to use in survival because you want to

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.020 
to use in survival because you want to
be<00:01:21.600> able<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> fast<00:01:22.290> shooting<00:01:22.860> gun<00:01:23.189> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
be able to have a fast shooting gun that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.510 
be able to have a fast shooting gun that
can<00:01:24.299> kill<00:01:24.540> everything<00:01:24.990> quickly<00:01:25.340> like<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
can kill everything quickly like the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.969 
can kill everything quickly like the
golden<00:01:26.880> redstone<00:01:27.240> cannon<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.350> autumn

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
golden redstone cannon the autumn

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.210 
golden redstone cannon the autumn
automatic<00:01:29.549> peacemaker<00:01:30.450> M<00:01:30.750> -<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.259> think<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.130> M

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
automatic peacemaker M - I think it's M

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.810 
automatic peacemaker M - I think it's M
2<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.490> M<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.610> one<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.570> two<00:01:34.220> that's<00:01:35.220> why<00:01:35.430> I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
2 or M for one of the two that's why I

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.630 
2 or M for one of the two that's why I
wouldn't<00:01:36.450> recommend<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.920> survival<00:01:38.490> as

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
wouldn't recommend this for survival as

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.490 
wouldn't recommend this for survival as
much<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.210> others<00:01:40.040> as<00:01:41.040> other<00:01:41.340> weapons<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.780> on

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
much as others as other weapons but on

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.819 
much as others as other weapons but on
the<00:01:44.009> same<00:01:44.189> note<00:01:44.270> time<00:01:45.270> survival<00:01:45.869> which<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.799> a

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
the same note time survival which is a

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.630 
the same note time survival which is a
little<00:01:47.100> bit<00:01:47.220> different<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.869> deathmatch

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
little bit different on the deathmatch

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.490 
little bit different on the deathmatch
our<00:01:50.640> cooperative<00:01:51.710> selection<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:54.079> it's<00:01:55.079> much

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
our cooperative selection it it's much

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.100 
our cooperative selection it it's much
better<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.950> use<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.820> I'd<00:01:57.110> suggest

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
better to use this for it I'd suggest

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.779 
better to use this for it I'd suggest
getting<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.619> before<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> magic<00:01:59.399> bow

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
getting this before the magic bow

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.480 
getting this before the magic bow
the<00:02:01.270> magic<00:02:01.630> bow<00:02:03.030> has<00:02:04.030> like<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:05.439> has<00:02:05.619> a<00:02:05.649> lot<00:02:06.070> less

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
the magic bow has like it has a lot less

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.919 
the magic bow has like it has a lot less
speed<00:02:07.360> of<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.659> rate<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.840> fire<00:02:08.110> plus<00:02:08.560> it's<00:02:08.920> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
speed of a rate of fire plus it's the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.540 
speed of a rate of fire plus it's the
magic<00:02:10.929> bow<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.170> can<00:02:11.530> see<00:02:11.739> here<00:02:12.129> even<00:02:12.430> when<00:02:12.519> I

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
magic bow you can see here even when I

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.080 
magic bow you can see here even when I
shoot<00:02:13.080> these<00:02:14.160> it's<00:02:15.160> doesn't<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.790> doesn't<00:02:15.940> even

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
shoot these it's doesn't it doesn't even

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.020 
shoot these it's doesn't it doesn't even
have<00:02:16.269> one<00:02:16.480> shot<00:02:16.660> kill<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.400> don't<00:02:18.670> see<00:02:18.849> how

thing<00:02:29.769> I<00:02:29.980> don't<00:02:30.040> know<00:02:30.370> why<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:31.030> when<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.420> try

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
thing I don't know why is when you try

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.070 
thing I don't know why is when you try
to<00:02:31.660> shoot<00:02:31.959> something<00:02:32.200> at<00:02:32.680> far<00:02:33.190> distance<00:02:34.080> this

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
to shoot something at far distance this

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.650 
to shoot something at far distance this
kills<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:35.980> very<00:02:36.190> quickly<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:40.239> doesn't

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
kills it very quickly and and it doesn't

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.759 
kills it very quickly and and it doesn't
the<00:02:40.930> arrow<00:02:42.329> that's<00:02:43.329> really<00:02:43.750> weird<00:02:43.959> when<00:02:44.680> you

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
the arrow that's really weird when you

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.390 
the arrow that's really weird when you
aim<00:02:44.920> for<00:02:44.950> something<00:02:45.459> in<00:02:45.579> far<00:02:45.760> distance<00:02:47.400> let's

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
aim for something in far distance let's

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.160 
aim for something in far distance let's
try<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.579> get<00:02:48.760> all<00:02:48.849> these<00:02:49.000> rounded<00:02:49.390> up<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.780> can

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
try to get all these rounded up so I can

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.830 
try to get all these rounded up so I can
get<00:02:53.170> them<00:02:53.319> towards<00:02:53.739> me<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:55.209> then<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.420> can<00:02:55.569> go

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
get them towards me and then I can go

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.819 
get them towards me and then I can go
show<00:02:56.049> you<00:02:56.110> guys<00:02:56.290> how<00:02:56.500> long-distance<00:02:57.660> works

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
show you guys how long-distance works

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:06.479 
show you guys how long-distance works
for<00:02:59.829> the<00:02:59.890> most<00:03:00.069> part<00:03:03.090> okay<00:03:05.220> try<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.280> shoot

weird thing is when you try to shoot
these<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:14.109> kills<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.590> thickness<00:03:14.920> that's<00:03:15.400> in

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670
