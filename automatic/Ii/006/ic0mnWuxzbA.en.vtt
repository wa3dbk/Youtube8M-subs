00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.140 
overall this is a great solid episode
though<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> bit<00:01:37.890> faster<00:01:38.400> pace<00:01:38.670> than<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
though it was a bit faster pace than the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.600 
though it was a bit faster pace than the
manga<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.960> manga<00:01:40.439> how<00:01:40.799> does<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.070> compare<00:01:41.310> to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
manga the manga how does this compare to

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.819 
manga the manga how does this compare to
the<00:01:42.090> manga<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.630> think<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.079> anime<00:01:43.530> has<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the manga I think this anime has the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.039 
the manga I think this anime has the
potential<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.790> better<00:01:45.149> than<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.630> manga

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
potential to be better than the manga

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.740 
potential to be better than the manga
why<00:01:46.320> because<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.189> feels<00:01:47.460> unique<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.600> like

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
why because it feels unique I just like

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.109 
why because it feels unique I just like
the<00:01:48.899> tone<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.619> more<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.369> manga<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.880> very

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the tone of it more the manga is very

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.880 
the tone of it more the manga is very
dark<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.659> gritty<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.290> sort<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.619> takes

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
dark and gritty and it sort of takes

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.710 
dark and gritty and it sort of takes
itself<00:01:53.250> too<00:01:53.399> seriously<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:54.420> anime

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
itself too seriously the anime

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.510 
itself too seriously the anime
brightened<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.140> up<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.500> art<00:01:55.680> looks<00:01:55.920> beautiful

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
brightened it up the art looks beautiful

and that's what I'm loving about this
anime<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.980> manga<00:02:15.370> kind<00:02:15.579> of<00:02:15.670> had<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.819> fist<00:02:16.209> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
anime the manga kind of had a fist the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.420 
anime the manga kind of had a fist the
North<00:02:16.569> Star<00:02:16.689> kind<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.230> feel<00:02:17.439> even<00:02:17.890> though<00:02:18.099> it

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
North Star kind of feel even though it

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.490 
North Star kind of feel even though it
is<00:02:18.459> about<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.060> bunch<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.540> high<00:02:19.750> school<00:02:20.019> kids<00:02:20.049> in

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
is about a bunch of high school kids in

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.789 
is about a bunch of high school kids in
the<00:02:20.849> 1800s<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:22.120> had<00:02:22.269> that<00:02:22.450> same<00:02:22.780> very<00:02:23.140> serious

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
the 1800s it had that same very serious

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.160 
the 1800s it had that same very serious
vibe<00:02:24.159> to<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.549> so<00:02:25.060> far<00:02:25.329> I<00:02:25.360> think<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.780> anime<00:02:26.079> is

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
vibe to it so far I think the anime is

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.289 
vibe to it so far I think the anime is
doing<00:02:26.349> an<00:02:26.409> outstanding<00:02:26.470> job<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.459> taking<00:02:27.970> the

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
doing an outstanding job of taking the

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.750 
doing an outstanding job of taking the
manga<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.930> making<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.590> something<00:02:29.859> really

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
manga and making it something really

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.460 
manga and making it something really
awesome<00:02:30.909> and<00:02:31.540> I'm<00:02:31.689> not<00:02:31.810> saying<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.140> manga<00:02:32.409> is

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
awesome and I'm not saying the manga is

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.619 
awesome and I'm not saying the manga is
bad<00:02:32.650> by<00:02:32.890> any<00:02:32.920> means<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.640> just<00:02:33.939> think<00:02:34.180> that<00:02:34.329> part

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
bad by any means I just think that part

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.530 
bad by any means I just think that part
1<00:02:34.810> phantom<00:02:35.709> blood<00:02:35.980> looks<00:02:36.579> like<00:02:36.849> it<00:02:37.060> might<00:02:37.299> turn

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
1 phantom blood looks like it might turn

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.589 
1 phantom blood looks like it might turn
out<00:02:37.599> to<00:02:37.750> be<00:02:38.079> better<00:02:38.379> in<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:39.280> anime<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.030> overall

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
out to be better in the anime so overall

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.690 
out to be better in the anime so overall
the<00:02:40.989> art<00:02:41.230> style<00:02:41.500> really<00:02:41.769> fits<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.129> story<00:02:42.370> and

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
the art style really fits the story and

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.720 
the art style really fits the story and
the<00:02:42.730> tone<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.840> action<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.650> amazing<00:02:45.459> the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
the tone the action is amazing the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.460 
the tone the action is amazing the
pacing<00:02:46.269> seems<00:02:46.540> slightly<00:02:46.780> fast<00:02:47.170> but<00:02:47.379> I<00:02:47.409> do

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
pacing seems slightly fast but I do

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.020 
pacing seems slightly fast but I do
think<00:02:47.739> it's<00:02:47.920> going<00:02:48.040> out<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> pretty<00:02:48.549> good<00:02:48.760> pace

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
think it's going out a pretty good pace

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.629 
think it's going out a pretty good pace
and<00:02:49.329> it<00:02:49.720> was<00:02:49.840> just<00:02:50.109> amazing<00:02:50.639> incredible

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
and it was just amazing incredible

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.490
