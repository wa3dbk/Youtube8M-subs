 do my curls on the video just 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.750

 I wanted to watch too so here I am 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.900
 advise you if you still want 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.759
 do you want to make you look pretty 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.740
 things but do not use given Thursday 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.439
 a tip do not use lacq no 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.400
 more access to ready the hair is that the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.229
 cuttlefish terribly 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.299
 so if you do not want to spoil a bit 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.549
 most beautiful hair especially not the 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.960
 same trick that flows from source and 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.700
 yet the tendency to think the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.170
 contrary is especially not to put 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.150
 oil on her hair when we go 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.750
 the sun it will simply 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.579
 fry 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.380
 as if you were frying french fries 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.659
 in the water here you warm up 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.990
 him it borders the chips and well it's 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.880
 the same bad things 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.740
 the sun may heat the oil and 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.229
 totally fits you burn your leather 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.060
 the hair so especially no oil when 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.869
 you are at random you go to the sea or 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.610
 at the swimming pool 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.840
 try not to soak your hair 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.369
 in the water I know that sometimes it's 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.110
 difficult especially if you like 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.850
 soul too do you like diving etc 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.580
 if it really is a temptation that is 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.380
 too strong for you attach them especially 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.060
 if you are at sea ​​because with the 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.840
 sand you have all who you want 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.030
 in the head 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.830
 the hair really at the party and the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.870
 straw really is bankruptcy 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.610
 obliged to cut them and at the same time if 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.280
 you want to let that tie 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.380
 that salt it sand especially 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.850
 agglutinate to the roots and that 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.560
 even the woman at grade my head and sam 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.989
 have slaughtered the hair and the same for 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.580
 the clar 600 attached even though the water 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.650
 will penetrate anyway but ten years 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.420
 how did you do you had 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.950
 intend to protect them you 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.319
 tie your tuques by the way if you 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.760
 are blonde may be going to be remember 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.870
 something to a girlfriend to me I know 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.459
 not if she will see this video 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.900
 but if you are bank pay attention 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.700
 with the club because your hair 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.680
 can turn green 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.200
 so then it will be necessary to wash them well 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.510
 to re raise all there and that I 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.280
 find their natural white so do 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.660
 pay attention to the same advice I you 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.910
 advise to wash the games 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.160
 directly on the way back from the beach 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.079
 the pool to evacuate knows it the 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.280
 pollution the chlorine whatever can there 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.350
 have in your hair and do not have that 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.209
 this sacred sword penetrates the hair and 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.380
 that it spoiled them so the melee 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.640
 directly like that you are 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.079
 quiet is not the head 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.030
 scrape light and your hair 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.260
 restaurant pretty much this month and 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.209
 clubs this even though I do not advise 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.590
 to put oil in alain outside I 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.239
 nevertheless advise you to make 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.730
 masks which confreres masks to 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.350
 oil brings you some on 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.500
 my blog i put you the link bar 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.570
 in particular coconut oil and 2005 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.210
 sweet almond oil I put you all 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.980
 at the info bar and here you are doing 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.930
 a mask so you put on the 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.190
 steps not on the steps on the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.260
 rations because otherwise you're going to have 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.790
 trend by choice is your choice and in 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.870
 more for so in general that we 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.520
 happens at least two or three fields 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.550
 points so it's a little con end no 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.230
 you put that on the ends damaged golden 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.540
 hair and then you can do 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.070
 heat a towel in the micro dress 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.600
 to be explosive do not fire 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.760
 it's not like me think like a 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.230
 family yes you emit my corner you 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.550
 heat it a bit crumpled or 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.959
 love bind you heat up 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.480
 quickly we will not take long and 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.950
 then fly away with your head 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.730
 allow the hair to open its 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.220
 scales and really suck drink in 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.440
 made oils and even it the 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.239
 so reinforces no need to stay any 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.350
 the night with a mask it serves 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.269
 strictly for nothing because once 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.700
 that he saw he drank so me I you 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.919
 advises between 15 minutes 30 minutes 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.720
 really an hour at the most but 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.360
 after longer you leave a lot longer 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.430
 with hard to actually remove the oil in 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.660
 the hair and 1 and in addition it will not be 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.580
 not necessarily more effective 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.530
 So here half an hour an hour 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.090
 maximum and then we like a status a 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.620
 trick is to not agree to 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.350
 course milk hair is not so 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.970
 use a turban a scarf made of 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.370
 pretty things with your hair you have 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.229
 make a video like us and a scarf 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.970
 in Mongrain turban my hair he was 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.710
 still let go wanted to go back to 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.700
 inside there is a lot of hairdressing 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.470
 besides, I would propose it to you 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.060
 soon with accessories your father 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.820
 is attached to her hair and 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.830
 protect from the sun from the wind of the 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.750
 chlorine of the crazy clan because we did not have 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.700
 not even garden you sell in the 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.250
 pool but in any case that's it and that 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.780
 it will protect them they are suddenly seen 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.200
 they are quiet and nobody 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.240
 bothers 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.310
 so I'll propose his rapier finally 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.710
 last tip there are sprays in 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.390
 specialized supermarkets for the 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.490
 protection 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.350
 hair in the sun I know it exists 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.360
 but I never used because in 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.900
 general to dance this loan even in the 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.190
 oils etc 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.690
 there is always a little alcohol and I 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.580
 I'm suspicious because the alcohol is dry 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.140
 after they say it's done for that 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.930
 so I think it should work 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.150
 but I do not know at all, so if you have 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.530

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.520

 pleasure and nocioni will be very happy 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.900
 back to school not to be cut 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.370
 despite everything I advise you anyway 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.750
 to go regularly very regularly 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.640
 I advise you to go to 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.280
 less every two years at the hairdresser 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.790
 to cut the tips so that 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.410
 that the turn leaves nicely and with a 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.640
 good health and that is because before 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.320
 long hair is pretty but if they are
