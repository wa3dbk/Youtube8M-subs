00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:10.250
 It's about Power Village, and only two more 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.440
 It is called advice 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.900
 I would like to do that 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:23.310
 It is such a place Hmm 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:25.240
 This Toreboro is entered in there become two 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.760
 There is no woman's sky 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.490
 If there is a unique break 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.329
 This is positive 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:38.260
 Let's think that it is a quick one after having entered four in three or more 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.140
 Colonial go I'd have people this is a completely tune 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 7 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.359
 You'd better go it is the reverse Nan slowly 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.359
 That's why I listen hard 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.410
 Yeah not'm so but is Jan Atten 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.410
 Nua 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.630
 It 's already a place to go to here 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.390
 I want it so 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:11.360
 In it and try to pull myself doing actually so um 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:16.220
 The song is so yeah it always makes that reaction 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.600
 Pull and are pulling fast and burn something and have heard but the person might feel good 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.260
 It sounds like it 's burning 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.510
 This must be taken care of 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.510
 In the end I occupy this song 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.690
 It is the next 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.140
 Unexpectedly everyone, this is a bad balance 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.020
 Just look at your right hand 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.990
 Though it is the same even with normal arpeggio 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:48.770
 The Tteyuu when the movement and the country in pima and order is 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:55.050
 Boob with your finger 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:57.560
 Nja without it it's made me sound simply by rotating the left wrist 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.689
 Actually 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.840
 The finger hits and the nail hits and rotates as it is 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.659
 It is all right 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.659
 I will come out with this 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.390
 Just rotating 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:22.700
 Wow 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:25.480
 As a commander of the head, I have to say 12 strikeouts and 4 times some 4th floor with this, but this is 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.480
 I will be filled 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.550
 I will use it at the very end, but I have some tips for that 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.510
 one two Three 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.170
 It is rotating as usual until here 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.190
 Pong from the bottom to the top 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.170
 Raise You 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.830
 Hmm 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.400
 ame 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.640
 It's really good balance of went so 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.640
 Yup 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:03:00.180
 The last thing is that-it is the same thing as now, but if you do more then just talk it over with this 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.689
 If there is a sound 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:10.580
 At this time, I just talk not by myself with fingers I just talk while rotating 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:14.030
 Only this time talking to without rotating Te 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.080
 It may not be anything, but the song is also a cell 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:22.050
 It's Tokoro important also 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:25.390
 That because it is left to the impression at the end also came, no matter how good things Well Aborigines and 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.520
 In particular, this song is I of the side 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.360
 This balance is by all means 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.630
 If you want to get 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.630
 is
