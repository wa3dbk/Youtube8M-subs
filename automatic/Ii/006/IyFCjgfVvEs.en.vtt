00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.460
 It's interesting for the car business 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.510
 The main theme is that it is fun 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.720
 Yes, what should we do to do it? 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.339
 And 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.789
 What kind of knowledge is necessary and practical 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.779
 I also distribute things from the regular used car business 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.120
 It was aztec 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.189
 When I say what it means 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.429
 Car things 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.669
 There is also a homeroom black business. 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.150
 Not as a really basic professional 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.339
 If there is any such thing please take care of it 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.820
 Well 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.990
 It's a real example in this way 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.940
 About this 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.150
 I did it in such a way, and usually it was almost as light 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.300
 Big Car Exhibition 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 The story that there was much in this car 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.320
 I would like to see this kind of Fukui prefecture in the Hokuriku countryside 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.420
 Though 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.070
 I went to Nagoya University from the previous work and studied in the United States 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.100
 Did 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.640
 Well, I came back and it was about the bubble burst 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.060
 I went back and covered my original work 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.650
 I finished the job of US trade though 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.369
 By chance it takes a job on the car 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.480
 I entered the world of the previous car 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.880
 That is the story of that export please tell me 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.700
 come 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.780
 After the tea 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.050
 Starting with the plan I will give you various teaching materials 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:19.810
 Shit 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.410
 I say that such a seminar 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.480
 There is no way to say that there are 6.4 million units of manners being exported 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.500
 In addition, the country is excavated to 11/3 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.370
 From the United States 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.040
 Continued recruitment of auction sites in the UK is a so-called professional contractor 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.690
 Mr. 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.920
 So that each auction 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.340
 It is a place where you can not enter or leave unless you are a registered company 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.270
 x here 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.270
 Gulliver Circle is also so, but Toyopet 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.780
 Even if you bought it from the customers 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.540
 Should I sell it? 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.330
 I think there is a fast discussion 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.290
 Selling a car must have some credit 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.780
 So in that sense 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.840
 Compete with information companies on the internet 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.520
 It's not enough for pdf by pdf 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.569
 I have improved but I say this 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.569
 Deploy the car 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.309
 Here is the hood 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:20.249
 When there is a front center, everyone says that Okano assessment 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:21.749
 Can also be imagined 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.749
 Or try to split the car frame 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.969
 -Look at the state 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.950
 I think the big thing is to decide the price 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.229
 Well turned 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:33.969
 For example, if you want a high ace 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.579
 I'm thinking but in fact 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.879
 If you listen carefully to that story, you will reflect on it separately 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:40.649
 Not 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:44.039
 If only one point was taken for the evil way simply because the family increased a little 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.699
 When it comes to saying good 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.249
 However, I can not get one point even if I say it now 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:53.989
 Even if I'm jumping in, it's said that I came as something coming 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.829
 The story is written as buying 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.989
 It is the beginning 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.069
 Actually this is also a good question 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.159
 I hope this can be repaired 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.879
 Because it was hand, but was said to be repair history 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.669
 1 part market is a thousand- 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:11.680
 Have you 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.769
 No sense 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.129
 Closer done br 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.450
 Start with a format that has earned more than 50 sheets 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.230
 If it is that 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.549
 No molding at Okayama 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.269
 I do a good bus 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.069
 2 please use the bus well but I use my own 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.849
 is not it 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.019
 Really inter-trader at the beginning of this February 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:37.559
 Because it is empty 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.539
 But this is also true 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.839
 Objected against another company 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:47.159
 Ten thousand yen two months in the minimum one month 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.199
 One hundred thirty-one thousand yen Three months three hundred ninety-two thousand yen 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.199
 I'm starting to turn around from about four months 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.499
 There is no doubt that Ariakehama 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:57.500
 to go well 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.819
 Being asked 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.659
 It's a model, but if he goes on he will lie down before going to bed 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.339
 Hand new service 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:07.099
 Of a new sense 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.880
 Let's aim at a wheelchair 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.840
 Production level
