 hello people and welcome to the next 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.429
 tutorial and this time shows you how you are 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.830
 your own wow private server 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.179
 which is then located on the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.029
 stood from version 1.12 point one, then 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.220
 classic wow and there of course 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.119
 first the things from the video 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.359
 description and the pact ii and herzl 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.730
 partie first in the luggage is 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:38.600
 on the server inside and the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:41.850
 database are packed then exactly 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:46.710
 double click on it and yes it was 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.280
 the server and the mangos folder and there 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.920
 then we have the v maps and the maps 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.399
 Run and pack the windows away 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.399
 down 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.980
 and just unzip it into the folder 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.480
 there also sees the dwc folder that is the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:21.950
 database and you do the same with the 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:25.460
 Also easy to move in and out of tree apps 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.920
 unpack a foul that a bit 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.920
 longer because it is bigger file 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.180
 so drives 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.180
 I think that has 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.350
 you go first the server folder and 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.350
 starts the mysql file 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.909
 and against mangos and then you start 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:08.340
 first conductor 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:11.430
 and then the mangos file exe and the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.830
 Mango's detail is the server started 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.260
 Now it's all over there 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.549
 database and everything load must puke 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.549
 maps and so on 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.060
 so and then you create one 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.920
 account with account create and then 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.880
 just name my name and just 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.880
 change the password 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 enter and then another go contra 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.560
 would want to make account zgm level 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.520
 then in account name then 3 the highest 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.070
 So, from the game master and 11 stands 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.660
 for the grooves if ever 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.660
 have several guys 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.400
 if you have three writes then have 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.210
 her the full GM rights look 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.210
 fight 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.860
 a password 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.920
 English and then I will too 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.510
 forwarded on the mangos and 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.160
 make our do someday 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:38.300
 Character not such a nice hairstyle 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:42.500
 it did not matter if it was directly level 60 wise 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.970
 it is a gm account if now if 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.500
 If we do not get a gamer now , then 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.580
 would of course be level 1 and needed more 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.270
 do not do it for your own 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.180
 private server and then you have 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:59.270
 of course now the following gm rights and 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.120
 who also left a link to one 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.120
 time with the whole gm command purely pack 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.950
 So in the description 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.470
 if you have any questions then report 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.320
 simply by private message or 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.150
 just below in the comments and 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.840
 wish you much fun in front of your own 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.840
 private server
