ok so now we can get it this is the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.859 
ok so now we can get it this is the
device<00:01:02.359> or<00:01:03.359> start<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> back<00:01:05.689> we<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
device or start at the back we have a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
I hope the performance will be good we

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.350 
I hope the performance will be good we
have<00:01:12.210> audio<00:01:13.369> output<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.610> suppose

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.950 
output there seems to be a fan and
neutral<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:31.130> will<00:01:32.130> check<00:01:32.310> later<00:01:32.570> another<00:01:33.570> USB

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
neutral I will check later another USB

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.950 
neutral I will check later another USB
port<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.650> SD<00:01:35.579> card<00:01:35.970> port

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.810 

one<00:01:39.960> at<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.200> front<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.740> get<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.040> IR<00:01:41.370> receiver

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
one at the front we get the IR receiver

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.350 
one at the front we get the IR receiver
a<00:01:42.030> power<00:01:42.630> button<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:44.370> we<00:01:44.760> can't<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.150> here

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
a power button and we we can't see here

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.630 
a power button and we we can't see here
but<00:01:45.540> they're<00:01:45.750> also<00:01:45.930> HD<00:01:46.560> display<00:01:46.980> if<00:01:47.490> I

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
but they're also HD display if I

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.110 
but they're also HD display if I
remember<00:01:48.060> correctly<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.920> display<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> time

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:05.690 

okay<00:02:02.900> so<00:02:03.900> on<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.080> talk<00:02:04.260> to<00:02:04.440> have<00:02:04.560> some<00:02:04.800> QR

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
okay so on the talk to have some QR

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.060 
okay so on the talk to have some QR
codes<00:02:08.660> here<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:10.050> download<00:02:10.410> some<00:02:10.619> apps<00:02:10.800> for

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
codes here to download some apps for

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.400 
codes here to download some apps for
iPhone<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.730> Android<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:12.420> guess<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.140> remote

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
iPhone and Android I guess is a remote
