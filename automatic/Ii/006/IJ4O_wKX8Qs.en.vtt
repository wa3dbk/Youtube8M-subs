00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
via bluetooth it actually opens up an

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.760 
via bluetooth it actually opens up an

this<00:02:57.389> rocket<00:02:58.169> launcher<00:02:58.530> via<00:02:58.829> bluetooth<00:02:59.400> and

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
this rocket launcher via bluetooth and

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.680 
this rocket launcher via bluetooth and
you<00:03:00.450> use<00:03:00.810> your<00:03:01.260> iPad<00:03:01.650> or

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
you use your iPad or

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.130 
you use your iPad or
you<00:03:03.870> turn<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.200> down<00:03:04.440> your<00:03:05.160> iPad<00:03:05.550> or<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:08.000> I

your iPhone and like I said up now left

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.530 
your iPhone and like I said up now left
or<00:03:15.360> right<00:03:16.100> I'm<00:03:17.100> imagining<00:03:17.460> if<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:18.030> had<00:03:18.240> an

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
or right I'm imagining if I had an

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.080 
or right I'm imagining if I had an
iphone<00:03:18.690> here<00:03:19.140> set<00:03:19.410> up<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.770> show<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:20.070> this<00:03:20.310> that

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
iphone here set up to show you this that

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.050 
iphone here set up to show you this that
would<00:03:21.240> actually<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:24.480> would<00:03:24.630> actually<00:03:26.060> work

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
would actually it would actually work

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.440 
would actually it would actually work
better<00:03:28.130> easier<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.310> control<00:03:29.490> with<00:03:30.000> an<00:03:30.180> actual

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
better easier to control with an actual

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.380 
better easier to control with an actual
iphone<00:03:30.710> so<00:03:31.710> anyway<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.310> is<00:03:32.550> by<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.790> little

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
iphone so anyway this is by a little

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.840 
iphone so anyway this is by a little
demo<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.960> the<00:03:34.770> dream<00:03:35.400> cheeky<00:03:37.340> from<00:03:38.340> brand<00:03:38.700> new
