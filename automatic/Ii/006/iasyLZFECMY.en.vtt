00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.700 
it up the test will be 43 questions two
of<00:00:55.890> those<00:00:56.010> will<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.280> essay<00:00:57.120> questions<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.840> say

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
of those will be essay questions I say

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.040 
of those will be essay questions I say
Si<00:00:59.129> loosely<00:00:59.969> because<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.570> know<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:00.930> not

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
Si loosely because you know it's not

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.370 
Si loosely because you know it's not
long<00:01:01.579> but<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.789> will<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.080> free<00:01:04.830> response

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
long but that will be of a free response

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.870 
long but that will be of a free response
there<00:01:07.380> are<00:01:07.500> two<00:01:07.710> matching<00:01:08.189> sections<00:01:08.670> where

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
there are two matching sections where

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.600 
there are two matching sections where
I'll<00:01:09.000> give<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.330> diagrams<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.770> diagram<00:01:11.369> of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
I'll give you diagrams one diagram of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
I'll give you diagrams one diagram of
the<00:01:11.700> eye<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> brain<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.409> you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the eye and one of the brain and you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.810 
the eye and one of the brain and you
will<00:01:14.070> need<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.250> match<00:01:14.880> up<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.119> parts<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:17.130> then

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
will need to match up the parts and then

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.450 
will need to match up the parts and then
also<00:01:18.600> some<00:01:18.810> true<00:01:19.229> false<00:01:19.470> questions<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
also some true false questions on the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.740 
also some true false questions on the
function<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.869> brain<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.759> that's<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
function of the brain so that's the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.640 
function of the brain so that's the
breakdown<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.409> 43<00:01:26.280> questions<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.530> tried<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
breakdown of the 43 questions I tried to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.440 
breakdown of the 43 questions I tried to
break<00:01:29.280> down<00:01:29.460> all<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> content<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.240> we've

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
break down all the content that we've

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.080 
break down all the content that we've
covered<00:01:30.720> over<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> last<00:01:31.320> few<00:01:32.189> weeks<00:01:32.430> into

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
covered over the last few weeks into

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.819 
covered over the last few weeks into
some<00:01:33.630> major<00:01:34.380> areas<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.090> here

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
some major areas that you can see here

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.380 
some major areas that you can see here
first<00:01:37.829> one<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.430> organization<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
first one is the organization of the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.130 
first one is the organization of the
nervous<00:01:39.780> system<00:01:41.150> you<00:01:42.150> know<00:01:42.240> very<00:01:42.270> generally

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
nervous system you know very generally

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.139 
nervous system you know very generally
that's<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.770> central<00:01:44.220> nervous<00:01:44.250> system<00:01:44.909> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
that's the central nervous system and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.539 
that's the central nervous system and
the<00:01:45.329> peripheral<00:01:45.750> nervous<00:01:45.869> system<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:47.460> will

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the peripheral nervous system you will

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.280 
the peripheral nervous system you will
need<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.970> know<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:49.530> parts<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.250> each<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.290> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
need to know the parts of each and the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.920 
need to know the parts of each and the
functions<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.979> each<00:01:53.430> central<00:01:54.329> nervous<00:01:54.509> system

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
functions of each central nervous system

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.569 
functions of each central nervous system
is<00:01:55.049> pretty<00:01:55.350> straightforward<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.100> said<00:01:56.310> bring

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
is pretty straightforward you said bring

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.910 
is pretty straightforward you said bring
in<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.790> spinal<00:01:57.060> cord<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.290> processing

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
in the spinal cord and it's a processing

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.560 
in the spinal cord and it's a processing
center<00:01:59.100> peripheral<00:01:59.700> nervous<00:01:59.909> system<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.540> a

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
center peripheral nervous system is a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.500 
center peripheral nervous system is a
little<00:02:00.630> bit<00:02:00.930> more<00:02:01.140> complicated<00:02:02.450> it's<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
little bit more complicated it's the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.880 
little bit more complicated it's the
the<00:02:04.810> cranial<00:02:05.380> nerves<00:02:06.930> peripheral<00:02:07.930> nerves<00:02:08.170> but

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
the cranial nerves peripheral nerves but

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.469 
the cranial nerves peripheral nerves but
then<00:02:09.010> you<00:02:09.100> have<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.369> afferent<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.240> efferent

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
then you have the afferent and efferent

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.680 
then you have the afferent and efferent
system<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:12.060> autonomic<00:02:13.060> nervous<00:02:15.690> system

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
system and the autonomic nervous system

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
system and the autonomic nervous system
or<00:02:16.870> autonomic<00:02:17.710> response<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.730> then

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
or autonomic response and then

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.220 
or autonomic response and then
involuntary<00:02:20.710> response<00:02:21.490> as<00:02:21.760> well<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.900> lecture

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230

the<00:02:28.750> neurological<00:02:29.710> support<00:02:30.100> cells<00:02:30.480> these<00:02:31.480> are

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
the neurological support cells these are

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.540 
the neurological support cells these are
the<00:02:31.690> glial<00:02:31.990> cells<00:02:32.910> including<00:02:34.590> astrocytes<00:02:35.590> and

the glial cells including astrocytes and

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.640 
the glial cells including astrocytes and
there's<00:02:37.510> four<00:02:37.780> of<00:02:37.810> them<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.260> just<00:02:38.470> need<00:02:38.590> to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
there's four of them so just need to

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.300 
there's four of them so just need to
look<00:02:38.770> them<00:02:38.950> up<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.250> know<00:02:39.310> what<00:02:39.460> they<00:02:39.580> do<00:02:39.640> and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
look them up and know what they do and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.490 
look them up and know what they do and
their<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.610> know<00:02:42.640> their<00:02:42.730> function<00:02:43.440> then<00:02:44.440> we

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
their you know their function then we

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.300 
their you know their function then we
move<00:02:44.650> on<00:02:44.770> to<00:02:44.800> neurons<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.830> hope<00:02:47.830> he's<00:02:48.010> waking

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
move on to neurons and hope he's waking

move on to neurons and hope he's waking
up<00:02:48.400> here<00:02:48.960> now<00:02:49.960> you<00:02:50.020> say<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.500> didn't<00:02:50.830> wait<00:02:54.990> the

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
up here now you say I didn't wait the

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:11.240 
up here now you say I didn't wait the
the<00:02:58.959> neurons<00:03:02.940> excuse<00:03:03.940> me<00:03:04.090> for<00:03:04.240> a<00:03:04.480> moment<00:03:04.630> here

you know all the parts like I said would

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.180 
you know all the parts like I said would
be<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.610> labeling<00:04:30.970> section<00:04:31.390> and<00:04:31.510> then<00:04:32.320> you'll<00:04:33.100> be

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
be a labeling section and then you'll be

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.480 
be a labeling section and then you'll be
able<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.370> need<00:04:33.640> to<00:04:33.700> be<00:04:33.790> able<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.030> trace<00:04:34.540> the
