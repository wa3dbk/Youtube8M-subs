00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.850
 if i have my create there 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.990
 autoblog the employee a lot of fun 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.390
 wooden shed 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.890
 exquisitely pointed out what is that one 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.350
 screen 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.180
 yes everyone and drive and we 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.310
 just still never lifted 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.950
 I've been a few times 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.320
 jesus 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.930
 never call on the circuit i am 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.600
 had never been on the hour it went there 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.220
 through one time what to do or how 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.780
 a nice wooden do so we have 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.500
 arranged hey 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.120
 from peugeot rcz and I could borrow more 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.570
 I also arranged that Kevin 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.940
 abbring 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.720
 yes some fire might be known for 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.180
 performance it 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.270
 the rally championship yes there is 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.580
 a few 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.860
 Edible tips on how we get there 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.080
 a bit quick about that ring, so 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.250
 yes we are going to do that 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.480
 but I 'll tell you something about the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.840
 car knows that will do 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.640
 so that is the peugeot rcz r and very good 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.500
 that is the peugeot rcz that we already have 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.410
 but with a few nice tweaks 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.010
 normal rcz is available with maximum 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.170
 200 hp and is nice though 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.260
 we also don't get very hot from the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.520
 there is and that has two 170 horsepower and thanks 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.180
 no longer close to what i like 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.490
 find 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.040
 point it out and simply nominate you 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.190
 it already recommends the kind of challenges 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.200
 to get that bekase on the road 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.869
 and therefore just decided to show up in this 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.110
 car by its differential 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.729
 to build in and yes that way on the 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.140
 I had a candle on the road and me 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.140
 must say that it works pretty well 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.729
 you feel the thing work because yes you 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.640
 involves eight well on the gas a 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.460
 little back and forth but now you will be there 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.679
 With a they can have fun piece of exercise 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.299
 75 what do I think if the normal houses move 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.679
 Of course the he has to say about order 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.180
 a piece of 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.069
 we driver on the wall we went 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.260
 sit and just car that just really 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.640
 very nice but very nice balance 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.200
 and sit 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.030
 but she can sport something custom 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.250
 chassis which makes me just van 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.760
 tight on the road 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.950
 yes it 's just a great candidate on 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.350
 those hours went council they know 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.330
 capsule chain and then he goes first 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.340
 just show you how 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.740
 He throws you down next to him and then 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.150
 we change seats and I agree 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.270
 let's see if i'm a better one myself 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.270
 can 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.959
 boys the cube they happen only thing 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.520
 Kevin arrives in other cars 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:57.090
 what we were working on 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:57.090
 great 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.799
 No 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.810
 Oh 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.650
 salvage all useful tips 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.340
 when 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.900
 and then 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.420
 I had a little bit 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.330
 following links is inside to one 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.080
 overdressed 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.080
 remain my third 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.270
 i'm in here okay 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.150
 his name 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.150
 so one 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:44.779
 not 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.779
 let me rest forest 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.800
 loose link also nice 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:56.789
 it is expensive 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.530
 a 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:02.819
 don't let her anymore 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.330
 to lean 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.560
 we take 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.560
 We want our under 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.140
 our in the zone 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.350
 as the girl's landmark pitchers 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.350
 a few logical reasons 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.480
 now in 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:47.260
 so yes 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.260
 also 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.890
 i would like one 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.810
 my by one 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.190
 wijnegem 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.250
 the provider 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.250
 No 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.580
 the 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.010
 no the all the way in 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:21.860
 when we have new services vlogs 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.169
 but very bold much it is about one 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.939
 opportunity provider 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.939
 you must mention mail 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:41.360
 on the way back thanks kevin 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.219
 was fun I definitely want to be fun 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.860
 Do it more often in the quite few times 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:47.089
 can be found on that great circuit 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.740
 if you were also very enthusiastic 

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:50.599
 become from various there is a day 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.400
 nothing with proposals or so there falls or 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:55.220
 car 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.180
 then you have to pay over 27,000 euros to that 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.180
 the darkness no 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.300
 I knocked again and think to do 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:03.520
 then it went down along nicely 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:08.439
 go with the powders every time 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:10.150
 top and also some whining anyway 

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:11.860
 well 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.839
 this is french car so we know that 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.849
 with build quality and such a big deal 

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:17.650
 berries but this car has something more 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:20.889
 than 3,000 km counter 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:22.900
 and the logo from my seat 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:26.589
 passenger 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.999
 but the vulture is unloaded 

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:29.999
 that is not necessarily very solid 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:34.360
 another thing that back seat 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.529
 they could as well have gone 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:41.110
 leave only pounds and the pass 

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:44.560
 nobody on unless a person knows without 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.980
 legs and head then I come very bad 

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.360
 different 

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.390
 may of course not be nice for that 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.310
 your labradors that far that case 

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:55.550
 perfect on the would not have any children 

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.930
 but to which also the FSR met 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.470
 show doesn't care 

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.470
 away from faith
