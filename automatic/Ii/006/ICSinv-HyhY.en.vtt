are<00:00:00.450> you<00:00:00.539> doing<00:00:00.870> okay<00:00:01.860> just<00:00:02.100> introduce<00:00:02.550> NetCam

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.380 
are you doing okay just introduce NetCam

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.230 
are you doing okay just introduce NetCam
2.0<00:00:04.380> it's<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.160> little<00:00:05.400> departure<00:00:05.940> from<00:00:06.120> the

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
2.0 it's a little departure from the

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:42.160 
2.0 it's a little departure from the
previous<00:00:06.390> game<00:00:16.130> this<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.310> friend

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.840 

now<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:43.890> no<00:00:44.100> reason<00:00:44.310> to<00:00:44.460> doing<00:00:44.760> this

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
now it's really no reason to doing this

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.340 
now it's really no reason to doing this
other<00:00:45.090> than<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> take<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.050> put<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.230> on

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
other than to take this and put it on

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.510 
other than to take this and put it on
eBay<00:00:46.739> but

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.740 

giving<00:00:52.520> us<00:00:52.640> a<00:00:52.700> little<00:00:52.850> place<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.330> place<00:00:53.540> our

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
giving us a little place to place our

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.430 
giving us a little place to place our
super<00:00:54.140> clamp

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.770 

what<00:00:56.739> we've<00:00:56.859> done<00:00:57.039> with<00:00:57.100> that<00:00:57.430> camp<00:00:57.699> 2.0<00:00:58.420> is

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
what we've done with that camp 2.0 is

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.350 
what we've done with that camp 2.0 is
maybe<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.559> smaller<00:00:59.920> plant<00:01:00.399> assembly<00:01:00.910> he

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
maybe the smaller plant assembly he

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:23.120 
maybe the smaller plant assembly he
doesn't<00:01:01.660> have<00:01:01.750> a<00:01:01.870> long<00:01:02.050> stitch

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.950 

good<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.710> that's<00:01:26.710> one<00:01:27.039> major<00:01:27.219> change<00:01:27.960> with

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
good so that's one major change with

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.520 
good so that's one major change with
NetCam<00:01:29.350> 2.0<00:01:30.840> she's<00:01:31.840> going<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.049> get<00:01:32.140> it<00:01:32.259> started

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
NetCam 2.0 she's going to get it started

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.320 
NetCam 2.0 she's going to get it started
here<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.380> rough<00:01:35.560> position

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.390 

what<00:01:38.930> we've<00:01:39.110> done<00:01:39.260> is<00:01:39.440> we've<00:01:39.620> inverted<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.220> L

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
what we've done is we've inverted the L

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.600 
what we've done is we've inverted the L
in<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.820> old<00:01:40.940> net<00:01:41.240> camp<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:42.290> threequel<00:01:42.800> 3/8

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
in the old net camp the threequel 3/8

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.300 
in the old net camp the threequel 3/8
inch<00:01:43.880> polycarbonate<00:01:44.300> would<00:01:45.110> comprise<00:01:46.010> the

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
inch polycarbonate would comprise the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.250 
inch polycarbonate would comprise the
front<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:46.760> the<00:01:46.880> net<00:01:47.030> camp<00:01:47.300> now<00:01:47.930> what<00:01:48.080> we've

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
front of the net camp now what we've

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.620 
front of the net camp now what we've
done<00:01:48.290> is<00:01:48.470> we've<00:01:48.770> inverted<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.370> L<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:50.450> we've

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
done is we've inverted the L and we've

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.740 
done is we've inverted the L and we've
got<00:01:50.890> simple<00:01:51.890> one-eighth<00:01:52.400> inch<00:01:52.640> as<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.510> front

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
got simple one-eighth inch as the front

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.540 
got simple one-eighth inch as the front
panel<00:01:54.140> it's<00:01:54.800> a<00:01:54.860> little<00:01:55.100> bit<00:01:55.220> more<00:01:55.400> inexpensive

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
panel it's a little bit more inexpensive

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.910 
panel it's a little bit more inexpensive
easier<00:01:58.550> to<00:01:58.880> achieve<00:01:59.150> these<00:01:59.660> pieces<00:01:59.990> out<00:02:00.290> than

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
easier to achieve these pieces out than

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.190 
easier to achieve these pieces out than
changing<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.550> whole<00:02:01.700> body<00:02:02.090> of<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.360> NetCam

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
changing the whole body of the NetCam

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.530 
changing the whole body of the NetCam
itself<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:04.790> other<00:02:04.850> thing<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:05.240> you'll<00:02:05.510> see

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
itself the other thing that you'll see

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.440 
itself the other thing that you'll see
is<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:06.590> clamp<00:02:06.950> now<00:02:07.100> goes<00:02:07.370> on<00:02:07.730> the<00:02:07.850> back<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:08.330> the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
is the clamp now goes on the back of the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.810 
is the clamp now goes on the back of the
net<00:02:08.630> camp<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.679> what<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:10.040> does<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.550> that

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
net camp and what that does is that

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.090 
net camp and what that does is that
provides<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.750> little<00:02:12.050> bit<00:02:12.200> extra<00:02:12.440> safety<00:02:12.770> for

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
provides a little bit extra safety for

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.890 
provides a little bit extra safety for
the<00:02:13.190> players<00:02:13.490> that<00:02:14.210> they<00:02:14.390> don't<00:02:14.600> slide

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
the players that they don't slide

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.720 
the players that they don't slide
underneath<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.770> hit<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.370> all<00:02:16.550> the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
underneath and hit it to all the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.390 
underneath and hit it to all the
clamping<00:02:17.150> mechanisms<00:02:17.810> we've<00:02:18.800> got<00:02:18.950> two<00:02:19.130> holes

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
clamping mechanisms we've got two holes

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.210 
clamping mechanisms we've got two holes
choose<00:02:19.880> from<00:02:20.500> we're<00:02:21.500> just<00:02:21.709> gonna<00:02:21.800> pick<00:02:22.010> this

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
choose from we're just gonna pick this
