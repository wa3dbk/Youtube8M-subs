00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.150
 to me 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.340
 how are you welcome to a new video 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.960
 and good guys this time we are 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.790
 back with something I did not do since 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.930
 a long time ago and it is the revised of 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.730
 something because the day I bring you what is the 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.930
 revised of three modern houses and then 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.849
 I think they are very small because 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.439
 reals are small but good before 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.380
 continue I want to tell you that this is 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.329
 very strange but your company the night in 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.599
 creative and I do not know how the hell this happened 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.890
 but minecraft witchcraft in order to see 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.200
 here you can see that we have three 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.489
 houses but every house was designed was 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.810
 made by youtuber saying from the 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.520
 description left what is the channel of 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.170
 every house of youtuber so 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.300
 we'll start with this little house boys 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.769
 I leave with this one and this one and then I think that 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.750
 this can serve more or less for the 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.489
 people who want to be their house these houses 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.440
 more that more or less as an example to 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.730
 continue so that you can then 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.899
 make them bigger or that is then 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.969
 in the description you have the link of 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.390
 download and we'll start with this by 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.789
 here 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.289
 ok we just removed this very quickly and 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.730
 well for this part we have a house 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.129
 which is very small because as I say 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.870
 They are small but modern houses and 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.920
 this term of modern house uses it 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.839
 youtuber much it called that 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.580
 rallies that basically does the review 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.140
 good map did not work but it does 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.430
 constructions everything so then in the 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.230
 description that one left here can 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.200
 see that we have this house that was made 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.939
 by blood 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.710
 and on the outside you can see that 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.780
 we have something very beautiful and this is 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.969
 like a pond for ducks that you can 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.770
 see what we can put so let's say 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.229
 ducks or I do not really know but we can 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.939
 put a few chickens or cows 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.649
 Now it's because the cows do not 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.539
 like and well then now I just saw 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.250
 that we have a very nice little tree and the 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.319
 house can see that it is very small but 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.149
 It has a very nice design that really 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.829
 I loved it is very simple but 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.149
 just very well done so for 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.520
 Here you can see that we have a little more 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.049
 of water some flowers we enter and 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.330
 can see that we have a very space 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.740
 reduced but if it fits well all 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.420
 believe me you look very pretty so 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.490
 well in the description you do not have go 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.560
 with the next house that remembers that 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.569
 the youtube channel that did this to you 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.369
 I leave the description of and sorry 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.259
 I wait for you always bark in this part 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.200
 we have another one that is very small but it was 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.119
 designed by nothing more and nothing less than 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.340
 and then cutting around here can see that 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.950
 we have a house with wool and with quartz 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.720
 since I think they all have quartz but 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.280
 this one has a few bushes 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.160
 by the sides in the back 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.079
 we have this that is like a table 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.430
 with a sofa or that I am for children but 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.840
 well entering the house you can see that 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.440
 we have a space very well used in 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.480
 reality 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.370
 13 x 13 and you can see that here 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.620
 we have what would be the living room or 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.410
 what do I know and in this part we have nothing 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.210
 plus a quarter, which I think 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.400
 it's fine it's a very small house but 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.980
 if we put the bed let's say in this part 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.090
 I find the shaft by a demon 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.580
 let's say we put the house by 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.560
 bed over here and let's say we put a 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.970
 freedom on this part I think everything 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.230
 It is very very epic, so now 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.660
 I just saw that we have this one that is 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.160
 very cool ok let's go to the next one and then 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.510
 if you want me to bring more houses or 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.430
 something then remember that the comments 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.500
 let us know or if you have your house 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.120
 you can send it to maps not to gamer or to 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.560
 gmail.com in the description I leave it 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.140
 so you see here we are going to continue 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.250
 the houses are going very well at the moment 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.630
 reality is that I would like to do my 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.770
 house yes but I do not know anything creative if 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.450
 you think you can see that it's something 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.730
 very epic the houses are very small 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.220
 but it explains so that cows because they come out 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.720
 of the pond you live in the next 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.760
 home strength because real and how they 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.500
 I say this guy actually that is another 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.900
 level if they see your channel they will see 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.030
 constructions link tractor and those 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.680
 mansions or what do I know in leb those of 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.060
 20 something minutes videos and actually 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.380
 it's epic so it's over here you can see 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.540
 which is a small house moderation is 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.340
 very small so those huge and well 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.560
 here you can see that we have a house 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.629
 because the ball and well then in the part 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.150
 from outside can see that we have a type 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.220
 garage for cars and everyone can 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.560
 see that we have those trees that are in 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.310
 vertical shape that are very beautiful in 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.230
 reality that I would not have 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.030
 happened to do this you can see that by 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.549
 here we have this that is like the grass 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.160
 very nice a tree here the shores 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.200
 or the part of the external one is what 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.940
 what is this thing to protect that 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.190
 is very epic with iron bars and 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.500
 with four and all and with a few 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.390
 things and good entering here can 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.069
 see that we have a guy for everything in the 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.360
 which I liked so much can see that 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.370
 it's like an electric door and it's 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.019
 open that is very well done ok in 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.200
 this part we have what is a source 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.569
 of cane and everything that is very luxurious 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.790
 it looks very nice the house ok for this part 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.230
 we have what would be the space for 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.120
 car if I'm not wrong let's say this 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.130
 is a car, so you can only imagine what 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.739
 I was like we would have a car on and 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.950
 well it is very good ok in this part 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.720
 we have what is a small area that 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.729
 could serve us to put lamps or 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.800
 something I do not know this would be his question 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.300
 boys that you imagine or something and 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.040
 if you want it then do more 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.440
 big either do or not is 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.090
 creativity I'm nothing creative but 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.710
 I leave you can see that 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.450
 here we can put lights or something in 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.550
 reality is very good this is not the 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.320
 house on this part can see that 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.020
 we have this that would be like the kitchen 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.300
 that is also very beautiful and in this 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.640
 part we would have an area to designate 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.260
 let's say the room whatever I am in 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.540
 actually this is already his question as 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.300
 I tell them no longer remove this I'm sorry 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.250
 much to see that part we have what 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.470
 It would be our room if I'm not bad and 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.210
 here we have a very very small area 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.160
 to put say a closet or two I do not know 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.870
 it is actually are very nice they are 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.820
 small houses but as I tell you very 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.020
 well done and if you want more houses then 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.520
