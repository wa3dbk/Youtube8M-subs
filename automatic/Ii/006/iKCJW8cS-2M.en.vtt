00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.929
 look how radio we race spastically 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.929
 attacks over google 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.780
 dagshaadee hey we wish to share 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.700
 will look at service arrival 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.260
 today we are going to do something very epic 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.090
 then we have today 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.520
 and then we go to slash mark en 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.990
 then we go to agenda because the whole 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.449
 many of you already know of course 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.830
 today we have and which dragons 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.939
 guy and it's the first time i have the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.439
 I organize it myself 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.880
 organize sick 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.470
 I assume that shit anyway 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.059
 goes wrong but he will see 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.840
 how and what and what's going on 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.170
 to happen 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.040
 I just put a word that is true 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.950
 warm 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.500
 ender dragon and then they come here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.110
 right and the privileged have to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.870
 can then choose an ender dragon 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.829
 or just though selecting at their 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.210
 bed select 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.059
 and who can those people can do it there then 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.770
 at least that's the idea of flying out 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.289
 and I hope it will work 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.949
 it's not really a very good one 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.689
 solution but hey we 'll see 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.909
 bread cupboard 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:15.540
 go to slut become ender dragon and spain 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.920

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.560

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.909
