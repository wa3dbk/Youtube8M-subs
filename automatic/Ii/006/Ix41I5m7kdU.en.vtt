tried it and I was still trying to use

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.170 
tried it and I was still trying to use
it<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> aks-74u<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.730> cannot<00:00:50.969> do

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
it like the aks-74u and you cannot do

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.150 
it like the aks-74u and you cannot do
that<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:52.140> guy's<00:00:52.289> laying<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> ground

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160

that as that guy's laying on the ground
I<00:00:53.309> don't<00:00:53.460> know<00:00:53.520> what<00:00:53.640> he's<00:00:53.760> doing<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.390> back<00:00:54.570> to

I don't know what he's doing and back to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.939 
I don't know what he's doing and back to
the<00:00:54.780> reason<00:00:55.020> why<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.140> cannot<00:00:55.469> use<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> like

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the reason why you cannot use it like

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.729 
the reason why you cannot use it like
the<00:00:56.100> ak-74<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.570> reason<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.440> is

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the ak-74 you the reason for that is is

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.369 
the ak-74 you the reason for that is is
that<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> Mac<00:00:59.309> 11<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.910> not<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:00.329> good<00:01:00.629> at<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> long

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
that the Mac 11 is not as good at a long

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.950 
that the Mac 11 is not as good at a long
distance<00:01:01.460> now<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.789> will<00:01:03.180> bring<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.510> charts

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
distance now I will bring up the charts

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.840 
distance now I will bring up the charts
here<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.290> second<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.979> shows<00:01:05.309> up<00:01:05.580> that

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
here in a second and it shows up that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.399 
here in a second and it shows up that
both<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.240> guns<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.869> same<00:01:07.049> amount<00:01:07.170> of

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
both the guns do the same amount of

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.870 
both the guns do the same amount of
damage<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.040> seems<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.670> little

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
damage but it seems like it's a little

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.359 
damage but it seems like it's a little
bit<00:01:09.000> harder<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.750> control<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.380> Mac<00:01:10.560> 11<00:01:10.979> bullets

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
bit harder to control the Mac 11 bullets

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.820 
bit harder to control the Mac 11 bullets
at<00:01:11.549> long<00:01:11.760> distance<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> ak-74<00:01:13.470> you

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
at long distance and it is the ak-74 you

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.410 
at long distance and it is the ak-74 you
what<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.189> mean<00:01:14.430> by<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> same<00:01:15.150> damage

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
what I mean by they do the same damage

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.420 
what I mean by they do the same damage
they<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.049> same<00:01:16.259> damage<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.770> distance<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.400> i

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
they do the same damage at distance so i

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.179 
they do the same damage at distance so i
have<00:01:17.549> about<00:01:17.759> 25<00:01:18.420> meters<00:01:18.840> all<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.350> SMGs<00:01:19.890> have

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
have about 25 meters all the SMGs have

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.130 
have about 25 meters all the SMGs have
been<00:01:20.430> dropped<00:01:20.729> down<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.180> 20<00:01:21.630> damage<00:01:21.840> per

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
been dropped down to 20 damage per

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.749 
been dropped down to 20 damage per
bullet<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:23.070> brings<00:01:23.189> up<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.580> good

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
bullet and this brings up a good

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.760 
bullet and this brings up a good
opportunity<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.479> me<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.930> bring<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.530> all<00:01:25.740> the

section you see that it goes 60 up 62

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.250 
section you see that it goes 60 up 62
the<00:02:43.549> right<00:02:43.730> 20<00:02:44.120> down<00:02:44.299> and<00:02:44.659> 10<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.019> left

that means the pole that it has so the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.599 
that means the pole that it has so the
Mac<00:02:47.629> 11<00:02:48.019> it<00:02:48.169> goes<00:02:48.349> up<00:02:48.590> into<00:02:48.829> the<00:02:48.980> right<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.489> you

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
Mac 11 it goes up into the right and you

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:50.920 
Mac 11 it goes up into the right and you
could<00:02:49.760> feel<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.329> can<00:02:50.480> see<00:02:50.629> it<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.810> this

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
could feel it and you can see it in this

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.959 
could feel it and you can see it in this
game<00:02:51.139> when<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.379> run<00:02:51.560> full<00:02:51.829> auto<00:02:52.069> it<00:02:52.340> does<00:02:52.519> go<00:02:52.730> up

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:52.969 
game when I run full auto it does go up

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:54.909 
game when I run full auto it does go up
and<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.209> does<00:02:53.359> go<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.750> right<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.650> because

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:54.919 
and it does go to the right and because

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.649 
and it does go to the right and because
of<00:02:54.949> this<00:02:55.129> recoil<00:02:55.609> I<00:02:55.699> think<00:02:55.939> it<00:02:56.060> caused<00:02:56.359> me<00:02:56.540> to

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
of this recoil I think it caused me to

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.300 
of this recoil I think it caused me to
get<00:02:56.810> quite<00:02:57.049> a<00:02:57.079> few<00:02:57.230> head<00:02:57.590> shots<00:02:57.620> on<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:58.129> game

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
get quite a few head shots on this game

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.920 
get quite a few head shots on this game
i<00:02:58.370> don't<00:02:58.609> think<00:02:58.790> i've<00:02:58.879> ever<00:02:58.909> gotten<00:02:59.209> quite<00:02:59.689> so

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
i don't think i've ever gotten quite so

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.020 
i don't think i've ever gotten quite so
many<00:03:00.139> headshots<00:03:00.349> with<00:03:00.799> the<00:03:00.919> SMD<00:03:01.250> before<00:03:01.760> and

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
many headshots with the SMD before and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.990 
many headshots with the SMD before and
now<00:03:02.510> let's<00:03:02.780> bring<00:03:02.959> up<00:03:03.199> the<00:03:03.409> ak-74<00:03:04.219> you<00:03:04.669> and<00:03:04.909> as

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
now let's bring up the ak-74 you and as

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.699 
now let's bring up the ak-74 you and as
you<00:03:05.150> can<00:03:05.269> see<00:03:05.299> let's<00:03:05.900> look<00:03:06.049> at<00:03:06.199> the<00:03:06.290> recoil

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
you can see let's look at the recoil

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.759 
you can see let's look at the recoil
section<00:03:07.099> first<00:03:07.340> does<00:03:07.879> 65<00:03:08.449> up<00:03:08.750> in<00:03:08.959> 5<00:03:09.409> to<00:03:09.739> both

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
section first does 65 up in 5 to both

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.740 
section first does 65 up in 5 to both
sides<00:03:09.949> basically<00:03:10.939> what<00:03:11.090> this<00:03:11.239> means<00:03:11.480> is<00:03:11.719> that

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
sides basically what this means is that

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.270 
sides basically what this means is that
it<00:03:11.930> can<00:03:12.049> jump<00:03:12.349> to<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.680> left<00:03:12.709> or<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:13.189> right

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
it can jump to the left or to the right

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.610 
it can jump to the left or to the right
or<00:03:13.669> it<00:03:13.760> can<00:03:13.849> do<00:03:14.000> both<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:15.079> just<00:03:15.230> really

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
or it can do both and you just really

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.960 
or it can do both and you just really
don't<00:03:15.650> know<00:03:15.949> if<00:03:16.159> you're<00:03:16.310> running<00:03:16.430> full<00:03:16.759> auto

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
don't know if you're running full auto

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.330 
don't know if you're running full auto
and<00:03:17.269> I'm<00:03:17.870> not<00:03:17.989> saying<00:03:18.259> that<00:03:18.439> the<00:03:18.709> Mac<00:03:18.859> 11<00:03:19.250> is

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
and I'm not saying that the Mac 11 is

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.099 
and I'm not saying that the Mac 11 is
any<00:03:19.489> better<00:03:19.790> but<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.239> just<00:03:20.419> feel<00:03:20.689> like<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:21.049> could

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
any better but I just feel like I could

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.289 
any better but I just feel like I could
control<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.889> recoil<00:03:22.099> on<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.549> Mac<00:03:22.699> 11<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.120> lot

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
control the recoil on the Mac 11 a lot

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.270 
control the recoil on the Mac 11 a lot
better<00:03:23.509> than<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:23.810> could<00:03:24.019> with<00:03:24.229> the<00:03:24.349> ak-74<00:03:24.919> you

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
better than I could with the ak-74 you

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.860 
better than I could with the ak-74 you
in<00:03:25.819> a<00:03:25.909> couple<00:03:26.090> other<00:03:26.269> things<00:03:26.329> about<00:03:26.659> the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
in a couple other things about the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.869 
in a couple other things about the
aks-74u<00:03:27.439> that<00:03:27.949> I<00:03:27.979> talked<00:03:28.340> about<00:03:28.609> but<00:03:28.790> you

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
aks-74u that I talked about but you

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.159 
aks-74u that I talked about but you
couldn't<00:03:29.150> see<00:03:29.329> it<00:03:29.449> you<00:03:29.629> can<00:03:29.780> see<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.079> damage

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
couldn't see it you can see the damage

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.499 
couldn't see it you can see the damage
is<00:03:30.439> I<00:03:30.530> have<00:03:30.650> 40<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.159> it<00:03:31.250> drops<00:03:31.489> on<00:03:31.669> 20<00:03:32.090> of<00:03:32.209> right

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:32.509 
is I have 40 and it drops on 20 of right

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.140 
is I have 40 and it drops on 20 of right
at<00:03:32.659> 25<00:03:33.169> meters<00:03:33.409> and<00:03:33.829> the<00:03:34.639> rounds<00:03:34.909> per<00:03:35.060> minute

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
at 25 meters and the rounds per minute

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.599 
at 25 meters and the rounds per minute
or<00:03:35.389> at<00:03:35.540> 750<00:03:36.259> but<00:03:36.859> one<00:03:36.979> thing<00:03:37.159> i<00:03:37.250> forgot<00:03:37.280> the

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
or at 750 but one thing i forgot the

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.490 
or at 750 but one thing i forgot the
cover<00:03:37.970> was<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.750> green<00:03:38.930> line<00:03:39.139> and<00:03:39.319> what<00:03:39.409> the

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
cover was the green line and what the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.259 
cover was the green line and what the
green<00:03:39.680> line<00:03:39.859> is<00:03:40.069> is<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.519> damage<00:03:40.729> your<00:03:41.090> gun

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
green line is is the damage your gun

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.719 
green line is is the damage your gun
does<00:03:41.540> with<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:41.959> silencer<00:03:42.530> now<00:03:43.099> basically<00:03:43.340> all<00:03:43.699> a

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:43.729 
does with a silencer now basically all a

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:45.819 
does with a silencer now basically all a
silencer<00:03:44.239> does<00:03:44.449> is<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:44.900> drops<00:03:45.139> your<00:03:45.409> damage

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
silencer does is it drops your damage

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.499 
silencer does is it drops your damage
down<00:03:45.979> to<00:03:46.159> 20<00:03:46.459> a<00:03:46.489> little<00:03:46.790> bit<00:03:46.909> sooner<00:03:47.269> so<00:03:47.419> you

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:47.509 
down to 20 a little bit sooner so you

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:50.199 
down to 20 a little bit sooner so you
don't<00:03:47.689> have<00:03:47.870> that<00:03:48.169> 40<00:03:48.680> or<00:03:49.009> 30<00:03:49.220> damage<00:03:49.579> at<00:03:49.939> quite

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
don't have that 40 or 30 damage at quite

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.729 
don't have that 40 or 30 damage at quite
the<00:03:50.389> same<00:03:50.569> distance<00:03:50.989> as<00:03:51.139> you<00:03:51.169> would<00:03:51.409> without<00:03:51.620> a

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
the same distance as you would without a

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.469 
the same distance as you would without a
sponsor<00:03:52.009> and<00:03:52.699> I<00:03:52.759> think<00:03:53.000> that<00:03:53.150> just<00:03:53.389> about

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:53.479 
sponsor and I think that just about

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.300 
sponsor and I think that just about
covers<00:03:53.599> it<00:03:53.989> for<00:03:54.169> all<00:03:54.349> the<00:03:54.379> gun<00:03:54.709> stats<00:03:54.979> I<00:03:55.129> think

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
covers it for all the gun stats I think

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.099 
covers it for all the gun stats I think
I<00:03:55.370> went<00:03:55.549> over<00:03:55.729> that<00:03:55.849> pretty<00:03:56.090> well<00:03:56.540> so<00:03:56.870> what<00:03:57.019> I'm

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
I went over that pretty well so what I'm

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.319 
I went over that pretty well so what I'm
going<00:03:57.199> to<00:03:57.290> cover<00:03:57.500> now<00:03:57.859> is<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.699> attachments

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
going to cover now is the attachments

going to cover now is the attachments

rounds<00:04:21.500> in<00:04:21.620> your<00:04:21.739> mag

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
rounds in your mag

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.790 
rounds in your mag
zeen<00:04:22.250> if<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:23.060> strap<00:04:23.810> on<00:04:23.990> extended<00:04:24.410> mags<00:04:24.560> that

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
zeen if you strap on extended mags that

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.800 
zeen if you strap on extended mags that
puts<00:04:25.010> it<00:04:25.130> up<00:04:25.220> to<00:04:25.370> 30<00:04:25.670> and<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.360> reason<00:04:26.600> for<00:04:26.630> that

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
puts it up to 30 and the reason for that

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.960 
puts it up to 30 and the reason for that
is<00:04:26.900> is<00:04:27.320> because<00:04:27.350> this<00:04:27.860> gun<00:04:28.040> shoots<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:28.640> fast

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
is is because this gun shoots so fast

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.120 
is is because this gun shoots so fast
and<00:04:29.360> if<00:04:29.900> you<00:04:30.020> don't<00:04:30.200> use<00:04:30.350> extended<00:04:30.770> mags<00:04:30.950> you

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
and if you don't use extended mags you

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.710 
and if you don't use extended mags you
really<00:04:31.400> can't<00:04:31.640> expect<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.150> kill<00:04:32.330> more<00:04:32.540> than

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
really can't expect to kill more than

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.260 
really can't expect to kill more than
one<00:04:32.870> person<00:04:32.900> without<00:04:33.500> reloading<00:04:34.010> I<00:04:34.400> also<00:04:34.970> had

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
one person without reloading I also had

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.030 
one person without reloading I also had
some<00:04:35.420> fun<00:04:35.660> duel<00:04:35.870> wielding<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.470> Mac<00:04:36.590> Elevens

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
some fun duel wielding the Mac Elevens

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.620 
some fun duel wielding the Mac Elevens
but<00:04:37.280> to<00:04:37.400> be<00:04:37.490> perfectly<00:04:37.520> honest<00:04:38.210> it's<00:04:38.360> really

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
but to be perfectly honest it's really

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.900 
but to be perfectly honest it's really
not<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:38.840> practical<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.830> it's<00:04:40.130> only<00:04:40.370> if<00:04:40.610> your

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
not that practical and it's only if your

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.610 
not that practical and it's only if your
you<00:04:41.210> know<00:04:41.540> just<00:04:41.780> wanting<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.230> feel<00:04:42.500> a<00:04:42.530> little

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
you know just wanting to feel a little

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.110 
you know just wanting to feel a little
bit<00:04:42.890> adventurous<00:04:43.160> you're<00:04:43.670> not<00:04:43.790> going<00:04:43.910> to<00:04:43.970> put

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
bit adventurous you're not going to put

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.760 
bit adventurous you're not going to put
a<00:04:44.150> big<00:04:44.390> scores<00:04:44.720> with<00:04:44.930> it<00:04:45.080> but<00:04:45.260> this<00:04:45.320> is<00:04:45.380> kind<00:04:45.710> of

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
a big scores with it but this is kind of

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.500 
a big scores with it but this is kind of
fun<00:04:45.830> running<00:04:46.430> around<00:04:46.550> with<00:04:46.880> steady<00:04:47.120> aim<00:04:47.330> and

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
fun running around with steady aim and

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.660 
fun running around with steady aim and
just<00:04:47.660> trying<00:04:47.810> to<00:04:47.930> kill<00:04:48.110> some<00:04:48.260> people<00:04:48.380> but<00:04:49.340> this

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
just trying to kill some people but this

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.520 
just trying to kill some people but this
is<00:04:49.850> actually<00:04:50.030> a<00:04:50.270> pretty<00:04:50.690> funny<00:04:50.810> part<00:04:51.350> right

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
is actually a pretty funny part right

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.000 
is actually a pretty funny part right
here<00:04:51.560> I<00:04:52.010> died<00:04:52.100> from<00:04:52.760> my<00:04:52.940> own<00:04:53.120> teams<00:04:53.570> RC<00:04:54.170> car<00:04:54.410> and

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
here I died from my own teams RC car and

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.650 
here I died from my own teams RC car and
I<00:04:55.070> was<00:04:55.220> like<00:04:55.310> oh<00:04:55.490> what<00:04:55.790> the<00:04:55.910> hell<00:04:56.060> happened<00:04:56.480> and

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
I was like oh what the hell happened and

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.330 
I was like oh what the hell happened and
then<00:04:56.810> I<00:04:56.900> figured<00:04:57.290> out<00:04:57.410> that<00:04:57.470> that<00:04:57.830> guy<00:04:58.010> shot

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
then I figured out that that guy shot

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.580 
then I figured out that that guy shot
the<00:04:58.490> RC<00:04:58.820> car<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:59.240> blew<00:04:59.510> me<00:04:59.660> up<00:04:59.690> which<00:05:00.200> sucks

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
the RC car and blew me up which sucks

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.110 
the RC car and blew me up which sucks
because<00:05:00.860> I<00:05:01.010> did<00:05:01.220> not<00:05:01.370> know<00:05:01.550> that<00:05:01.580> could<00:05:01.970> happen

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
because I did not know that could happen

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.060 
because I did not know that could happen
but<00:05:02.600> I<00:05:02.660> guess<00:05:02.870> that's<00:05:03.140> just<00:05:03.230> way<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:03.830> cookie

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
but I guess that's just way the cookie

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.150 
but I guess that's just way the cookie
crumbles<00:05:04.280> sometimes<00:05:04.970> but<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:06.380> perks<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:06.980> would

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
crumbles sometimes but the perks I would

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.010 
crumbles sometimes but the perks I would
recommend<00:05:07.430> in<00:05:07.730> the<00:05:07.820> first<00:05:08.060> perk<00:05:08.390> slot<00:05:08.540> I<00:05:08.840> would

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
recommend in the first perk slot I would

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.200 
recommend in the first perk slot I would
use<00:05:09.200> scavenger<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:10.310> second<00:05:10.640> perk<00:05:10.760> slot<00:05:10.940> I

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
use scavenger the second perk slot I

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.090 
use scavenger the second perk slot I
would<00:05:11.360> use<00:05:11.630> slide<00:05:12.020> and<00:05:12.290> and<00:05:12.560> in<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.770> third<00:05:12.800> you

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
would use slide and and in the third you

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.880 
would use slide and and in the third you
can<00:05:13.220> pretty<00:05:13.370> much<00:05:13.460> use<00:05:13.610> whatever<00:05:14.060> you<00:05:14.240> want

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
can pretty much use whatever you want

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.080 
can pretty much use whatever you want
scavenger<00:05:15.890> because<00:05:16.220> if<00:05:16.490> you<00:05:16.610> were<00:05:16.940> watching

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
scavenger because if you were watching

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.910 
scavenger because if you were watching
the<00:05:17.420> beginning<00:05:17.780> of<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:17.990> game<00:05:18.140> I<00:05:18.350> was<00:05:18.530> just

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
the beginning of the game I was just

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.070 
the beginning of the game I was just
blowing<00:05:19.460> through<00:05:19.490> bullets<00:05:20.030> so<00:05:20.180> fast<00:05:20.480> and<00:05:20.840> I

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
blowing through bullets so fast and I

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.570 
blowing through bullets so fast and I
actually<00:05:21.230> had<00:05:21.470> to<00:05:21.500> pick<00:05:21.710> up<00:05:21.830> a<00:05:21.920> few<00:05:22.100> scavenger

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
actually had to pick up a few scavenger

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.390 
actually had to pick up a few scavenger
packs<00:05:22.850> and<00:05:23.120> even<00:05:23.750> that<00:05:23.930> wasn't<00:05:24.140> enough<00:05:24.400> this

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
packs and even that wasn't enough this

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.520 
packs and even that wasn't enough this
is<00:05:25.520> actually<00:05:25.850> a<00:05:25.880> good<00:05:26.150> illustration<00:05:26.840> of<00:05:27.380> how

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
is actually a good illustration of how

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.930 
is actually a good illustration of how
to<00:05:27.590> shoot<00:05:27.890> at<00:05:28.010> long<00:05:28.160> range<00:05:28.400> you<00:05:28.550> kind<00:05:28.760> of<00:05:28.820> just

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
to shoot at long range you kind of just

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.660 
to shoot at long range you kind of just
gotta<00:05:29.150> burst<00:05:29.360> fire<00:05:30.130> slide<00:05:31.130> a<00:05:31.160> hand<00:05:31.250> because

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
gotta burst fire slide a hand because

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.520 
gotta burst fire slide a hand because
you<00:05:31.820> have<00:05:31.970> to<00:05:32.090> reload<00:05:32.450> so<00:05:32.780> many<00:05:33.020> times<00:05:33.320> with

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
you have to reload so many times with

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.200 
you have to reload so many times with
this<00:05:33.680> gun<00:05:33.830> even<00:05:34.100> with<00:05:34.220> extended<00:05:34.700> mags<00:05:34.730> you<00:05:35.090> got

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
this gun even with extended mags you got

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.270 
this gun even with extended mags you got
to<00:05:35.330> constantly<00:05:35.630> be<00:05:35.900> reloading<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:36.890> in<00:05:37.190> the

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
to constantly be reloading and in the

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.890 
to constantly be reloading and in the
third<00:05:37.670> perks<00:05:37.940> lot<00:05:38.150> it<00:05:38.330> really<00:05:38.360> doesn't<00:05:38.840> matter

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
third perks lot it really doesn't matter

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.280 
third perks lot it really doesn't matter
usually<00:05:39.500> I<00:05:39.560> use<00:05:39.590> hacker<00:05:40.040> or<00:05:40.340> ninja<00:05:41.080> and<00:05:42.080> that's

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
usually I use hacker or ninja and that's

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.170 
usually I use hacker or ninja and that's
just<00:05:42.470> all<00:05:42.680> personal<00:05:43.220> preference<00:05:43.490> once<00:05:43.910> again

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
just all personal preference once again

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
but the end of the game is coming upon

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.070 
but the end of the game is coming upon
us<00:05:46.280> guys<00:05:46.490> and<00:05:46.850> my<00:05:47.030> final<00:05:47.270> recommendation

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
us guys and my final recommendation

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.050 
us guys and my final recommendation
would<00:05:48.260> be<00:05:48.320> not<00:05:48.620> to<00:05:48.650> use<00:05:49.040> this<00:05:49.220> gun<00:05:49.430> I<00:05:49.700> mean<00:05:49.940> it

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
would be not to use this gun I mean it

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.970 
would be not to use this gun I mean it
does<00:05:50.330> have<00:05:50.630> its<00:05:50.810> purposes<00:05:51.260> for<00:05:51.530> certain<00:05:51.830> maps

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980

and<00:05:52.310> certain<00:05:52.610> play<00:05:52.790> styles<00:05:53.210> but<00:05:53.780> I<00:05:53.840> consider

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
and certain play styles but I consider

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.080 
and certain play styles but I consider
more<00:05:54.500> of<00:05:54.590> a<00:05:54.680> trinket<00:05:54.950> it's<00:05:55.370> something<00:05:55.610> that<00:05:55.910> if

more of a trinket it's something that if

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.880
