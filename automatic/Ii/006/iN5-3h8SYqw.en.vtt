orange is done I'm gonna go ahead and
pour<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.599> in<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:07.870> then<00:03:07.959> I'm<00:03:08.260> going<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.560> swirl

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
pour it in and then I'm going to swirl

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.330 
pour it in and then I'm going to swirl
it<00:03:09.840> let's<00:03:10.840> give<00:03:11.050> that<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.260> check<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.980> one's

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
it let's give that a check that one's

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.170 
it let's give that a check that one's
done<00:03:14.459> nice<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.700> bubbly

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
done nice and bubbly

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.780 
done nice and bubbly
set<00:03:17.049> it<00:03:17.170> down<00:03:17.680> gonna<00:03:18.069> do<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.400> whole<00:03:18.580> weight

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
set it down gonna do the whole weight

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.780 
set it down gonna do the whole weight
process<00:03:19.269> again<00:03:19.980> it's<00:03:20.980> probably<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.580> thing

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
process again it's probably the thing

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.910 
process again it's probably the thing
that<00:03:21.819> is<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.360> longest<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.959> do<00:03:23.140> with<00:03:23.349> what

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
that is the longest to do with what

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.440 
that is the longest to do with what
you're<00:03:24.099> working<00:03:24.400> with<00:03:24.430> ice<00:03:24.700> melt<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.150> that

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
you're working with ice melt is that

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.660 
you're working with ice melt is that
wait<00:03:25.660> process<00:03:26.170> because<00:03:26.890> we<00:03:27.010> all<00:03:27.129> kind<00:03:27.489> of<00:03:27.549> want

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
wait process because we all kind of want

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.839 
wait process because we all kind of want
to<00:03:27.819> go<00:03:28.140> military<00:03:29.140> hurry<00:03:29.319> hurry<00:03:29.549> but<00:03:30.549> I<00:03:30.580> can

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
to go military hurry hurry but I can

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.610 
to go military hurry hurry but I can
assure<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.239> that<00:03:31.480> fast

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
and whether it's sugar ice a melt

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.309 
and whether it's sugar ice a melt
anything<00:03:36.640> hot<00:03:37.060> does<00:03:37.569> not<00:03:37.780> go<00:03:37.930> well<00:03:38.110> together

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
anything hot does not go well together

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
you want to kind of keep fast and sugar

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.830 
you want to kind of keep fast and sugar
separated<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:43.239> we're<00:03:43.329> just<00:03:43.360> gonna<00:03:43.630> wait<00:03:43.810> on

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840

that this little guy over here if I turn
him<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:47.200> can<00:03:47.410> still<00:03:47.709> see<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.250> he's<00:03:48.489> kind<00:03:48.790> of

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
him I can still see that he's kind of

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.610 
him I can still see that he's kind of
got<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.030> little<00:03:49.239> bit<00:03:49.510> of<00:03:49.629> movement<00:03:49.810> in<00:03:50.290> his

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
got a little bit of movement in his

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.410 
got a little bit of movement in his
Center<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.190> know<00:03:51.310> he's<00:03:51.610> not<00:03:51.790> ready<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.239> pop

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
Center so I know he's not ready to pop

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.069 
Center so I know he's not ready to pop
out<00:03:52.599> yet<00:03:54.810> bubbles<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:56.140> dissipating<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.930> I'm

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
out yet bubbles of dissipating and I'm

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.890 
out yet bubbles of dissipating and I'm
gonna<00:03:59.290> go<00:03:59.470> ahead<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.769> do<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.040> pour<00:04:00.690> right<00:04:01.690> on

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
gonna go ahead and do a pour right on

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.410 
gonna go ahead and do a pour right on
over<00:04:02.140> that<00:04:02.410> yellow<00:04:05.639> just<00:04:06.639> a<00:04:06.790> little<00:04:07.030> couple<00:04:07.180> of

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
over that yellow just a little couple of

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.729 
over that yellow just a little couple of
drops<00:04:07.690> into<00:04:08.079> the<00:04:08.380> smaller<00:04:08.650> areas<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:11.500> is<00:04:11.560> a

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
drops into the smaller areas this is a

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.390 
drops into the smaller areas this is a
fairly<00:04:12.190> deep<00:04:12.519> mold<00:04:12.850> too<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:15.040> we'll<00:04:15.190> set<00:04:15.370> that

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
fairly deep mold too so we'll set that

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.650 
fairly deep mold too so we'll set that
over<00:04:15.700> there<00:04:16.590> once<00:04:17.590> again<00:04:18.000> just<00:04:19.000> use<00:04:19.359> your

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
over there once again just use your

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.770 
over there once again just use your
toothpick<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.769> move<00:04:21.099> the<00:04:21.430> ice<00:04:21.609> a<00:04:21.639> melt<00:04:22.120> into

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
toothpick to move the ice a melt into

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.320 
toothpick to move the ice a melt into
the<00:04:23.020> corners<00:04:23.639> rather<00:04:24.639> than<00:04:24.880> trying<00:04:25.180> to

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
the corners rather than trying to

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.029 
the corners rather than trying to
overfill<00:04:26.229> to<00:04:26.440> get<00:04:26.620> them<00:04:26.830> in<00:04:26.979> there<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.860> then

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
overfill to get them in there and then

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.350 
overfill to get them in there and then
