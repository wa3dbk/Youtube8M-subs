00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.840
 the ideal school 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.280
 today is not a day like anybody today is 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.130
 a special day 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.799
 Sofía got up as usual but 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.230
 this time I was not going to college in 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.560
 this time she was heading towards her 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.960
 first work day the previous day and you 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.360
 I had thought a lot about how that would be 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.310
 first day I will be very comfortable 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.380
 I will understand well with all things were 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.309
 great instead of sure it's beautiful 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.000
 wide has decorated then in its first 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.790
 day it came out well arranged perfumed I'll 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.820
 peinadita and with her big smile heading to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.160
 the curias but on arrival he found 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.920
 with a very different school than 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.530
 she was waiting for the door of the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.350
 entry are nothing more than your car's 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.820
 grandfather and on entering he noticed that we had 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.460
 Color a rainy night that place 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.160
 with some melancholy he went to the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.620
 the rector's office to tell him in 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.680
 what room did his class belong to? 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.680
 on the road I thought that surely in 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.260
 the living room everything would be different but not 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.110
 she became increasingly disillusioned with 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.000
 that place he saw as the watchman together 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.369
 with a teacher they had to go up 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.770
 third floor to a child who was in 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.110
 wheelchair and as another teacher 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.290
 I was carrying a girl with almost paralysis 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.020
 dragged all over the place and as a 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.810
 teacher dictated his math class 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.910
 speaking very very very shortly giving the 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.250
 back to your students without having in 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.360
 tell the deaf student of your class 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.580
 but what impressed him most was when 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.820
 all the students started arriving 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.759
 and in his little faces there was not a single 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.009
 expression of happiness it seemed that all 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.920
 they were there against their 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.110
 will but she very encouraged and started 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.660
 to take out of his briefcase a series of things 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.000
 that I was wearing for the class because those and 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.979
 Sofia had been very well informed of 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.960
 what were your students what 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.049
 capabilities they have and what are their 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.180
 difficulties first said hello 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:13.760
 threaten in the min man that offers a 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.950
 new teacher and after all 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.620
 they presented themselves she explained in what 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.989
 was the class what theme would remove 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.870
 that day and asked the students with 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.900
 melodious voice they know about the subject and that 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.750
 they want to know but only after a 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.880
 anna's silence time said red 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.760
 because he asks us that because 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.820
 just write down your class as they do 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.560
 all the teachers and already because you 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.720
 they also have the right to express their opinion 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.090
 target example so you would like that 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.820
 let's make this class do not do more 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.220
 aside to take into account and that I 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.530
 teach 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.080
 then Sofia took out the map adapted in 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.020
 High relief for bullseye and while you 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.030
 he explained what this map was 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.370
 put a video with texts and images that 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.190
 explained the same thing and went through all the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.050
 posts of a printed map to amaze 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.090
 of the teacher the students 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.819
 they started to look happier and their 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.219
 opinions began to emerge 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.680
 Suffering sent that in that school he 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.359
 I needed a radical change first 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.150
 what he did after finishing the classes 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.430
 to talk to the principal and ask him to 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.680
 show you the institutional curriculum and 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.629
 after looking at him I said 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.040
 Mr. rung, what do you think? 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.769
 we implement in the institution the 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.090
 universal learning design 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.189
 imagine that this design would allow 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.560
 create an institution for all without 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:38.659
 physical barriers in architectural with 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.640
 teaching methods that respond to the 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.189
 needs of all students and 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.019
 with goals material methods and 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:47.209
 clear evaluations proposed from the 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.579
 currículum besides the students 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.370
 they would be more comfortable in school what 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.769
 you think the idea sounds great but 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.569
 What should we do with the 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.280
 teachers of the institution and get us 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.739
 hands to work with the creation of the 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.750
 curriculum is fine sofía I think just like 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.519
 that you that I am situation needs 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.430
 a change for that reason well that if we have to 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.319
 all by has informed we will unblock 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.230
 Sofia came out in happy from the office of the 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.950
 rector a week later met with 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.959
 the other teachers 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.540
 everyone started working in the 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.400
 curriculum summon the parents of 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.560
 family to the representatives of the 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.360
 students and all the staff of the 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.300
 institution and some people from the 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.910
 community after a while the 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.300
 school started to look different to 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.470
 serves the elevator painted the walls 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.690
 they remembered the doors were made 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.810
 ramps among other important changes 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.060
 in addition the attitude of the teachers began 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.889
 to change and improve the faces of the 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.680
 students started to look more 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.540
 quiet differences students 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.000
 they started to be an active part of the 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.710
 school giving opinions resolving 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.780
 problems working as a team 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.620
 being more interested in their learning 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.960
 being autonomous critics and much more and 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.419
 the teachers began to train and 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.160
 implement a series of strategies that 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.590
 allow to take into account all the 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.440
 population using class materials 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.370
 varied technology printed texts 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.850
 texts 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.560
 images in braille videos plus its 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.389
 attitude towards teaching change 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.820
 much now the relationship with the 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.320
 students is different kinder and 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.930
 cordial 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.760
 when it's time for rest sofía is 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.130
 He feels watching and listening to 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.080
 students and teachers of the school and 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.840
 a smile is drawn on his face at 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.530
 hear them say I like to come to school 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.930
 to 10 degrees boring flat to me 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.960
 also the teachers already bring 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.270
 so good and varied activities not 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.470
 time to get up to come study 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:52.080
 now is the school idea goodbye 2 200 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:55.380
 year a corner and there you in things that I 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.350
 I can do and with the city sold I 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:01.560
 I read the lips and now the serious ones do not 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:05.430
 They also give back and bring images and 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.240
 support so I like to me what more 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.250
 I like that I can say things 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.740
 different ways and that force me to 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.470
 do it only with written opinions without 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.090
 afraid to be scolded that good change 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.650
 Now we can say that this is a 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.680
 school for all that respects the 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.969
 diversity an ideal school if in addition 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.519
 the students are already more critical 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:29.679
 opinions and look at their faces that are 

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:31.360
 happy to come here and parents 

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:33.879
 They are also happy because they claim that 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.799
 tutorials and supports for students 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:38.049
 has allowed them to integrate better into the 

00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:41.019
 school and be more responsible with the 

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:43.989
 tasks in case sofía stops and gets to 

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:45.909
 play with children at recess and so one 

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:47.469
 to one of the student parents 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:49.449
 community and teachers of schools 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:53.189
 they enjoy the great change that 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:53.189
 allowed the implementation of the dow
