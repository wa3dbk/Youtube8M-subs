 before that many teams yes what's there 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.820
 even whole research groups and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.369
 research centers force 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.100
 create something like this 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.700
 technology which to mass 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.220
 production managed to reach only

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.189
 This suggests that the dam actually 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.439
 is it your opinion on whether that

 puppet letters full control and 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.609
 it is more than that 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.089
 no this time it's about contactless 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:41.349
 gestural songs which he using

 determining position and movement 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.450
 hands just enough to hold your hand 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.630
 there is nothing useful above the screen

 re-motion increase on the field or 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.920
 add the opposite of hot water 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.060
 movement marks rar also 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.720
 opportunity provided 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.620

 ministers reduce the flow of anything 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.230
 will require a special hour

 researchers from boston 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.239
 the university spent curious 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.899
 an experiment during which a man 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.390
 test with 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.040
 the width of virtual reality could 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.569
 feel all women 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.550
 the conflict alone was called 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.010
 so convincing that 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.069
 volunteers present 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.290
 characteristic of women and Odessa when 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.550
 responding to different 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.670
 stimuli and virtual world all 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.569
 details regarding male volunteers 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.270
 asked were held at the level of this 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.720
 volunteer look at myself saw a stranger 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.829
 female body details of the victim clothes 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:33.959
 participating men 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.829
 experiments reported that they received 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.359
 full body relocation feeling 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.069
 women heavy rains 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.340
 priest researchers could 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.969
 notice judicial and other opinions 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.260
 months in a row for example when another

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.379
 legislators the whole country 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.400
 otherwise how the deity was revealed noticeable 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.059
 growth at opening the longer at this time 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:56.150
 was in the area of ​​female character themes 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.919
 more feminine setter 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:58.519
 reactions 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.090
 but those who get the researchers 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.999
 noted that these changes are the reaction 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.930
 immediately and counted after 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.480
 the man was shooting going virtual 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.669
 reality and again could see myself in 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.109
 his old 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.669

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.289
 these were news from the world of high 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:13.489
 efficiency technologies 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.089
 programs you can look at 

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:17.389
