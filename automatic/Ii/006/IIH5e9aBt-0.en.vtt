sitting every single day so I was

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.010 
sitting every single day so I was
thinking<00:01:23.909> I've<00:01:24.270> actually<00:01:24.450> been<00:01:24.630> doing<00:01:24.930> this

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
thinking I've actually been doing this

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.050 
thinking I've actually been doing this
for<00:01:25.259> about<00:01:25.290> two<00:01:25.830> weeks<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.400> once<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.850> got<00:01:26.880> to

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
for about two weeks but once I got to

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
for about two weeks but once I got to
December<00:01:27.509> first<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.900> decided<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.320> make<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.470> for

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
December first I decided to make it for

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.469 
December first I decided to make it for
the<00:01:29.040> whole<00:01:29.130> month<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.549> thought<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.420> should

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the whole month I thought that I should

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.230 
the whole month I thought that I should
make<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> goal<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.590> exercise<00:01:32.250> every<00:01:32.729> single<00:01:33.090> day

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
make a goal to exercise every single day

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.030 
make a goal to exercise every single day
this<00:01:33.420> month<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.140> my<00:01:34.290> December<00:01:34.680> fitness

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
challenge is to do one hour of exercise

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.109 
challenge is to do one hour of exercise
every<00:01:37.740> single<00:01:38.070> day<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.340> month<00:01:38.549> now<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.909> easy

every single day this month now the easy

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.609 
every single day this month now the easy
thing<00:01:39.360> about<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.689> challenge<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.229> me<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.350> it

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
thing about this challenge for me is it

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.889 
thing about this challenge for me is it
can<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.890> an<00:01:41.040> hour<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.610> anything<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.720> doesn't

can be an hour of anything so it doesn't

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.569

have<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.409> super<00:01:43.920> super<00:01:44.100> intense

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
have to be like super super intense

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.249 
have to be like super super intense
workouts<00:01:45.450> every<00:01:45.689> single<00:01:46.200> day<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.590> just<00:01:47.040> want<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
workouts every single day I just want a

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.660 
workouts every single day I just want a
motivation<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.439> every<00:01:49.920> single<00:01:50.130> day<00:01:50.369> no<00:01:50.549> matter

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
motivation to every single day no matter

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.940 
motivation to every single day no matter
what<00:01:50.939> get<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.659> move<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:52.259> an<00:01:52.350> hour<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.799> this

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
what get up and move for an hour so this

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.230 
what get up and move for an hour so this
doesn't<00:01:53.100> really<00:01:53.250> affect<00:01:53.610> my<00:01:53.759> routine<00:01:54.060> too

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
doesn't really affect my routine too

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.460 
doesn't really affect my routine too
much<00:01:54.390> because<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:54.899> already<00:01:55.110> doing<00:01:55.229> that

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
much because I was already doing that

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.469 
much because I was already doing that
five<00:01:55.740> days<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> week<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.490> running<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.060> going

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
five days a week with running and going

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.609 
five days a week with running and going
to<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> gym<00:01:57.750> actually<00:01:57.990> when<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> go<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> gym

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
to the gym actually when I go to the gym

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.050 
to the gym actually when I go to the gym
it's<00:01:58.799> more<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.100> one<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.700> half<00:01:59.729> to<00:02:00.000> two

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
it's more like one and a half to two

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
it's more like one and a half to two
hours<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.259> doesn't<00:02:01.649> really<00:02:01.770> affect<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
hours so it doesn't really affect the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.010 
hours so it doesn't really affect the
majority<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> my<00:02:03.119> routine<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:03.840> those

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
majority of my routine it's just those

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.800 
majority of my routine it's just those
one<00:02:04.409> or<00:02:04.439> two<00:02:04.710> days<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.430> typically<00:02:06.000> don't

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
one or two days that I typically don't

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.900 
one or two days that I typically don't
go<00:02:07.170> workout<00:02:07.560> that's<00:02:07.979> what<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:08.399> affecting

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
go workout that's what it's affecting

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.219 
go workout that's what it's affecting
and<00:02:09.090> I've<00:02:09.209> really<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.479> been<00:02:09.660> doing<00:02:09.840> anything

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
and I've really just been doing anything

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.930 
and I've really just been doing anything
that<00:02:10.560> involves<00:02:10.979> me<00:02:11.160> getting<00:02:11.459> out<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.819> my

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
that involves me getting out of my

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.550 
that involves me getting out of my
apartment<00:02:12.209> or<00:02:12.569> just<00:02:12.720> getting<00:02:12.930> up<00:02:13.140> and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
apartment or just getting up and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.770 
apartment or just getting up and
something<00:02:14.010> like<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.459> will<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.090> go<00:02:15.150> for<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.569> walk

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
something like I will just go for a walk

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.140 
something like I will just go for a walk
for<00:02:16.080> an<00:02:16.170> hour<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.590> just<00:02:17.160> walk<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.849> medium

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
for an hour and just walk in a medium

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.970 
for an hour and just walk in a medium
pace<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.630> just<00:02:18.840> get<00:02:18.959> up<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.170> go<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.620> that

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
pace and just get up and go and that

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.589 
pace and just get up and go and that
might<00:02:20.250> not<00:02:20.400> seem<00:02:20.760> like<00:02:20.819> that<00:02:21.180> big<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.510> a

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
might not seem like that big of a

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.780 
might not seem like that big of a
workout<00:02:21.989> but<00:02:22.500> if<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.160> walk<00:02:23.370> for<00:02:23.640> an<00:02:23.730> hour

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
workout but if you walk for an hour

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.729 
workout but if you walk for an hour
that's<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.300> three<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.780> four<00:02:24.989> miles<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.620> if

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
that's like three to four miles and if

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.040 
that's like three to four miles and if
you<00:02:25.860> do<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.130> two<00:02:26.459> extra<00:02:26.790> days<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.970> week<00:02:27.360> that's

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
you do that two extra days a week that's

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.589 
you do that two extra days a week that's
an<00:02:28.319> extra<00:02:28.650> six<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.040> eight<00:02:29.190> miles<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:30.000> week<00:02:30.030> and

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
an extra six to eight miles a week and

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.780 
an extra six to eight miles a week and
if<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.110> do<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:32.099> four<00:02:32.310> weeks<00:02:32.459> in<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.760> month

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
if you do that for four weeks in a month

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.740 
if you do that for four weeks in a month
that's<00:02:33.420> an<00:02:33.540> extra<00:02:33.840> 20<00:02:34.819> 24<00:02:35.819> now<00:02:36.180> I'm<00:02:36.330> 24<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.590> 32

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
that's an extra 20 24 now I'm 24 to 32

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.660 
that's an extra 20 24 now I'm 24 to 32
miles<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:40.080> month<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.590> over<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.099> year<00:02:41.430> that's

like<00:02:41.819> over<00:02:42.120> 300<00:02:42.599> miles<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:43.140> add<00:02:43.920> up<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.250> it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
like over 300 miles to add up so it

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.890 
like over 300 miles to add up so it
actually<00:02:44.489> adds<00:02:44.880> up<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.420> I'm<00:02:45.510> still<00:02:45.750> keeping
