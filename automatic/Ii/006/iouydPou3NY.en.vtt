if<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:01.079> an<00:01:01.559> annual<00:01:02.399> rate<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.840> number

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
if you have an annual rate and a number

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.670 
if you have an annual rate and a number
of<00:01:04.320> compounding<00:01:05.280> periods<00:01:05.339> or<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.150> our<00:01:06.270> case

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
of compounding periods or in our case

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.740

that's<00:01:10.380> 12<00:01:10.770> periods<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.189> cannot<00:01:11.520> use<00:01:11.729> your

that's 12 periods you cannot use your

that's 12 periods you cannot use your
annual<00:01:12.330> rate<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.110> we'll<00:01:13.260> go<00:01:13.380> ahead<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.770> divide

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
annual rate so we'll go ahead and divide

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.850

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
year point zero zero five so 1/2 a

periods per year once we have all of our
formula<00:01:33.270> inputs<00:01:33.659> actually<00:01:33.990> we'll<00:01:34.140> use<00:01:34.939> these

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
formula inputs actually we'll use these

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.710 
formula inputs actually we'll use these
here<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.799> go<00:01:37.920> ahead<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.100> use<00:01:38.250> our<00:01:38.400> PMT<00:01:38.970> now

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
here we can go ahead and use our PMT now

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.319 
here we can go ahead and use our PMT now
let's<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.799> assume<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.220> don't<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.850> we're

so if you're not familiar with how to

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.730 
so if you're not familiar with how to
use<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.640> function<00:02:24.300> like<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.960> dialog<00:02:25.440> box

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
use a function like this the dialog box

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.650 
use a function like this the dialog box
is<00:02:25.950> great<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.640> reminds<00:02:27.060> us<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.390> take<00:02:27.540> our

now<00:04:30.370> that's<00:04:30.640> good<00:04:30.970> information<00:04:31.410> now

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
now that's good information now

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.480 
now that's good information now
most<00:04:34.210> consumer<00:04:34.750> loans<00:04:34.960> are<00:04:35.290> at<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.650> end<00:04:35.890> of

it's always at the end of the month

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.460 
it's always at the end of the month
things<00:04:39.790> like<00:04:40.030> leases<00:04:40.660> are<00:04:40.810> at<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.080> beginning

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
things like leases are at the beginning

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.510 
things like leases are at the beginning
now<00:04:42.100> notice<00:04:42.520> it<00:04:42.700> says<00:04:42.940> 0<00:04:43.630> or<00:04:43.960> omit<00:04:44.500> it<00:04:44.680> I'm

now notice it says 0 or omit it I'm
gonna<00:04:45.670> leave<00:04:45.970> it<00:04:46.120> out<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.270> they<00:04:46.570> did<00:04:46.810> this

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
gonna leave it out and they did this

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.050 
gonna leave it out and they did this
because<00:04:47.350> they<00:04:47.470> know<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:48.190> know<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.460> very

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
because they know you know the very

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.180 
because they know you know the very
common<00:04:49.510> use<00:04:49.690> for<00:04:49.900> this<00:04:50.050> PMT<00:04:50.590> function<00:04:50.800> is

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
common use for this PMT function is

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.190 
common use for this PMT function is
payment<00:04:51.580> at<00:04:51.670> the<00:04:51.700> end<00:04:51.790> so<00:04:52.450> guess<00:04:52.630> what<00:04:52.840> we

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
payment at the end so guess what we

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.990 
payment at the end so guess what we
don't<00:04:53.380> need<00:04:53.560> these<00:04:53.740> last<00:04:54.010> two<00:04:54.280> arguments<00:04:54.880> at

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
don't need these last two arguments at

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.280 
don't need these last two arguments at

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
between the two second point it's

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.100

negative<00:05:09.220> why<00:05:09.490> is<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.880> negative<00:05:10.419> well<00:05:10.750> because

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
negative why is it negative well because

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.710 
negative why is it negative well because
financial<00:05:12.070> functions<00:05:12.340> no<00:05:12.610> cash<00:05:12.880> flow<00:05:13.210> when

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
financial functions no cash flow when

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.870 
financial functions no cash flow when
you<00:05:13.780> make<00:05:14.230> your<00:05:14.440> payment<00:05:15.010> to<00:05:15.130> the<00:05:15.310> bank<00:05:15.340> each

month it's coming out of your purse or

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.760 
month it's coming out of your purse or
wallet<00:05:19.000> and<00:05:19.510> so<00:05:20.050> that's<00:05:20.229> why<00:05:20.440> it's<00:05:20.590> negative

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
wallet and so that's why it's negative

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.440 
wallet and so that's why it's negative
I'm<00:05:21.340> gonna<00:05:21.520> click<00:05:21.729> OK<00:05:22.680> so<00:05:23.680> PMT<00:05:24.610> absolutely

I'm gonna click OK so PMT absolutely
awesome<00:05:25.780> now<00:05:25.930> let's<00:05:26.200> say<00:05:26.410> we<00:05:27.220> get<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.700> different

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
awesome now let's say we get a different

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.990 
awesome now let's say we get a different
rate<00:05:28.330> it's<00:05:28.710> 5.5<00:05:29.710> we<00:05:29.950> just<00:05:30.160> change<00:05:30.400> our<00:05:30.580> formula

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
rate it's 5.5 we just change our formula

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.630 
rate it's 5.5 we just change our formula
input<00:05:31.360> that<00:05:31.960> will<00:05:32.200> change<00:05:32.530> which<00:05:32.800> will<00:05:33.490> make

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
input that will change which will make

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.750 
input that will change which will make
that<00:05:33.820> change<00:05:34.150> also<00:05:34.870> ooh

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
that change also ooh

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.300 
that change also ooh
so<00:05:36.760> half<00:05:37.060> a<00:05:37.210> percent<00:05:37.570> down<00:05:37.750> and<00:05:38.020> we<00:05:38.250> jump<00:05:39.250> down

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
so half a percent down and we jump down

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.700 
so half a percent down and we jump down
to<00:05:39.610> 900<00:05:39.850> and<00:05:40.390> -<00:05:40.960> 993<00:05:41.950> dollars<00:05:42.400> each<00:05:43.030> month

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
to 900 and - 993 dollars each month

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.480 
to 900 and - 993 dollars each month
alright<00:05:45.120> next<00:05:46.120> video<00:05:46.990> we<00:05:47.380> will<00:05:47.410> look<00:05:47.800> at<00:05:47.860> a
