actually have a comic book where you
know<00:00:57.809> spoiler<00:00:58.170> he<00:00:58.920> meets<00:00:59.160> his<00:00:59.340> demise<00:00:59.370> so

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
know spoiler he meets his demise so

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.459 
know spoiler he meets his demise so
that's<00:01:00.180> pretty<00:01:00.539> cool<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.930> he's<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.379> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that's pretty cool and he's just a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.720 
that's pretty cool and he's just a
really<00:01:01.500> cool<00:01:01.859> looking<00:01:02.070> Jedi<00:01:02.370> he's<00:01:02.579> very

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
really cool looking Jedi he's very

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.509 
really cool looking Jedi he's very
different<00:01:03.239> very<00:01:03.930> unique<00:01:04.019> alien<00:01:04.769> species<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
different very unique alien species and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.520 
different very unique alien species and
I<00:01:05.820> think<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.659> main<00:01:06.869> appeal<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
I think that's the main appeal of the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.030 
I think that's the main appeal of the
figure

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
figure

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.039 
figure
and<00:01:08.159> he<00:01:08.760> tends<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.150> go<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.450> about<00:01:09.570> twenty<00:01:10.020> or

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and he tends to go for about twenty or

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.830 
and he tends to go for about twenty or
so<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.439> line<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.490> know<00:01:11.640> kind<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.570> looked<00:01:12.720> at

before

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
before

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.410 
before
nice<00:01:27.240> little<00:01:27.619> lightsaber<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.579> uh<00:01:29.610> there<00:01:30.299> he

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
nice little lightsaber but uh there he

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.800 
nice little lightsaber but uh there he
is<00:01:30.740> very<00:01:31.740> cool<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:33.150> actually<00:01:33.479> thought<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> was

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
is very cool now actually thought it was

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.730 
is very cool now actually thought it was
a<00:01:33.869> lot<00:01:34.020> bigger

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
a lot bigger

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.929 
a lot bigger
before<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> had<00:01:36.509> him<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.720> my<00:01:36.869> hands<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:38.280> guess

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
before I had him in my hands I guess

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.969 
before I had him in my hands I guess
what<00:01:39.210> really<00:01:39.360> makes<00:01:39.630> them<00:01:39.780> look<00:01:39.960> much<00:01:40.710> bigger

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
what really makes them look much bigger

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.179 
what really makes them look much bigger
is<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.460> tail<00:01:41.729> but<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.750> torso<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:43.979> most

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
is the tail but is torso for the most

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.139 
is the tail but is torso for the most
part<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.549> his<00:01:44.640> head<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.060> an<00:01:45.960> accurate<00:01:46.610> size<00:01:47.610> for

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
part in his head is an accurate size for

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.550 
part in his head is an accurate size for
any<00:01:48.210> three<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.630> three-quarter<00:01:49.020> inch<00:01:49.140> figure
