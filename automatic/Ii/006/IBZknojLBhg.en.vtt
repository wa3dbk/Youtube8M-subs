00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
loud and it's great for practice now at

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.870 
loud and it's great for practice now at
a<00:01:06.990> gig<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.979> probably<00:01:08.430> wouldn't<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.670> able<00:01:08.760> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
a gig it probably wouldn't be able to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.690 
a gig it probably wouldn't be able to
handle<00:01:09.360> what<00:01:09.540> you'd<00:01:09.689> want<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.460> but<00:01:11.460> I

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
handle what you'd want it to do but I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.620 
handle what you'd want it to do but I
would<00:01:12.090> recommend<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.430> just<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.790> size<00:01:15.360> of

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
would recommend it for just the size of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.039 
would recommend it for just the size of
it

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.530

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
I have some stickers on mine but it's

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.149 
I have some stickers on mine but it's
just<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.659> really<00:01:21.990> good<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.259> practice<00:01:22.830> and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
just it's really good for practice and

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.210 
just it's really good for practice and
for<00:01:23.520> covers<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.420> works<00:01:24.750> fine<00:01:25.200> if<00:01:25.740> you're<00:01:26.040> with

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
for covers it works fine if you're with

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.670 
for covers it works fine if you're with
one<00:01:26.460> or<00:01:26.610> two<00:01:26.759> other<00:01:26.939> people<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:28.290> for<00:01:28.439> Jam

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
and it's nice it's about 15 pounds and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.310 
and it's nice it's about 15 pounds and
then<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.299> sides<00:01:33.869> look<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:36.320> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
then the sides look like this and the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.890 
then the sides look like this and the
back<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.040> got<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.759> where<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> valve<00:01:39.600> or<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
back you got the where the valve or the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.859 
back you got the where the valve or the
UM<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:41.460> input<00:01:41.909> goes<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> power

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
UM the input goes in for the power

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.870 
UM the input goes in for the power
supply<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:44.070> also<00:01:44.189> kind<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.520> cool<00:01:44.670> because

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
supply it's also kind of cool because

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.819 
supply it's also kind of cool because
this<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.329> hollowed<00:01:45.810> out<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.649> put

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
this is like hollowed out so you can put

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.800 
this is like hollowed out so you can put
cords<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.700> stuff<00:01:47.970> just<00:01:48.450> for

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
cords in there and stuff just for

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.370 
cords in there and stuff just for
carrying<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.350> around<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:52.049> was<00:01:52.140> about

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
carrying it around and it it was about

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.190 
carrying it around and it it was about
$100<00:01:53.040> amp<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.939> mean<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.840> get<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.110> you

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
$100 amp so I mean it's you get what you

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.789 
$100 amp so I mean it's you get what you
pay<00:01:55.439> for

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
pay for

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.649 
pay for
it's<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.460> nice<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.850> only<00:01:57.030> downside<00:01:57.630> is

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
it's really nice the only downside is

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.850 
it's really nice the only downside is
that<00:01:58.790> when<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.939> change<00:01:59.969> from<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.990> from<00:02:01.680> any

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that when you change from a from any

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.770 
that when you change from a from any
channel<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> clean<00:02:02.820> channel<00:02:03.210> when<00:02:03.630> it's

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
channel to a clean channel when it's

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.980 
channel to a clean channel when it's
factory<00:02:04.649> settings<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.909> phaser<00:02:06.270> switch<00:02:06.780> is

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
factory settings the phaser switch is

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.059 
factory settings the phaser switch is
