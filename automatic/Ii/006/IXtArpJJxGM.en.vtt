00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.940
 and welcome to my kitchen see here 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.010
 they 're about minimalistic 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.590
 furnished, however, that is straight 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.810
 also very modern and today i would 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.369
 like to make a recipe with the eye 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.869
 Blind if you have no money now 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.119
 would blender or persistent stand mixer 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.530
 just as well go there would have to send 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.840
 but always a little smaller 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.700
 grind and the whole thing longer 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.059
 I would like to run 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.700
 make a raw food red beet soup 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.350
 okay you have to first of course needs 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.410
 a little beet 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.010
 these are now 150 grams you can you 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.440
 just cut into rough pieces and 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.820
 but nothing then but one more 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:06.439
 carrot approximately 75 km year are there 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:08.990
 also good in an extreme 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.600
 I have a leek onions you can 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.740
 normal triebel then take 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.159
 but only half is in small 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.840
 cut and also in the change 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.450
 then I have a bit 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.430
 fresh rosemary namely two stem 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.440
 as you can probably too 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.720
 dried rosemary that is then 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.299
 probably not so intense though 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.030
 should also work purely with it 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:39.650
 then I need an orange of it 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.770
 but only half of it is 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.659
 you can eat one and the other 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.659
 somehow liberated from its shell 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.710
 also in the change with it then 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.810
 he still needs a glass of water that 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.229
 should be about 150 medium liter 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:05.960
 in addition a pack alpro soya 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:09.519
 So cream about 150 milliliters then 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:15.230
 a tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:16.970
 two teaspoons soy sauce a half 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.560
 teaspoon of salt 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.330
 of course it is now with the page 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.920
 no more raw food 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.070
 but you can easily replace them 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.490
 just water it instead 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.610
 takes 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.530
 and another one to two tablespoons deficiency 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.640
 need to then can still two 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:39.950
 spoonful of seaweed must stand by that 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.410
 whole a nice funny touch of olive oil 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.440
 also comes to this, however, only 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.480
 later than when polishing it will be 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.700
 olive oil always a bit bitter 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.680
 That's why I admit that completely 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.360
 conclude so and now has the whole 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.260
 at highest for about 1 60 seconds 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.260
 pureed 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.750
 so now come the two tablespoons 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.700
 pure olive oil and again very short 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:21.750
 no longer than ten seconds 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:29.780
 puree and finished 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.780
 the raw food beetroot soup soma cost 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.210
 yes a very simple no soup 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.840
 if you have no children 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.800
 should as I can yes that 's it 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.670
 again next time 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.080
 maybe with the right books are yes 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.440
 otherwise have fun until then and 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.440
 Until next time 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.210
