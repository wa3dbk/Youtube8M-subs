00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello everyone, Kuzya and today I 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.560
 I'll tell you how to play Walther on the network 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.929
 for this we need a fitter nathan 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.030
 turn the incentive you swing it 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.679
 free and for that you will need 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.500
 hamachi and open ports 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.000
 Well , I have ports open 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.100
 hamachi eat unter over eat everything 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.460
 ok so that downloaded unter over 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.310
 downloaded now downloaded hamachi created 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.329
 network on 1 network stones connected two 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.989
 man one of them plays van turner 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:40.500
 it means everything is ok 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.969
 creates a network a friend connects to it but 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.780
 this principle is very easy then later 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.090
 we go van turner 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.520
 ivanter give the most important thing be well 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.030
 Well see you adventurous so here we are 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.879
 the game 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.680
 it means everything is normal under hamachi to me 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.989
 friends joined now we will not 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.680
 experiment but have already done it 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.110
 it's pretty easy so go tab. 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.729
 play 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.369
 so now we will create sulfur 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.180
 then I will show how to connect as 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.729
 connect 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.710
 friends click the host server and create a 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.920
 so firstly we can deliver by 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.100
 water or put on the 2nd 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.979
 can put the difficulty level i 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.560
 I will put normal 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.530
 I advise you not to change this 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.659
 let it stay password and if you 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.850
 need a password 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.549
 I think in principle it is not worth it 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.299
 Led news you want to head 12 a 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.180
 easy password here and further maximum 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.340
 player player max player how much 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.420
 you will play as you fit 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.090
 in hamachi or well yes better help them here 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.060
 then you put your port which you have 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:03.030
 open me for example port 25 is open 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.670
 thousand further push tail tail and 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.190
 the game is created later 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.490
 join friends then eat friends 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.920
 to your server 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.650
 friends click connect you with him and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.560
 share your password is nothing 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.700
 I put something here do not write 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.050
 share your ip 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.170
 which means ip from where we take in hamachi 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.320
 right click on your there 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:34.260
 ip up there and copy click 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:37.330
 Iv- pi-4 then we write the port that 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.090
 your friend has been opened and you click 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.820
 connect and prank but that's all 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.400
 pretty very easy very simple but 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.380
 some stupid and and can not do and 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.710
 Normally the main thing that you had 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.920
 open ports and no longer 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:57.010
