so beforehand and it seemed to work

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.950 
so beforehand and it seemed to work
pretty<00:01:20.640> well<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.090> first<00:01:21.270> time<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.570> actually

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
pretty well the first time this actually

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.840 
pretty well the first time this actually
is<00:01:22.020> me<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> fruit<00:01:22.440> punch<00:01:22.470> though<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.820> I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
is me the fruit punch though so I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.219 
is me the fruit punch though so I
haven't<00:01:24.180> tried<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> fruit<00:01:24.660> punch<00:01:24.690> I've<00:01:25.080> tried

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
haven't tried the fruit punch I've tried

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.389
