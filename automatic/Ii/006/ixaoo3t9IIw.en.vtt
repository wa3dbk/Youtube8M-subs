00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
in 1296 p and it's also

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.990 
in 1296 p and it's also
good<00:02:12.930> my<00:02:13.110> computer<00:02:13.620> I've<00:02:13.739> been<00:02:14.010> able<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.400> blow

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
good my computer I've been able to blow

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.729 
good my computer I've been able to blow
up<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.209> images<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.750> get<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:15.989> bit<00:02:16.200> more<00:02:16.440> clarity

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
up the images you get a bit more clarity

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.740

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.210 
seamless recording as you'll see in a
minute<00:02:27.450> I'll<00:02:27.720> transition<00:02:28.590> between<00:02:28.830> two

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
minute I'll transition between two

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.400 
minute I'll transition between two
different<00:02:29.400> film<00:02:29.819> clips<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.360> there<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.380> have

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
different film clips and there you have

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.290

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
it that's two Clips joined in to end

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.790 
it that's two Clips joined in to end
there<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.690> wouldn't<00:02:33.959> even<00:02:34.080> notice<00:02:34.380> there's<00:02:34.739> a

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
there you wouldn't even notice there's a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.839 
there you wouldn't even notice there's a
gap<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.250> totally<00:02:35.730> seamless<00:02:36.030> footage<00:02:37.849> now

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
gap it's totally seamless footage now

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.100 
gap it's totally seamless footage now
I'll<00:02:38.940> just<00:02:39.060> let<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.360> run<00:02:39.569> for<00:02:39.599> a<00:02:39.780> little<00:02:39.840> bit

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
I'll just let this run for a little bit

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.870 
I'll just let this run for a little bit
just<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.470> show<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:40.980> what<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.459> footage<00:02:41.760> is

transition over to a darker street
because<00:03:56.459> as<00:03:56.609> we<00:03:56.790> all<00:03:56.819> know<00:03:57.239> driving<00:03:58.170> is<00:03:58.260> not

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
because as we all know driving is not

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.229 
because as we all know driving is not
always<00:03:58.560> going<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:58.859> be<00:03:58.889> well-lit<00:03:59.459> main<00:03:59.819> street

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
from the camera is still quite soft in

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.670 
from the camera is still quite soft in
the<00:04:53.090> old<00:04:53.240> model<00:04:53.630> the<00:04:53.750> microphone<00:04:54.230> wasn't<00:04:54.440> that

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
the old model the microphone wasn't that

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.590 
the old model the microphone wasn't that
brilliant<00:04:55.100> itself<00:04:55.490> it's<00:04:55.760> still<00:04:56.030> not<00:04:56.330> great

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
brilliant itself it's still not great

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.040 
brilliant itself it's still not great
but<00:04:57.470> I'd<00:04:57.800> say<00:04:58.100> it's<00:04:58.340> better<00:04:58.550> than<00:04:58.760> it<00:04:58.820> was<00:04:59.050> but

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
but I'd say it's better than it was but

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.260 
but I'd say it's better than it was but
then<00:05:00.500> again<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:01.070> microphone<00:05:01.640> is<00:05:01.820> not<00:05:01.850> going<00:05:02.180> to

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
then again a microphone is not going to

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.210 
then again a microphone is not going to
be<00:05:02.390> the<00:05:02.510> most<00:05:02.720> important<00:05:03.470> feature<00:05:03.710> for<00:05:03.890> most

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
so my final thoughts on this camera I'm

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.150 
so my final thoughts on this camera I'm
still<00:05:22.760> very<00:05:23.030> impressed<00:05:23.570> with<00:05:23.690> these<00:05:24.560> cameras

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
still very impressed with these cameras

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.340 
still very impressed with these cameras
are<00:05:25.370> even<00:05:26.210> more<00:05:26.390> so<00:05:26.630> with<00:05:26.810> this<00:05:26.960> one<00:05:27.200> I<00:05:27.230> think

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
are even more so with this one I think

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.250 
are even more so with this one I think
the<00:05:27.710> 1296<00:05:28.520> p<00:05:28.790> is<00:05:28.940> a<00:05:28.970> very<00:05:29.240> nice<00:05:29.450> addition<00:05:29.990> here

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
the 1296 p is a very nice addition here

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.550 
the 1296 p is a very nice addition here
and<00:05:30.520> a<00:05:31.520> few<00:05:32.030> of<00:05:32.360> the<00:05:32.450> other<00:05:32.600> image<00:05:33.080> modes<00:05:33.380> I

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
and a few of the other image modes I

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.020 
and a few of the other image modes I
think<00:05:33.740> will<00:05:33.860> be<00:05:33.980> very<00:05:34.010> interesting<00:05:34.730> which<00:05:34.910> I'm

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
think will be very interesting which I'm
