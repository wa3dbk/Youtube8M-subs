00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.459
 ah 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.870
 This is how the first aquarium in the city looks 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.870
 from mexico 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.050
 in an area of 3,500 meters 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.660
 squares distributed in a structure 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.810
 of four underground levels and 48 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.880
 fish tanks can be seen at more than 230 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.790
 marine species ranging from sharks 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.000
 up to hippocampus we can 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.170
 compare them in terms of species and 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.300
 exhibitions with london 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.660
 and how about london is also underground 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.360
 then it is a comparison that we 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.399
 allow to do because the people who have 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.360
 had the opportunity to know the 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:54.250
 london agreement is very similar addition 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.320

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.110
 stay here forever 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.230
 we need 15 times each drop of water 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.290
 15 times a day that gives us that 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.460
 we process 22 million liters 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.460
 in our systems 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.550
