00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
experience for someone with a high end

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.649 
experience for someone with a high end
AMD<00:01:31.890> graphics<00:01:32.490> card<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.390> when<00:01:33.600> they

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
AMD graphics card will have when they

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.030 
AMD graphics card will have when they
put<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> sliders<00:01:34.290> all<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> way<00:01:34.619> up<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.920> this

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
put the sliders all the way up on this

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.890 
put the sliders all the way up on this
game<00:01:35.220> sure<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.240> wanted<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> make<00:01:36.689> sure<00:01:36.720> this

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
game sure so we wanted to make sure this

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.050 
game sure so we wanted to make sure this
game<00:01:37.110> could<00:01:37.259> both<00:01:37.439> run<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.740> entry<00:01:38.700> level<00:01:38.939> but

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
game could both run on entry level but

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.730 
game could both run on entry level but
also<00:01:39.090> take<00:01:39.509> advantage<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> high<00:01:40.259> end<00:01:40.470> and

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
also take advantage of the high end and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.499 
also take advantage of the high end and
so<00:01:40.860> AMD<00:01:41.280> has<00:01:41.369> been<00:01:41.490> helping<00:01:41.759> us<00:01:41.880> test<00:01:42.150> their

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
so AMD has been helping us test their

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.719 
so AMD has been helping us test their
mantle<00:01:42.810> system<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.860> their<00:01:44.070> labs<00:01:44.280> right<00:01:44.549> now

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
mantle system in their labs right now

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.520 
mantle system in their labs right now
and<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.030> we're<00:01:45.479> working<00:01:45.509> with<00:01:45.899> them<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.049> try<00:01:46.170> to

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
and so we're working with them to try to

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.050 
and so we're working with them to try to
find<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.829> way<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.979> push<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.670> every<00:01:47.939> different

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
find a way to push it in every different

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.149 
find a way to push it in every different
way<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.509> shaders<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.020> resolution<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:49.979> all

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
way like shaders and resolution and all

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.010 
way like shaders and resolution and all
that<00:01:50.340> comes<00:01:50.520> what's<00:01:51.210> what<00:01:51.540> does<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.780> mean<00:01:51.990> to

in development so we're still you know
work<00:02:13.870> you're<00:02:14.020> testing<00:02:14.380> on<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.620> but<00:02:14.800> it's<00:02:15.190> just

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
work you're testing on it but it's just

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.880 
work you're testing on it but it's just
it's<00:02:15.970> gonna<00:02:16.090> add<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.330> whole<00:02:16.540> like<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> higher

well<00:02:27.910> we<00:02:28.810> wanted<00:02:29.050> something<00:02:29.350> where<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.620> felt

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
well we wanted something where you felt

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.440 
well we wanted something where you felt

really epic and powerful while you were
playing<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:32.290> we<00:02:32.410> just<00:02:32.560> thought<00:02:32.740> dragons

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
playing and so we just thought dragons

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.710 
playing and so we just thought dragons
like<00:02:33.370> what's<00:02:33.580> cooler<00:02:33.790> than<00:02:33.880> dragons<00:02:34.360> right<00:02:34.540> in

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
like what's cooler than dragons right in

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.150 
like what's cooler than dragons right in
so<00:02:34.900> that's<00:02:35.080> why<00:02:35.200> we<00:02:35.410> that's<00:02:35.560> why<00:02:35.740> we<00:02:35.890> started

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
so that's why we that's why we started

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.280 
so that's why we that's why we started
what<00:02:36.730> are<00:02:36.820> your<00:02:36.880> eSports<00:02:37.360> aspirations<00:02:38.080> when

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
it comes to dragons and titans we want

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.810 
it comes to dragons and titans we want

your<00:02:58.030> weapon<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:58.990> you<00:02:59.080> have<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.230> lot<00:02:59.500> of

your weapon and so you have a lot of

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.920 
your weapon and so you have a lot of
control<00:03:00.130> as<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.459> what<00:03:00.640> your<00:03:00.820> five<00:03:01.030> skills<00:03:01.690> are

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
control as to what your five skills are

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.810 
control as to what your five skills are
in<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.230> game<00:03:02.440> when<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.070> other<00:03:03.190> ones<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.459> the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
in the game when the other ones the the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.370 
in the game when the other ones the the
character<00:03:04.240> you<00:03:04.360> pick<00:03:04.540> is<00:03:04.810> all<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.260> your

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
character you pick is all of your

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.230 
character you pick is all of your
abilities<00:03:05.860> so<00:03:06.100> we<00:03:06.580> really<00:03:06.790> think<00:03:06.910> that<00:03:07.000> gives

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
abilities so we really think that gives

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.030 
abilities so we really think that gives
a<00:03:07.360> lot<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.660> combinations<00:03:08.020> that<00:03:08.530> should<00:03:08.860> make

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
a lot of combinations that should make

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.090 
a lot of combinations that should make
for<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.280> lot<00:03:09.519> of<00:03:09.640> possibilities
