00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 the Yamal Peninsula faces a catastrophe with 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.970
 this statement was made by experts 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.309
 after we examined the area of ​​the village 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.410
 Bovanenkovo where this summer land 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.809
 discovered a monstrous funnel 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.639
 as it turned out not far from the giant 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.920
 I we recently appeared eight more 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.050
 Kratori smaller circle and according to 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.650
 experts soon number 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.740
 failures 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.840
 will only grow when and how will change 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.269
 the landscape of the peninsula which is mined 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.410
 the lion's share of Russian natural gas 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.180
 Ilya Daniltsev learned Elena now 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.770
 the researcher makes special 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.320
 card on which mark already 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.420
 existing funnels and places where they are 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.890
 only can appear and need to say 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.730
 the picture is bleak 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.239
 and my man top night dive in 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.219
 the abyss 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.079
 unique video Russian scientists 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.480
 descend to the bottom of the mysterious funnel 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.739
 in Yamal to find out what kind of power 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.660
 This has created a huge crater a huge 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.180
 Grotter near eviction would be wohnen 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.280
 who discovered this summer to name 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.129
 specific causes of the funnel 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.110
 60 meters in diameter and 30 depth 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.450
 the researchers did not dare somewhat 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.760
 months though there were several theories 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.950
 leaching of groundwater cavity in 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.110
 earth fall meteorite and even 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.360
 the activity of super mutants however 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.490
 the last option was offered not by scientists but 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.430
 new movie writers from the series of people 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.210
 X crater in Russia arose from migraine 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.340
 boys 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.890
 which controls things by the power of thought 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.689
 however, the preliminary findings of scientists 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.329
 after the last expedition 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.700
 destroys these theories geologists have discovered in 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.950
 rock on the surface of the crater excess 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.320
 methane molecule content and made 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.479
 the conclusion on the Yamal 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 deep gas which over the years 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.590
 accumulated in a natural underground 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.700
 tank or at some point 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.210
 gas pressure 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.240
 it turns out enough to 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.219
 tear apart the cobweb 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.140
 at first glance, the process is quite 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.390
 are natural however according to the professor 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.670
 Basil Epiphany literally for 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.649
 last few months like 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.200
 smaller scale emissions in Yamal 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.690
 happened 8 and all close to home 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.560
 no one like scientists before watching 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.560
 I didn't have to compare 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.989
 spoke of our mycelium if in one 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.520
 the place created the conditions for the fact that 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.200
 grown mushroom cleaner around scientists 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.660
 suggest that this chain reaction 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.310
 caused human activity not 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.230
 following certain rules 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.540
 conducting drilling operations led to 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.430
 that part of the gas was in the deep 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.950
 soil cavities and began to move 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.050
 further under a layer of earth and under conditions 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.450
 permafrost when groups constantly 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.680
 cracking due to low temperatures no one 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.709
 does not undertake to predict the direction 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.450
 we travel in such a place in such a place 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.569
 gas release is in several 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.790
 hundreds of meters and sometimes kilometers 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.670
 According to geologists, the Yamal land today 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.349
 this is a huge minefield unknown where 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.660
 the next emissions will happen quite 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.790
 it is possible that in some populated 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.200
 paragraph now researchers are scanning 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.360
 terrain using a special 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.610
 instrumentation and trying to map 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.709
 underground migration of natural gas about 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.989
 the results of their work will be immediately 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.400
 inform the press their residents of the area 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.400
 who are at risk
