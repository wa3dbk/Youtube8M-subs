only knows but I think when he sees big
like<00:00:56.010> Gerard<00:00:56.489> running<00:00:56.850> towards<00:00:57.210> him<00:00:57.239> he's

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
like Gerard running towards him he's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.760 
like Gerard running towards him he's
going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:57.719> about<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:58.079> confident<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.739> a
