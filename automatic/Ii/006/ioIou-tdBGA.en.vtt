00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
is really going to make this strong

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.760 
is really going to make this strong
might<00:01:20.000> do<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.240> same<00:01:20.270> movement<00:01:20.900> /<00:01:21.260> /<00:01:21.620> you're

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
might do the same movement / / you're

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.980 
might do the same movement / / you're
really<00:01:22.040> neurologically<00:01:22.730> going<00:01:23.030> to<00:01:23.090> force<00:01:23.720> the

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
really neurologically going to force the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.480 
really neurologically going to force the
muscle<00:01:24.320> to<00:01:24.410> grow<00:01:24.650> because<00:01:24.980> of<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.160> amount<00:01:25.280> of

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
muscle to grow because of the amount of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.330 
muscle to grow because of the amount of
volume<00:01:25.700> you're<00:01:26.000> putting<00:01:26.300> on<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:27.340> think

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
volume you're putting on it and think

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.310 
volume you're putting on it and think
that's<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:28.760> so<00:01:29.270> we're<00:01:29.570> going<00:01:29.660> to<00:01:29.750> go<00:01:29.810> over<00:01:29.900> here

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
that's it so we're going to go over here

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.990 
that's it so we're going to go over here
because<00:01:30.710> my<00:01:30.800> flexibility<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.610> that<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.820> best

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
because my flexibility is that the best

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.640 
because my flexibility is that the best
i'm<00:01:32.240> going<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.420> improvise<00:01:32.810> a<00:01:32.840> back<00:01:33.140> squats<00:01:33.530> for

min<00:03:37.310> theory<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.900> goals<00:03:39.200> I<00:03:39.500> mean<00:03:39.830> if<00:03:39.920> you're

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
min theory the goals I mean if you're

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.160 
min theory the goals I mean if you're

actually able to do 10 by 10 the weights

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.410 
actually able to do 10 by 10 the weights
aren't<00:03:42.380> heavy<00:03:42.530> enough<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:43.070> you<00:03:43.790> will<00:03:44.030> start

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
aren't heavy enough so you will start

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.060 
aren't heavy enough so you will start
failing<00:03:44.690> around<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.200> fifth<00:03:45.440> or<00:03:45.560> sixth<00:03:45.860> set

failing around the fifth or sixth set

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.940 
failing around the fifth or sixth set
and<00:03:46.870> your<00:03:47.870> reps<00:03:48.080> are<00:03:48.230> dropped<00:03:48.470> down<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.650> nine

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
and your reps are dropped down a nine

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.850 
and your reps are dropped down a nine
eight<00:03:49.340> seven<00:03:49.910> which<00:03:50.390> is<00:03:50.540> cool<00:03:50.780> that's<00:03:51.680> where

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
eight seven which is cool that's where

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.130 
eight seven which is cool that's where
the<00:03:51.950> benefit<00:03:52.280> happens<00:03:52.670> when<00:03:52.880> you<00:03:52.940> start<00:03:53.210> being

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
the benefit happens when you start being

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.050 
the benefit happens when you start being
able<00:03:54.380> to<00:03:54.470> get<00:03:54.530> closer<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.370> 10<00:03:55.520> by<00:03:55.670> 10<00:03:55.880> with

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
able to get closer to the 10 by 10 with

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.990 
able to get closer to the 10 by 10 with
the<00:03:56.090> same<00:03:56.360> way<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.230> use<00:03:57.560> all<00:03:57.710> meet<00:03:57.860> one<00:03:58.070> all

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
the same way to use all meet one all
