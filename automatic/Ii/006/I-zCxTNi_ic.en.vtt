00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.980
We need to get on our way ‘cause it’s
a three-hour run back to the mainland.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.990
And we need a cook up…

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.160
Well here we are in the middle of the Kimberley,
and behind me is this awesome little island.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.750
Now this is where we pulled up for the evening,
and we are going to camp on that beach tonight.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.750
But earlier on today we caught some reef fish
so I'm thinking a tricky way to put together

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:44.909
a bit of a dish using reef fish. So I'm thinking
lets go for reef fish stir-fry. Now sounds

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.079
complicated, but it's not. That's what cooking
in the boat's all about. Being uncomplicated,

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.010
because there's not a lot of room to work
with. It's a very cramped space, but we'll

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.040
see what we can do.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.320
So that's the reef fish, all nicely filleted
by Simon today. So I'm going to grab a pile

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.829
of that out, and I'm going to chop it all
up. Now what I'm going to do is, I want to

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:13.680
lightly fry the fish in some oil. But I want
to put a fish mix on it. So that's just basically

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.110
some flour, some herbs. All right, fish pieces
into the hot pan.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.900
In the meantime, we're going to get some noodles
going. So I've got some 2-minute noodles here.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.100
So basically just the ones out of the packet.
Now I'm going to stick one of the sachets

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.840
in. So we're just going to shove that in there
with that. Now I think if you were smart,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:50.440
you'd get the seafood flavour maybe. I've
just got some yellow flavouring. It's usually

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.439
pretty tasty anyway. So a bit of water in
that.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:08.159
Like I said, it's a bit cramped around here,
so you try and use whatever you can as a table.

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:18.199
Now fish is going along nicely. So behind
me, what I've got is chopped spring onions,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.440
broccoli, and I've got some capsicum, red
and green to give it a bit of flavour. And

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.650
also to give it a bit of colour. It's all
about the colour. And I've chopped up some

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.950
normal onion. It's just some brown onions,
okay? So we're going to fry that up first,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.450
but first of all, we wait for the fish to
get done. And then we're going to be ready

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.709
to start on the onion.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.080
All right, now that your fish is going all
nice and brown and crispy, what we'll do is,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.200
get her on a plate on a bit of paper towel,
and get it out of the frying pan. Now I'm

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.500
going to use that hot oil to cook my onion.
I'm going to start the whole stir-fry component

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.720
of our reef fish stir fry. So we'll get the
onion in, so in she goes. Now we want some

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.410
garlic; I've just got the old tube garlic
here. All right, that's our onion browning.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:23.319
Capsicum in. Broccoli. Spring onion goes in.
And I've got some bamboo shoots, sliced. All

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.499
right, there we go, so while that's sitting
there, I'm going to make up the sauce. How

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.780
do you make the sauce? We'd better get a bit
of this hoisin sauce. We'll get a bit of that.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:43.820
Take the lid off. There we go. A bit of the
old hoisin sauce. I've got some soy here,

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.200
some soya sauce. Everyone's favourite, the
old soya sauce.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:05.280
Here we go. Soy. We whack some sweet chilli
in. In she goes. Now you want to get that

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.560
through. The fish, basically, you just want
to sit that in there, like that. Nice and

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.579
gentle. Remember to be gentle with your fish.
And then we want to fold that in. You've got

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.479
to get yourself some noodles.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.020
Reef fish stir fry. Chuck that on top there.
And there we have it. And that's what you

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:32.760
call reef fish stir-fry on a bed of noodles.
It's pretty good tucker for in the boat. Sun's

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.879
just dropped down over the horizon. And I
reckon it's time to hook in to a bit of tucker.

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.599
Sit back and relax.
