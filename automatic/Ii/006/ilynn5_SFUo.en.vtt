in it the weirdest damn thing walking
along<00:02:20.930> this<00:02:21.050> trail<00:02:21.760> these<00:02:22.760> branches<00:02:23.330> are<00:02:23.450> just

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
along this trail these branches are just

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.460 
along this trail these branches are just
quivering<00:02:24.170> it's<00:02:24.680> not<00:02:24.860> breezy<00:02:25.160> right<00:02:25.460> here

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
quivering it's not breezy right here

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.990 
quivering it's not breezy right here
this<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.680> quivering<00:02:28.220> tree<00:02:28.580> from<00:02:28.820> the

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
this is the quivering tree from the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.690 
this is the quivering tree from the
other<00:02:29.090> side<00:02:29.420> it's<00:02:29.990> just<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.320> damndest<00:02:30.830> thing

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.550 

all<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.270> can<00:02:36.330> think<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.200> other<00:02:37.319> end

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
all I can think of is that the other end

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.360 
all I can think of is that the other end
of<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.770> tree<00:02:38.629> must<00:02:39.629> be<00:02:40.129> dipped<00:02:41.129> down<00:02:41.310> into

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
of this tree must be dipped down into

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.809 
of this tree must be dipped down into
the<00:02:41.790> river<00:02:42.120> there<00:02:42.360> he's<00:02:42.780> just<00:02:42.959> getting

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
the river there he's just getting

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.949 
the river there he's just getting
continually<00:02:44.819> uh<00:02:46.340> jiggled<00:02:47.480> this<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.629> a<00:02:48.660> pretty

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
continually uh jiggled this is a pretty

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.449 
continually uh jiggled this is a pretty
damn<00:02:49.200> beat<00:02:49.590> trail<00:02:49.950> on<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:51.620> midway<00:02:52.620> point<00:02:52.920> down

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
damn beat trail on the midway point down

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.710 
damn beat trail on the midway point down
the<00:02:53.610> Elwha<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.120> think<00:02:54.330> I'm<00:02:54.390> gonna<00:02:54.510> be<00:02:54.660> able

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
the Elwha but I think I'm gonna be able

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.940 
the Elwha but I think I'm gonna be able
to<00:02:54.840> get<00:02:54.930> down<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.290> old<00:02:55.410> lake<00:02:55.560> bed

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
to get down to the old lake bed

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.050 
to get down to the old lake bed
okay<00:02:56.489> now<00:02:56.670> I'm<00:02:56.849> down<00:02:57.060> by<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.300> river<00:02:58.849> you<00:02:59.849> can

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
okay now I'm down by the river you can

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.710 
okay now I'm down by the river you can
see<00:03:00.360> all<00:03:00.540> these<00:03:00.750> old<00:03:00.830> stumps<00:03:02.330> from<00:03:03.330> what<00:03:03.569> was

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720

see all these old stumps from what was
once<00:03:03.750> logged<00:03:04.530> out<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:04.890> then<00:03:05.160> they<00:03:05.310> flooded

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
once logged out and then they flooded

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.070
