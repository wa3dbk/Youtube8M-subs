00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:08.440
 and how are you here again angelito 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:13.930
 gonzÃ¡lez as it is a good new name 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:16.900
 because today I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.849
 fishing rod 0 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:24.810
 how am I living on your fence 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.810
 good first step 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.679
 a wood or metal stick 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.679
 very resistant 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.900
 a bit of 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.000
 and we change it 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.000
 and of course very thick 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.750
 they give him 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.180
 and finally I just 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.180
 a needle 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.960
 the first step will be to tie the needle 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.090
 here where you have the hole as you will see 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.159
 I have it tied because it's a bit 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.719
 complicated delay 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.719
 and do it why not 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.670
 second step 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.740
 let's take the thread 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.400
 by the way I'm from 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.400
 and the 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.170
 it has to be long another time that 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.170
 drag 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.970
 first step let's take a good chunk 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.690
 of thread as you will see is a lot I can not 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.770
 teach 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.800
 but just step let's take the stick of 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.850
 wood 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.850
 and we are going to entangle 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.530
 I was so hope 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.819
 I'm checking 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.880
 who can you advance to the video 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.880
 where 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.450
 good 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.640
 let's stay like this 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.640
 nothing else we are going to make the knot 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.620
 what will be and local in return 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.689
 and it will be like that 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.550
 as we will see cuts for 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.450
 distant is not going to break and we wanted it 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.450
 for her 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.970
 I'm already tied here to the needle 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.510
 and the thread 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.510
 and that's it 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.180
 good 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:06.340
 all this that 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:09.120
 the thread has to be a bit long 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.120
 so that it is 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.459
 it stays like this 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.130
 once we did that because it gives you 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.850
 our cane now does move us around 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.850
 on the beach 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.820
 as I had nothing to do 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.820
 I decided to do the cane 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:35.860
 about an hour away from the beach and 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.000
 i 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:48.290
 and I'll go next good week 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.290
 this has been everything and this 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.070
 that has been all
