 before it gets hot we will accommodate 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.180
 well and what this is going to do is that you 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.360
 will give color and how are we going to use 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.070
 sugar and it 's a sweet dish then it's going to 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.520
 to be perfect we are going to have to take out 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.900
 america we are going to put sugar sugar 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.510

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.570
 in the water and let's make a water of 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.280
 sugar well and a while then the 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.250
 sugar is like this we're going to do it down 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.730
 black banana 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.050
 to make it clear that they take that color 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.540
 excellent let's move with a fork 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.550
 very carefully so that whenever 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.760
 we look for it, we move it very carefully 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.070
 so that bananas are not lacking 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.580
 we continue to develop it looking for then 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.610
 to brown 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.100
 and then now is when we go to 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.340
 keep putting water a little bit of water 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.650
 truth and something very important that we are going to 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.960
 power now that is cinnamon now that 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.020
 come on now that we 're going to put more and more 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.640
 water to put the cinnamon question of if 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.980
 It was the amount that I like a lot 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.870
 cinnamon I like to put it true and 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.480
 well I like to put enough 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.360
 you will know cinnamon is very strong and 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.370
 here is going to release an aroma and the taste of 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.230
 cinnamon also in bananas 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.230
 mature to the caul so be it 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.780
 Now I'm going to put another little bit of 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.430
 Water 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:52.330

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.330
 and I want the banana to cook now 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.120
 in the process first I know about a 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.510
 little bit then we are joining them 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.599

 is cooked truly is cooked excellent 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.930
 Remember that the more mature you are 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.800
 the banana much better 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.930

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.510
 missing unless I have the amount 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.130
