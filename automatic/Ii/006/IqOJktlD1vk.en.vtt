00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
this is like the only map they give you

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.120 
this is like the only map they give you
I<00:01:10.970> did<00:01:11.970> survival<00:01:12.630> mode<00:01:12.780> exam<00:01:13.080> oh<00:01:13.320> shit<00:01:13.710> that's

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
I did survival mode exam oh shit that's

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.760 
I did survival mode exam oh shit that's
a<00:01:14.220> lot<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.369> dudes<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.909> did<00:01:15.659> survival<00:01:16.320> zombies

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
a lot of dudes I did survival zombies

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.770 
a lot of dudes I did survival zombies
and<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.310> believe<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.759> still<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.150> same<00:01:18.180> map

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and I believe it's still the same map

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.850 
and I believe it's still the same map
but<00:01:19.369> just<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.549> different<00:01:21.119> that's<00:01:22.020> that's

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
but just it's different that's that's

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.440 
but just it's different that's that's
the<00:01:23.100> best<00:01:23.280> way<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> can<00:01:23.549> put<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.030> different

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
the best way I can put it it's different

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.450 
the best way I can put it it's different
but<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.200> still<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> same<00:01:25.590> thing<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.340> know

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
but it's still the same thing you know

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.359 
but it's still the same thing you know
it's<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.150> map<00:01:27.680> so<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.710> wish<00:01:29.009> they<00:01:29.159> would<00:01:29.280> be

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
it's this map so I wish they would be

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.429 
it's this map so I wish they would be
given<00:01:29.610> us<00:01:29.729> more<00:01:29.970> map<00:01:30.180> choices<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:30.960> they<00:01:31.229> did

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
given us more map choices like they did

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.840 
given us more map choices like they did
with<00:01:31.650> black<00:01:32.340> ops<00:01:32.579> 1<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> rocky<00:01:33.600> no<00:01:33.810> I

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
with black ops 1 like the rocky no I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.219 
with black ops 1 like the rocky no I
believe<00:01:35.850> they<00:01:36.030> gave<00:01:36.180> us<00:01:36.360> older<00:01:36.720> man<00:01:36.900> will<00:01:37.110> they

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
believe they gave us older man will they

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.770 
believe they gave us older man will they
eventually<00:01:37.380> us<00:01:37.979> older<00:01:38.280> maps<00:01:38.540> but<00:01:39.540> then<00:01:39.659> there

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
eventually us older maps but then there

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.260 
eventually us older maps but then there
was<00:01:39.810> fine<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.829> then<00:01:41.009> sentient<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.060> can

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
was fine and then sentient and they can

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.810 
was fine and then sentient and they can
do<00:01:42.390> every<00:01:42.630> maps<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.110> look<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.640> take<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
do every maps and look at this take the
