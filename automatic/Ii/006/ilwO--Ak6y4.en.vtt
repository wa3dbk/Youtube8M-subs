00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.600
 when you blog instead of make up 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.699
 tutorial you're most used to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.439
 but I know you can also really 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.600
 a whole other side of bit like you 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.160
 show something that I in any past 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.380
 quite a lot of fashion items at the moment 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.150
 purchased and I really enjoy myself 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.099
 to share with you this time 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.020
 about the inspiration to the oldest 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.180
 and if you are curious 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.910
 to a quick and then purchase I have 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.350
 done keep looking cozy like 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.600
 first of all I would like to leave you 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.760
 see this black and white striped top 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.610
 I took this with me at the H&amp;M 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.860
 so of a fairly thick quality and it 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.199
 is also quite short he could handle exactly that 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.120
 the top of my pants but that 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.920
 I think it's fun about it 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.809
 and these stripes are reminiscent of one 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.430
 kind of marine style but I think so 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.010
 a very chic style and I love it 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.250
 Personally it is chain comes too 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.000
 from the radio and that 795 and this blouse 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.010
 was 2995 and yes I am actually quite 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.450
 very happy with test 2 purchase because I think 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.159
 that I can really do this very well 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.990
 combine with other items from with 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.939
 wardrobe 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.509
 I am thinking, for example, of a white 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.369
 shirt and below that you really 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.810
 classic black pumps that example 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.400
 really a combination that i will wear 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.080
 when I go out for a night or maybe 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.670
 grab a terrace 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.720
 and yes i think you have much more that 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.790
 you can come for example you can 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.610
 also plug in 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.070
 you can go with leather pants or even with 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.540
 jeans and also for now 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.880
 for example, not even a bit colder 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.470
 just a good black it stayed you there 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.180
 across 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.950
 the next item that I really want 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.149
 show that this is this and chic blouse 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.579
 with floral print 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.250
 and this one I bought online and 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.560
 via the miss selfridge site 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.270
 discounted if this is now around 25 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.979
 euro I am not sure what 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.590
 the prices there are displayed in 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.659
 english pounds and these tactically on your 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.460
 quite short in one comes on just now 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.500
 gram at the top of my pants 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.600
 and that I like it so much is that 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.150
 This stylish jacket that all was 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.010
 Woven fabric was made when I was that good 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.510
 but it boils down to that 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.850
 it just seems like someone's just doing this 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.380
 embroidered on by hand 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.300
 and the blood is actually quite one 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.400
 expensive appearance too that is actually 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.170
 I do n't think this is at all 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.080
 blog will quite often wear in the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.480
 summer months with white jeans 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.480
 with matching pad with a metal jaw 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.310
 because he's really a metallic french 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.020
 over seer I think this blouse 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.630
 every outfit is a very feminine one 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.030

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.470

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.209
