00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.300
 said or in this third issue of the 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.980
 episode 1 of spartan all this part 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.780
 of the first season the story of 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.820
 this mission goes more or less like this 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.410
 part of the crimson squadron you're sent 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.480
 by orders of the commander to return 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.310
 to deactivate certain key objectives 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.109
 another remarkable thing is that 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.849
 chronologically this is the first 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.679
 Meeting with the promised ones 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.630
 of the crimson squad taking advantage of that 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.580
 the majestic squad and crimson had 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.560
 exactly the same objectives in 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.630
 bases equal but only separated 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.190
 in different locations palmer had the 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.050
 idea of giving them a challenge to see what 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.940
 squadron ended earlier and this for 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.680
 determine who was better between the two 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.900
 squads their first goal is 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.940
 pretty simple and short only 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.920
 you must deactivate the antenna that prevents 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.420
 the communications and so interference 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.880
 with the radio once you have 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.590
 completed you must clear two towers one 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.360
 that is to the east and another that is 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.220
 find to the west of this small map 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.630
 once you make way for the 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.190
 first tower you must lend to a 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.410
 switch that should be enough 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.240
 to proceed to the second on your way 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.070
 until the second tower you must remember 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.110
 that watchers can invoke more 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.060
 trailers or worse yet they can activate 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.500
 turrets form artists which are 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.300
 a great annoyance once 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.490
 that you manage to deactivate the second tower 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.530
 will have its penultimate objective which 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.180
 is to activate the central tower which is 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.520
 find up to the top of the map is 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.229
 fortified perfectly by waters and 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.000
 crawler so it's normal if you take a 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.620
 little time to complete once what 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.540
 you get what remains to survive 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.220
 you must essentially build your way 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.020
 until the landing area where palmer 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.910
 will ask you to defend and protect the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.650
 place until it is clear the water 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.360
 integrate to send more crawlers from 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.310
 Inside mistakes and trailers 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.900
 of course to kill when you complete 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.400
 you should have won the challenge 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.110
 against the competitor squad 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.580
 majestic in addition to having survived 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.649
 your first encounter with the defenders 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.540
 from king I went to the Prometheus once I 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.130
 everything is ready, you just have to wait 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.020
 the publish pick you up and there would be 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.550
 finished the mission but well that was 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.140
 all for this video if you liked it 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.910
 subscribe is the easiest way to 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.830
 know when there will be a new video if it 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.960
 I enjoyed or at least damage was helpful 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.780
 I like to leave your comments and we 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.770
 we'll see until next time to sing in 343 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.770
