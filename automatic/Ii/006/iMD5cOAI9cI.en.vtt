00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
season even starts but you know it's a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
season even starts but you know it's a
fun<00:01:32.700> topic<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.330> I'm<00:01:33.450> wondering<00:01:33.600> how<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.229> guys

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470

fun topic so I'm wondering how you guys
feel<00:01:34.770> coming<00:01:35.100> into<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.399> season<00:01:35.610> because<00:01:35.880> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
feel coming into the season because you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.430 
feel coming into the season because you
may<00:01:36.210> feel<00:01:36.390> differently<00:01:36.780> coming<00:01:37.110> out<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.259> the

season I think obviously a lot is going

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.980 
season I think obviously a lot is going
to<00:01:39.750> depend<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:40.170> how<00:01:40.229> he<00:01:40.409> looks<00:01:41.450> how<00:01:42.450> healthy<00:01:42.750> he

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
to depend on how he looks how healthy he

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.399 
to depend on how he looks how healthy he
looks<00:01:43.380> how<00:01:44.369> well<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.270> Achilles<00:01:46.260> has
