00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
are there's no window pieces so I'd have

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.330 
are there's no window pieces so I'd have
to<00:02:20.790> order<00:02:21.090> those<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.290> know<00:02:22.320> those<00:02:22.440> trans

things<00:02:36.030> for<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.270> engines<00:02:36.630> which<00:02:36.780> were

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
things for the engines which were

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.200 
things for the engines which were
probably<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.290> hardware<00:02:37.620> piece<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.950> find

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
probably a hardware piece to find

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.270 
probably a hardware piece to find
luckily<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.240> had<00:02:39.570> these<00:02:39.840> no<00:02:40.140> geez<00:02:40.530> luckily<00:02:41.250> I

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
black when I get around to it but it's

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.120 
black when I get around to it but it's
not<00:03:19.709> really<00:03:19.920> priority<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:21.630> don't<00:03:22.620> know<00:03:22.709> but<00:03:23.010> I'm

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
shouldn't scrap that that's almost

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.699 
shouldn't scrap that that's almost
complete<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:30.030> won't<00:03:30.780> I'm<00:03:31.020> probably<00:03:31.530> not
