00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
same thing now if you're too lazy to

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.020 
same thing now if you're too lazy to
even<00:04:22.079> do<00:04:22.410> that<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.950> that<00:04:23.370> takes<00:04:23.640> too<00:04:23.880> much

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
even do that and that takes too much

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.510 
even do that and that takes too much
effort<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:24.810> end<00:04:24.960> up<00:04:25.190> having<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.280> take<00:04:26.340> a

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
effort that you end up having to take a

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.100 
effort that you end up having to take a
breather<00:04:26.880> after<00:04:27.180> you<00:04:27.450> do<00:04:27.570> that<00:04:27.600> because<00:04:27.900> it's

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
breather after you do that because it's

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.500 
breather after you do that because it's
like<00:04:28.350> so<00:04:28.650> difficult<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.310> tedious<00:04:29.490> well<00:04:30.330> you

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
like so difficult and tedious well you

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.660 
like so difficult and tedious well you
can<00:04:30.630> actually<00:04:30.750> edit<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.320> sir<00:04:31.650> or<00:04:31.920> modify<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.490> or

can actually edit it sir or modify it or
whatever<00:04:32.970> so<00:04:33.540> that's<00:04:33.660> even<00:04:34.080> easier<00:04:34.320> than<00:04:34.560> just

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
whatever so that's even easier than just

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.220

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
something that's really easy to remember

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.080 
something that's really easy to remember
for<00:05:17.880> inserting<00:05:18.210> text<00:05:18.480> would<00:05:19.110> be<00:05:19.260> ctrl<00:05:19.620> T<00:05:19.770> so<00:05:20.640> if

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
for inserting text would be ctrl T so if

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.770 
for inserting text would be ctrl T so if
I<00:05:21.270> hit<00:05:21.390> ctrl<00:05:21.780> T<00:05:21.960> it<00:05:22.830> shows<00:05:23.700> my<00:05:24.090> shortcuts<00:05:24.630> that

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
I hit ctrl T it shows my shortcuts that

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.230 
I hit ctrl T it shows my shortcuts that
already<00:05:25.230> have<00:05:25.440> control<00:05:25.919> tea<00:05:26.130> in<00:05:26.280> it<00:05:26.400> this<00:05:26.940> one

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
already have control tea in it this one

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.210 
already have control tea in it this one
edit<00:05:27.690> thought<00:05:27.930> shrimp<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.800> keyboard

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
edit thought shrimp the keyboard

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.790

shortcut<00:05:29.610> for<00:05:29.640> edit<00:05:30.090> trim<00:05:30.450> would<00:05:31.140> be<00:05:31.290> ctrl<00:05:31.650> T

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
shortcut for edit trim would be ctrl T

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
shortcut for edit trim would be ctrl T
so<00:05:32.220> we<00:05:32.550> can't<00:05:32.910> use<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.680> ctrl<00:05:34.680> T<00:05:34.890> on<00:05:35.100> text<00:05:35.640> media

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
so we can't use the ctrl T on text media

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.659 
so we can't use the ctrl T on text media
