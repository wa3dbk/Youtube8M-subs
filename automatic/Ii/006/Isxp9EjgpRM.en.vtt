00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.100
 Baptists if so much 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.590
 batista70phone friends today I do 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.480
 seeing another rom is called omniroma 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.680
 let's see directly in the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.400
 phone info settings like 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.050
 you can see omni version 4.4.2 la 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.079
 kernel version is always the same 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.180
 which is the 3.4 that the last available in 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.390
 expectation of 3.10 which should lead 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.930
 real improvements including 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.579
 also the use of art instead 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.829
 that of the derby however that for him 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.090
 we'll see when it comes out 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.980
 let's see what are the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.109
 main customizations as you can 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.390
 note a fairly sober Rome not a 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.910
 particular things for example I do not have 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.910
 found the function for the king size of 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.769
 but there is the possibility of having 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.809
 the very immersive or extended destop 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.339
 how do you want to call it in the toolbar 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.500
 state we can put the control 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.270
 the brightness above the number of 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.160
 very convenient notifications appear on the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.680
 number of notifications speed 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.369
 network network activity where the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.030
 pull down 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.470
 you can choose which way to do 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.570
 dragging the bar if make appear 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.790
 directly the settings or not me 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.619
 I chose to have it here on the right if 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.329
 I do it centrally or on the other side 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.500
 I find the notifications I have to say it's one 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.119
 good comfort 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.960
 let's take a ride only instead of 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.810
 two general let's say va well then there are 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.570
 the arrival connections the rapid 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.619
 through which we can decide over 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.560
 to google now 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.159
 what other functions to apply I have 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.200
 chosen the screenshot and the ringtone 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.039
 let's say to put it in mode or 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.719
 silent vibration or ringtone for 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.930
 is that in any case it is one more thing and it is 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.120
 quite 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.910
 comfortable let's see what else there 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.410
 offers menus we have the possibility of 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.140
 choose the data connection 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.290
 I then activated the screenshot show 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.410
 shot show screen log display 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.940
 airplane mode and you that to audio then 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.990
 what is this menu a lot 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.820
 shutdown 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.910
 when I go to turn off it offers me these 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.209
 things including the screen record 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.310
 very convenient if you want to do a say 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.740
 a video capture of what you are 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.570
 doing on your screen to me 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.750
 really like it I used it a lot of the time 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.840
 of windows mobile 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.280
 then what else we have notification area 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.230
 notification leader imposed the background of the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.120
 notification panel with an image 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.100
 based on current date and time and is that 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.570
 what did I do 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.750
 so as you can see above we have 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.670
 this red bar that indicates 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.560
 that it's sunny now I don't know if you do 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.060
 you can see pretty good come 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.459
 outside the image of a city ​​we say 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.400
 with the sun in the background nothing 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.890
 particular but it's pretty nice then 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.180
 what else we have the tve display 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.010
 I didn't activate because I didn't 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.480
 you are interested but you can have the text 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.299
 notifications around the ring of 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.850
 unlock all notifications hide 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.160
 those of low priority activate the 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.200
 pocket mode sunlight mode that 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.150
 never invert the colors and miscellaneous 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.450
 show date type customizations 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.750
 show mpm display and display 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.430
 threshold proximity of the display time 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.799
 notifications notification the brightness of 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.049
 notifications I do not like I have not activated 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.780
 so in the meantime we have two emails yes 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.299
 the number above is also activated 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.360
 indicating that there are two e-mails is 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.930
 little one is really small but yes yes 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.420
 note let's see what else we have the 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.180
 monster button close position of 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.519
 we have placed the button on the bottom 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.720
 on the right this is practically necessary 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.239
 when there is the application menu 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.739
 recent on display in memory and position 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.720
 indicator memories we can choose 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.000
 where to put it I do first to do it to you 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.380
 see what happens here as 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.550
 see above we have indicator 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.380
 of the memory we have 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.150
 with the various applications that they are 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.770
 open in the background 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.570
 if we click here it goes to close it 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.070
 directly what to say are few 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.710
 functions let's say there is no one 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.530
 extreme customization, however, Rome 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:22.300
 I must say that really very light 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.280
 leaves so much free ram really to mine 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.100
 opinion is not bad 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.570
 now I wanted to show a little one 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.910
 little program that advised me that 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.010
 it is called all in one gesture through the 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.150
 which we can enable gestures ad 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.980
 example to hide the keys below 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.930
 nor can we enable different ones for example 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.340
 if we go under par and ha we have the 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.950
 chance to tell him when 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.290
 we swipe or touch the part 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.960
 this opens the home applications 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.020
 recent status bar or we can 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.450
 also choose various screenshots how much 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.150
 boost direct contact composition 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.250
 gmail or even we can choose 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.680
 of the app with a swipe activate an is 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.210
 an app then me for my convenience to 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.730
 not overcoat areas too 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.300
 I chose only two gestures that second 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:13.630
 me are those fundamental left area from 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.240
 a raitalia back through those now 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.830
 I will show you that it is still possible 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.290
 with a little patience let's say a little 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.840
 manual handling everything then now 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:26.440
 we are here no we do that I enter into 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.510
 any application entered the 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.310
 gallery in this case I have to go back 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.780
 back or I want to go 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.200
 directly to the home to return 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.050
 back 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.610
 I swipe a moment 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.100
 manual work you have to take it well here 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.480
 or return to the gallery I want 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.680
 go to the home I swipe 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.740
 on the other side and I find myself in the 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.690
 in the home as you see two very small ones 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.110
 gesture that my way of seeing can 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:54.440
 replace easily between the keys 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.330
 below it is the small buttons below 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.639
 you want to activate any mode 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.220
 just do this the small keys you have ad 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.860
 example I want to close the applications 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.199
 open and I go to click here and came to 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.600
 close just to say if you need it 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:11.300
 but I don't particularly need it 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.680
 for my use as I told you 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.810
 just having those two is there for example 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.720
 I'm here I want to go back to the home of it 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:20.240
 excuse the swipe and come back directly 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.910
 as you can see, the word home or appears 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.759
 I repeat I am in an application I want 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.590
 go back I do the back and blacks 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:30.110
 come back quietly this is 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.449
 a very small application very much 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.270
 easy to use, it's called all in 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.949
 one gesture signaled it to me 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.590
 mario if I remember correctly then 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:41.000
 thank you and how you see it works in 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.289
 excellent way 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.750
 fashion must be taken a moment 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:48.050
 manual dexterity with 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.730
 however with the keys as you see it is not is not 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.320
 difficult to use and this is a bit 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.120
 the speech I did that I think 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.660
 implementing a couple of small gestures 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.770
 you can do everything there is also the kill up 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.020
 with various gestures you can close 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.830
 the app who give it at the time there 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.390
 are various functions we say with this 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:13.870
 concluded greeting from la reis alias 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:18.480
 Well so much for batista70 batista70phone 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.480
