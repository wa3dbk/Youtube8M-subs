two<00:00:30.680> classes<00:00:30.950> out<00:00:31.220> of<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.369> way<00:00:31.430> that<00:00:31.880> I<00:00:31.910> would

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
two classes out of the way that I would

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.370 
two classes out of the way that I would
have<00:00:32.149> had<00:00:32.329> to<00:00:32.419> take<00:00:32.599> during<00:00:32.899> the<00:00:33.020> regular

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
semester and now that they're done I can

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.510 
semester and now that they're done I can
take<00:00:35.660> the<00:00:35.989> next<00:00:36.230> classes<00:00:36.680> in<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:36.950> order<00:00:37.220> which

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
take the next classes in the order which

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.220 
take the next classes in the order which
puts<00:00:37.880> me<00:00:38.030> ahead<00:00:38.149> by<00:00:38.480> about<00:00:38.720> half<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:39.050> semester

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
puts me ahead by about half a semester

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.510 
puts me ahead by about half a semester
which<00:00:39.649> is<00:00:39.770> really<00:00:39.980> nice

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
practical than the theoretical things

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.280 
practical than the theoretical things
you<00:00:54.010> would<00:00:54.100> learn<00:00:54.250> in<00:00:54.280> class<00:00:55.080> learning<00:00:56.080> a<00:00:56.170> lot

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
you would learn in class learning a lot

you would learn in class learning a lot
more<00:00:56.560> about<00:00:56.830> the<00:00:56.980> specific<00:00:57.489> equations

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
more about the specific equations

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.330 
more about the specific equations
putting<00:00:58.450> them<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:59.020> use<00:00:59.290> and<00:00:59.680> running<00:00:59.950> the<00:01:00.070> test

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
putting them to use and running the test

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.880 
putting them to use and running the test
I'm<00:01:01.120> learning<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.140> kind<00:01:02.350> of<00:01:02.379> research<00:01:02.650> that<00:01:02.710> I

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
I'm learning the kind of research that I

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.719 
I'm learning the kind of research that I
would<00:01:03.010> actually<00:01:03.129> be<00:01:03.460> doing<00:01:03.760> after<00:01:03.879> I<00:01:04.059> graduate

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
would actually be doing after I graduate

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.010 
would actually be doing after I graduate
