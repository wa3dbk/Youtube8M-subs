00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
just makes it easier because children

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.960 
just makes it easier because children
have<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:34.950> hard<00:04:35.130> time<00:04:35.250> making<00:04:35.400> up<00:04:35.610> their<00:04:35.760> mind

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
giving you know the free rein to say I

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.190 
giving you know the free rein to say I
want<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:38.940> be<00:04:39.030> this<00:04:39.180> and<00:04:39.480> you<00:04:39.720> know<00:04:39.840> if<00:04:39.960> I<00:04:40.050> have<00:04:40.169> a

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
want to be this and you know if I have a

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.510 
want to be this and you know if I have a
line<00:04:40.380> of<00:04:40.410> children<00:04:40.860> that<00:04:40.890> I<00:04:41.040> need<00:04:41.190> to<00:04:41.310> paint

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
line of children that I need to paint

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.080 
line of children that I need to paint
and<00:04:41.790> it<00:04:42.000> just<00:04:42.150> makes<00:04:42.300> more<00:04:42.450> sense<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.840> have

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
and it just makes more sense to have

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.120 
and it just makes more sense to have
choices<00:04:45.090> to<00:04:45.540> narrow<00:04:46.080> down<00:04:46.200> and<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.710> helps<00:04:46.950> me

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
choices to narrow down and it helps me

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.690 
choices to narrow down and it helps me
put<00:04:47.610> this<00:04:47.730> on<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.030> flow<00:04:48.510> of<00:04:48.540> a<00:04:48.900> business<00:04:49.700> when

put this on the flow of a business when

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.220 
put this on the flow of a business when
it<00:04:50.730> comes<00:04:50.940> to<00:04:51.090> body<00:04:51.240> painting<00:04:51.780> or<00:04:51.990> what<00:04:52.140> I'm

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230

things like that Superman spider-man so

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.640 
things like that Superman spider-man so
there's<00:05:15.879> a<00:05:15.939> theme<00:05:16.210> then<00:05:16.539> obviously<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.349> can't

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
there's a theme then obviously I can't

guidelines because i don't in my opinion
that's<00:07:18.599> just<00:07:18.900> maybe<00:07:19.380> it's<00:07:19.500> the<00:07:19.650> artists<00:07:19.979> way

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520

that's just maybe it's the artists way
but<00:07:21.090> i<00:07:21.300> just<00:07:21.659> think<00:07:21.780> that<00:07:21.930> if<00:07:22.169> you<00:07:22.320> want<00:07:22.470> to<00:07:22.560> do

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.650 
but i just think that if you want to do

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.070 
but i just think that if you want to do
something<00:07:22.889> you<00:07:23.280> can<00:07:23.430> do<00:07:23.520> it<00:07:23.699> and<00:07:24.080> anything's

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 
something you can do it and anything's
