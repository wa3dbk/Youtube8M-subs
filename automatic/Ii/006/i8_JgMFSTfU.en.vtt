steel frame it's beautiful in the
cracking<00:03:39.379> of<00:03:39.530> conditions<00:03:40.010> they<00:03:40.160> still<00:03:40.400> pull

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
cracking of conditions they still pull

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.280 
cracking of conditions they still pull
huge<00:03:40.970> amounts<00:03:41.269> of<00:03:41.329> money<00:03:41.480> in<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.959> best<00:03:42.169> of

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
hundred dollars all day long so be on

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.460 
hundred dollars all day long so be on
the<00:03:47.209> lookout<00:03:47.569> for<00:03:47.629> these<00:03:47.870> bikes<00:03:48.169> they're

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
the lookout for these bikes they're

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.759 
the lookout for these bikes they're
really<00:03:48.980> really<00:03:49.549> neat<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.319> yeah<00:03:51.319> the<00:03:51.440> defining

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
really really neat and yeah the defining

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.589 
really really neat and yeah the defining
characteristics<00:03:52.489> of<00:03:52.579> these<00:03:52.819> then<00:03:53.120> actually

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
characteristics of these then actually

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.170 
characteristics of these then actually
remade<00:03:54.049> them<00:03:54.230> in<00:03:54.409> the<00:03:54.799> past<00:03:55.099> three<00:03:55.400> years<00:03:55.519> so

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
remade them in the past three years so

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.539 
remade them in the past three years so
don't<00:03:56.629> look<00:03:56.870> for<00:03:57.079> those<00:03:57.349> but<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.069> lot<00:03:58.220> of<00:03:58.280> times

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
don't look for those but a lot of times

00:03:58.549 --> 00:03:59.830 
don't look for those but a lot of times
look<00:03:58.730> for<00:03:58.879> the<00:03:58.970> ones<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.299> have<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.510> stick

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
look for the ones that have the stick

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.659 
look for the ones that have the stick
shifter<00:04:00.169> when<00:04:00.319> it<00:04:00.440> did<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.680> remake<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:01.250> the

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
shifter when it did the remake and the

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:02.920 
shifter when it did the remake and the
more<00:04:01.819> current<00:04:02.030> ones<00:04:02.239> they<00:04:02.329> don't<00:04:02.540> have<00:04:02.750> this

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
more current ones they don't have this

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.990 
more current ones they don't have this
part<00:04:03.199> in<00:04:03.409> okay<00:04:03.769> so<00:04:04.340> that's<00:04:04.669> one<00:04:04.819> of<00:04:04.909> the

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
part in okay so that's one of the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.939 
part in okay so that's one of the
defining<00:04:05.690> things<00:04:06.049> hell<00:04:06.319> if<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:06.560> even<00:04:06.829> find

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:06.949 
defining things hell if you even find

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.050 
defining things hell if you even find
this<00:04:07.069> thing<00:04:07.280> laying<00:04:07.489> around<00:04:07.760> with<00:04:07.879> someone
