here's<00:00:04.350> our<00:00:04.500> progression<00:00:06.410> and<00:00:07.410> we've<00:00:07.559> already

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:07.769 
here's our progression and we've already

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:09.650 
here's our progression and we've already
covered<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.400> starting<00:00:08.970> with<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.269> E<00:00:09.300> minor

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:22.400 
covered it starting with the E minor
fool<00:00:10.669> I'll<00:00:11.669> review<00:00:12.299> that<00:00:12.509> just<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.839> show<00:00:13.049> you

I<00:00:23.390> am<00:00:24.390> getting<00:00:24.570> my<00:00:24.869> cords<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.529> my<00:00:25.650> scales<00:00:26.010> all

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
I am getting my cords and my scales all

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.019 
I am getting my cords and my scales all
associated<00:00:26.939> over<00:00:27.360> these<00:00:27.510> forms<00:00:28.460> d<00:00:29.460> minor<00:00:29.760> with

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
associated over these forms d minor with

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.030 
associated over these forms d minor with
the<00:00:30.119> E<00:00:30.150> minor<00:00:30.420> form<00:00:30.930> a<00:00:31.400> with<00:00:32.400> a<00:00:32.430> deform<00:00:34.040> deal

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the E minor form a with a deform deal

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.580 
the E minor form a with a deform deal
with<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> G<00:00:35.580> form<00:00:36.170> and<00:00:37.170> that's<00:00:37.379> how<00:00:37.500> i'm

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
with the G form and that's how i'm

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.820 
with the G form and that's how i'm
getting<00:00:37.680> my<00:00:37.920> ideas<00:00:38.070> remember<00:00:38.970> that<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> same

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
getting my ideas remember that the same

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.229 
getting my ideas remember that the same
pentatonic<00:00:40.830> serves<00:00:41.129> for<00:00:41.370> both<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.670> new<00:00:41.850> minor

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
pentatonic serves for both the new minor

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.390 
pentatonic serves for both the new minor
and<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> deal<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.379> means<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.830> six-string

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
and the deal that means a six-string

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.990 
and the deal that means a six-string
road<00:00:45.050> my<00:00:46.050> only<00:00:46.199> punctuation<00:00:47.040> has<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.400> be<00:00:47.580> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
road my only punctuation has to be to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.150 
road my only punctuation has to be to
eliminate<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.720> a<00:00:48.960> cord<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.620> would<00:00:49.920> be<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
eliminate that a cord that would be the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.910 
eliminate that a cord that would be the
second<00:00:50.580> string<00:00:51.110> but<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.140> want<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> stay<00:00:52.620> close

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
second string but I want to stay close

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.190 
second string but I want to stay close
to<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.220> court<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.089> see<00:00:54.330> the<00:00:54.450> arpeggio<00:00:54.840> all

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
to the court so I see the arpeggio all

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.380 
to the court so I see the arpeggio all
this<00:00:55.559> stuff<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.040> in<00:00:56.250> charts<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.940> his<00:00:57.030> lesson

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
this stuff is in charts and his lesson

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.229 
this stuff is in charts and his lesson
so<00:00:57.629> makes<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.079> easy<00:00:58.399> let's<00:00:59.399> cover<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.879> next

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
so makes it easy let's cover the next

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.299 
so makes it easy let's cover the next
area<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> neck<00:01:01.110> I<00:01:01.289> would<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.039> B

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
area up the neck I would have the B

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.320 
area up the neck I would have the B
minor<00:01:03.589> then<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.710> need<00:01:04.890> an<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.250> punctuation<00:01:05.940> in

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
minor then I need an a punctuation in

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.590 
minor then I need an a punctuation in
that<00:01:06.539> area<00:01:06.899> I<00:01:07.580> have<00:01:08.580> an<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.970> chord<00:01:09.330> with<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
that area I have an a chord with the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.050 
that area I have an a chord with the
seed<00:01:09.869> form<00:01:10.259> which<00:01:10.560> would<00:01:10.740> give<00:01:10.950> me<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.160> fist

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
seed form which would give me the fist

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.330 
seed form which would give me the fist
reroute<00:01:12.479> pentatonic<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> yeah<00:01:14.160> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
reroute pentatonic and you yeah the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.400 
reroute pentatonic and you yeah the
arpeggio<00:01:14.640> then<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.539> need<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.780> go<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> décor

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
arpeggio then I need to go the décor

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.370 
arpeggio then I need to go the décor
which<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.520> formed<00:01:17.850> around<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.509> e<00:01:18.690> fingering

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
which is formed around the e fingering

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:39.450 
which is formed around the e fingering
I'll<00:01:20.009> play<00:01:20.280> against<00:01:20.640> it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.260

form here's your arpeggio you have the
second<00:01:58.040> straight<00:01:58.280> route<00:01:58.460> pentatonic<00:01:59.320> then<00:02:00.320> we

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
second straight route pentatonic then we

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.469 
second straight route pentatonic then we
need<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.800> go<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.010> an<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.310> chord<00:02:01.729> for<00:02:02.450> a

surefire bed of hitting the right notes

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.479 
surefire bed of hitting the right notes
makes<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.780> little<00:02:47.870> more<00:02:48.019> sense<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.409> me<00:02:48.560> let's

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.930 
makes a little more sense to me let's
cover<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.970> next<00:02:50.269> area<00:02:50.659> will<00:02:50.989> go<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:52.430> B

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
cover the next area will go to the B

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.960 
cover the next area will go to the B
minor<00:02:53.319> with<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.470> minor<00:02:54.890> form<00:02:55.370> then<00:02:55.700> we<00:02:55.790> need

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
minor with the a minor form then we need

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.869 
minor with the a minor form then we need
an<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.209> chord<00:02:56.510> for<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.780> punctuation<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:58.489> ends<00:02:58.760> up

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
an a chord for a punctuation it ends up

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.039 
an a chord for a punctuation it ends up
being<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.239> G<00:02:59.480> chord<00:02:59.810> then<00:03:00.560> we<00:03:00.829> need<00:03:01.040> our<00:03:01.310> décor

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
being the G chord then we need our décor

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.069 
being the G chord then we need our décor

really spend some time working on every

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.060 
really spend some time working on every
position<00:04:47.090> all<00:04:47.480> five<00:04:47.780> positions<00:04:47.990> it's<00:04:48.860> kind<00:04:48.980> of

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
position all five positions it's kind of

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.770 
position all five positions it's kind of
nice<00:04:49.250> how<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.550> pentatonic<00:04:50.000> scale<00:04:50.330> has<00:04:50.510> five

section<00:05:00.560> I'm<00:05:00.980> going<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.310> talk<00:05:01.520> about<00:05:01.760> how<00:05:02.150> to

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
section I'm going to talk about how to

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.270 
section I'm going to talk about how to
connect<00:05:02.750> these<00:05:02.930> a<00:05:02.990> little<00:05:03.320> bit<00:05:03.620> because<00:05:03.830> we

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
connect these a little bit because we

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.950 
connect these a little bit because we
know<00:05:04.400> we<00:05:04.520> keep<00:05:04.760> ourselves<00:05:04.940> in<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.390> box<00:05:05.690> I've

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
know we keep ourselves in a box I've

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.090 
know we keep ourselves in a box I've
been<00:05:06.110> telling<00:05:06.380> you<00:05:06.440> all<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:06.680> learn<00:05:06.830> two

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
been telling you all to learn two

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.430 
been telling you all to learn two
adjacent<00:05:07.400> positions<00:05:08.120> will<00:05:08.750> go<00:05:08.870> back<00:05:09.080> to<00:05:09.110> just

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
adjacent positions will go back to just

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.530 
adjacent positions will go back to just
one<00:05:09.680> chord<00:05:10.100> make<00:05:10.340> it<00:05:10.460> real<00:05:10.610> simple<00:05:10.640> so<00:05:11.450> you

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
one chord make it real simple so you

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.700 
one chord make it real simple so you
don't<00:05:11.690> feel<00:05:11.810> like<00:05:11.990> you're<00:05:12.140> climbing<00:05:12.410> too

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
don't feel like you're climbing too

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
don't feel like you're climbing too
steep<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.610> wall<00:05:13.850> and<00:05:14.410> open<00:05:15.410> up<00:05:15.860> your<00:05:16.040> vision<00:05:16.640> so

steep a wall and open up your vision so

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.780 
steep a wall and open up your vision so
you<00:05:16.820> don't<00:05:16.970> have<00:05:17.030> just<00:05:17.240> tunnel<00:05:17.510> vision
