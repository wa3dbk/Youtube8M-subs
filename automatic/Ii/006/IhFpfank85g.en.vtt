00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
so so far it seems to be doing nothing

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.029 
so so far it seems to be doing nothing
this<00:01:56.340> doesn't<00:01:56.640> activate<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.270> every<00:01:57.689> bark<00:01:58.039> very

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
this doesn't activate on every bark very

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.130 
this doesn't activate on every bark very
few<00:01:59.340> barks<00:01:59.640> actually<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.659> she<00:02:00.840> doesn't<00:02:00.989> even

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
few barks actually and she doesn't even

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.190 
few barks actually and she doesn't even
seem<00:02:01.349> to<00:02:01.439> be<00:02:01.530> responding<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:03.479> bark<00:02:03.780> off

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.389 

and<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.289> seems<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.649> actually<00:02:08.160> when<00:02:08.250> there's

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
and it seems like actually when there's

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.430 
and it seems like actually when there's
no<00:02:08.789> barking<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.750> thing<00:02:10.019> works

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
no barking this thing works

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.740 
no barking this thing works
a<00:02:10.590> lot<00:02:11.039> more<00:02:11.579> than<00:02:11.819> when<00:02:12.000> there<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.269> barking

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
a lot more than when there is barking

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.890 
a lot more than when there is barking
that's<00:02:13.110> kind<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.410> strange<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:14.660> don't<00:02:15.660> know<00:02:15.840> if

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
that's kind of strange I don't know if

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.960 
that's kind of strange I don't know if
my<00:02:16.079> bark<00:02:16.769> off<00:02:16.920> was<00:02:17.129> broken<00:02:17.579> because<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
my bark off was broken because the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.030 
my bark off was broken because the
sensitivity<00:02:18.540> was<00:02:18.900> set<00:02:19.109> to<00:02:19.260> high<00:02:19.440> what<00:02:19.739> should

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
sensitivity was set to high what should

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.589 
sensitivity was set to high what should
detected<00:02:20.579> dog's<00:02:20.790> bark

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
detected dog's bark

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.640 
detected dog's bark
within<00:02:22.230> 20<00:02:22.890> feet<00:02:23.810> but<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.930> definitely<00:02:25.230> does

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
within 20 feet but it definitely does

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.990 
within 20 feet but it definitely does
not<00:02:25.799> work<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.640> doesn't<00:02:26.940> work

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
not work and it doesn't work

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.330 
not work and it doesn't work
consistently<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.440> could<00:02:28.590> be<00:02:28.709> broken<00:02:28.980> but

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
consistently and it could be broken but

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.699 
consistently and it could be broken but
I<00:02:29.549> even<00:02:29.790> it's<00:02:30.090> brand-new<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.840> package<00:02:31.319> so<00:02:31.650> I

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
I even it's brand-new in package so I

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.680 
I even it's brand-new in package so I
don't<00:02:32.069> see<00:02:32.250> how<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:33.090> if<00:02:33.239> something<00:02:33.569> is<00:02:33.660> that

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
don't see how and if something is that

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.479 
don't see how and if something is that
cheap<00:02:34.109> that<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.410> doesn't<00:02:34.709> work<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.400> know
