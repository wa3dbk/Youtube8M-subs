metals um if we can get maybe over two

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.930 
metals um if we can get maybe over two
or<00:00:50.039> three<00:00:50.190> hundred<00:00:50.280> that'd<00:00:50.550> be<00:00:50.670> pretty<00:00:50.820> cool

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
or three hundred that'd be pretty cool

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.760 
or three hundred that'd be pretty cool
but<00:00:51.780> we're<00:00:51.960> going<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.110> be<00:00:52.199> losing<00:00:52.530> every

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
but we're going to be losing every

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.549 
but we're going to be losing every
single<00:00:53.070> battle<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.690> up<00:00:54.690> getting<00:00:55.050> stuff<00:00:55.320> might

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
single battle so up getting stuff might

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.369 
single battle so up getting stuff might
be<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> pain<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:57.510> only<00:00:57.870> thing<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.260> can

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
be a pain the only thing that I can

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.470 
be a pain the only thing that I can
really<00:00:58.620> think<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.190> going<00:00:59.760> wrong<00:01:00.120> with<00:01:00.300> this

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
really think of going wrong with this

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.170 
really think of going wrong with this

headquarters<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.320> need<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> specific

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
headquarters you need to be a specific

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.140 
headquarters you need to be a specific
level<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:09.119> upgrade<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.250> since<00:01:11.250> i'd<00:01:11.729> say<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
level to upgrade it so since i'd say the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.050 
level to upgrade it so since i'd say the
defensive<00:01:12.630> buildings<00:01:12.810> probably<00:01:13.439> take<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:14.060> at

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
defensive buildings probably take up at

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.999 
defensive buildings probably take up at
least<00:01:15.330> sixty<00:01:15.689> percent<00:01:15.840> or<00:01:16.200> not<00:01:16.320> more<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.830> your

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
least sixty percent or not more of your

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.289 
least sixty percent or not more of your
total<00:01:17.280> buildings<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> might<00:01:18.030> be<00:01:18.150> actually

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
total buildings it might be actually

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.020 
total buildings it might be actually
hard<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.720> get<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> high<00:01:19.860> enough<00:01:19.890> HQ<00:01:20.759> level

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
hard to get to a high enough HQ level

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.359 
hard to get to a high enough HQ level
where<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.689> might<00:01:22.500> get<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> point<00:01:23.130> where

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
where we might get to the point where

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.920 
where we might get to the point where
there's<00:01:23.700> nothing<00:01:23.970> left<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.270> upgrade<00:01:24.720> and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
there's nothing left to upgrade and

there's nothing left to upgrade and
we're<00:01:25.259> still<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> level<00:01:25.920> short<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.340> even<00:01:26.460> move

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
we're still a level short to even move

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.330

of<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.360> mistakes<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.740> see<00:01:49.920> people

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
of the mistakes that you see people

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.770 
of the mistakes that you see people
making<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:51.060> capitalize<00:01:51.540> them

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
making now you can capitalize them

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.069 
making now you can capitalize them
capitalize<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.619> them<00:01:52.860> pretty<00:01:52.979> easily<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:54.119> just

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
capitalize on them pretty easily so just

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.690 
capitalize on them pretty easily so just
like<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.770> only<00:01:55.920> have<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> soldiers<00:01:56.579> on

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
like this we only have the soldiers on

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.490 
like this we only have the soldiers on
locks<00:01:56.939> right<00:01:57.119> now<00:01:57.329> we've<00:01:57.659> got<00:01:57.689> three<00:01:58.170> landing

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
locks right now we've got three landing

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.620 
locks right now we've got three landing
crafts<00:01:58.710> they're<00:01:59.189> all<00:01:59.310> level<00:01:59.579> one<00:01:59.729> or<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> think

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
crafts they're all level one or I think

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.310

there's quite a lot of them we got to
support<00:02:41.269> building<00:02:41.660> left<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:42.110> can<00:02:42.170> build<00:02:42.349> an

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
support building left we can build an

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.250 
support building left we can build an
armory<00:02:43.480> residence<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.690> only<00:02:44.810> takes<00:02:45.019> two

minutes<00:02:45.440> let's<00:02:45.799> throw<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.160> resonance<00:02:46.700> down<00:02:48.459> and

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
minutes let's throw a resonance down and

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.690 
minutes let's throw a resonance down and
we'll<00:02:50.120> put<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:50.420> right<00:02:50.540> there<00:02:54.459> yep<00:02:55.459> so

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
we'll put it right there yep so

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.580 
we'll put it right there yep so
hopefully<00:02:56.000> but<00:02:56.720> in<00:02:56.840> this<00:02:57.049> video<00:02:57.290> we<00:02:57.380> can<00:02:57.500> get

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
hopefully but in this video we can get

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.910 
hopefully but in this video we can get
maybe<00:02:57.709> two<00:02:57.799> or<00:02:57.980> two<00:02:58.340> or<00:02:58.459> three<00:02:58.580> upgrades<00:02:58.880> off

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
maybe two or two or three upgrades off

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.550 
maybe two or two or three upgrades off
since<00:03:00.920> we<00:03:01.099> got<00:03:01.250> blending<00:03:01.790> half<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.239> residents

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
any troops everyone fighting MPC basis

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.289 
any troops everyone fighting MPC basis
because<00:03:45.980> there<00:03:46.190> should<00:03:46.220> be<00:03:46.489> away<00:03:46.700> until<00:03:46.730> you

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
because there should be away until you

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.199 
because there should be away until you
get<00:03:47.480> higher<00:03:48.380> up<00:03:48.680> that<00:03:49.459> you<00:03:49.579> shouldn't<00:03:49.880> lose<00:03:50.150> a

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
get higher up that you shouldn't lose a

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.220 
get higher up that you shouldn't lose a
single<00:03:50.510> guy<00:03:52.150> okay<00:03:53.150> so<00:03:53.209> they<00:03:53.480> big<00:03:53.660> I<00:03:53.900> think<00:03:54.109> that

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
single guy okay so they big I think that

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.020 
single guy okay so they big I think that
clears<00:03:54.470> our<00:03:54.590> map<00:03:54.799> up<00:03:55.040> now<00:03:57.579> we've<00:03:58.579> got<00:03:58.790> some

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
clears our map up now we've got some

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.349 
clears our map up now we've got some
gold<00:03:59.269> to<00:03:59.569> use<00:03:59.930> so<00:04:00.650> let's<00:04:01.100> open<00:04:01.400> up<00:04:01.730> another

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
gold to use so let's open up another

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.580 
gold to use so let's open up another
area<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.880> we'll<00:04:05.120> get<00:04:05.389> some<00:04:05.900> metal<00:04:06.230> out<00:04:06.470> of

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
area and we'll get some metal out of

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.819 
area and we'll get some metal out of
that<00:04:06.739> chest<00:04:07.130> and<00:04:07.880> we'll<00:04:08.359> hit<00:04:08.780> an<00:04:09.019> MPC<00:04:09.350> base<00:04:09.650> we

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
that chest and we'll hit an MPC base we

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.710 
that chest and we'll hit an MPC base we
just<00:04:10.010> got<00:04:10.160> it's<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.609> same<00:04:10.819> one<00:04:11.030> all<00:04:11.600> right

last time so I'm just going to speed

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.180 
last time so I'm just going to speed
this<00:04:14.150> battle<00:04:14.569> up<00:04:14.690> for<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:14.930> guys<00:04:15.130> we're<00:04:16.130> just

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190

this battle up for you guys we're just
going<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.400> come<00:04:16.609> in<00:04:16.639> drop<00:04:17.389> to<00:04:17.660> heels<00:04:17.930> kill<00:04:18.919> both

going to come in drop to heels kill both

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.060 
going to come in drop to heels kill both
the<00:04:19.280> mortars<00:04:19.609> and<00:04:20.109> then<00:04:21.109> just<00:04:21.320> go<00:04:21.409> for<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.620> HQ

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
the mortars and then just go for the HQ

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.379 
the mortars and then just go for the HQ
basically

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.450 

and<00:04:26.389> just<00:04:27.139> like<00:04:27.199> that<00:04:27.259> it's<00:04:27.710> going<00:04:28.009> to<00:04:28.069> go<00:04:28.129> down

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.950 

all<00:04:31.460> right<00:04:31.610> so<00:04:31.789> possibly<00:04:32.479> when<00:04:32.599> we<00:04:32.689> get<00:04:32.810> back

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
all right so possibly when we get back

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.070 
all right so possibly when we get back
the<00:04:32.990> resident<00:04:33.469> should<00:04:33.620> be<00:04:33.710> done<00:04:33.949> and<00:04:34.840> we<00:04:35.840> will

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
the resident should be done and we will

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.689 
the resident should be done and we will
yep<00:04:36.529> there<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:36.770> go<00:04:36.889> the<00:04:37.069> construction<00:04:37.580> is

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
yep there you go the construction is

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.239 
yep there you go the construction is
finished<00:04:38.229> let's<00:04:39.229> build<00:04:39.740> something<00:04:39.949> it<00:04:40.129> takes

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:40.249 
finished let's build something it takes

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:41.679 
finished let's build something it takes
a<00:04:40.400> little<00:04:40.550> bit<00:04:40.699> longer<00:04:40.909> now<00:04:41.150> now<00:04:41.479> that<00:04:41.539> we've

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:41.689 
a little bit longer now now that we've

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.610 
a little bit longer now now that we've
got<00:04:41.840> some<00:04:42.080> wood<00:04:42.229> going<00:04:42.590> um<00:04:43.840> let's<00:04:44.840> go<00:04:44.930> with<00:04:45.319> the

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
got some wood going um let's go with the

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.619 
got some wood going um let's go with the
armory<00:04:46.249> I<00:04:46.340> think<00:04:46.699> would<00:04:46.849> be<00:04:46.969> best<00:04:47.120> that<00:04:47.360> way<00:04:47.479> we

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:47.629 
armory I think would be best that way we

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:50.110 
armory I think would be best that way we
can<00:04:47.749> start<00:04:47.960> spending<00:04:48.289> your<00:04:48.499> gold<00:04:48.740> on<00:04:49.120> troop

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
can start spending your gold on troop

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.320 
can start spending your gold on troop
upgrades<00:04:50.539> also<00:04:51.789> so<00:04:52.789> um<00:04:54.520> I've<00:04:55.520> got<00:04:55.669> another<00:04:55.879> NPC

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
upgrades also so um I've got another NPC

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.439 
upgrades also so um I've got another NPC
base<00:04:56.479> so<00:04:56.659> we<00:04:56.689> can<00:04:56.900> hit<00:04:57.020> and<00:04:57.830> it<00:04:58.669> has<00:04:58.759> a<00:04:58.789> rocket

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
base so we can hit and it has a rocket

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.100 
base so we can hit and it has a rocket
launcher<00:04:59.810> on<00:04:59.870> it<00:05:00.080> basically<00:05:01.449> being<00:05:02.449> this<00:05:02.750> low

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
launcher on it basically being this low

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.140 
launcher on it basically being this low
rocket<00:05:04.009> launchers<00:05:04.340> I<00:05:04.520> think<00:05:04.819> are<00:05:05.000> the

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
rocket launchers I think are the

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.689 
rocket launchers I think are the
scariest<00:05:05.919> defenses<00:05:06.919> to<00:05:07.099> deal<00:05:07.250> with<00:05:07.430> right<00:05:07.639> now

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
scariest defenses to deal with right now

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.300 
scariest defenses to deal with right now
until<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.449> start<00:05:08.870> getting<00:05:09.020> heavies<00:05:09.469> and<00:05:09.770> even

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
until you start getting heavies and even

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.709 
until you start getting heavies and even
with<00:05:10.430> heavies<00:05:10.699> I<00:05:10.819> think<00:05:11.060> they're<00:05:11.330> still<00:05:11.569> going

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:11.719 
with heavies I think they're still going

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:13.719 
with heavies I think they're still going
to<00:05:11.810> be<00:05:11.930> a<00:05:11.960> pain<00:05:12.349> compared<00:05:12.919> like<00:05:13.069> right<00:05:13.370> now<00:05:13.520> for

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
to be a pain compared like right now for

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.629 
to be a pain compared like right now for
high<00:05:13.969> levels<00:05:14.300> they<00:05:14.750> don't<00:05:14.990> even<00:05:15.169> do<00:05:15.319> anything

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
high levels they don't even do anything

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.850 
high levels they don't even do anything
anymore<00:05:16.639> really<00:05:17.500> unless<00:05:18.500> you're<00:05:18.710> playing

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
anymore really unless you're playing

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.829 
anymore really unless you're playing
with<00:05:19.039> medics<00:05:19.430> but<00:05:19.729> with<00:05:19.879> these<00:05:20.029> guys<00:05:20.210> I'm<00:05:20.659> kind

00:05:20.829 --> 00:05:20.839

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
of just letting them hit one boat worth

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.719 
of just letting them hit one boat worth
of<00:05:23.479> the<00:05:23.599> guys<00:05:23.749> and<00:05:24.169> then<00:05:24.580> we're<00:05:25.580> going<00:05:25.669> to

of the guys and then we're going to
flare<00:05:25.999> right<00:05:26.270> inside<00:05:26.629> the<00:05:26.749> inner<00:05:26.870> circle<00:05:27.110> side

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:27.439 
flare right inside the inner circle side

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:28.749 
flare right inside the inner circle side
of<00:05:27.560> stop<00:05:27.710> shooting<00:05:28.009> your<00:05:28.099> guys<00:05:28.249> so<00:05:28.460> hopefully

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
of stop shooting your guys so hopefully

of stop shooting your guys so hopefully
they<00:05:28.849> can<00:05:28.909> get<00:05:29.120> there<00:05:29.270> before<00:05:29.389> they<00:05:29.569> get<00:05:29.659> hit

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
they can get there before they get hit

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.230 
they can get there before they get hit
and<00:05:30.080> they're<00:05:30.860> able<00:05:31.009> to<00:05:31.279> which<00:05:31.430> is<00:05:31.580> good<00:05:31.789> nope

but we're not going to let that happen
don't<00:05:47.870> want<00:05:48.050> to<00:05:48.110> waste<00:05:48.229> time<00:05:48.469> with<00:05:48.710> it<00:05:48.860> we<00:05:48.979> just

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
don't want to waste time with it we just

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:50.740 
don't want to waste time with it we just
want<00:05:49.310> to<00:05:49.370> get<00:05:49.460> in<00:05:49.610> get<00:05:49.819> our<00:05:49.939> metals<00:05:50.270> and<00:05:50.599> get

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
want to get in get our metals and get

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.950 
want to get in get our metals and get
out<00:05:52.960> alright<00:05:53.960> so<00:05:54.349> down<00:05:54.830> this<00:05:55.069> one<00:05:55.330> and<00:05:56.330> then

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
out alright so down this one and then

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.159 
out alright so down this one and then
after<00:05:57.439> this<00:05:57.560> I<00:05:57.740> think<00:05:57.800> we<00:05:58.759> are<00:05:59.029> clear<00:05:59.689> on<00:05:59.810> our

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
after this I think we are clear on our

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.619 
after this I think we are clear on our
map<00:06:00.439> again<00:06:00.770> so<00:06:01.189> we'll<00:06:01.610> have<00:06:01.699> to<00:06:01.909> see<00:06:02.149> if<00:06:02.180> we

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:02.629 
map again so we'll have to see if we

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:05.469 
map again so we'll have to see if we
have<00:06:02.839> enough<00:06:03.110> gold<00:06:03.560> in<00:06:04.120> order<00:06:05.120> to<00:06:05.270> open

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
have enough gold in order to open

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:14.499 
have enough gold in order to open
something<00:06:08.169> kind<00:06:09.169> of<00:06:09.409> don't<00:06:10.330> think<00:06:11.330> we<00:06:11.659> do<00:06:13.509> so

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:14.509 
something kind of don't think we do so

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:16.540 
something kind of don't think we do so
you<00:06:15.259> know<00:06:15.379> what<00:06:15.529> we'll<00:06:15.740> just<00:06:15.979> spend<00:06:16.159> a<00:06:16.370> couple

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.879 
you know what we'll just spend a couple
gems<00:06:16.879> on<00:06:17.089> it<00:06:17.210> just<00:06:17.539> so<00:06:17.689> we<00:06:17.779> can<00:06:17.899> do<00:06:18.529> one<00:06:18.710> more

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
gems on it just so we can do one more

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.920 
gems on it just so we can do one more
battle<00:06:19.099> for<00:06:19.399> this<00:06:19.550> video<00:06:19.819> and<00:06:19.879> inside<00:06:20.779> we're

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
battle for this video and inside we're

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.089 
battle for this video and inside we're
going<00:06:21.050> to<00:06:21.110> basically<00:06:21.319> get<00:06:21.500> our<00:06:21.620> gems<00:06:21.860> back

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
going to basically get our gems back

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:24.700 
going to basically get our gems back
anyways<00:06:22.460> in<00:06:22.669> another<00:06:22.939> metal<00:06:23.149> so<00:06:23.899> up<00:06:23.990> to<00:06:24.110> 46<00:06:24.469> now

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
anyways in another metal so up to 46 now

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.019 
anyways in another metal so up to 46 now
and<00:06:25.009> we're<00:06:25.339> just<00:06:25.370> gonna<00:06:25.550> have<00:06:25.669> to<00:06:25.759> gem<00:06:25.909> it

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:26.029 
and we're just gonna have to gem it

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:27.100 
and we're just gonna have to gem it
because<00:06:26.180> we<00:06:26.240> also<00:06:26.389> don't<00:06:26.539> have<00:06:26.629> any<00:06:26.810> goal<00:06:26.960> to

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
because we also don't have any goal to

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.689 
because we also don't have any goal to
attack<00:06:27.319> this<00:06:27.649> is<00:06:27.800> our<00:06:27.889> first<00:06:28.099> resource<00:06:28.550> base

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:28.699 
attack this is our first resource base

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.439 
attack this is our first resource base
though<00:06:28.939> so<00:06:29.210> it's<00:06:30.110> very<00:06:30.409> very<00:06:30.649> simple<00:06:31.159> so<00:06:32.120> I

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
though so it's very very simple so I

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:33.610 
though so it's very very simple so I
think<00:06:32.659> we're<00:06:32.930> only<00:06:33.019> actually<00:06:33.319> going<00:06:33.409> to<00:06:33.500> have

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
think we're only actually going to have

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.769 
think we're only actually going to have
to<00:06:33.709> kill<00:06:33.949> one<00:06:34.339> of<00:06:34.399> the<00:06:34.610> machine<00:06:34.940> guns<00:06:35.180> just

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:35.779 
to kill one of the machine guns just

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.140 
to kill one of the machine guns just
because<00:06:36.409> where<00:06:36.709> they're<00:06:36.860> positioned

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
because where they're positioned

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.570 
because where they're positioned
um<00:06:38.800> yeah<00:06:39.800> we're<00:06:40.070> going<00:06:40.190> to<00:06:40.220> do<00:06:40.310> that<00:06:40.460> we're

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
um yeah we're going to do that we're

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.950 
um yeah we're going to do that we're
just<00:06:40.640> going<00:06:40.790> to<00:06:40.850> flair<00:06:41.150> to<00:06:41.360> the<00:06:41.390> right<00:06:41.630> and

machine<00:06:44.150> gun<00:06:44.330> and<00:06:44.600> then<00:06:44.780> we'll<00:06:45.350> just<00:06:45.560> have<00:06:45.770> to

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010 
machine gun and then we'll just have to

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.840 
machine gun and then we'll just have to
kill<00:06:46.760> the<00:06:46.910> HQ<00:06:48.010> be<00:06:49.010> curious<00:06:49.280> to<00:06:49.400> see<00:06:49.640> what<00:06:49.760> they

just go up a couple levels I'll have to
see<00:06:55.400> I<00:06:55.430> think<00:06:55.700> they're<00:06:55.790> both<00:06:55.970> one<00:06:56.180> hope<00:06:56.300> to<00:06:57.670> all

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:58.670 
see I think they're both one hope to all

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.740 
see I think they're both one hope to all
right<00:06:59.060> got<00:07:00.050> our<00:07:00.170> first<00:07:00.230> resource<00:07:00.980> base<00:07:01.750> and

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
right got our first resource base and

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.200 
right got our first resource base and
yeah<00:07:03.710> I<00:07:03.920> was<00:07:04.070> right<00:07:04.340> they<00:07:04.520> both<00:07:04.700> just<00:07:05.000> kind<00:07:05.180> of

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210 
yeah I was right they both just kind of

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.310 
yeah I was right they both just kind of
leveled<00:07:05.480> up<00:07:05.570> so<00:07:05.810> I<00:07:05.840> think<00:07:05.930> we're<00:07:06.140> going<00:07:06.260> to

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.320 
leveled up so I think we're going to

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.360 
leveled up so I think we're going to
take<00:07:06.440> them<00:07:06.560> we're<00:07:06.770> going<00:07:06.890> to<00:07:06.950> put<00:07:07.040> them<00:07:07.190> close

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370

take them we're going to put them close
to<00:07:07.490> the<00:07:07.580> beach<00:07:07.730> cuz<00:07:08.000> i<00:07:08.030> think<00:07:08.180> that's<00:07:08.360> that<00:07:09.140> way

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260 
to the beach cuz i think that's that way

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.660 
to the beach cuz i think that's that way
as<00:07:09.350> soon<00:07:09.410> as<00:07:09.680> the<00:07:09.770> new<00:07:09.890> player<00:07:10.100> comes<00:07:10.340> up<00:07:10.520> they

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:10.670 
as soon as the new player comes up they

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.860 
as soon as the new player comes up they
drop<00:07:10.850> them<00:07:11.030> on<00:07:11.150> the<00:07:11.180> beach<00:07:11.390> and<00:07:11.630> then<00:07:11.750> they

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 
drop them on the beach and then they

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.380 
drop them on the beach and then they
just<00:07:12.020> get<00:07:12.140> shot<00:07:12.410> right<00:07:12.650> away<00:07:12.800> basically<00:07:13.390> but

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:14.390
