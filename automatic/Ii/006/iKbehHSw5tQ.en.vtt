gifts over the head lids or that it's a
really<00:01:29.250> thick<00:01:29.640> formula<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:31.409> you're

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
really thick formula so if you're

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.780 
really thick formula so if you're
looking<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:32.009> something<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.369> cover<00:01:32.579> blemishes

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
this works really well you don't want

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.670 
this works really well you don't want
something<00:01:35.640> that's<00:01:35.850> light<00:01:36.810> or<00:01:37.110> creamy<00:01:37.439> or

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
something that's light or creamy or

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.620 
something that's light or creamy or
liquidy<00:01:38.189> because<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.640> need<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.240> really

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
liquidy because you need it to be really

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.149 
liquidy because you need it to be really
opaque<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.650> better<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.070> have

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
opaque so it's better if you have

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.010 
opaque so it's better if you have
something<00:01:41.430> more<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> paste<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
something more like a paste this is a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.569 
something more like a paste this is a
very<00:01:43.259> thick<00:01:43.530> formula<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.070> mean<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.430> tell

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.130 
very thick formula I mean you can tell
because<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.210> stick<00:01:45.509> if<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.810> able<00:01:45.899> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
because it's in a stick if it's able to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.569 
because it's in a stick if it's able to
stand<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.740> then<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.220> know<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
stand up like that then you know it's a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.639 
stand up like that then you know it's a
really<00:01:47.729> stiff<00:01:48.540> formula<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.320> that's<00:01:49.500> what

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
really stiff formula so that's what

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.340 
really stiff formula so that's what
you're<00:01:49.770> going<00:01:49.979> for<00:01:50.390> but<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.450> also<00:01:51.810> use<00:01:52.140> this

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
you're going for but I also use this

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.810 
you're going for but I also use this
under<00:01:52.649> my<00:01:52.799> eyes<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.640> works

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
under my eyes and I think it works

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.359 
under my eyes and I think it works
really<00:01:54.119> well<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.740> one<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.890> advantages<00:01:56.310> of

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
really well so one of the advantages of

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.459 
really well so one of the advantages of
this<00:01:56.610> kind<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.060> shape<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.229> don't

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
this kind of shape is that you don't

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.350 
this kind of shape is that you don't
need<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> brush<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.579> just<00:01:59.729> dot<00:02:00.180> it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
need a brush with it so I just dot it

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.149 
need a brush with it so I just dot it
under<00:02:00.630> my<00:02:00.780> eyes<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:00.960> then<00:02:01.469> take<00:02:01.710> my<00:02:01.829> fingers

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
under my eyes and then take my fingers

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.560 
under my eyes and then take my fingers
and<00:02:02.310> smooth<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.729> out<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.880> little<00:02:03.119> bit<00:02:03.360> and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
and smooth it out a little bit and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.870 
and smooth it out a little bit and
that's<00:02:03.990> pretty<00:02:04.200> much<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.189> also<00:02:05.549> dot

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
that's pretty much in you can also dot

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.789 
that's pretty much in you can also dot
it<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.149> blemishes<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.840> will<00:02:07.439> sometimes

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
it on blemishes but I will sometimes

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.249 
it on blemishes but I will sometimes
just<00:02:07.979> take

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
just take

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.749 
just take
small<00:02:08.470> brush<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:08.709> dot<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.129> read<00:02:09.310> on<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.580> end

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
small brush and dot it read on the end

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.910 
small brush and dot it read on the end
of<00:02:09.939> this<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.450> apply<00:02:11.080> it<00:02:11.140> like<00:02:11.379> that<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.709> works

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
of this and apply it like that and works

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.429 
of this and apply it like that and works
really<00:02:12.129> well<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:13.000> lot<00:02:13.450> versatility<00:02:14.319> in

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
really well so a lot versatility in

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.530 
really well so a lot versatility in
terms<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.829> the<00:02:14.950> design<00:02:15.280> but<00:02:15.909> having<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.239> really

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
terms of the design but having it really

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.240 
terms of the design but having it really
a<00:02:16.569> thick<00:02:16.959> paste<00:02:17.230> like<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.680> works<00:02:17.920> really

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
a thick paste like that works really

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.399 
a thick paste like that works really
well<00:02:18.400> also<00:02:19.090> I'm<00:02:19.569> putting<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.049> under<00:02:20.260> my<00:02:20.379> eyes

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
well also I'm putting it under my eyes

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.500 
well also I'm putting it under my eyes
because<00:02:20.890> it's<00:02:21.069> not<00:02:21.280> too<00:02:21.519> liquidy<00:02:21.909> it<00:02:22.090> doesn't

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
because it's not too liquidy it doesn't

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.000 
because it's not too liquidy it doesn't
settle<00:02:22.780> into<00:02:23.019> creases<00:02:23.470> at<00:02:23.620> all<00:02:23.769> which<00:02:23.980> is
