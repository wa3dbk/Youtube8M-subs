dishwasher safe and freezer safe and the

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.570 
dishwasher safe and freezer safe and the
main<00:05:04.360> reason<00:05:04.810> why<00:05:05.080> I<00:05:05.110> bought<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:06.010> induction

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
main reason why I bought the induction

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.180 
main reason why I bought the induction
induction<00:05:07.120> engine<00:05:08.050> is<00:05:08.470> because<00:05:08.800> I<00:05:08.890> have<00:05:09.070> an

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
induction engine is because I have an

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.410 
induction engine is because I have an
induction<00:05:09.550> hob<00:05:09.910> and<00:05:10.180> I<00:05:10.960> needed<00:05:12.120> for<00:05:13.120> it<00:05:13.240> to

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
induction hob and I needed for it to

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.030 
induction hob and I needed for it to
work<00:05:13.600> and<00:05:14.220> I<00:05:15.220> spent<00:05:15.520> so<00:05:15.940> much<00:05:16.270> money<00:05:16.330> on

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
work and I spent so much money on

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.740 
work and I spent so much money on
nonstick<00:05:18.040> frying<00:05:18.310> pans<00:05:18.640> that<00:05:19.060> didn't<00:05:19.450> really

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
nonstick frying pans that didn't really

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.800 
nonstick frying pans that didn't really
have<00:05:19.960> a<00:05:19.990> long<00:05:20.200> life<00:05:20.500> span<00:05:21.400> so<00:05:22.830> hopefully<00:05:24.810> this

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
have a long life span so hopefully this

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.840 
have a long life span so hopefully this
will<00:05:28.320> that's<00:05:29.320> more<00:05:29.830> better<00:05:30.040> and<00:05:30.340> they<00:05:30.610> have<00:05:30.820> a

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
will that's more better and they have a

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.100 
will that's more better and they have a
thermo<00:05:31.330> Spock

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
thermo Spock

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.950 
thermo Spock
so<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.820> thermos<00:05:34.270> pot<00:05:34.540> should<00:05:35.970> indicate<00:05:36.970> when

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
so the thermos pot should indicate when

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.030 
so the thermos pot should indicate when
