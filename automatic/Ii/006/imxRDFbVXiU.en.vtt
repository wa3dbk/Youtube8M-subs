 Welcome to delicious rings like her 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.439
 I'm not in this video in 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.389
 my choice of his kitchen for me 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.570
 Show yourself how you can do it yourself 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.570
 on 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.630
 for making sugar syrup 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:25.520
 we need a pot of 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.470
 I do not take any final sugar now 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:35.780
 but usually fine even 200 milliliters 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.309
 water a bottle in which we the 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.110
 finish the filling afterwards 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.120
 bottle I have with hot before 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.800
 water boiled so that the germ-free 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.800
 and the syrup last longer 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.940
 we need a priest so we can 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.449
 they are too different without anything 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.449
 abfÃ¼llten 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.500
 what I do now is a 12 1 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.740
 career 200 times sugar 200 milliliters 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.660
 water if you have 400 grams of sugar on 200 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.280
 milliliters of water are used then taken 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.410
 the one 2 2 1 2 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.410
 nobody or even trips owner 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.840
 The mass of books belong to sugar so long 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.950
 has dissolved 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.950
 the water used 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.689
 I also have the highest level for the stove 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:33.750
 posed so that the mass as possible 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.649
 I was fast I have ever heard 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.350
 So that the sugar is not on the ground 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:45.090
 fixing burnt caramel samir 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.189
 As you can see , we now have a clear one 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.890
 liquid 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.579
 so it can completely dissolve and you 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.579
 have it done 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.520
 the sugar syrup now film 20 over the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.420

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.420
 bottle one 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.790
 finished is our sugar syrup or too 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.990
