00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:01.810
 so let's go 

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.870
 now say the saints 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.059
 we went like this over 60 grams then in sÃ£o paulo with action 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:13.730
 the name of our potential September so the first step ever you 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.749
 but at one point 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:17.869
 the origin 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.669
 what we want 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.929
 no net 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.060
 you are mine 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.730
 remembering that the angle in the figure formed by two similar ones with the same 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.460
 month 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.940
 so to appear this other semi we use the compass with aperture 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.810
 any 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.580
 concept in note 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.580
 we draw a bow sow by cutting the line 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.390
 following examples 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.650
 on here 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.650
 in this intercession comes a point we shall call 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.210
 this point 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.660
 with the same aperture 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.660
 and now I'll try 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.690
 let's do 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.000
 another without being checked 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.230
 or was it punctual past 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.550
 because they have the same father 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.480
 and goes until 7 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.830
 another air 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.870
 at this point of intersection we can call the beak 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.180
 will be an agent 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.140
 will undergo another surgery 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.290
 so enough 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.050
 connected to point b 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.950
 and the point 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.950
 passing mancini repeats 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.250
 So we have you, we can give us the baskets. 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.830
 and this fifth we shall call v 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.240
 and the man then this opening 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.450
 we guarantee that this reading and qi 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.759
 is a people or is the world sixty degrees 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.080
 for you to have an idea like that we can prove that this new 60 degrees 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.900
 just note that wanted in the figure we have a movie so fast linking 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.170
 fixed point 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.170
 when rating 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.630
 this legislation 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:15.979
 are rays of circumference dans marques this ensures a clark suit and 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.799
 the three years 60 degrees so alpha 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:19.569
 sixty degrees
