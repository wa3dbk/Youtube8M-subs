me<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> surgeon<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:54.120> what<00:00:54.299> I<00:00:54.330> do<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
me as a surgeon because what I do as a

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.969 
me as a surgeon because what I do as a
surgeon<00:00:55.080> has<00:00:55.260> direct<00:00:55.650> implications<00:00:56.449> what<00:00:57.449> an

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
surgeon has direct implications what an

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:59.780 
surgeon has direct implications what an
oncologist<00:00:58.979> does<00:00:59.190> where<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.519> radiation

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
oncologist does where the radiation

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.509 
oncologist does where the radiation
doctor<00:01:00.360> does<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.680> communication<00:01:02.400> is

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
doctor does and that communication is

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:03.890 
doctor does and that communication is
very<00:01:02.820> important<00:01:03.360> between<00:01:03.449> all<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
very important between all the

patients<00:02:40.930> ears<00:02:41.500> after<00:02:42.330> but<00:02:43.330> most<00:02:43.570> patients

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
patients ears after but most patients

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.470 
patients ears after but most patients
liken<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.370> loss<00:02:45.520> of<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.820> relative<00:02:46.240> or

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
liken it to the loss of a relative or

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.580 
liken it to the loss of a relative or
friend<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.780> know<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.170> if<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.380> think

back<00:02:50.650> at<00:02:50.950> your<00:02:51.040> own<00:02:51.190> experiences<00:02:51.820> when<00:02:51.970> you

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
back at your own experiences when you

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.020 
back at your own experiences when you
lost<00:02:52.300> someone<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.630> truly<00:02:53.080> cared<00:02:53.560> for<00:02:54.030> there

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
lost someone you truly cared for there

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.360 
lost someone you truly cared for there
are<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.180> whole<00:02:55.360> range<00:02:55.390> of<00:02:55.750> emotions<00:02:56.340> shock

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.920 

being<00:03:00.370> upset<00:03:01.200> anger<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.330> for<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:04.870> reason

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
being upset anger and so for that reason

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.920 
being upset anger and so for that reason
it's<00:03:05.380> a<00:03:05.470> very<00:03:05.650> emotional<00:03:05.920> time<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.660> when<00:03:07.840> you

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
it's a very emotional time and when you

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.780 
it's a very emotional time and when you
when<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.290> draw<00:03:08.740> the<00:03:08.770> parallel<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.550> breast

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
when you draw the parallel to breast

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.360 
when you draw the parallel to breast
cancer<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:11.110> whole<00:03:11.410> range<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.710> emotions<00:03:12.220> is

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
cancer the whole range of emotions is

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.630 
cancer the whole range of emotions is
identical<00:03:16.620> there's<00:03:17.620> no<00:03:17.770> right<00:03:18.040> or<00:03:18.070> wrong<00:03:18.190> with

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
identical there's no right or wrong with

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.820 
identical there's no right or wrong with
how<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.820> patient<00:03:19.300> should<00:03:19.390> act<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.930> think<00:03:20.560> it's

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
how a patient should act I think it's

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.120 
how a patient should act I think it's
very<00:03:20.950> important<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:22.480> patient<00:03:23.050> is<00:03:23.410> free<00:03:23.890> to

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
very important that a patient is free to

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.980 
very important that a patient is free to
express<00:03:24.430> their<00:03:24.730> emotions<00:03:25.210> I<00:03:27.330> think<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.630> one

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
express their emotions I think the one

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.760 
express their emotions I think the one
thing<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:29.200> always<00:03:29.440> stress<00:03:29.740> to<00:03:30.310> my<00:03:30.430> patients<00:03:31.030> is

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
thing I always stress to my patients is

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.280 
thing I always stress to my patients is
that<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:34.060> only<00:03:34.240> thing<00:03:34.570> they<00:03:34.690> ever<00:03:34.720> need<00:03:35.200> to

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
that the only thing they ever need to

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.230 
that the only thing they ever need to
know<00:03:35.470> when<00:03:35.920> they<00:03:36.040> meet<00:03:36.280> meet<00:03:36.790> us<00:03:36.940> for<00:03:37.180> the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
know when they meet meet us for the

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.720 
know when they meet meet us for the
first<00:03:37.450> time<00:03:37.600> is<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:39.280> we're<00:03:39.430> going<00:03:39.520> to<00:03:39.580> be
