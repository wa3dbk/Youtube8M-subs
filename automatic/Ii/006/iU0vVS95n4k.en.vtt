00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.290
 Good evening review for cartons 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.849
 animated for adults that is addressed to 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.639
 adults for what your parents look at 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.430
 This evening's children are up small 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.630
 realm of good all the original title 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.960
 lidl king ben 6 only the kingdom dai 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.570
 same creators of peppa pig and this is it 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.449
 very perceptible from the graphics 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.759
 especially from the movements and the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.989
 expressions that year characters see 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.360
 this way they bring animation 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.950
 completely different than for popes for it 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.489
 minus one for the story because in this 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.140
 case we see a world completely 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:49.980
 imaginary that deals with a small 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.680
 kingdom of elves and fairies located in the woods 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.899
 of a real world therefore with people and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.640
 human and not as superb as families 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.670
 impersonated by animals but rather of a 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.070
 human world with which sometimes 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.140
 they come into contact and seek above all 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.570
 to hide most of the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.400
 sometimes by humans then the rail of Arezzo 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.040
 they are the parents of oils in this 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.729
 case is the fairy princess looks 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.100
 case that really pleases the popes and therefore it is 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.890
 a bit of a spin off for papi we can 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.619
 say is instead the other side I love you 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.380
 the elves with the family around well 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.340
 so wise grandfather etc. and so on 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.130
 wise comma I think is the grandfather 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.780
 comma parents and the rest of them 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.870
 population that lives inland instead 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.830
 of a tree while 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.690
 a castle and the house of 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.670
 royal family of fairies and all 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.310
 other fairies live in wild mushrooms 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.070
 called magical village if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.140
 make use of an irinian spell indeed 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.600
 he cannot fear magic 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.570
 but then they always find themselves telling us 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.900
 to resort to this cartoon 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.180
 price the very fact that the characters 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.220
 small then we say the children of 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.660
 history are always the most sharpest 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.480
 smartest smart while i 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.980
 parents are a little spooky parents 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.120
 other adult characters are a bit 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.840
 airheads and the right deadline 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.240
 because it represents a lot like children 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.930
 they see adults so that they don't 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.080
 they realize certain of certain 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.670
 shades of life because obviously 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.790
 taken in real life I'm talking about 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.910
 priests from their commitments from work and from 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.980
 everything in the house let's 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.880
 mind of an adult while at the point of 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.670
 view of children 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.530
 certain things are just glaring let's say 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.970
 the sixth sense of children and therefore 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.550
 this football has filed wants 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.510
 metaphorize, rather, better to extremize 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.510
 extremes 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.180
 children's nappa intelligence 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.909
 so this sixth sense for things 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.250
 that this spirit of observation of the 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.840
 good children today have a dog that in 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.689
 reality is a ladybug but behaves 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.639
 as a dog is called a gastone live 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:13.310
 lots of adventures also introducing 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:16.069
 little songs in that one thing that you 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.230
 would observe those who are not lacking and not 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.750
 we call them subliminal messages are 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.120
 just of the beats suitable for 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.340
 entertain adults because children 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.700
 we would understand them 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.980
 example symbol were to enter into one 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.629
 cave I think populated by dwarfs or 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.379
 however we know where it is inside yes 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.810
 they found the dwarves is the magic word for 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.280
 enter that the door kept telling him was from 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.780
 you friends come in 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.750
 the cave said it was not 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.139
 written however does not remind me of anything 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.049
 your friends found are scattered 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:53.359
 these details for a more public 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.329
 adult who can understand anyway 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.069
 laugh at these things a child like us 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.120
 would not even notice I assume it was 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.120
 quoted the lord of the rings 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.430
 to me this cartoon 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:07.060
 I personally like it very much 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.639
 fun different than usual 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.919
 with these somewhat grotesque paradoxes 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.870
 with these strange things but still a 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.880
 imagination and positive according to 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.620
 constructive for children and not like the 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.750
 pimpa I don't know if I've ever told you but 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.979
 I don't like the imagination used by 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.960
 pimpa because I find it deviant for the 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.610
 teaching and for understanding the 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.159
 world by a child instead 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.199
 this is this kind of imagination 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.789
 I find it really constructive to 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.590
 a child's creativity 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:39.050
 this at least my opinion for 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.950
 what can for that little studied of 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.320
 psychology of color form 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.640
 let's say the whole theory behind it 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.650
 to the job of the advertiser 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.850
 so I send a big kiss to me 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.660
 I say that I would do it very willingly 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.020
 see my children 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.020
 bye Bye
