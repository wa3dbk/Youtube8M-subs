00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 marc wilmots we are 15th on the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.549
 fifa ranking 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.069
 how happy you make the angle 4 you are 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.679
 there also your things we can be happy and 4 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.259
 its what is the goal is not yet 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.089
 achieve two is as simple as we want 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.980
 of course the qualification 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.750
 but we are good to the way we are 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.119
 nuna6 match 15 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.650
 then he ruled do him now must now 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.990
 among the first ten 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.960
 but she looked behind us so much later 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.460
 we are berries one ever scratches ten 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.279
 twelve years ago 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.559
 I think true 16 to the 2002 World Cup too 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.780
 just to get a better bladder but then 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.460
 should you do that then it should be now we 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.140
 are focused on wisdom 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.730
 have to grab 3 points 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.320
 what is the goal in the fifa ranking then 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.480
 itself from there you still want touch 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.960
 forward of course because if you win win 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.120
 your place 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.579
 I think we should not move ahead of new ones 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.989
 his works are not happy 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.750
 we must now be a new ambition in 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.370
 the top ten turbine to come so so so so 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.070
 separately difficult with of course the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.600
 qualification that is under do but if 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.460
 we are on fifa ranking hey how 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.309
 also classified these as we should 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.659
 play luggage contest then we are this 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.640
 that is why the series 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.200
 to get news of yelling 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.689
 ok it is also not a certainty about one 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.819
 qualifying with is nevertheless a plus 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.159
 our most important opponent relationship 

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:19.869
 furthermore that means he is very 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.090
 being strong have also seen one here 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.159
 fourth place is nothing that is natural 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.159
 nothing is the start of my qualification 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.439
 where quasi 7 and now they are through then 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.880
 his lessons they do not let anything go 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.799
 they make such a beautiful course as we do 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.359
 almost a perfect trail 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.090
 ok but then also a plan with me and me 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.319
 knew there and I have something in circulation 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.959
 is favorite 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.209
 through his experience also by the player 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.739
 who are at many big club are we too 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:46.959
 maybe with our for the first or 

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:49.750
 second years but they are busy with four 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:51.129
 five years experience in tone horn 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.860
 but we will see how 

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:55.360
 do n't let them look at anything now against Serbia 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.250
 tried to grab points until the 10th 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.890
 final and then we'll see where we are 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.569
 stand for Serbian racing trip to the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.219
 united states what exactly is it 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.229
 purpose of it and what do you expect from it 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.599
 what are their ambitions united? 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.759
 states the friendly match 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:11.680
 The first thing to do is play with us 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.989
 and then elyse medical 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.910
 analysis make much wisdom have 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.459
 made who is hurt who is not 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.920
 hurt in forms to stay point one 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.200
 little team burning also between us and 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.030
 family but certainly also a match one 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.980
 contest where we can beat and 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.359
 have eight days for the 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.130
 have an important game against them 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.050
 it's more mine 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.630
 a training at battle when they are in as 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.950
 international I have a question now at 7a 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.010
 player I play with 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.900
 the intention is that the 23 players are fit 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.520
 to get 100% ready for the 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.170
 game against them have as say 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.960
 against the people who have reservations 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.240
 relatively short for a further trip 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.270
 an important one but it is now relative 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.660
 Short went crazy from 23 to 30 then 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.250
 we have 9 more days for them to order 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.690
 jack click there 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.130
 but we leave we say we are tired 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.720
 will certainly be tired we have now 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.460
 have bought special glasses where necessary 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.020
 each mills in the leg and in order to 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.840
 twenty minute rough 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.220
 ok it is now so thoughts we have 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.230
 have also watched a meeting with 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.080
 the medical staff metric then fracture 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.850
 am new mesh framework with the erichot we 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.950
 have everything planned for a new must 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.630
 its otherwise i never went to america 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.630
 gone 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.630
