00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
of America as you can see it's about

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.380 
of America as you can see it's about
ladies<00:01:02.079> would<00:01:02.379> and<00:01:02.790> so<00:01:03.790> it's<00:01:03.879> running<00:01:04.059> pretty

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
ladies would and so it's running pretty

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.690 
ladies would and so it's running pretty
fast<00:01:04.479> now<00:01:05.520> further<00:01:06.520> downstream

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.240 

now<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.240> moved<00:01:12.600> further<00:01:12.780> downstream<00:01:13.440> so<00:01:14.070> it's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
now I moved further downstream so it's

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.290 
now I moved further downstream so it's
about<00:01:14.460> 35<00:01:15.120> meters<00:01:15.479> wide<00:01:15.690> now<00:01:16.670> as<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.180> see

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
on the ground there's sand so that means

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:34.190 
on the ground there's sand so that means
that<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.400> rivers<00:01:23.729> going<00:01:24.150> slow
