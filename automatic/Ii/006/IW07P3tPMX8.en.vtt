00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.250
 Hello and welcome to for 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.559
 beginners the segment of this channel 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.690
 dedicated to those useless shit 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.209
 that in their fucking life they have touched a 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.250
 video game control because here 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.410
 will learn the basics about the sagas 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.570
 of most popular video games in this 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.520
 occasion we have an indie saga and of 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.430
 low budget called mario bros 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.380
 Let's start the Mario Bros saga 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.450
 in the medieval era and it looks 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.880
 reflected in the presence of castles 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.309
 fortresses and dungeons scattered around 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.550
 all the games the only thing that I do not 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.070
 I explain is how this escaped from the 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.720
 Inquisition in any case the first thing that 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.790
 should know is that the character more 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.580
 relevant to the saga is the bread are from 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.740
 He mario along with his sexually friend 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.510
 brother luigi they became 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.670
 time travelers to be brought to the 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.680
 gone through a fucking playstation convoy 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.470
 that makes magic to throw buttons 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.090
 dualshock for many years it 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.370
 he speculated on the inspiration that 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.269
 nintendo used for the appearance of 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.159
 Mario and Luigi 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.049
 but for some time it was revealed that 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.680
 mario is inspired by the communist 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.720
 Cuban 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.530
 joseph stalin who is most remembered by 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.740
 save life 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.479
 millions likewise the appearance of luigi 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.369
 it was taken from the famous communist 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.470
 nigerian min 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.110
 tendon 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.520
 like any Thai company nintendo 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.290
 It hides many secrets in its 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.560
 franchises and the names of mario and 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.270
 luigi are not at all the exception anymore 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.910
 that reveal aspects about their 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.710
 personality so for example if the 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.050
 potigÃ³n de mario remove the letter m 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.230
 of its name is the Aryan word 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.100
 revealing itself so mario is indeed a 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.110
 Nazi communist to luigi on the other hand if 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.900
 it removes the l from his name is the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.880
 word which and now this is a game 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.000
 of words since in English the word 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.210
 ouija is pronounced uy 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.310
 willy board and since the ouija board is 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.740
 related to religion then this 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.240
 means that luigi is nothing more and nothing 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:10.450
 less than an ultra conservative communist 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.420
 but what about those with doubts behind ml 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.060
 well these two reveal the exact time 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.340
 in which this franchise is set the m 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.530
 no, it's not shit, it's 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.640
 to the number of thousand in the numbers 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.090
 Romans while l means 50 by 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.090
 what this saga is set in the year 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.540
 2050 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.250
 since his arrival in the land of mario has 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.190
 fought innumerable adventures for 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.870
 defeat the evil square dart that with 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.940
 your army of ninja turtles viola 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.560
 mushrooms has tried to conquer this 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.730
 place by kidnapping the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.860
 priestess samus aran yes yes I already know what 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.599
 who will be wondering how shit 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.610
 Samus is the person more 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.670
 powerful of this place always end 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.040
 kidnapped will be that the syndrome of 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.950
 Stockholm has given way to a sickly 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.579
 relationship between her and her captor 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.750
 well we'll see the answer later 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.970
 in terms of the gameplay of this 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.590
 franchising promoter of zoophilia the 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.870
 Mario games are designed to be 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.209
 played without breaking a single block of 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.250
 This is because, from the 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.530
 first incursion of the fourth act the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.950
 priestess samus used his power 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.360
 originated in purity yes clear for 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.690
 transform the inhabitants of the 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.610
 earth of in stone blocks without 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.349
 But I'm noticing when I realize that 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.810
 no egg from the manuals of the 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.360
 games decided to include from the second 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.870
 game the option to unlock 2 final 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.910
 one good and one bad to unlock 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.740
 the good ending obviously you have to 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.350
 Pass the game without breaking a fucking 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.840
 block and to unlock the bad end 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.900
 not enough to break a block because 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.630
 you have to break exactly 777 of 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.180
 these is to say you have to reach the 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.530
 number of the beast among others 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.500
 important characters of this 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.180
 franchise we have anti mario the 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.670
 mario mafia personality that makes 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.610
 honor to its American Italian origin 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.520
 we also have elsa the witch of 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:14.030
 Swedish west the banana tree crowns with 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.650
 feet the 'bous among others now maybe 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.530
 have heard of a character 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.329
 called dudes and good, well, that 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.270
 is nothing more and nothing less than the son of 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.250
 square cartoon now you will say and for 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.230
 What the shit is important, yes, the 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.640
 I really do not have a fucking idea but what I do 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.290
 I know is that one of the biggest 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.560
 mysteries of the saga has been the 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.390
 identity of the mother of god and although 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.190
 according to statements by the dubbing actor 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.590
 of Arabic origin face 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.500
 hector and the the mystery is simpler than 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.960
 what it looks like in a statement said in 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.240
 every game samus and square tarbut pass 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.250
 most of the time together I do not think 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.800
 that there is mystery in the mother of God and 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.300
 how can this franchise still have 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.640
 more mysteries that should be 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.590
 solved in upcoming games as per 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.230
 example will one day be fulfilled the 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.330
 mario's prophecy and dreams that mysteries 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.310
 mysterious hides the mysterious area of 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.890
 the green hill we will see again 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.410
 Pinocchio will one day come back 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.720
 luigi from the land of voice with courage 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.840
 how much you want what the 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.580
 recent rise of samus aran weight 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.100
 because the sas always has porongas 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.380
 in his castle because the fan boy of 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.050
 Playstation never throws the whores x 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.000

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.270
