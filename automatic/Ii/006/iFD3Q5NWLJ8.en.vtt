I think he was in the round of eight of
the<00:01:50.459> msl<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.149> remember<00:01:51.509> his<00:01:51.689> best<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.169> five

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.859 
the msl I remember his best of five
against<00:01:52.709> luxury<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.849> the<00:01:54.029> msl<00:01:54.419> doesn't<00:01:54.749> work

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
against luxury but the msl doesn't work

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.550 
against luxury but the msl doesn't work
the<00:01:55.020> same<00:01:55.049> as<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> OSL<00:01:56.719> OSL<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:58.049> its<00:01:58.169> best<00:01:58.380> of

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the same as the OSL OSL but its best of

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.979 
the same as the OSL OSL but its best of
three<00:01:58.770> format<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.279> the<00:01:59.310> round<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.639> eight<00:01:59.959> but<00:02:00.959> i

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:00.989 
three format in the round of eight but i

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:03.769 
three format in the round of eight but i
think<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:02.099> is<00:02:02.279> best-of-five<00:02:02.789> format<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:03.779 
think it is best-of-five format and the

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:06.489 
think it is best-of-five format and the
msl<00:02:04.319> least<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.770> was<00:02:04.919> in<00:02:05.099> the<00:02:05.189> avalon<00:02:05.669> or

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499 
msl least it was in the avalon or

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:09.109 
msl least it was in the avalon or
whatever<00:02:07.499> the<00:02:07.679> name<00:02:07.709> it<00:02:08.039> was<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> MSO

might have read that in the first game
between<00:02:51.180> Lita<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.080> type<00:02:52.260> B<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.470> don't<00:02:52.770> remember

between Lita and type B I don't remember
but<00:02:54.620> yeah<00:02:55.620> there<00:02:56.070> it<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.340> looks<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.180> yeah

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
but yeah there it is looks like yeah

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.550 
but yeah there it is looks like yeah
lead<00:02:58.110> is<00:02:58.290> going<00:02:58.650> out<00:02:58.890> here<00:03:00.170> might<00:03:01.170> be<00:03:01.200> thinking

excellent fan there yeah this is going

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.960 
excellent fan there yeah this is going
to<00:03:07.260> be<00:03:07.350> probably<00:03:07.830> a<00:03:07.920> wall<00:03:08.250> off<00:03:08.490> from<00:03:08.760> Lita

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
to be probably a wall off from Lita

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.880 
to be probably a wall off from Lita
always<00:03:09.810> walling<00:03:10.080> off<00:03:10.200> into<00:03:10.530> his<00:03:10.650> main

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
always walling off into his main

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.610 
always walling off into his main
actually<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.520> sending<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:12.090> s<00:03:12.720> CB<00:03:13.110> out<00:03:13.320> there

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
actually and sending that s CB out there

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.380 
actually and sending that s CB out there
to<00:03:13.800> get<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.010> scout<00:03:14.280> since<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.090> four

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
to get the scout since this is a four

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.510 
to get the scout since this is a four
player<00:03:15.570> map<00:03:16.020> it's<00:03:16.890> probably<00:03:17.220> going<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.430> take

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
player map it's probably going to take

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.060 
player map it's probably going to take
yeah<00:03:18.420> it's<00:03:18.600> going<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.840> take<00:03:19.050> late<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.410> long<00:03:19.770> time

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
yeah it's going to take late a long time

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.340 
yeah it's going to take late a long time
to<00:03:20.280> eventually<00:03:20.850> find<00:03:20.880> type<00:03:21.480> be<00:03:21.690> here<00:03:21.960> although

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
to eventually find type be here although

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.480 
to eventually find type be here although
he's<00:03:22.470> probably<00:03:22.620> going<00:03:22.800> to<00:03:22.890> see<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.130> Overlord

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
he's probably going to see that Overlord

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.230 
he's probably going to see that Overlord
after<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.880> while<00:03:25.280> type<00:03:26.280> B<00:03:26.310> over<00:03:26.730> here<00:03:26.910> putting

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
after a while type B over here putting

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.390 
after a while type B over here putting
down<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.600> command<00:03:28.140> center<00:03:28.620> oh<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:28.980> thought<00:03:29.340> that

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
down a command center oh I thought that

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.860 
down a command center oh I thought that
was<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:29.640> barracks<00:03:30.180> there<00:03:30.360> for<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.570> second<00:03:30.840> but

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
was a barracks there for a second but

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.650 
was a barracks there for a second but
this<00:03:31.050> is<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.200> command<00:03:31.770> center<00:03:31.970> actually<00:03:32.970> from

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
this is a command center actually from

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.780 
this is a command center actually from
ohm<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.770> think<00:03:34.950> this<00:03:35.040> was<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.220> night<00:03:35.580> either

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
ohm and I think this was a night either

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.760 
ohm and I think this was a night either
a<00:03:35.910> nine<00:03:36.270> poor<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:36.840> over<00:03:37.140> pool<00:03:37.350> or<00:03:37.530> something

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
a nine poor and over pool or something

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.000 
a nine poor and over pool or something
but<00:03:38.190> these<00:03:38.310> legs<00:03:38.610> are<00:03:38.850> very<00:03:39.300> very<00:03:39.660> quick<00:03:40.140> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
but these legs are very very quick the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.340 
but these legs are very very quick the
links<00:03:41.310> coming<00:03:41.460> in<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:41.970> manly<00:03:42.570> could<00:03:43.020> be<00:03:43.140> in<00:03:43.260> a

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
links coming in so manly could be in a

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.200 
links coming in so manly could be in a
really<00:03:43.800> bad<00:03:44.100> position<00:03:44.400> here<00:03:44.730> he's<00:03:44.940> going<00:03:45.090> to

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
really bad position here he's going to

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.600 
really bad position here he's going to
be<00:03:45.300> scouted<00:03:45.690> by<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:46.020> overlord<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.130> things

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
be scouted by this overlord so things

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.060 
be scouted by this overlord so things
may<00:03:48.300> be<00:03:48.360> not<00:03:48.690> going<00:03:49.050> for<00:03:49.260> leaders<00:03:49.560> way<00:03:49.770> here<00:03:50.040> I

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
may be not going for leaders way here I

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.750 
may be not going for leaders way here I
can't<00:03:50.370> believe<00:03:50.580> he<00:03:50.730> put<00:03:50.940> down<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:52.520> base<00:03:53.520> there

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
can't believe he put down a base there

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.400 
can't believe he put down a base there
although<00:03:53.970> this<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:54.390> kind<00:03:54.690> of<00:03:54.840> smart<00:03:55.200> this<00:03:55.350> is

although this is kind of smart this is

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.530 
although this is kind of smart this is
kind<00:03:55.740> of<00:03:55.830> smart<00:03:56.220> play<00:03:56.460> from<00:03:56.490> Leda<00:03:56.910> building

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
kind of smart play from Leda building

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.200 
kind of smart play from Leda building
that<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:58.050> wall<00:03:58.350> off<00:03:58.530> his<00:03:59.010> main<00:03:59.310> like<00:03:59.610> this<00:03:59.880> he

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
that to wall off his main like this he

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.360 
that to wall off his main like this he
didn't<00:04:00.510> build<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.900> at<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.320> natural<00:04:02.070> expansion

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
didn't build it at the natural expansion

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.330 
didn't build it at the natural expansion
area<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.270> that<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:04.380> means<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.980> this<00:04:05.100> going

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
area and that that means that this going

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.460 
area and that that means that this going

to be super close I'm not sure what

to be super close I'm not sure what

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
out in time to deal with this actually

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.890 
out in time to deal with this actually
this<00:04:25.740> is<00:04:25.890> absolutely<00:04:26.310> on<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.610> edge<00:04:26.910> play<00:04:27.330> from

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
this is absolutely on the edge play from

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.170 
this is absolutely on the edge play from
Leda<00:04:28.169> if<00:04:28.320> he<00:04:28.470> actually<00:04:28.680> fence<00:04:29.190> this<00:04:29.430> off<00:04:29.669> he's

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
Leda if he actually fence this off he's

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.250 
Leda if he actually fence this off he's
going<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.480> be<00:04:30.570> in<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:30.750> hue

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
going to be in a hue

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.050 
going to be in a hue
huge<00:04:31.380> economic<00:04:31.620> advantage<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:32.760> he's

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
huge economic advantage and he's

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.340 
huge economic advantage and he's
probably<00:04:33.330> going<00:04:33.570> to<00:04:33.690> be<00:04:33.780> able<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.990> take<00:04:34.170> the

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
probably going to be able to take the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.020 
probably going to be able to take the
game<00:04:34.530> but<00:04:34.740> man<00:04:34.980> this<00:04:35.160> is<00:04:35.280> going<00:04:35.460> to<00:04:35.520> be<00:04:35.610> so

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
game but man this is going to be so

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.930 
game but man this is going to be so
close<00:04:36.800> leaders<00:04:37.800> actually<00:04:37.950> pumping<00:04:38.460> an<00:04:38.580> SCV

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
close leaders actually pumping an SCV

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.740 
close leaders actually pumping an SCV
from<00:04:39.390> that<00:04:39.540> one<00:04:39.720> base<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.400> i'll<00:04:41.400> type<00:04:42.240> he<00:04:42.420> sees

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
from that one base and i'll type he sees

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.660 
from that one base and i'll type he sees
this<00:04:42.960> now<00:04:43.200> but<00:04:43.680> he's<00:04:43.800> going<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.100> try<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.310> figure

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
this now but he's going to try to figure

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.550 
this now but he's going to try to figure
out<00:04:44.760> a<00:04:44.880> way<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.120> deal<00:04:45.390> with<00:04:45.540> this<00:04:45.690> he<00:04:45.870> is<00:04:45.900> that

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
out a way to deal with this he is that

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.920 
out a way to deal with this he is that
is<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.770> complete<00:04:47.280> wall<00:04:47.640> in<00:04:47.910> from<00:04:48.540> leader<00:04:48.750> this

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
is a complete wall in from leader this

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.360 
is a complete wall in from leader this
is<00:04:48.990> absolutely<00:04:49.710> one<00:04:49.890> of<00:04:49.920> the<00:04:49.980> most<00:04:50.160> bizarre

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
is absolutely one of the most bizarre

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.230 
is absolutely one of the most bizarre
Terran<00:04:50.970> bills<00:04:51.150> I've<00:04:51.330> ever<00:04:51.510> seen<00:04:52.520> but<00:04:53.520> yeah<00:04:54.210> I

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
Terran bills I've ever seen but yeah I

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.420 
Terran bills I've ever seen but yeah I
think<00:04:54.450> Lita<00:04:55.110> is<00:04:55.200> going<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.740> be<00:04:55.860> able<00:04:55.950> to<00:04:56.220> do

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
think Lita is going to be able to do

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.740 
think Lita is going to be able to do
this<00:04:56.640> he's<00:04:56.910> going<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.180> be<00:04:57.240> able<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.480> get<00:04:57.600> out

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
this he's going to be able to get out

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.750 
this he's going to be able to get out
enough<00:04:58.260> brings<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.770> defend<00:04:59.160> and<00:04:59.340> eventually

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
enough brings to defend and eventually

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.980 
enough brings to defend and eventually
is<00:04:59.820> going<00:04:59.910> to<00:05:00.000> be<00:05:00.090> able<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:00.300> float<00:05:00.540> that<00:05:00.720> base

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
is going to be able to float that base

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.080 
is going to be able to float that base
up<00:05:01.290> but<00:05:01.800> if<00:05:01.980> I<00:05:02.100> were<00:05:02.250> tight<00:05:02.430> be<00:05:02.610> right<00:05:02.790> now<00:05:02.940> I'd

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
up but if I were tight be right now I'd

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.600 
up but if I were tight be right now I'd
be<00:05:03.120> trying<00:05:03.420> to<00:05:03.690> deny<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:04.320> base<00:05:04.620> trying<00:05:05.430> to

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
be trying to deny that base trying to

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.580 
be trying to deny that base trying to
get<00:05:05.760> those<00:05:05.940> zerglings<00:05:06.390> over<00:05:06.780> there<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.320> just

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
get those zerglings over there and just

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.230 
get those zerglings over there and just
try<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:07.860> deny<00:05:08.190> that<00:05:08.550> base<00:05:08.760> as<00:05:08.910> long<00:05:09.060> as<00:05:09.180> I

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
try to deny that base as long as I

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.000 
try to deny that base as long as I
possibly<00:05:09.270> can<00:05:09.810> i<00:05:09.870> think<00:05:10.170> the<00:05:10.260> layer<00:05:10.500> is<00:05:10.680> coming

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
possibly can i think the layer is coming

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.910 
possibly can i think the layer is coming
up<00:05:11.130> actually<00:05:11.640> for<00:05:12.240> type<00:05:13.020> B<00:05:13.290> so<00:05:13.560> this<00:05:13.590> is

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
up actually for type B so this is

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.700 
up actually for type B so this is
absolutely<00:05:14.820> on<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.030> edge<00:05:15.330> game<00:05:15.810> this<00:05:16.470> going

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
absolutely on the edge game this going

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.740 
absolutely on the edge game this going
to<00:05:16.740> be<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.860> lurker<00:05:17.220> rush<00:05:17.580> from<00:05:17.880> type<00:05:18.090> B's<00:05:18.390> going
