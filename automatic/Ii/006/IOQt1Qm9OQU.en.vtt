00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.560 
you don't get any commitment and your I

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
could potentially walk at any moment

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.840 
could potentially walk at any moment
because<00:01:28.020> we're<00:01:28.229> not<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.560> relationship<00:01:28.850> so
