I<00:00:15.720> used<00:00:16.720> to<00:00:16.900> come<00:00:17.110> here<00:00:17.350> alone<00:00:17.500> a<00:00:17.740> long<00:00:18.310> time

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
I used to come here alone a long time

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.140 
I used to come here alone a long time
ago<00:00:19.150> I'd<00:00:19.660> practice<00:00:20.140> my<00:00:20.320> lines<00:00:20.350> out<00:00:20.950> here<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
ago I'd practice my lines out here the

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.350 
ago I'd practice my lines out here the
night<00:00:22.180> sea<00:00:22.990> would<00:00:23.320> be<00:00:23.350> dark<00:00:23.860> and<00:00:24.220> swirling<00:00:25.090> and

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
night sea would be dark and swirling and

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.150 
night sea would be dark and swirling and
I<00:00:25.450> would<00:00:25.660> think<00:00:25.900> it's<00:00:26.410> just<00:00:26.950> like<00:00:27.250> me<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
I would think it's just like me and the

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.080 
I would think it's just like me and the
sea<00:00:30.490> is<00:00:30.789> just<00:00:31.300> like<00:00:31.539> me<00:00:31.810> now<00:00:32.129> it's<00:00:33.129> clean<00:00:33.640> and

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
sea is just like me now it's clean and

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.830 
sea is just like me now it's clean and
shining<00:00:34.600> that's<00:00:35.590> how<00:00:35.829> I<00:00:35.860> feel<00:00:36.280> too<00:00:36.690> when<00:00:37.690> I'm

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
shining that's how I feel too when I'm

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.020 
shining that's how I feel too when I'm
with<00:00:38.020> you<00:00:38.079> I<00:00:38.590> feel<00:00:39.280> like<00:00:39.310> I<00:00:39.579> can<00:00:39.760> start

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
with you I feel like I can start

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.889 
with you I feel like I can start
thinking<00:00:40.270> of<00:00:40.600> myself<00:00:41.079> as<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.290> decent<00:00:41.829> person<00:00:42.130> oh

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
thinking of myself as a decent person oh

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.200 
thinking of myself as a decent person oh
yeah<00:00:43.899> the<00:00:44.620> whole<00:00:44.649> point<00:00:45.100> of<00:00:45.310> wanting<00:00:45.880> to<00:00:45.910> see

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
yeah the whole point of wanting to see

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:54.380 
yeah the whole point of wanting to see
you<00:00:46.360> today

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.950 

it's<00:00:55.040> homemade<00:00:56.040> I<00:00:56.460> probably<00:00:57.450> could<00:00:57.900> have

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it's homemade I probably could have

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.110 
it's homemade I probably could have
bought<00:00:58.200> something<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.890> tastes<00:00:59.280> better<00:00:59.460> but

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
bought something that tastes better but

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
bought something that tastes better but
I<00:01:00.150> figured<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.900> the<00:01:01.020> thought<00:01:01.350> counts<00:01:01.830> for

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
I figured that the thought counts for

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.549 
I figured that the thought counts for
more<00:01:02.190> than<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.550> flavor<00:01:03.080> you<00:01:04.080> don't<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.410> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
more than the flavor you don't have to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:13.920 
more than the flavor you don't have to
eat<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.770> but<00:01:05.370> please<00:01:05.970> accept<00:01:06.450> my<00:01:07.140> gift

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
you'd say that it's a bit unfair of me
