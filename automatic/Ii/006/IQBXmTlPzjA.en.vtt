00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the blue background the court cards have

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.910 
the blue background the court cards have
a<00:01:20.130> standard<00:01:20.759> design<00:01:21.110> but<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.380> custom

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
a standard design but have custom

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.300 
a standard design but have custom
coloring<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:25.020> number<00:01:25.350> cards<00:01:25.799> are<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.280> same

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
coloring the number cards are the same

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.289 
coloring the number cards are the same
way<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.409> spades<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.400> clubs<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:30.030> white

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
way so the spades and clubs are white

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.749 
way so the spades and clubs are white
and<00:01:30.659> then<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.170> hearts<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.590> diamonds<00:01:31.799> are<00:01:32.189> red

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
and then the hearts and diamonds are red

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.120 
and then the hearts and diamonds are red
and<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.200> look<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> deck<00:01:34.890> it's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
and that's the look of the deck it's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.600 
and that's the look of the deck it's
definitely<00:01:35.780> different<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:37.020> terms<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.340> blue

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
definitely different in terms of a blue

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.690 
definitely different in terms of a blue
deck<00:01:39.079> with<00:01:40.079> having<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> blue<00:01:40.860> background<00:01:41.130> I

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
deck with having the blue background I

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.880 
deck with having the blue background I
think<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> good<00:01:42.840> deck<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.290> you're<00:01:43.439> into

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
think this is a good deck if you're into

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.649 
think this is a good deck if you're into
that<00:01:44.130> blue<00:01:44.369> color<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.270> nice<00:01:45.450> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that blue color and then it's nice to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.020 
that blue color and then it's nice to
have<00:01:45.810> those<00:01:46.049> extra<00:01:46.470> gaff<00:01:47.100> cards<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.610> there<00:01:47.759> for

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
have those extra gaff cards in there for

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.359 
have those extra gaff cards in there for
some<00:01:48.180> tricks<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.409> now<00:01:49.500> let's<00:01:49.680> talk<00:01:49.829> about<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
some tricks so now let's talk about the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.039 
some tricks so now let's talk about the
handling<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> deck<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.869> other

cards<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:43.340> would<00:02:44.340> say<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:44.819> this<00:02:45.030> deck<00:02:45.390> can<00:02:46.080> be

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
cards I would say that this deck can be

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.430 
cards I would say that this deck can be
used<00:02:46.650> for<00:02:46.890> magic<00:02:47.340> it's<00:02:48.030> not<00:02:48.239> too<00:02:48.780> over-the-top

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
used for magic it's not too over-the-top

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.509 
used for magic it's not too over-the-top
with<00:02:50.220> design<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.660> handling<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:53.310> if

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
with design and the handling is if

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.140 
with design and the handling is if
overall<00:02:54.060> decent<00:02:54.870> quality<00:02:55.760> that's<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.940> end<00:02:57.090> of

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
overall decent quality that's the end of
