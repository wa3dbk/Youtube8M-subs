things I listen to all sorts of music
and<00:05:39.720> I<00:05:40.710> don't<00:05:41.220> think<00:05:41.400> there<00:05:41.669> was<00:05:41.820> a<00:05:42.050> type<00:05:43.050> of

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
and I don't think there was a type of

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.420 
and I don't think there was a type of
music<00:05:43.590> that<00:05:43.620> they<00:05:43.740> didn't<00:05:44.070> work<00:05:44.220> out<00:05:44.370> very

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
music that they didn't work out very

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.330 
music that they didn't work out very
well<00:05:44.699> for<00:05:46.970> so<00:05:47.970> yeah<00:05:48.090> overall<00:05:48.330> I<00:05:49.099> like<00:05:50.099> these

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.279 
well for so yeah overall I like these
headphones<00:05:50.970> I<00:05:51.210> think<00:05:51.479> they<00:05:51.599> work<00:05:51.870> really<00:05:52.139> well

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
headphones I think they work really well

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.310 
headphones I think they work really well
and<00:05:52.710> they<00:05:53.430> would<00:05:53.580> definitely<00:05:54.030> keep<00:05:54.330> getting

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
and they would definitely keep getting

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.800 
and they would definitely keep getting
those<00:05:55.380> out<00:05:55.680> if<00:05:55.830> you're<00:05:55.979> working<00:05:56.159> in<00:05:56.520> a<00:05:57.210> louder

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
those out if you're working in a louder

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.980 
those out if you're working in a louder
environm<00:05:58.440> environment<00:05:59.430> and<00:05:59.699> are<00:06:00.479> tired<00:06:00.780> of

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
environm environment and are tired of

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.350 
environm environment and are tired of
cords<00:06:01.440> all<00:06:01.590> the<00:06:01.710> time<00:06:01.919> so<00:06:02.820> give<00:06:03.030> it<00:06:03.060> a<00:06:03.150> shot
