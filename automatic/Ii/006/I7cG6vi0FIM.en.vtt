00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
been it's going to be a slow week I

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.889 
been it's going to be a slow week I

guess I think it'll be an active week I

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.430 
guess I think it'll be an active week I
think<00:00:41.320> there's<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:41.590> real<00:00:42.100> chance<00:00:42.129> if<00:00:42.789> if<00:00:43.329> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
think there's a real chance if if the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.840 
think there's a real chance if if the
carnage<00:00:44.440> continues<00:00:44.620> in<00:00:45.070> the<00:00:45.160> stock<00:00:45.399> markets

the<00:01:01.690> euro<00:01:01.840> has<00:01:01.930> taken<00:01:02.260> a<00:01:02.320> hammer<00:01:02.469> hammering

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
the euro has taken a hammer hammering

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.640 
the euro has taken a hammer hammering
this<00:01:03.609> week<00:01:04.019> how<00:01:05.019> is<00:01:05.110> that<00:01:05.140> going<00:01:05.320> to<00:01:05.410> play<00:01:05.530> out

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
this week how is that going to play out

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.380 
this week how is that going to play out
with<00:01:05.800> gold<00:01:05.950> well<00:01:06.490> I<00:01:06.520> think<00:01:06.670> money's<00:01:07.090> moving

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
with gold well I think money's moving

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.660 
with gold well I think money's moving
into<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.720> dollar<00:01:08.280> even<00:01:09.280> though<00:01:09.370> the<00:01:09.490> dollar

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
into the dollar even though the dollar

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.190 
into the dollar even though the dollar
is<00:01:09.790> not<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.060> best<00:01:10.180> place<00:01:10.360> to<00:01:10.630> be<00:01:10.750> it's<00:01:10.900> the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
is not the best place to be it's the

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.070 
is not the best place to be it's the
better<00:01:11.530> place<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:12.070> be<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.930> gold<00:01:13.930> is

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
better place to be and gold is

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.830 
better place to be and gold is
denominated<00:01:14.409> in<00:01:15.130> dollars<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:16.570> stronger

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
denominated in dollars and the stronger

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.539 
denominated in dollars and the stronger
dollar<00:01:17.049> is<00:01:17.290> certainly<00:01:17.560> having<00:01:17.890> an<00:01:17.979> impact<00:01:18.280> on

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
dollar is certainly having an impact on

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.670 
dollar is certainly having an impact on
on<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.210> metals<00:01:19.509> creating<00:01:20.200> much<00:01:20.350> weaker

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
on the metals creating much weaker

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.760 
on the metals creating much weaker
metals<00:01:20.979> prices<00:01:21.329> and<00:01:22.329> I<00:01:22.450> expect<00:01:22.869> that<00:01:23.409> trend<00:01:23.590> to

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
metals prices and I expect that trend to

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.130 
metals prices and I expect that trend to
continue<00:01:23.799> with<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.490> euro<00:01:25.020> possibly<00:01:26.020> maybe

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
continue with the euro possibly maybe

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.649 
continue with the euro possibly maybe
not<00:01:26.409> this<00:01:26.560> week<00:01:26.799> but<00:01:26.979> headed<00:01:27.759> towards<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.150> the

not this week but headed towards the the

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.749 
not this week but headed towards the the
110<00:01:29.079> level<00:01:29.439> against<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:29.979> dollar<00:01:30.159> which<00:01:30.579> would

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
110 level against the dollar which would

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.160 
110 level against the dollar which would
be<00:01:30.939> negative<00:01:30.970> for<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:31.450> metals<00:01:31.750> in<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:31.930> short

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
be negative for the metals in the short

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.420 
be negative for the metals in the short

play into anything in the markets you

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.190 
play into anything in the markets you
know<00:01:39.909> I<00:01:39.970> don't<00:01:40.180> think<00:01:40.329> it'll<00:01:40.450> be<00:01:40.509> a<00:01:40.600> surprise<00:01:40.810> i

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
know I don't think it'll be a surprise i

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.690 
know I don't think it'll be a surprise i
think<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:41.890> know<00:01:41.920> they're<00:01:42.130> expecting<00:01:42.610> around

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
think you know they're expecting around

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.190 
think you know they're expecting around
two<00:01:43.000> percent<00:01:43.390> i<00:01:43.570> think<00:01:43.720> it'll<00:01:43.869> come<00:01:44.049> in

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
two percent i think it'll come in

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.819 
two percent i think it'll come in
between<00:01:44.350> 1.8<00:01:45.189> 2.2<00:01:46.229> there's<00:01:47.229> very<00:01:47.619> little

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
between 1.8 2.2 there's very little

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.260 
between 1.8 2.2 there's very little
that's<00:01:47.979> going<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.399> happen<00:01:48.520> in<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:48.880> market

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
that's going to happen in this market
