should be a very long code this is copy
that<00:04:15.490> I<00:04:16.470> forgot<00:04:17.530> it's<00:04:17.859> at<00:04:17.950> all<00:04:18.040> but<00:04:18.250> I<00:04:18.400> hope<00:04:19.049> to

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
that I forgot it's at all but I hope to

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.380 
that I forgot it's at all but I hope to
the<00:04:20.170> end<00:04:20.940> 6<00:04:22.500> there<00:04:23.500> we<00:04:23.590> go

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
the end 6 there we go

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.830 
the end 6 there we go
copy<00:04:25.390> that<00:04:25.510> then<00:04:26.320> there<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:27.040> wanna<00:04:27.840> just

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
copy that then there you wanna just

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.050 
copy that then there you wanna just
right-click<00:04:29.290> and<00:04:29.470> paste<00:04:29.500> that<00:04:29.860> in<00:04:30.040> as<00:04:30.850> you<00:04:31.000> can

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
right-click and paste that in as you can

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.550 
right-click and paste that in as you can
see<00:04:31.360> gonna<00:04:31.690> make<00:04:31.780> sure<00:04:31.900> about<00:04:32.020> spaces<00:04:32.440> it

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
see gonna make sure about spaces it

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.600 
see gonna make sure about spaces it
otherwise<00:04:32.830> will<00:04:33.070> not<00:04:33.190> work

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
otherwise will not work

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.690 
otherwise will not work

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
this curve right here this code in fact

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.719 
this curve right here this code in fact
is<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.840> machine<00:05:04.840> ID<00:05:05.190> so<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.280> want<00:05:06.430> to<00:05:06.490> copy<00:05:06.640> a

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
is the machine ID so you want to copy a

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.830 
is the machine ID so you want to copy a
copy<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:08.590> you<00:05:09.460> just<00:05:09.550> really<00:05:09.820> well<00:05:10.540> here<00:05:10.720> that

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
copy and you just really well here that

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.350 
copy and you just really well here that
obviously<00:05:11.650> cuz<00:05:11.979> that's<00:05:12.130> boo<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.460> original<00:05:12.790> we

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
obviously cuz that's boo the original we

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.780 
obviously cuz that's boo the original we
paste<00:05:13.690> okay

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
paste okay

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.940

to<00:06:53.879> go<00:06:54.509> to<00:06:54.779> tools<00:06:55.369> scroll<00:06:56.369> down<00:06:56.580> to<00:06:56.849> scripting

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
to go to tools scroll down to scripting

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.559 
to go to tools scroll down to scripting
and<00:06:57.830> you<00:06:58.830> could<00:06:58.979> batch<00:06:59.249> render<00:06:59.669> and<00:06:59.909> a<00:07:00.059> batch

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:00.569 
and you could batch render and a batch

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:03.889 
and you could batch render and a batch
render<00:07:00.990> of<00:07:01.199> course<00:07:01.439> and<00:07:01.649> then<00:07:01.769> you<00:07:01.889> wanna<00:07:02.899> you

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:03.899 
render of course and then you wanna you

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:06.199 
render of course and then you wanna you
choose<00:07:04.139> the<00:07:04.289> format<00:07:04.559> you<00:07:04.619> exported<00:07:05.189> and<00:07:05.399> yeah
