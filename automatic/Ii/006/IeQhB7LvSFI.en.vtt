00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.090
 after incongruity and incompetence 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.940
 of the town hall of Seville in particular 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.189
 of icas with which we have an agreement 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.900
 signed from the cultural association bar 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.460
 a promoter of the artistic space 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.029
 carp we are forced to take 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:32.669
 sharp measures 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:32.669
 apparently does not fit with the activity 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.199
 it has gone through my mind not even 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.240
 to follow up not even 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.160
 to track 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.170
 and very curious because in this 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.480
 have already visited media 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.670
 communication from around the world as to 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.420
 jazeera or the same Spanish television 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.280
 earn 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.980
 five documentaries have been made 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.960
 about cancer has been published in 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.500
 numerous magazines and art locations 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.750
 political culture and is currently in 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.280
 the adecos international actions in 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.960
 this time the union of actors us 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.149
 awarded the solidarity award for 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.600
 the activity carried out visited us 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.250
 Schools of England and the USA 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.049
 architects and artists from around the world 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.149
 they have even invited us to give 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.939
 lectures in the faculty of economics 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.380
 de sevilla day of new managers and 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.509
 in the meeting of alternatives 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.180
 because he has not raised interest this 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.880
 town hall and with which we have 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.729
 signed an agreement for it we asked 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.060
 an appointment to the delegate of culture but 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.060
 has passed 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.829
 practically the same thing has happened to us 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.079
 but well I do not want to extend much 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.079
 with these very organic issues 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.100
 you have to see how complicated it is to give 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.200
 life to a space destined for culture 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.060
 which belongs to the administrations 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.230
 public have already left for 28 years 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.030
 abandoned as a solar debris 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.310
 and that only in four years are we one of 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.960
 the cultural spaces of the city ​​with 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.530
 more activities 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.300
 for all these things and many more 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.070
 that does not add 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.440
 we are obliged to break the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.150
 relations with this city ​​council which 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.200
 we believe that it has not lived up to 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.180
 a project of this magnitude 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.220
 but as we continue to think that 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.440
 the city of seville suitable and its 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.209
 citizenship is enough 7 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.500
 participants to assess these 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.420
 activities that all groups 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.450
 we have made without the intention of 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.360
 profit and literally leaving the skin 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.360
 in this project here we are going to continue 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.220
 all the activity carried out and the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.410
 public attention that has accompanied 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.380
 legitimizes the presence of the project of the 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.080
 tent in this space agreed with the 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.140
 administration 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.060
 with beyond that the project of the 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.160
 carp has grown even in this framework 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.300
 of precariousness and look for other spaces 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.810
 where collaboration with the 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.810
 administration 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.420
 it simply moves to the room 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.970
 of the letter to try not to depend on 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.090
 no case of a town hall in which 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.310
 nor the director himself knew dedicate 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.950
 until two months ago the land where 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.950
 is located the tent is competition 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.380
 a somewhat sensation 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.300
 surrealist for having dedicated four 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.459
 years of our lives intact to this 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.860
 project and not having appeared 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.099
 representative throughout this time of 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.459
 body with whom we signed the agreement 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.459
 we said goodbye 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.990
 for that is a mobile infrastructure 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.640
 without census you will soon have news 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.640
 our thanks for everything 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:50.629
 one
