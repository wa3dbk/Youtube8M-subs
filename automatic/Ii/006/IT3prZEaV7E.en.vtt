00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
there's a little zls on here and looking

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.830 
there's a little zls on here and looking
on<00:01:26.280> their<00:01:26.400> website<00:01:26.700> zerolemon<00:01:27.060> says<00:01:27.509> that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
on their website zerolemon says that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.710 
on their website zerolemon says that
these<00:01:28.290> create<00:01:28.979> spacing<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.729> prevent<00:01:30.570> your

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
these create spacing that prevent your

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.090 
these create spacing that prevent your
phone<00:01:30.930> from<00:01:31.229> overheating<00:01:31.650> because<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
phone from overheating because it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.460 
phone from overheating because it
prevents<00:01:32.520> heat<00:01:33.150> remain<00:01:33.540> trapped<00:01:33.840> inside<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
prevents heat remain trapped inside the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.160 
prevents heat remain trapped inside the
case<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:35.040> these<00:01:35.220> little<00:01:35.549> seals<00:01:36.420> actually<00:01:36.960> do

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
case of these little seals actually do

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.170 
case of these little seals actually do
something<00:01:37.380> other<00:01:37.710> than<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:38.009> look<00:01:38.189> cool<00:01:38.369> so

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
something other than just look cool so

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.450 
something other than just look cool so
yeah<00:01:39.630> we'll<00:01:39.780> go<00:01:39.930> ahead<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.170> put<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.770> case<00:01:41.220> on

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
yeah we'll go ahead and put the case on

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.609 
yeah we'll go ahead and put the case on
the<00:01:41.729> phone<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:42.990> kind<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> put<00:01:43.530> it

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the phone so you can just kind of put it

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.590 
the phone so you can just kind of put it
in<00:01:43.799> one<00:01:43.950> corner<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.340> then<00:01:44.579> just<00:01:45.030> kind<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.390> work

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
in one corner and then just kind of work

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.380 
in one corner and then just kind of work
it<00:01:45.750> around<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.530> phone<00:01:46.770> until<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.030> all<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
it around the phone until it is all the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.319 
it around the phone until it is all the
way<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.079> little<00:01:49.560> difficult<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:50.040> put<00:01:50.189> on

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
way in is a little difficult to put on

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.910 
way in is a little difficult to put on
but<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.170> go<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.590> then

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
but you just go like that and then

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.460 
but you just go like that and then
you've<00:01:53.040> got<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.460> difficult<00:01:54.450> part<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.810> when<00:01:55.380> it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
you've got the difficult part is when it

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.770 
you've got the difficult part is when it
comes<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.009> hard<00:01:56.939> plastic<00:01:57.390> piece<00:01:57.540> I've

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
comes to this hard plastic piece I've

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.999 
comes to this hard plastic piece I've
not<00:01:57.990> actually<00:01:58.110> been<00:01:58.380> able<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.649> get<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.860> on

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
not actually been able to get it on

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.120 
not actually been able to get it on
completely<00:01:59.579> successfully<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.469> kind

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
completely successfully so I just kind

of put
on<00:02:02.740> this<00:02:03.340> side<00:02:03.730> first<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.620> this<00:02:05.620> is<00:02:05.860> where<00:02:06.040> it

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
on this side first and this is where it

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.330 
on this side first and this is where it
doesn't<00:02:06.370> really<00:02:06.550> work<00:02:06.790> it<00:02:07.410> it<00:02:08.410> just<00:02:08.470> there<00:02:09.130> go

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
doesn't really work it it just there go

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.910 
doesn't really work it it just there go
that<00:02:09.820> looks<00:02:10.030> good<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.509> then<00:02:10.660> we'll<00:02:10.750> just<00:02:10.920> kind

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
that looks good and then we'll just kind

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.200 
that looks good and then we'll just kind
of<00:02:11.980> slap<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.370> on<00:02:12.460> this<00:02:12.670> side<00:02:12.730> as<00:02:13.090> well<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:15.210> yeah

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
of slap it on this side as well and yeah

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.850 
of slap it on this side as well and yeah
this<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.420> where<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.960> doesn't<00:02:17.260> actually<00:02:17.440> go<00:02:17.830> on

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
this is where it doesn't actually go on

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.910 
this is where it doesn't actually go on
successfully<00:02:19.140> maybe<00:02:20.140> push<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.650> on<00:02:20.740> a<00:02:20.770> little

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
successfully maybe push it on a little

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.630 
successfully maybe push it on a little
more<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.960> actually<00:02:22.960> there<00:02:23.230> we<00:02:23.290> go<00:02:23.550> alright<00:02:24.550> so

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
more I actually there we go alright so

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.070 
more I actually there we go alright so
this<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:24.880> what<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.180> case<00:02:25.390> looks<00:02:25.660> like<00:02:25.840> on<00:02:25.960> the

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
this is what the case looks like on the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.270 
this is what the case looks like on the
phone<00:02:26.260> of<00:02:26.470> course<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.770> have<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:26.980> red<00:02:27.100> version

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
phone of course I have the red version

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.460 
phone of course I have the red version
so<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.640> see<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.030> red<00:02:28.690> here<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.200> would<00:02:29.350> not

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
so you see the red here you would not

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.890 
so you see the red here you would not
notice<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.710> as<00:02:29.920> much<00:02:30.100> if<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.370> had<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.900> darker

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
notice that as much if you had a darker

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.810 
notice that as much if you had a darker
color<00:02:32.170> but<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.860> personally<00:02:33.400> think<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.700> looks

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
color but I personally think it looks

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.910 
color but I personally think it looks
pretty<00:02:33.880> good<00:02:34.180> with<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.570> white<00:02:35.200> iphone<00:02:35.380> the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
pretty good with the white iphone the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.010 
pretty good with the white iphone the
red<00:02:36.400> case<00:02:36.640> Jack<00:02:37.209> just<00:02:37.510> looks<00:02:37.690> good<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:37.900> that

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
red case Jack just looks good on that

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.780 
red case Jack just looks good on that
and<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.130> is<00:02:39.280> what<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.520> would<00:02:39.550> look<00:02:39.670> like

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
and so this is what it would look like

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.760 
and so this is what it would look like
if<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.120> just<00:02:40.240> laying<00:02:40.420> on<00:02:40.600> a<00:02:40.630> table<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:41.410> kind<00:02:41.680> of

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
if it just laying on a table you kind of

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.650 
if it just laying on a table you kind of
get<00:02:41.890> an<00:02:41.950> idea<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.640> all<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.209> corners<00:02:43.540> are

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
get an idea of that all the corners are

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.140 
get an idea of that all the corners are
more<00:02:43.900> squared-off<00:02:44.590> than<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.580> actual<00:02:45.850> iphone

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
more squared-off than the actual iphone

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.630 
more squared-off than the actual iphone
6<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:47.170> this<00:02:47.290> will<00:02:47.530> help<00:02:47.560> protect<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.430> from

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
6 and this will help protect you from

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.010 
6 and this will help protect you from
drops<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:49.330> things<00:02:49.510> like<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.690> because

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
drops and things like that because

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.190 
drops and things like that because
there's<00:02:50.890> just<00:02:51.010> extra<00:02:51.630> material<00:02:52.630> on<00:02:52.840> each<00:02:53.050> of

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
there's just extra material on each of

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.690 
there's just extra material on each of
the<00:02:53.260> corners<00:02:53.590> so<00:02:53.800> hopefully<00:02:54.250> rather<00:02:54.490> than

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
the corners so hopefully rather than

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.060 
the corners so hopefully rather than
your<00:02:55.090> iphone<00:02:55.360> screen<00:02:55.690> breaking<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.680> case

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
your iphone screen breaking the case

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.040 
your iphone screen breaking the case
will<00:02:57.280> absorb<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.670> impact<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:58.420> personally

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
will absorb the impact I personally

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
will absorb the impact I personally
think<00:02:59.140> they<00:02:59.290> would<00:02:59.410> do<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.500> very<00:02:59.740> good<00:02:59.800> job<00:02:59.920> of

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
think they would do a very good job of

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.160 
think they would do a very good job of
that<00:03:00.280> just<00:03:00.580> because<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.180> material<00:03:01.720> feels

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
that just because the material feels

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.110 
that just because the material feels
very<00:03:02.500> quality<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.160> it's<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.520> pretty<00:03:03.730> thick

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
very quality and it's a pretty thick

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.790 
very quality and it's a pretty thick
piece<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.690> rubber<00:03:04.900> on<00:03:05.110> each<00:03:05.290> of<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.500> corners

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
piece of rubber on each of the corners

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.199 
piece of rubber on each of the corners
so<00:03:06.250> it's<00:03:06.370> kind<00:03:06.490> of<00:03:06.550> hard<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.730> make<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:06.910> case<00:03:07.180> that

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
so it's kind of hard to make a case that

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.240 
so it's kind of hard to make a case that
offers<00:03:08.050> good<00:03:08.230> protection<00:03:08.500> of<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.800> iphone<00:03:09.040> 6

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
offers good protection of the iphone 6

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.190 
offers good protection of the iphone 6
while<00:03:09.519> keeping<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.000> iphone<00:03:10.239> 6s<00:03:10.570> form<00:03:10.810> factor

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
while keeping the iphone 6s form factor

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.570 
while keeping the iphone 6s form factor
but<00:03:11.440> i<00:03:11.500> personally<00:03:11.739> think<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.100> this<00:03:12.340> case

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
but i personally think that this case

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.940 
but i personally think that this case
does<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.850> very<00:03:13.300> good<00:03:13.780> job<00:03:13.930> of<00:03:14.110> offering<00:03:14.530> great

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
does a very good job of offering great

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.770 
does a very good job of offering great
amount<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.220> protection<00:03:15.340> while<00:03:15.730> not<00:03:15.970> really

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
amount of protection while not really

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.630 
amount of protection while not really
detracting<00:03:17.320> from<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.620> look<00:03:17.800> of<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.070> iphone<00:03:18.370> 6

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
detracting from the look of the iphone 6

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.520 
detracting from the look of the iphone 6
because<00:03:19.300> of<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.600> color<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.140> design<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.470> the

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
because of the color and design of the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.840 
because of the color and design of the
case<00:03:20.650> i<00:03:20.680> actually<00:03:21.010> think<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.310> looks<00:03:21.730> pretty

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
case i actually think it looks pretty

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.759 
case i actually think it looks pretty
good<00:03:22.120> on<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.300> iphone<00:03:22.540> 6<00:03:22.750> so<00:03:23.290> this<00:03:23.410> case<00:03:23.590> will

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
good on the iphone 6 so this case will

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:24.990 
good on the iphone 6 so this case will
do<00:03:23.860> a<00:03:23.920> pretty<00:03:24.100> good<00:03:24.190> job<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.400> protecting<00:03:24.760> your

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
do a pretty good job of protecting your

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000 
do a pretty good job of protecting your
phone<00:03:25.150> from<00:03:25.300> jobs<00:03:25.630> but<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.260> does<00:03:26.470> not<00:03:26.650> have

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
phone from jobs but it does not have

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.340 
phone from jobs but it does not have
anything<00:03:27.430> covering<00:03:28.090> all<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.209> ports<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:29.230> if

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
anything covering all the ports so if

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.290 
anything covering all the ports so if
you<00:03:29.530> were<00:03:29.739> wanting<00:03:30.100> to<00:03:30.130> use<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.430> for<00:03:30.700> dusters

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
you were wanting to use this for dusters

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.580 
you were wanting to use this for dusters
water<00:03:31.720> resistance<00:03:32.140> or<00:03:32.230> anything<00:03:32.440> like<00:03:32.470> that

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
water resistance or anything like that

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.530 
water resistance or anything like that
this<00:03:33.250> case<00:03:33.489> would<00:03:33.730> not<00:03:33.940> do<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.120> for<00:03:34.420> you

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
this case would not do that for you

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.000 
this case would not do that for you
because<00:03:34.840> all<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.200> ports<00:03:35.440> are<00:03:35.530> open<00:03:35.650> I

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
because all the ports are open I

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.130 
because all the ports are open I
personally<00:03:36.880> enjoyed<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.269> Sun<00:03:37.450> cases<00:03:37.810> because

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
personally enjoyed the Sun cases because

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.540 
personally enjoyed the Sun cases because
you<00:03:38.380> don't<00:03:38.530> have<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.769> fiddle<00:03:38.980> around<00:03:39.160> with<00:03:39.400> a

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
you don't have to fiddle around with a

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.800 
you don't have to fiddle around with a
rubber<00:03:39.760> flap<00:03:40.120> whenever<00:03:40.420> you<00:03:40.510> would<00:03:40.600> like<00:03:40.660> to

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
rubber flap whenever you would like to

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.240 
rubber flap whenever you would like to
charge<00:03:41.050> your<00:03:41.140> phone<00:03:41.380> same<00:03:42.040> with<00:03:42.160> the

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
charge your phone same with the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.880 
charge your phone same with the
headphone<00:03:42.550> jack<00:03:42.580> unfortunately<00:03:43.420> the

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
headphone jack unfortunately the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.470 
headphone jack unfortunately the
headphone<00:03:44.890> jack<00:03:45.100> cutout<00:03:45.700> is<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:45.910> little<00:03:46.239> small

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
headphone jack cutout is a little small

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.759 
headphone jack cutout is a little small
so<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:46.780> might<00:03:47.080> have<00:03:47.200> some<00:03:47.380> problems<00:03:47.410> with

so you might have some problems with

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.440 
so you might have some problems with
certain<00:03:48.519> headphones<00:03:48.850> because<00:03:49.000> this<00:03:49.269> is<00:03:49.420> a

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
certain headphones because this is a

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.910 
certain headphones because this is a
pretty<00:03:49.780> thick<00:03:50.019> piece<00:03:50.230> of<00:03:50.350> reverence<00:03:50.650> if<00:03:50.799> the

pretty thick piece of reverence if the

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
like I was saying this case is very

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.390 
like I was saying this case is very
difficult<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.410> get<00:04:10.530> on<00:04:10.620> as<00:04:10.770> you<00:04:10.950> can<00:04:11.069> see<00:04:11.220> this

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
difficult to get on as you can see this

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.520 
difficult to get on as you can see this
little<00:04:11.520> plastic<00:04:12.300> piece<00:04:12.660> here<00:04:12.840> is<00:04:12.959> raised<00:04:13.350> up

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
little plastic piece here is raised up

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.500 
little plastic piece here is raised up
so<00:04:13.920> it's<00:04:14.069> not<00:04:14.160> actually<00:04:14.610> on<00:04:14.790> all<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.330> way<00:04:15.480> I

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
so it's not actually on all the way I

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.560 
so it's not actually on all the way I
was<00:04:16.320> trying<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.950> kind<00:04:17.310> of<00:04:17.370> put<00:04:17.609> this<00:04:17.760> plastic

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
was trying to kind of put this plastic

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.840 
was trying to kind of put this plastic
piece<00:04:18.600> down<00:04:18.840> but<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.109> just<00:04:19.440> can't<00:04:19.709> get<00:04:19.829> it<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:20.130> was

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
piece down but I just can't get it I was

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.949

having problems with getting this
plastic<00:04:22.440> piece<00:04:22.470> fit<00:04:23.040> around<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.370> sides<00:04:23.639> but<00:04:23.940> I

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
plastic piece fit around the sides but I

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.180 
plastic piece fit around the sides but I
got<00:04:24.330> this<00:04:24.510> now<00:04:25.230> so<00:04:25.530> it's<00:04:25.680> fine<00:04:25.860> around<00:04:26.070> the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
got this now so it's fine around the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.010 
got this now so it's fine around the
sides<00:04:26.400> but<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:26.790> back<00:04:26.970> piece<00:04:27.180> just<00:04:27.389> does<00:04:27.870> not

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
sides but the back piece just does not

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.570 
sides but the back piece just does not
fit<00:04:28.380> down<00:04:28.560> in<00:04:28.710> there<00:04:28.830> no<00:04:28.919> matter<00:04:29.040> hard<00:04:29.370> you

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
fit down in there no matter hard you

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.730 
fit down in there no matter hard you
push<00:04:29.730> on<00:04:29.910> it<00:04:30.090> or<00:04:30.240> whatever<00:04:30.360> just<00:04:30.720> will<00:04:31.440> not<00:04:31.560> go

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
push on it or whatever just will not go

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.500 
push on it or whatever just will not go
down<00:04:31.770> so<00:04:32.160> that<00:04:32.190> is<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.490> very<00:04:32.760> big<00:04:32.970> downside<00:04:33.360> to

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
down so that is a very big downside to

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.230 
down so that is a very big downside to
this<00:04:33.600> case<00:04:34.040> getting<00:04:35.040> it<00:04:35.340> on<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:35.970> phone

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
this case getting it on the phone

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.180 
this case getting it on the phone
actually<00:04:37.169> is<00:04:37.260> a<00:04:37.290> little<00:04:37.560> difficult<00:04:37.710> but<00:04:38.040> if

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
actually is a little difficult but if

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.220 
actually is a little difficult but if
you<00:04:38.280> do<00:04:38.430> manage<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.820> get<00:04:39.600> it<00:04:39.690> on<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:40.020> this<00:04:40.110> is

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
you do manage to get it on and this is

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.409 
you do manage to get it on and this is
probably<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.680> very<00:04:40.890> very<00:04:41.160> nice<00:04:41.310> case<00:04:41.640> but<00:04:42.060> this

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
probably a very very nice case but this

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.450 
probably a very very nice case but this
plastic<00:04:42.870> piece<00:04:42.900> just<00:04:43.230> seems<00:04:43.440> a<00:04:43.710> little<00:04:44.250> too

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
plastic piece just seems a little too

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.270 
plastic piece just seems a little too
difficult<00:04:44.880> to<00:04:45.180> fit<00:04:45.600> perfectly<00:04:46.080> in<00:04:46.350> with<00:04:47.040> the

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
difficult to fit perfectly in with the

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.250 
difficult to fit perfectly in with the
rubber<00:04:47.760> covering<00:04:48.180> however<00:04:48.810> if<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.050> ignore

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
rubber covering however if you ignore

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.140 
rubber covering however if you ignore
the<00:04:49.380> fact<00:04:49.560> that<00:04:49.650> this<00:04:49.890> doesn't<00:04:50.160> really<00:04:50.490> fit<00:04:50.880> on

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
the fact that this doesn't really fit on

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.909 
the fact that this doesn't really fit on
the<00:04:51.510> case<00:04:51.780> or<00:04:52.020> at<00:04:52.110> least<00:04:52.260> is<00:04:52.380> very<00:04:52.680> very

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
the case or at least is very very

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.010 
the case or at least is very very
difficult<00:04:53.130> to<00:04:53.400> do<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:53.640> then<00:04:54.390> I<00:04:54.540> think<00:04:54.870> this

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
difficult to do so then I think this

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.170 
difficult to do so then I think this
case<00:04:55.530> looks<00:04:55.890> very<00:04:56.100> very<00:04:56.160> nice<00:04:56.370> on<00:04:56.640> the<00:04:56.850> iphone

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
case looks very very nice on the iphone

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.510 
case looks very very nice on the iphone
6<00:04:57.419> we<00:04:57.630> do<00:04:57.750> have<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:57.900> little<00:04:58.110> cutout<00:04:58.830> for<00:04:59.130> apple

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
6 we do have a little cutout for apple

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.820 
6 we do have a little cutout for apple
logo<00:04:59.640> so<00:04:59.970> you<00:05:00.090> can<00:05:00.330> look<00:05:01.020> at<00:05:01.200> your<00:05:01.380> apple<00:05:01.710> logo

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
logo so you can look at your apple logo

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.530 
logo so you can look at your apple logo
which<00:05:02.130> everybody<00:05:02.400> is<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:02.700> proud<00:05:02.910> of<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:03.270> you

which everybody is so proud of and you

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.659 
which everybody is so proud of and you
have<00:05:03.780> a<00:05:04.050> good<00:05:04.650> cut<00:05:04.800> out<00:05:04.890> for<00:05:05.160> camera

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
have a good cut out for camera

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.700 
have a good cut out for camera
unfortunately<00:05:06.300> it's<00:05:06.450> a<00:05:06.570> little<00:05:06.600> tight<00:05:07.560> as

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
unfortunately it's a little tight as

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.530 
unfortunately it's a little tight as
well<00:05:07.919> so<00:05:08.100> you<00:05:08.190> might<00:05:08.850> have<00:05:09.060> some<00:05:09.240> problems

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
well so you might have some problems

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.480 
well so you might have some problems
clear<00:05:09.810> I<00:05:09.990> personally<00:05:10.410> didn't<00:05:10.680> but<00:05:10.889> my<00:05:11.130> think

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
clear I personally didn't but my think

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.430 
clear I personally didn't but my think
just<00:05:12.000> because<00:05:12.180> it's<00:05:12.540> kind<00:05:12.810> of<00:05:12.840> a<00:05:12.960> reflective

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
just because it's kind of a reflective

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.350 
just because it's kind of a reflective
material<00:05:13.919> and<00:05:14.160> it's<00:05:14.340> closer<00:05:14.700> on<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.030> camera

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
material and it's closer on the camera

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.540 
material and it's closer on the camera
lens<00:05:15.479> and<00:05:15.690> flash<00:05:15.840> that<00:05:16.590> they<00:05:16.950> might<00:05:17.220> have<00:05:17.370> some

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
lens and flash that they might have some

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.530 
lens and flash that they might have some
problems<00:05:17.580> glare<00:05:18.060> depending<00:05:18.419> on<00:05:18.479> the

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
problems glare depending on the

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.030 
problems glare depending on the
situation<00:05:18.720> but<00:05:19.200> like<00:05:19.320> I<00:05:19.350> said<00:05:19.530> I<00:05:19.650> haven't<00:05:19.860> had

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
situation but like I said I haven't had

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.440 
situation but like I said I haven't had
any<00:05:20.160> problems<00:05:20.460> with<00:05:20.490> that<00:05:20.580> one<00:05:21.150> thing<00:05:21.270> that<00:05:21.419> is

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
any problems with that one thing that is

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.120 
any problems with that one thing that is
nice<00:05:21.630> about<00:05:21.750> this<00:05:21.930> case<00:05:22.110> it<00:05:22.260> doesn't<00:05:22.560> have<00:05:22.740> any

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
nice about this case it doesn't have any

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.880 
nice about this case it doesn't have any
giant<00:05:23.610> really<00:05:24.090> flashy<00:05:24.360> logos<00:05:24.900> as<00:05:25.169> a<00:05:25.229> lot<00:05:25.740> of

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
giant really flashy logos as a lot of

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.460 
giant really flashy logos as a lot of
cases<00:05:26.160> do<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.789> only<00:05:27.150> logans<00:05:27.479> we<00:05:27.600> have<00:05:27.780> are<00:05:28.110> the

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
cases do the only logans we have are the

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.409 
cases do the only logans we have are the
zero<00:05:29.250> lemon<00:05:29.550> logo<00:05:29.820> here<00:05:30.000> which<00:05:30.240> is<00:05:30.330> just

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
zero lemon logo here which is just

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.000 
zero lemon logo here which is just
engraved<00:05:30.810> into<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.169> red<00:05:31.350> so<00:05:31.590> it<00:05:31.620> doesn't

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
engraved into the red so it doesn't

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.230 
engraved into the red so it doesn't
detract<00:05:32.400> from<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:32.700> look<00:05:32.910> of<00:05:32.970> the<00:05:33.090> case

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
detract from the look of the case

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.060 
detract from the look of the case
because<00:05:33.539> of<00:05:33.660> a<00:05:33.720> giant<00:05:33.900> zerolemon<00:05:34.320> logo<00:05:34.860> and

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
because of a giant zerolemon logo and

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.950 
because of a giant zerolemon logo and
the<00:05:35.100> only<00:05:35.370> other<00:05:35.490> branding<00:05:35.970> we<00:05:36.090> have<00:05:36.360> is<00:05:36.660> on

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
the only other branding we have is on

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.969 
the only other branding we have is on
the<00:05:37.050> side<00:05:37.169> of<00:05:37.229> the<00:05:37.350> case<00:05:37.500> here<00:05:37.680> where<00:05:37.740> it<00:05:37.919> says

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
the side of the case here where it says

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.190 
the side of the case here where it says
razor<00:05:38.370> armor<00:05:38.820> so<00:05:39.120> think<00:05:39.390> that<00:05:39.510> is<00:05:39.660> pretty<00:05:39.960> much

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
razor armor so think that is pretty much

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.590 
razor armor so think that is pretty much
it<00:05:40.260> for<00:05:40.500> this<00:05:40.800> case<00:05:41.250> it<00:05:41.550> does<00:05:41.760> do<00:05:41.970> a<00:05:42.000> very<00:05:42.360> good

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
it for this case it does do a very good

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.510 
it for this case it does do a very good
job<00:05:42.720> of<00:05:42.870> protecting<00:05:43.200> your<00:05:43.470> phone<00:05:43.680> and<00:05:43.979> it<00:05:44.370> also

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
job of protecting your phone and it also

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.340 
job of protecting your phone and it also
looks<00:05:44.850> very<00:05:45.090> nice<00:05:45.240> it<00:05:45.510> doesn't<00:05:45.810> add<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:45.960> lot<00:05:46.110> of

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
looks very nice it doesn't add a lot of

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.380 
looks very nice it doesn't add a lot of
weight<00:05:46.620> or<00:05:46.860> bulk<00:05:46.919> to<00:05:47.280> your<00:05:47.310> phone<00:05:47.580> even<00:05:48.330> though

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
weight or bulk to your phone even though

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.969 
weight or bulk to your phone even though
it<00:05:48.419> does<00:05:48.570> it<00:05:48.660> quite<00:05:48.810> a<00:05:48.870> bit<00:05:48.930> of<00:05:49.080> protection<00:05:49.200> the

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
it does it quite a bit of protection the

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.400 
it does it quite a bit of protection the
only<00:05:50.430> con<00:05:50.640> I<00:05:50.669> can<00:05:51.030> think<00:05:51.180> of<00:05:51.300> is<00:05:51.600> that<00:05:51.840> this

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
only con I can think of is that this

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.130 
only con I can think of is that this
really<00:05:52.710> does<00:05:53.160> not<00:05:53.370> fit<00:05:53.940> down<00:05:54.120> a<00:05:54.450> lot<00:05:54.810> of<00:05:54.900> people

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
really does not fit down a lot of people

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.930 
really does not fit down a lot of people
would<00:05:55.289> disagree<00:05:55.770> with<00:05:56.039> that<00:05:56.160> but<00:05:56.430> this<00:05:56.610> case

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
would disagree with that but this case

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.450 
would disagree with that but this case
that<00:05:57.210> i<00:05:57.240> have<00:05:57.360> just<00:05:57.990> really<00:05:58.950> does<00:05:59.220> not

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
that i have just really does not

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.490 
that i have just really does not
the<00:06:00.669> classic<00:06:01.539> piece<00:06:01.690> is<00:06:01.870> just<00:06:02.050> a<00:06:02.139> little<00:06:02.380> too

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
the classic piece is just a little too

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.140 
the classic piece is just a little too
large<00:06:02.770> or<00:06:03.009> something<00:06:03.280> for<00:06:03.460> the<00:06:03.550> case<00:06:03.759> I<00:06:04.000> mean

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
large or something for the case I mean

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.480 
large or something for the case I mean
it<00:06:04.750> looks<00:06:04.900> like<00:06:05.139> it's<00:06:05.319> fine<00:06:05.620> down<00:06:05.889> here<00:06:05.919> it's

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
it looks like it's fine down here it's

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.469 
it looks like it's fine down here it's
not<00:06:06.610> like<00:06:07.830> it's<00:06:08.830> not<00:06:08.919> like<00:06:09.039> it's<00:06:09.400> over<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.270> top

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
not like it's not like it's over the top

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.390 
not like it's not like it's over the top
here<00:06:10.750> it's<00:06:10.870> perfectly<00:06:11.590> smooth<00:06:11.860> here<00:06:12.220> and

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
here it's perfectly smooth here and

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.309 
here it's perfectly smooth here and
everywhere<00:06:13.330> else<00:06:13.389> it<00:06:13.690> is<00:06:13.810> perfectly<00:06:14.229> fine

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 
everywhere else it is perfectly fine

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:16.740 
everywhere else it is perfectly fine
just<00:06:15.250> this<00:06:15.400> plastic<00:06:15.789> piece<00:06:15.819> here<00:06:16.210> just<00:06:16.479> does

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
just this plastic piece here just does

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.809 
just this plastic piece here just does
not<00:06:16.930> sit<00:06:17.380> down<00:06:17.560> for<00:06:17.949> some<00:06:18.130> reason<00:06:18.160> so<00:06:18.639> I

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
not sit down for some reason so I

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.820 
not sit down for some reason so I
personally<00:06:19.780> think<00:06:19.930> that<00:06:20.020> is<00:06:20.199> a<00:06:20.229> very<00:06:20.560> big

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
personally think that is a very big

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.620 
personally think that is a very big
downside<00:06:21.280> if<00:06:21.400> you<00:06:21.520> can't<00:06:21.789> get<00:06:21.940> the<00:06:22.090> case<00:06:22.330> if<00:06:22.509> it

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
downside if you can't get the case if it

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.900 
downside if you can't get the case if it
on<00:06:22.750> your<00:06:22.870> phone<00:06:23.139> then<00:06:23.590> the<00:06:24.130> case<00:06:24.520> is<00:06:24.580> pretty

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
on your phone then the case is pretty

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.909 
on your phone then the case is pretty
much<00:06:25.150> unusable<00:06:25.330> but<00:06:26.020> assume<00:06:26.349> this<00:06:26.530> is<00:06:26.590> just

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
much unusable but assume this is just

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.730 
much unusable but assume this is just
the<00:06:27.190> case<00:06:27.400> I<00:06:27.639> got<00:06:27.880> if<00:06:28.150> I<00:06:28.360> really<00:06:29.199> really<00:06:29.500> worked

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
the case I got if I really really worked

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.010 
the case I got if I really really worked
at<00:06:29.889> it<00:06:30.099> or<00:06:30.280> put<00:06:30.729> it<00:06:30.759> on<00:06:30.940> like<00:06:31.210> 150<00:06:31.930> different

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
at it or put it on like 150 different

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.810 
at it or put it on like 150 different
times<00:06:32.349> I<00:06:32.500> might<00:06:32.710> be<00:06:32.830> able<00:06:32.949> to<00:06:33.160> fitness<00:06:33.400> plastic

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
times I might be able to fitness plastic

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.760 
times I might be able to fitness plastic
piece<00:06:33.970> down<00:06:34.120> here<00:06:34.419> but<00:06:34.840> after<00:06:34.960> removing<00:06:35.590> and

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
piece down here but after removing and

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.200 
piece down here but after removing and
putting<00:06:36.039> this<00:06:36.130> case<00:06:36.310> back<00:06:36.520> on<00:06:36.699> my<00:06:36.820> iPhone

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
putting this case back on my iPhone

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.779 
putting this case back on my iPhone
several<00:06:37.599> times<00:06:37.810> I<00:06:38.050> have<00:06:38.169> had<00:06:38.349> this<00:06:38.470> problem

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
several times I have had this problem

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.420 
several times I have had this problem
every<00:06:39.789> single<00:06:40.000> time<00:06:40.150> one<00:06:41.080> time<00:06:41.229> I<00:06:41.430> couldn't

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
every single time one time I couldn't

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.800 
every single time one time I couldn't
get<00:06:42.580> this<00:06:42.729> piece<00:06:42.940> to<00:06:43.090> fit<00:06:43.240> down<00:06:43.330> here<00:06:43.570> it<00:06:43.660> would

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
get this piece to fit down here it would

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.170 
get this piece to fit down here it would
like<00:06:44.110> this<00:06:44.830> black<00:06:45.400> rubber<00:06:45.699> piece<00:06:45.910> was<00:06:46.090> like

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
like this black rubber piece was like

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.700 
like this black rubber piece was like
pushed<00:06:46.449> in<00:06:46.630> and<00:06:46.870> this<00:06:47.050> piece<00:06:47.320> wouldn't<00:06:47.650> go

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
pushed in and this piece wouldn't go

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.560 
pushed in and this piece wouldn't go
over<00:06:47.740> it<00:06:48.009> but<00:06:48.220> I<00:06:48.250> fixed<00:06:48.639> that<00:06:48.699> on<00:06:49.300> my<00:06:49.419> most

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
over it but I fixed that on my most

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.080 
over it but I fixed that on my most
recent<00:06:49.780> time<00:06:50.110> putting<00:06:50.380> it<00:06:50.470> on<00:06:50.590> and<00:06:50.800> I<00:06:51.669> still

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
recent time putting it on and I still

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.629 
recent time putting it on and I still
have<00:06:52.389> this<00:06:52.539> problem<00:06:52.840> here<00:06:53.259> with<00:06:53.590> the<00:06:53.860> red

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 
have this problem here with the red

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.820 
have this problem here with the red
piece<00:06:54.849> being<00:06:55.120> raised<00:06:55.360> up<00:06:55.570> so<00:06:55.930> that<00:06:56.560> is<00:06:56.710> the

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
piece being raised up so that is the

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.559 
piece being raised up so that is the
only<00:06:56.919> con<00:06:57.130> I<00:06:57.159> can<00:06:57.370> think<00:06:57.520> of<00:06:57.669> I<00:06:57.940> mean<00:06:58.360> it's<00:06:58.509> a

00:06:58.559 --> 00:06:58.569 
only con I can think of I mean it's a

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:00.779 
only con I can think of I mean it's a
pretty<00:06:58.750> big<00:06:58.930> one<00:06:59.169> but<00:06:59.530> if<00:06:59.919> you<00:07:00.340> can<00:07:00.520> get<00:07:00.639> around

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:00.789 
pretty big one but if you can get around

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:02.850 
pretty big one but if you can get around
that<00:07:00.970> and<00:07:01.210> find<00:07:01.659> a<00:07:01.780> way<00:07:01.900> that<00:07:02.289> makes<00:07:02.740> the

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860 
that and find a way that makes the

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.920 
that and find a way that makes the
plastic<00:07:03.159> piece<00:07:03.310> fit<00:07:03.520> better<00:07:03.729> on<00:07:04.030> the<00:07:04.509> phone

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
plastic piece fit better on the phone

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.960 
plastic piece fit better on the phone
and<00:07:05.560> I<00:07:05.680> personally<00:07:06.190> think<00:07:06.370> this<00:07:06.550> is<00:07:06.699> a<00:07:06.729> very

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:06.970 
and I personally think this is a very

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.510 
and I personally think this is a very
very<00:07:07.090> nice<00:07:07.479> case<00:07:07.810> it<00:07:08.139> will<00:07:08.620> add<00:07:08.979> a<00:07:09.009> bunch<00:07:09.400> of

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 
very nice case it will add a bunch of

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.520 
very nice case it will add a bunch of
protection<00:07:09.880> to<00:07:09.909> your<00:07:09.970> phone<00:07:10.180> and<00:07:10.360> it<00:07:11.229> does<00:07:11.380> not

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:11.530 
protection to your phone and it does not

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.950 
protection to your phone and it does not
take<00:07:11.740> away<00:07:11.770> from<00:07:11.979> the<00:07:12.610> look<00:07:13.030> of<00:07:13.180> the<00:07:13.360> iphone<00:07:13.690> 6

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 
take away from the look of the iphone 6

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.290 
take away from the look of the iphone 6
a<00:07:14.289> lot<00:07:14.500> of<00:07:14.650> rugged<00:07:15.250> cases<00:07:15.699> the<00:07:15.849> ad<00:07:15.969> adventure

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.300 
a lot of rugged cases the ad adventure

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.490 
a lot of rugged cases the ad adventure
production<00:07:16.659> take<00:07:16.840> away<00:07:17.020> from<00:07:17.169> the<00:07:17.289> look<00:07:17.440> of

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
production take away from the look of

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.170 
production take away from the look of
the<00:07:17.620> iphone<00:07:17.860> 6<00:07:18.039> which<00:07:18.250> i<00:07:18.400> personally<00:07:18.460> think<00:07:18.969> is

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
the iphone 6 which i personally think is

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.360 
the iphone 6 which i personally think is
not<00:07:19.360> good<00:07:19.570> because<00:07:19.780> the<00:07:20.080> iphone<00:07:20.320> 6<00:07:20.560> is<00:07:20.680> very

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.370 
not good because the iphone 6 is very

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.129 
not good because the iphone 6 is very
very<00:07:21.610> thin<00:07:21.880> and<00:07:22.240> light<00:07:22.599> and<00:07:22.780> it<00:07:22.900> looks<00:07:23.050> really

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:23.139 
very thin and light and it looks really
