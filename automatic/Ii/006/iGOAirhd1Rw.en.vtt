centeno direct that blew my mind was

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.930 
centeno direct that blew my mind was
when<00:01:19.990> they<00:01:20.140> announced<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.830> new<00:01:21.159> model<00:01:21.580> of<00:01:21.760> the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
when they announced a new model of the

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:29.370 
when they announced a new model of the
3ds<00:01:22.409> called<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:24.400> new<00:01:24.640> 3ds<00:01:27.930> I'm<00:01:28.930> not<00:01:29.140> even

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
3ds called the new 3ds I'm not even

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.140 
3ds called the new 3ds I'm not even
making<00:01:29.530> that<00:01:29.680> up<00:01:29.950> I'm<00:01:30.130> so<00:01:30.340> serious<00:01:30.610> right<00:01:30.880> now

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
making that up I'm so serious right now

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.570 
making that up I'm so serious right now
and<00:01:31.540> I<00:01:31.720> guess<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.440> means<00:01:32.799> that<00:01:33.250> they're<00:01:33.430> not

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
and I guess that means that they're not

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.020 
and I guess that means that they're not
planning<00:01:34.090> on<00:01:34.479> making<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.830> newer<00:01:36.159> 3d<00:01:36.640> ass<00:01:36.760> in<00:01:36.939> the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
planning on making a newer 3d ass in the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.679 
planning on making a newer 3d ass in the
future<00:01:37.420> because<00:01:37.689> newer<00:01:38.500> 3ds<00:01:39.159> just<00:01:40.090> doesn't

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
future because newer 3ds just doesn't

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.320 
future because newer 3ds just doesn't
sound<00:01:40.869> as<00:01:41.140> good<00:01:41.229> so<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.010> new<00:01:42.189> 3ds<00:01:42.549> comes<00:01:43.060> with
