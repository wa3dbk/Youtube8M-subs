00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.140
 he is carrying led like you 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.980
 You can see I'm loading it via 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.079

 I can not do anything with your there. 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.270
 because every time I have to go in 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.210
 on the wifi network he asks to update 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.660

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.730

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.980
 I'll try to upload and try to update 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.580
 only 40% of the battery 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.860
 I have not tried via wifi because it steps it 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:07.700

 fully charge the battery . 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.800
 use future backup 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.539
 state and the above information 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.910
 it speaks thus to allow the recording of the 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:05:02.229
 your ip settings continue 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:02.229

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.560
 previous 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:45.430
 after the new software update 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.680
 due to security reasons then 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:58.159
 it is probably irreversible personal 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:06:03.530
 let's take a following here will do there 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:06.310

 You saw it's just personal. 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:25.169

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:27.900
 battery before making or upgrading ok 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:30.740
