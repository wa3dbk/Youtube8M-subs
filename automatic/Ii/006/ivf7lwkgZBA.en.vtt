00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Much has changed ... 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 I have not been too long ... 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.500
 They destroyed us with bombs. 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.100
 and no one knows how. 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.500
 The world was forced to obey. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.000
 They took our freedom. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Demolished that was created for centuries. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 They put fear in their power. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.500
 Worked millions. 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.000
 Our brothers ... 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 the rebels ... 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 resistance... 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.500
 Crushed his boot. 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.000
 They steal our future. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Get into our minds. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 They think the war is over. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.600
 And they are in vain.
