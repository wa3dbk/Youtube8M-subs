00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
haven't been able to go on with it to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.849 
haven't been able to go on with it to
the<00:00:24.000> next<00:00:24.180> level<00:00:24.300> why<00:00:24.750> do<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:25.019> think<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.740> you

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
the next level why do you think that you

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.870 
the next level why do you think that you
can<00:00:26.119> I<00:00:27.119> guess<00:00:27.750> my<00:00:28.439> game<00:00:28.680> being<00:00:29.160> lefty<00:00:29.670> and

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
can I guess my game being lefty and

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.030 
can I guess my game being lefty and
being<00:00:30.480> fast<00:00:30.779> around<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.109> court<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> big

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
being fast around the court is a big

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.190 
being fast around the court is a big
advantage<00:00:32.340> I've<00:00:33.149> got<00:00:33.450> an<00:00:33.540> all<00:00:33.660> court<00:00:33.960> game<00:00:34.170> I

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
advantage I've got an all court game I

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.810 
advantage I've got an all court game I
mean<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.100> come<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.399> net<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:35.610> well

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
mean I like to come to the net as well

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.750 
mean I like to come to the net as well
which<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.540> pretty<00:00:37.050> pretty<00:00:37.590> good<00:00:38.309> thing<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.640> do

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
which is pretty pretty good thing to do

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.209 
which is pretty pretty good thing to do
I<00:00:38.790> guess<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.239> well<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.660> juniors<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.350> think

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
I guess as well in the juniors I think

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.979 
I guess as well in the juniors I think
some<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.850> his<00:00:42.030> best<00:00:42.180> qualities<00:00:42.300> obviously<00:00:42.870> he

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
some of his best qualities obviously he

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.410 
some of his best qualities obviously he
mentioned<00:00:43.320> himself<00:00:43.620> he's<00:00:43.739> left-handed<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:45.000> it

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
mentioned himself he's left-handed so it

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.670 
mentioned himself he's left-handed so it
throws<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.809> little<00:00:46.110> bit<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> different

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
throws a little bit of a different

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.819 
throws a little bit of a different
dynamic<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.820> his<00:00:47.940> opponents<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.559> way<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
dynamic to his opponents the the way the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.869 
dynamic to his opponents the the way the
ball<00:00:49.980> comes<00:00:50.190> off<00:00:50.280> his<00:00:50.430> record<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
ball comes off his record on the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:51.860 
ball comes off his record on the
forehand<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.329> background<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.809> very

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
forehand in the background is very

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.170 
forehand in the background is very
different<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.489> also<00:00:53.789> throws<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.120> little

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
different so it's also throws a little

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.639 
different so it's also throws a little
bit<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.480> different<00:00:54.719> look<00:00:54.870> at<00:00:55.050> his<00:00:55.140> opponents

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
bit of a different look at his opponents

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.310 
bit of a different look at his opponents
and<00:00:56.059> he<00:00:57.059> feels<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.539> ball<00:00:57.690> very<00:00:57.899> well<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.289> he

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
and he feels the ball very well so he

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.779 
and he feels the ball very well so he
can<00:00:58.559> create<00:00:58.859> different<00:00:58.980> shots<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.520> different

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
can create different shots and different

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.610 
can create different shots and different
angles<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.359> has<00:01:00.510> different<00:01:00.809> options<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.289> a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
angles and has different options that a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.700 
angles and has different options that a
lot<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.070> his<00:01:02.160> opponents<00:01:02.579> don't<00:01:02.699> always<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:03.710> he

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
lot of his opponents don't always see he

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.350 
lot of his opponents don't always see he
has<00:01:04.860> very<00:01:05.010> fast<00:01:05.250> legs<00:01:05.610> when<00:01:05.880> he<00:01:05.970> when<00:01:06.270> he

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
has very fast legs when he when he

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.870 
has very fast legs when he when he
really<00:01:06.659> applies<00:01:06.930> himself<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.610> he's<00:01:08.729> been

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
really applies himself so and he's been

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.190 
really applies himself so and he's been
doing<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.210> little<00:01:09.360> bit<00:01:09.450> better<00:01:09.540> lately<00:01:09.780> so

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
doing that a little bit better lately so

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.890 
doing that a little bit better lately so
there's<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> lot<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.430> positives<00:01:11.820> there<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.360> think

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
there's a lot of positives there I think

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.410 
there's a lot of positives there I think
he<00:01:12.990> also<00:01:13.140> has<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> has<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> great<00:01:14.670> ability<00:01:14.880> to

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
he also has a has a great ability to

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.359 
he also has a has a great ability to
read<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.689> game<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.290> understand<00:01:17.159> what's

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550 
make adjustments and and that's one of
the<00:01:20.820> hardest<00:01:21.090> things<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.420> teach<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:22.049> there<00:01:22.409> is

the hardest things to teach is there is

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.929

the<00:01:22.710> feeling<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> flow<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.580> what's

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
the feeling and the flow of what's

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.359 
the feeling and the flow of what's
what's<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.500> he's<00:01:25.770> very<00:01:26.130> good
