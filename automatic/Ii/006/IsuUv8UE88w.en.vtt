00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.380
 Today I'm going to show you how this is done 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:22.310
 sample of this woven lace can you 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.570
 make in yarn in silk including 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.910
 It was a thin tape looks very nice 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.640
 It is suitable for all kinds of garments. 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:36.410
 the great advantage that comes out of the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:40.910
 right and on the reverse I made 22 points 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.379
 which are 18 of the lace 2 of the beginning and 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.480
 2 of the end 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.680
 these 2 from the beginning and the two from 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.590
 final along all the fabric go 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.840
 tissues in a right point either by 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.670
 the right either be on the reverse in 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.520
 this case we do not have the reverse of the tissue 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.920
 because the stitch comes out exactly the same 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.370
 on all sides and it's always done 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.549
 same 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.980
 after having assembled the 22 points 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.430
 I made a line 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.590
 all right from the beginning to the end and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.890
 to the next start the stitch of the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.310
 next way 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.490
 a right point a right point two 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.650
 sometimes two rights are the points 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.330
 let's say the edge that we put on 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:32.390
 lace then we make a loop 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.800
 we passed a point and we make two points 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.800
 together rights 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.079
 we started a loop again 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.450
 I pass a point two points together in point 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:50.320
 right that's the whole stitch starts 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.720
 again a peace loop a point without 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.810
 weave I put the needle in the middle of the 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.710
 point the steps without knitting to the needle of 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.460
 the right hand 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.229
 then I make two points together in 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.039
 right point 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:10.590
 again a loop passed a point without 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:16.030
 have two points together in right point 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:19.540
 And there ends a loop again step 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.780
 to a point without knitting I make two points 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.650
 together at the right point and I have them and 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:31.500
 the steps finished again 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:33.590
 or a lacing step 1.2 points together in 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.950
 a right point 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.310
 and there ends what is the part of the 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.000
 lace next I have the edge 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:48.230
 final that is in two points at one point 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.890
 right that's the whole stitch 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.780
 the next race and all the others 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.900
 they are made exactly the same 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.580
 register on the channel tell me how 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.970
 they went with the stitch that they 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.970
 applied woven lace on two needles
