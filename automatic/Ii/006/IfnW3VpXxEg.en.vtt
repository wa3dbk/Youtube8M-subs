the video without the user intervention

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.119 
the video without the user intervention
that's<00:04:49.689> something<00:04:50.169> that<00:04:50.349> we<00:04:50.439> usually<00:04:50.710> keep

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.129 
that's something that we usually keep

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.830 
that's something that we usually keep
off<00:04:51.490> for<00:04:52.449> best<00:04:52.659> practices<00:04:54.419> looping<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:55.569> video

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
off for best practices looping the video

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.379 
off for best practices looping the video
means<00:04:56.169> when<00:04:56.469> the<00:04:56.620> video<00:04:56.919> ends<00:04:57.219> it<00:04:58.120> will<00:04:58.270> go

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
means when the video ends it will go

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.420 
means when the video ends it will go
back<00:04:58.599> to<00:04:58.719> the<00:04:58.810> beginning<00:04:58.960> and<00:04:59.440> start<00:04:59.860> playing

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
back to the beginning and start playing

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.670 
back to the beginning and start playing
again

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
again

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.189 
again
now<00:05:02.680> it's<00:05:03.099> also<00:05:03.340> something<00:05:03.759> that<00:05:03.969> usually<00:05:04.810> we

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
now it's also something that usually we

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:11.490 
now it's also something that usually we
want<00:05:05.440> to<00:05:05.620> keep<00:05:05.800> off<00:05:07.680> click<00:05:08.680> ok<00:05:09.009> and<00:05:10.050> there<00:05:11.050> we

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
want to keep off click ok and there we

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.369 
want to keep off click ok and there we
have<00:05:11.680> our<00:05:11.889> video<00:05:12.280> block<00:05:12.750> put<00:05:13.750> it<00:05:13.870> wherever<00:05:14.080> we

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:14.379 
have our video block put it wherever we

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:20.369
