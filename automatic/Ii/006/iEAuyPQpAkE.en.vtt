00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.180 
first off i'm in a hunchback for SP
which<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:33.079> one<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> hunchbacks<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:35.100> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
which is one of the hunchbacks it's a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.880 
which is one of the hunchbacks it's a
medium<00:00:35.520> mech<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.690> has<00:00:36.960> both<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.410> its<00:00:37.530> shoulders

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
medium mech it has both of its shoulders

are<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.100> equal<00:00:38.250> size<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.879> gives<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.210> little

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
are of equal size so that gives a little

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.119 
are of equal size so that gives a little
bit<00:00:39.570> longer<00:00:39.899> duration<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.710> most<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.070> those

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
bit longer duration in most of those

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.479 
bit longer duration in most of those
close<00:00:41.399> range<00:00:41.640> fights<00:00:42.890> one<00:00:43.890> thing<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.129> note<00:00:44.460> is

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
close range fights one thing to note is

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.279 
close range fights one thing to note is
that<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.539> i<00:00:45.690> did<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.960> beginning<00:00:46.020> of

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
that just like i did in the beginning of

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.600 
that just like i did in the beginning of
this<00:00:46.410> match<00:00:46.649> out<00:00:46.860> here<00:00:47.070> if<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.370> have

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
this match out here if you have

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.729 
this match out here if you have
long-range<00:00:48.059> missiles<00:00:48.719> always<00:00:49.260> be<00:00:49.440> sure<00:00:49.620> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
long-range missiles always be sure to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.869 
long-range missiles always be sure to
tell<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.010> teammates<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.640> have

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
tell your teammates that you have

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.790 
tell your teammates that you have
long-range<00:00:51.180> missiles<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.559> kind<00:00:52.710> of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
long-range missiles so it's just kind of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.779 
long-range missiles so it's just kind of
sitting<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> back<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.520> their<00:00:53.610> head<00:00:53.760> so

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
sitting in the back of their head so

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.049 
sitting in the back of their head so
they<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.539> waiting<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.770> them<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
they can have that waiting for them to

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.610 
they can have that waiting for them to
go<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.210> make<00:00:57.360> sure<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.660> they<00:00:57.750> press<00:00:58.020> R<00:00:58.199> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
go and make sure that they press R and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.270 
go and make sure that they press R and
lock<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.520> do<00:01:00.270> small<00:01:00.600> things<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.320> if

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
lock on and do small things like that if

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.100 
lock on and do small things like that if
you<00:01:02.550> guys<00:01:02.699> are<00:01:02.910> interested<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:03.989> ahead

you guys are interested I can go ahead
and<00:01:04.260> do<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> tutorial<00:01:04.860> series<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:06.210> over<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
and do a tutorial series going over the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.780 
and do a tutorial series going over the
HUD<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:06.869> all<00:01:07.350> these<00:01:07.619> various<00:01:08.010> other<00:01:08.340> small

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
HUD and all these various other small

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.140 
HUD and all these various other small
things<00:01:09.740> but<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.150> relatively

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
things but it's relatively

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.910 
things but it's relatively
self-explanatory<00:01:12.900> once<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.619> get<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
self-explanatory once you get the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.550 
self-explanatory once you get the
control<00:01:14.610> scheme<00:01:14.760> down<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.049> nice<00:01:16.200> slow

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
control scheme down it's a nice slow

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.090 
control scheme down it's a nice slow
pace<00:01:17.119> which<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.330> enjoy<00:01:18.689> not<00:01:18.990> quite<00:01:19.229> as<00:01:19.500> quick<00:01:19.890> as

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
pace which I enjoy not quite as quick as

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.620 
pace which I enjoy not quite as quick as
like<00:01:20.340> cod<00:01:20.970> or<00:01:21.500> modern<00:01:22.500> warfare<00:01:23.450> but<00:01:24.450> what

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630

range<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.840> looks<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:43.680> going<00:01:43.770> to

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
range that looks like it's not going to

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
range that looks like it's not going to
be<00:01:43.979> losing<00:01:44.340> vision<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.909> thought<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
be losing vision I thought that the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.120 
be losing vision I thought that the
Centurion<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.740> vision<00:01:46.979> for

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
Centurion was going to be in vision for

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.280 
Centurion was going to be in vision for
a<00:01:47.159> while<00:01:47.369> ends<00:01:48.329> up<00:01:48.420> he<00:01:48.509> comes<00:01:48.720> back<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> think

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
a while ends up he comes back so I think

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.230 
a while ends up he comes back so I think
I<00:01:49.740> guide<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> missus<00:01:50.399> back<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.790> there<00:01:50.970> but<00:01:51.119> it

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
I guide the missus back in there but it

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.160 
I guide the missus back in there but it
takes<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.509> while<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.750> get<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> information

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
takes a while to get the information

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.999 
takes a while to get the information
looks<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.220> got<00:01:53.340> hit<00:01:53.549> with<00:01:53.700> something<00:01:53.939> at

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
looks like you got hit with something at

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.069 
looks like you got hit with something at
this<00:01:56.009> point<00:01:56.250> someone<00:01:56.729> has<00:01:56.759> found<00:01:57.210> or<00:01:57.570> spotted

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
this point someone has found or spotted

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.300 
this point someone has found or spotted
wherever<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.439> missiles<00:01:58.770> are<00:01:58.860> coming<00:01:59.040> out<00:01:59.280> of

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
wherever the missiles are coming out of

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.639 
wherever the missiles are coming out of
the<00:01:59.490> trees<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.119> has<00:02:00.270> shot<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> shot<00:02:01.320> there<00:02:01.500> that

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
some missile fire doesn't look like it's

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.770 
some missile fire doesn't look like it's
being<00:02:05.700> too<00:02:05.909> effect

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
Centurions and 800 range looks like

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.430 
Centurions and 800 range looks like
there's<00:02:21.700> an<00:02:21.819> ally<00:02:22.150> that's<00:02:22.390> close<00:02:22.750> by<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.050> him

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
bottom left is starting to change

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.110 
bottom left is starting to change
showing<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.709> it's<00:02:35.860> damaged<00:02:36.280> but<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.849> doesn't

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
showing that it's damaged but it doesn't

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.150 
showing that it's damaged but it doesn't
seem<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.360> be<00:02:37.480> very<00:02:37.510> large<00:02:37.989> caliber<00:02:38.830> weapon

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160

seem to be very large caliber weapon
that's<00:02:39.310> hitting<00:02:39.550> me<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.810> go<00:02:41.080> ahead<00:02:41.200> and

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
that's hitting me so I go ahead and

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.199 
that's hitting me so I go ahead and
decide<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.709> continue<00:02:41.940> offloading<00:02:42.940> maiello

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
decide to continue offloading maiello

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.820 
decide to continue offloading maiello
rims<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.700> will<00:02:46.060> be<00:02:46.600> doing<00:02:47.049> that<00:02:47.350> until<00:02:47.590> I

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
rims so I will be doing that until I

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.440 
rims so I will be doing that until I
pretty<00:02:48.130> much<00:02:48.220> reaches<00:02:48.700> zero<00:02:48.910> here<00:02:49.209> it<00:02:49.299> looks

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
pretty much reaches zero here it looks

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.180 
pretty much reaches zero here it looks
like<00:02:49.510> he's<00:02:49.780> about<00:02:50.110> dead<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.590> he's<00:02:50.680> also<00:02:50.890> out

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
like he's about dead and he's also out

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.710 
like he's about dead and he's also out
of<00:02:51.220> range<00:02:51.580> or<00:02:51.880> close<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.299> being<00:02:52.480> out<00:02:52.569> of<00:02:52.600> range

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
of range or close to being out of range

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.150 
of range or close to being out of range
so<00:02:53.080> I'm<00:02:53.170> just<00:02:53.290> going<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.470> let<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.739> teammates

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
so I'm just going to let the teammates

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.340 
so I'm just going to let the teammates
finish<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.610> kill<00:02:54.819> on<00:02:54.850> him<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:55.900> get<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.140> same

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
finish the kill on him you get the same

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.120 
finish the kill on him you get the same
amount<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:57.660> credits<00:02:58.660> whether<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.739> get<00:02:59.950> the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
amount of credits whether you get the

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.620 
amount of credits whether you get the
kill<00:03:00.340> or<00:03:00.519> you<00:03:00.610> get<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.880> assist<00:03:01.269> so<00:03:01.540> I've

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
kill or you get the assist so I've

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.850 
kill or you get the assist so I've
already<00:03:01.780> done<00:03:02.019> everything<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.650> needed

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
way that matchmaking is currently this

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.840 
way that matchmaking is currently this
is<00:05:21.500> all<00:05:21.650> going<00:05:21.830> to<00:05:21.889> change<00:05:21.950> of<00:05:22.310> course<00:05:22.340> but<00:05:22.760> the

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
is all going to change of course but the

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.000

way<00:05:22.940> it<00:05:23.030> is<00:05:23.090> currently<00:05:23.510> is<00:05:23.810> that<00:05:24.440> it<00:05:24.530> if<00:05:24.710> you

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
way it is currently is that it if you

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.860 
way it is currently is that it if you
have<00:05:25.220> a<00:05:25.250> medium<00:05:25.610> mech<00:05:25.820> then<00:05:26.270> your<00:05:26.389> team<00:05:26.600> gets<00:05:26.810> a

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.420 
have a medium mech then your team gets a
medium<00:05:27.169> mech<00:05:27.350> if<00:05:27.590> you<00:05:27.710> have<00:05:27.889> a<00:05:27.919> heavy<00:05:28.190> mech

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
medium mech if you have a heavy mech

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.770 
medium mech if you have a heavy mech
then<00:05:28.639> you're<00:05:28.760> the<00:05:28.970> other<00:05:29.120> team<00:05:29.360> gets<00:05:29.510> a<00:05:29.630> heavy

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
then you're the other team gets a heavy
