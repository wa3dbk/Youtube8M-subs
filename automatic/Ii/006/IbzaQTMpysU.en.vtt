if<00:02:42.880> we<00:02:42.910> were<00:02:43.180> playing<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:43.810> Boyd<00:02:44.230> bandstand

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
if we were playing it and Boyd bandstand

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.830 
if we were playing it and Boyd bandstand
you<00:02:45.160> know<00:02:45.250> people<00:02:45.519> started<00:02:45.970> missing<00:02:46.569> out<00:02:46.810> a

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
you know people started missing out a

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.840 
you know people started missing out a
little<00:02:47.080> bit<00:02:47.319> you<00:02:47.890> practiced<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.519> little<00:02:48.640> bit

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
little bit you practiced a little bit

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.400 
little bit you practiced a little bit
you<00:02:49.000> think<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.780> could<00:02:49.900> probably<00:02:50.049> do

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
you think you could probably do

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.559 
you think you could probably do
something<00:02:50.680> there<00:02:50.950> but<00:02:51.610> definitely<00:02:52.269> just<00:02:52.450> some

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
something there but definitely just some

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.479 
something there but definitely just some
ideas<00:02:52.600> about<00:02:52.989> like<00:02:53.440> reading<00:02:53.980> boy<00:02:54.220> look

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
ideas about like reading boy look

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.250 
ideas about like reading boy look
through<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.730> better<00:02:55.000> boy<00:02:55.330> I<00:02:55.569> chose<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:56.049> song

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
through the better boy I chose that song

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.140 
through the better boy I chose that song
specifically<00:02:56.830> because<00:02:57.580> that<00:02:57.819> was<00:02:57.940> one<00:02:58.120> thing

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
specifically because that was one thing

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.289 
specifically because that was one thing
I<00:02:58.390> learned<00:02:58.630> from<00:02:58.750> tab<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.470> I<00:03:00.130> could<00:03:00.340> man<00:03:01.150> it

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
I learned from tab and I could man it

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.809 
I learned from tab and I could man it
was<00:03:01.420> years<00:03:01.690> before<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.560> offer<00:03:02.799> that<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.670> they

was years before you offer that and they

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.000 
was years before you offer that and they
used<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.060> sit<00:03:04.239> there<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.600> then<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:05.110> just<00:03:05.739> can't

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
easy for me to take those ideation and

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.720 
easy for me to take those ideation and
you<00:04:02.170> know<00:04:02.290> form<00:04:02.620> down<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.100> maybe<00:04:03.280> two<00:04:03.519> three

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
you know form down to maybe two three

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.120 
you know form down to maybe two three
breaks<00:04:04.090> you<00:04:04.420> know<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:04.569> solid<00:04:05.079> breaks<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:05.590> I

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
breaks you know a solid breaks and I

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.319 
breaks you know a solid breaks and I
part<00:04:06.400> of<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:06.609> practice<00:04:06.850> is<00:04:07.239> great<00:04:07.480> little<00:04:07.870> bit

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
part of the practice is great little bit

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.170 
part of the practice is great little bit
put<00:04:10.329> out<00:04:10.359> people<00:04:10.840> loose<00:04:11.370> because<00:04:12.370> of<00:04:12.730> because

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
put out people loose because of because

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.229 
put out people loose because of because
um<00:04:13.720> it's<00:04:14.620> good<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:15.040> new<00:04:15.250> proposed<00:04:15.610> on<00:04:15.849> because

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
um it's good to new proposed on because

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.099 
um it's good to new proposed on because
I've<00:04:16.450> sat<00:04:16.690> in<00:04:16.720> practice<00:04:17.260> improvisation

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
I've sat in practice improvisation

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.159 
I've sat in practice improvisation
and<00:04:18.739> I<00:04:18.889> know<00:04:19.090> how<00:04:20.090> to<00:04:20.150> get<00:04:20.329> myself<00:04:20.509> out<00:04:20.959> of<00:04:20.989> the

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
and I know how to get myself out of the

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.129 
and I know how to get myself out of the
out<00:04:21.349> of<00:04:21.469> the<00:04:21.739> hole<00:04:22.009> and<00:04:22.659> how<00:04:23.659> to<00:04:23.719> recover<00:04:23.990> from

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
out of the hole and how to recover from

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.899 
out of the hole and how to recover from
my<00:04:24.289> steaks<00:04:24.710> how<00:04:24.949> I<00:04:24.979> probably<00:04:25.340> would<00:04:25.580> keep<00:04:25.789> the

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
my steaks how I probably would keep the

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.610 
my steaks how I probably would keep the
second<00:04:26.210> or<00:04:26.300> third<00:04:26.330> brake<00:04:26.719> a<00:04:26.870> little<00:04:26.990> loose<00:04:27.259> and

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
second or third brake a little loose and

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.879 
second or third brake a little loose and

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
little bit more solid at least for the

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.290 
little bit more solid at least for the
moment<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.439> know<00:04:42.530> I<00:04:42.770> might<00:04:43.520> not<00:04:43.669> knock<00:04:44.030> bet

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
moment you know I might not knock bet

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.670 
moment you know I might not knock bet
that<00:04:44.479> would<00:04:44.569> forever<00:04:44.750> before<00:04:45.169> that<00:04:45.439> moment

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
that would forever before that moment

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
any mistakes and so i pair through all
