00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.770 
what you might have noticed that is we
haven't<00:02:19.349> told<00:02:19.890> them<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.459> leave<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.569> reason

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
haven't told them to leave it the reason

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.080 
haven't told them to leave it the reason
for<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.709> because<00:02:23.160> they<00:02:23.880> don't

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
for that is because they don't

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.540 
for that is because they don't
understand<00:02:24.569> English<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.530> saying<00:02:26.069> leave<00:02:26.370> it

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
understand English so saying leave it

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.100 
understand English so saying leave it
