findings video today I thought I would
show<00:00:19.160> you<00:00:19.190> a<00:00:19.400> little<00:00:19.670> bit<00:00:19.790> about<00:00:20.240> wire

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
show you a little bit about wire

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.380 
show you a little bit about wire
twisting<00:00:21.320> it's<00:00:21.950> a<00:00:22.100> great<00:00:22.340> tool<00:00:22.790> to<00:00:22.820> add<00:00:23.360> to

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
twisting it's a great tool to add to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.570 
twisting it's a great tool to add to
your<00:00:23.810> repertoire<00:00:24.350> because<00:00:24.830> you<00:00:24.950> can<00:00:25.130> use<00:00:25.369> it

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
your repertoire because you can use it

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.450 
your repertoire because you can use it
in<00:00:25.759> lots<00:00:26.270> of<00:00:26.450> different<00:00:26.810> ways<00:00:26.960> I<00:00:27.500> often<00:00:28.070> use<00:00:28.250> it

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
in lots of different ways I often use it

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.400 
in lots of different ways I often use it
when<00:00:28.759> I<00:00:29.060> want<00:00:29.090> to<00:00:29.390> do<00:00:29.630> something<00:00:30.110> with<00:00:30.259> the

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
when I want to do something with the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.050 
when I want to do something with the
wire<00:00:30.619> and<00:00:30.890> I<00:00:30.980> don't<00:00:31.040> have<00:00:31.430> a<00:00:31.460> heavy<00:00:31.759> enough

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
wire and I don't have a heavy enough

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.200 
wire and I don't have a heavy enough
gauge<00:00:32.419> so<00:00:33.350> by<00:00:33.530> twisting<00:00:34.220> two<00:00:34.460> wires<00:00:34.760> together

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
gauge so by twisting two wires together

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.050 
gauge so by twisting two wires together
like<00:00:35.720> I<00:00:35.870> did<00:00:36.050> in<00:00:36.170> this<00:00:36.350> earring<00:00:36.770> frame<00:00:37.070> now<00:00:37.880> it

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
like I did in this earring frame now it

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.260 
like I did in this earring frame now it
was<00:00:38.329> heavy<00:00:38.570> enough<00:00:38.900> to<00:00:39.170> do<00:00:39.470> what<00:00:39.650> I<00:00:39.680> wanted

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
was heavy enough to do what I wanted

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.110 
was heavy enough to do what I wanted
also<00:00:41.270> once<00:00:41.960> you've<00:00:42.260> twisted<00:00:42.829> your<00:00:42.980> wire<00:00:43.219> you

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
also once you've twisted your wire you

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.540 
also once you've twisted your wire you
can<00:00:44.510> hammer<00:00:44.750> it<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.230> then<00:00:45.500> you<00:00:45.739> have<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.039> frame

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
can hammer it and then you have a frame

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.759 
can hammer it and then you have a frame
that<00:00:46.879> you<00:00:47.000> can<00:00:47.210> loop<00:00:47.420> wire<00:00:47.719> through<00:00:48.260> to<00:00:48.620> make

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
that you can loop wire through to make

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.099 
that you can loop wire through to make
things<00:00:49.070> like<00:00:49.340> this<00:00:49.550> bracelet<00:00:50.059> or<00:00:50.719> this<00:00:50.870> piece

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
things like this bracelet or this piece

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.380 
things like this bracelet or this piece
which<00:00:51.440> is<00:00:51.469> a<00:00:51.710> part<00:00:52.070> of<00:00:52.219> a<00:00:52.309> pair<00:00:52.519> of<00:00:52.550> earrings<00:00:53.059> so

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
which is a part of a pair of earrings so

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.720 
which is a part of a pair of earrings so
let<00:00:54.079> me<00:00:54.199> show<00:00:54.379> you<00:00:54.410> three<00:00:54.920> different<00:00:55.550> ways

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
let me show you three different ways

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.290 
let me show you three different ways
that<00:00:56.090> you<00:00:56.239> can<00:00:56.510> twist<00:00:56.809> wire<00:00:57.760> this<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:58.910> a<00:00:58.940> tool

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
that you can twist wire this is a tool

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.959 
that you can twist wire this is a tool
that<00:00:59.329> you'll<00:00:59.719> find<00:01:00.019> in<00:01:00.289> many<00:01:00.469> of<00:01:00.800> your

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
that you'll find in many of your

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.060 
that you'll find in many of your
crafting<00:01:01.969> stores<00:01:02.359> made<00:01:03.050> just<00:01:03.440> for<00:01:03.649> twisting

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
crafting stores made just for twisting

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.200 
crafting stores made just for twisting
wire<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:05.480> idea<00:01:05.870> is<00:01:06.200> that<00:01:06.230> you<00:01:07.090> put<00:01:08.090> the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
wire and the idea is that you put the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.630 
wire and the idea is that you put the
wire<00:01:08.390> through<00:01:08.500> two<00:01:09.500> of<00:01:09.620> the<00:01:09.710> holes<00:01:09.890> on<00:01:10.340> this

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
wire through two of the holes on this

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.120 
wire through two of the holes on this
wheel<00:01:10.910> and<00:01:14.170> then<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:15.350> have<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.680> twist<00:01:15.950> these

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
wheel and then you have to twist these

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.830 
wheel and then you have to twist these
ends<00:01:16.549> together<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.150> you<00:01:17.210> have<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.570> do<00:01:17.689> it

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
ends together and you have to do it

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.260 
ends together and you have to do it
pretty<00:01:17.990> securely<00:01:18.619> it's<00:01:19.430> one<00:01:19.579> reason<00:01:19.939> I<00:01:20.210> don't

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
pretty securely it's one reason I don't

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.569 
pretty securely it's one reason I don't
love<00:01:20.659> this<00:01:20.900> tool<00:01:21.229> is<00:01:21.530> there's<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:22.009> lot<00:01:22.189> of<00:01:22.310> waste

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
love this tool is there's a lot of waste

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.219 
love this tool is there's a lot of waste
down<00:01:22.939> here<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.329> can't<00:01:23.570> just<00:01:23.630> put<00:01:23.930> in<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.110> couple

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
down here you can't just put in a couple

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.350 
down here you can't just put in a couple
twists<00:01:24.860> you<00:01:25.399> have<00:01:25.549> to<00:01:25.700> put<00:01:25.880> in<00:01:25.970> quite<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.270> few

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
twists you have to put in quite a few

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.280 
twists you have to put in quite a few
and<00:01:26.960> also<00:01:27.710> you<00:01:27.770> need<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.640> hook<00:01:29.540> something

and also you need a hook something
stationary<00:01:30.590> or<00:01:31.220> something<00:01:31.670> heavy<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.299> clamp

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
stationary or something heavy to clamp

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.109 
stationary or something heavy to clamp
on<00:01:33.049> to<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.439> other<00:01:33.619> end<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.700> then<00:01:34.850> once<00:01:35.030> you

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
on to the other end so then once you

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.389 
on to the other end so then once you
have<00:01:35.360> your<00:01:35.479> wires<00:01:35.720> in<00:01:36.110> here<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.500> just<00:01:36.799> hold<00:01:37.130> on

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
have your wires in here you just hold on

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.609 
have your wires in here you just hold on
to<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.030> other<00:01:38.180> end<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:39.159> twist<00:01:40.780> this<00:01:41.780> tool

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
to the other end and twist this tool

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.709 
to the other end and twist this tool
does<00:01:42.950> its<00:01:43.219> job<00:01:43.310> but<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:44.090> there's<00:01:44.420> several

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
does its job but it there's several

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.389 
does its job but it there's several
steps<00:01:44.869> involved<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:45.649> think<00:01:45.920> ever<00:01:46.070> pain

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
steps involved that I think ever pain

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.510 
steps involved that I think ever pain
like<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:46.820> said<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:47.689> waste<00:01:47.930> wire<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:48.829> you<00:01:49.340> have

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
like I said you waste wire and you have

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.490 
like I said you waste wire and you have
to<00:01:49.700> have<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.909> third<00:01:50.329> hand<00:01:50.600> of<00:01:50.840> some<00:01:51.049> sort

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
to have a third hand of some sort

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.190 
to have a third hand of some sort
instead<00:01:52.159> you<00:01:52.430> can<00:01:52.610> do<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.060> same<00:01:53.299> thing<00:01:53.780> with

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
instead you can do the same thing with

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.679 
instead you can do the same thing with
just<00:01:54.469> a<00:01:54.680> pair<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:54.979> chain<00:01:55.670> nose<00:01:55.729> or<00:01:56.210> flat<00:01:56.450> nose

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
just a pair of chain nose or flat nose

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.980

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
once again the piece of wire gets folded

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.990 
once again the piece of wire gets folded
in<00:02:01.939> half<00:02:02.180> and

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.100

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.300 
nose or flat nose
tuck<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.300> round<00:02:11.510> nose<00:02:11.750> into<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.320> loop<00:02:12.530> and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
tuck the round nose into the loop and

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.620 
tuck the round nose into the loop and
you<00:02:14.030> can<00:02:14.210> just<00:02:14.450> twist<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.500> tool<00:02:19.630> this

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
you can just twist the tool this

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.780 
you can just twist the tool this
actually<00:02:21.020> works<00:02:21.200> well<00:02:21.530> if<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:21.860> put<00:02:22.160> your<00:02:22.340> wire

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
actually works well if you put your wire

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.150 
actually works well if you put your wire
into<00:02:23.209> vice<00:02:23.450> grips<00:02:23.840> because<00:02:24.470> then<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:24.920> don't

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
into vice grips because then you don't

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.100 
into vice grips because then you don't
have<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.580> rip<00:02:25.820> onto<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.480> grips<00:02:26.690> do<00:02:26.930> that

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
have to rip onto it the grips do that

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.510 
have to rip onto it the grips do that
for<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.590> but<00:02:28.340> by<00:02:28.580> far<00:02:29.830> my<00:02:30.830> favorite<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.490> a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
for you but by far my favorite is a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.550 
for you but by far my favorite is a
power<00:02:31.880> tool<00:02:34.060> just<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.420> power<00:02:35.690> drill<00:02:36.110> with<00:02:36.500> a

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
power tool just a power drill with a

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.330 
power tool just a power drill with a
Chuck

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
Chuck

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.940 
Chuck
that<00:02:37.940> means<00:02:38.150> these<00:02:38.450> little<00:02:38.930> things<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.440> come

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
that means these little things that come

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.890 
that means these little things that come
together<00:02:40.220> as<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.239> spin<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:44.510> once<00:02:44.750> again

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
together as you spin it and once again

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.050 
together as you spin it and once again
you<00:02:45.320> fold<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.830> wire<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.280> half<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.850> this<00:02:46.910> is

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
you fold the wire in half and this is

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.500 
you fold the wire in half and this is
great

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
great

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.229 
great
if<00:02:48.170> you're<00:02:48.440> using<00:02:48.650> heavier<00:02:49.220> gauge<00:02:49.580> wire<00:02:49.910> that

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
if you're using heavier gauge wire that

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.830 
if you're using heavier gauge wire that
would<00:02:50.390> be<00:02:50.510> difficult<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:51.940> twist<00:02:52.940> by<00:02:53.209> hand<00:02:53.600> you

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
would be difficult to twist by hand you

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.830 
would be difficult to twist by hand you
just<00:02:54.080> tuck<00:02:54.380> them<00:02:54.560> in<00:02:54.739> there<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:56.300> then<00:02:56.570> tighten

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
just tuck them in there and then tighten

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.600 
just tuck them in there and then tighten
down<00:02:57.020> the<00:02:57.170> Chuck<00:02:57.590> until<00:02:57.950> it's<00:02:58.070> holding<00:02:58.430> them

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
down the Chuck until it's holding them

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:06.610 
down the Chuck until it's holding them
firmly<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:05.360> then<00:03:05.420> I'm<00:03:06.020> not<00:03:06.110> gonna<00:03:06.230> be<00:03:06.380> able<00:03:06.530> to

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
firmly and then I'm not gonna be able to

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.840 
firmly and then I'm not gonna be able to
get<00:03:06.739> all<00:03:06.890> of<00:03:06.920> this<00:03:07.220> on<00:03:07.580> camera<00:03:08.270> but<00:03:09.580> you<00:03:10.580> can

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
get all of this on camera but you can

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.789 
get all of this on camera but you can
put<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.269> loop<00:03:12.489> again<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.940> loop<00:03:14.180> of<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:15.200> wire

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
put the loop again the loop of the wire

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:30.710 
put the loop again the loop of the wire
into<00:03:16.670> your<00:03:17.000> round<00:03:17.180> nose<00:03:17.299> pliers<00:03:19.060> hit<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.209> gas

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.330 

and<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.930> way<00:03:32.170> your<00:03:32.560> wire<00:03:32.800> is<00:03:33.069> twisted

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
and that way your wire is twisted

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.990 
and that way your wire is twisted
perfectly<00:03:34.239> evenly<00:03:34.920> quickly<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.640> can<00:03:36.819> do

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
perfectly evenly quickly and you can do

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.479 
perfectly evenly quickly and you can do
a<00:03:37.030> piece<00:03:37.299> as<00:03:37.690> long<00:03:38.200> as<00:03:38.409> you<00:03:38.560> can<00:03:38.769> reach<00:03:39.010> from

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
a piece as long as you can reach from

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.119 
a piece as long as you can reach from
one<00:03:39.580> hand<00:03:40.090> to<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.360> other

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
one hand to the other

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.979 
one hand to the other
so<00:03:42.129> then<00:03:42.370> once<00:03:42.610> you<00:03:42.730> have<00:03:42.849> your<00:03:43.090> twisted<00:03:43.750> wire

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
so then once you have your twisted wire

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.559 
so then once you have your twisted wire
you<00:03:44.440> can<00:03:44.860> shape<00:03:45.489> it<00:03:45.700> just<00:03:45.730> like<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:46.360> would<00:03:46.540> a

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
you can shape it just like you would a

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.449 
you can shape it just like you would a
single<00:03:47.080> strand<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.560> wire<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:48.160> then<00:03:48.310> that

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
single strand of wire and then that

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:49.949 
single strand of wire and then that
makes<00:03:48.640> it<00:03:48.879> just<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:49.120> bit<00:03:49.269> more<00:03:49.390> fancy<00:03:49.720> and

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
makes it just a bit more fancy and

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.369 
makes it just a bit more fancy and
decorative<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:51.370> can<00:03:51.700> hammer<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:52.330> and<00:03:52.540> again

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
decorative you can hammer it and again

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.930 
decorative you can hammer it and again
like<00:03:53.560> I<00:03:53.680> said<00:03:53.739> earlier<00:03:54.250> you'll<00:03:54.519> have<00:03:54.730> these

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
like I said earlier you'll have these

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.720 
like I said earlier you'll have these
holes<00:03:55.330> that<00:03:55.780> open<00:03:56.110> up<00:03:56.230> as<00:03:56.500> you<00:03:56.680> hammer<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.099> so

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
holes that open up as you hammer it so

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.250 
holes that open up as you hammer it so
that<00:03:57.879> you<00:03:57.970> can<00:03:58.120> pass<00:03:58.329> wire<00:03:58.660> through<00:03:58.989> it<00:03:59.140> and

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
that you can pass wire through it and

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.910 
that you can pass wire through it and
use<00:03:59.379> it<00:03:59.530> as<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.680> frame<00:04:00.069> make<00:04:00.579> scrolls<00:04:01.739> just<00:04:02.739> have

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
use it as a frame make scrolls just have

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.220 
use it as a frame make scrolls just have
fun<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.220> create<00:04:03.519> an<00:04:03.819> experiment<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.690> hope<00:04:05.049> I've

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
fun and create an experiment I hope I've

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.589
