gravel bar when I get into the bigger
stuff<00:00:17.539> this<00:00:18.539> thing's<00:00:18.840> just<00:00:18.960> covered<00:00:20.210> was<00:00:21.210> out

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
stuff this thing's just covered was out

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.870 
stuff this thing's just covered was out
was<00:00:23.910> up<00:00:24.090> for<00:00:24.570> maybe<00:00:25.289> 50<00:00:25.769> yards<00:00:25.949> there<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.760> then

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
was up for maybe 50 yards there and then

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.279 
was up for maybe 50 yards there and then
you<00:00:27.000> go<00:00:27.150> past<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.689> brush<00:00:29.449> and<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.720> winds<00:00:31.170> on

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you go past the brush and just winds on

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.040 
you go past the brush and just winds on
up<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.740> way<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:33.360> we're<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.780> go<00:00:33.930> ahead

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
up that way so we're going to go ahead

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.569 
up that way so we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:34.350> give<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.649> try<00:00:34.920> we're<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.399> have<00:00:35.489> to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and give it a try we're going to have to

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.100 
and give it a try we're going to have to
first<00:00:35.790> figure<00:00:36.000> out<00:00:36.239> where<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.660> gold<00:00:36.809> might

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
first figure out where the gold might

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.600 
first figure out where the gold might
have<00:00:37.230> settled<00:00:37.559> out<00:00:37.710> when<00:00:37.920> all<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.219> flooding

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
have settled out when all this flooding

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.299 
have settled out when all this flooding
occurred<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.090> bring<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.420> down<00:00:39.660> here<00:00:39.930> so

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
occurred to bring this down here so

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.430 
occurred to bring this down here so
we'll<00:00:41.309> take<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.550> look<00:00:41.760> at<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.270> see<00:00:43.260> what

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
we'll take a look at that and see what

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.110 
we'll take a look at that and see what
we<00:00:43.559> find<00:00:43.770> today<00:00:46.640> this<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.000> our
