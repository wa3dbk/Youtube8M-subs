00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.489
 evening make my skin is so 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.260
 This face care and them really 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.280
 very well 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.860
 I do not have that many anymore and 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.360
 then we will stop before and the products 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.030
 which I show you and those now 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.370
 I am very confident they are for 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.930
 is my part pretty good, of course, 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.760
 it's always people who are not so good at it 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.230
 he clearly responds to my products 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.940
 Example do not react so well 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.320
 I react so well to my skin 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.180
 products of garnier so the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.320
 Facial care through the products 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.689
 Just give it to you soon 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.400
 Show this is not so expensive that 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.990
 everything is still within the scope of the possible 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.189
 and I think that will be for the one 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.530
 or others already a few products 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.909
 to be interesting and yes 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.350
 let's start in the morning after that 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.290
 Anyway, I'll wash my own 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.390
 face and then I take that 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.130
 daily facial water from bb that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.540
 helps to rid the skin of blackheads 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.860
 and for me it actually works 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.930
 pretty good that's about it already 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.439
 my third pack it may be good 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.280
 third pack and i could with real 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.470
 Of course that helped me too and that 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.549
 then I distribute with sohnemann 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.549
 cotton pads easy on my skin i 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.979
 already have another law of athena 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.270
 I also tried that I believe in 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.799
 the video which I linked to you here 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.930
 presented but somehow it then 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.180
 not helped that was everything as before 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.110
 but with the product I have the feeling 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.280
 That's what helps my skin and that's why 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.530
 use the also still like and 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.290
 that costs but really not much the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.940
 price performance the price performance 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.690
 relationship 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:12.410
 is for this product really okay there can 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.060
 you really can not do more and can do something 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.350
 I definitely recommend it because you 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.120
 are looking for such a 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.130
 courtroom is natural 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.630
 that does not like that that was yours 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.760
 skin just does not work the same way 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.320
 let it work for me you have to 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.750
 then try it and I think 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.310
 that this is not now such a 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.030
 big loss if you just now 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.590
 the few euros for this facial water 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.250
 out of violence, miracles really escalate 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.560
 effect 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.370
 different for everyone but you can 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.350
 give it a try 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.790
 After that I look at my vision 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.530
 have worn and that a bit 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.040
 my skin has a lasting effect 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.500
 little 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.930
 then I take this soothing 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.340
 care of bb that's just a whole 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.470
 normal day cream and the sad then 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.360
 on my skin too I 've had before 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.710
 for normal skin then I have 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.210
 noticed that my skin is more sensitive 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.650
 I would have taken those so there 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.290
 There are really different types of 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.430
 this cream and who can you ever after 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.739
 the captain has to choose the cream 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.959
 which fits a serb because it yoga- 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.140
 or it is math logically tested 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.910
 and yes , my skin is off 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.590
 Anything but dry then 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.390
 The fear is really pretty good at 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.350
 You and you can both you and you 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.120
 you also have a look if you are 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.770
 really looking for his seeds 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.090
 then I can give you the one on each one 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.739
 I recommend this case 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.750
 We can say ours on the make-up 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.030
 I use myself then and in the evening 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.380
 then to make-up the www war in 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.420
 clean waschke and eye make up 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.800
 Removes what we remotely make up 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.450
 any case, i can do that for you 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.519
 also totally recommend so I'll do it 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.739
 Product really like the most simple 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.989
 not with these cotton pads and then with 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.330
 this make-up remover all of this 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.230
 on the skin somehow I like it 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.360
 somehow not it is so part 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.400
 expects consumption and there you need 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.350
 that I'm not there you just can 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.820
 a little something of it your hand 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.630
 make me so happy almost me 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.940
 take a little bit you can watch the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.190
 make-up really easy out of the face 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.450
 Remove the skin and was then also 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.709
 I do not like that either 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.750
 if you are looking for a product like 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.370
 you use it so exciting that when i do 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.550
 not that good at all and that's why 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.200
 I like the product 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.390
 really like because it 's just that 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.970
 not doing where you can without too 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.770
 Care in the eye area so use that 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.870
 brings in the eyes and 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.810
 it therefore comes down mascara 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.670
 and alone and i can do it real 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.410
 recommend this is really great product 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.810
 Look that different is really good 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:39.270
 yes, then I use that again 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.310
 natural water from wb of course again 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.260
 there are people in cotton pads 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.790
 I have everything to say in august 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.920
 I can tell you every case 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.810
 advise the product to test and afterwards 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.240
 I use again a cream and 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.280
 Although one of the bb and directly 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.930
 the guy day and night green 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.780
 she already knows me if you 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.060
 my videos often comes that means too 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.890
 a normal chandler 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.300
 I find that skin feeling with this 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.100
 cream is really nice 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.110
 the skin feels like it should be easy 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.960
 well maintained and I really like that 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.020
 I like the feeling my skin is 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.790
 then the next morning very smooth and 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.800
 supple and soft and I 'll do that 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.870
 cream quite like it should be 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.669
 quite pleasant 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.190
 then I even have products I do not 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.290
 so often use and that is once 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.380
 a peeling and that is the john s 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.810
 I have a pretty long time 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.840
 bought more and I use that stop 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.740
 not so on I use that I believe 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.410
 once a month 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.660
 when it comes up twice so npd now 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.610
 not so often I had done earlier 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.700
 but not so good for my skin because 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.590
 she was pretty irritating and that 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.080
 I use I know but I do not know if 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.480
 I'll buy that again if 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.160
 I rather because what is also the bb when 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.930
 my skin already the bw products 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.630
 quite well tolerates as I said it 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.900
 not with everyone but with me already 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.160
 and I can look at this but this 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.480
 I did not feel that way either 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.669
 bad that is herbal kiss with 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.550
 is on it reuter cosmetics I am 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.350
 actually really satisfied 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.850
 and yes, as I said, I use stop if 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.640
 it does not come up to a month so 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.770
 so often but I think you should too 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.060
 not in his skin too often with one 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.680
 Peeling is enough in my skin 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.389
 that is very sensitive then I still have 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.180
 not a product I ever 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.860
 use regularly but only if yes 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.570
 I got pretty big pimples at that time 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.210
 face that as fast as possible 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.289
 that's more , and that's it 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.440
 from James m 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:40.110
 and that's such a pimple swab so 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.240
 then it has such a pillow me then 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.500
 You can see that from the people 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.389
 pots and go for a pimple 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.669
 pretty soon that too 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:53.039
 I usually use it in the evening sometimes 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:54.630
 also in the morning but that's more like this 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:56.340
 I use that product when I am 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.009
 then do not make a make up because I 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.630
 believe that such a product already 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:02.610
 quite a long time around in the 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.949
 Looks great when you still make-up 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.780
 over it march or concealer or so then 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:08.820
 I do not think that's it then 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.610
 that's why it's so great that I use it 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.860
 only if i really have a sunday 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.810
 have when I sit somewhere and lazy 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.940
 do nothing else or generally one 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.160
 I will not be with me because then 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.630
 yes my skin should relax pretty much 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.759
 and not by make up like that 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.410
 to be strained so much too 

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:27.090
 the two products, the house already 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.500
 do this with my facial routine 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.000
 I always like this in the morning and 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.590
 in the evening and then as I said to the
