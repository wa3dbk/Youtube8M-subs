moment that assassin's creed two ended

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.960 
moment that assassin's creed two ended
so<00:02:12.659> you<00:02:13.470> know<00:02:13.590> when<00:02:13.739> we<00:02:13.860> made<00:02:14.099> assassin's

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.470 
creed two we understood the at to your
story<00:02:16.620> was<00:02:16.799> more<00:02:17.159> epic<00:02:17.580> than<00:02:17.610> anything<00:02:18.360> we

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
story was more epic than anything we

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.570 
story was more epic than anything we
could<00:02:18.599> tell<00:02:18.840> with<00:02:19.019> one<00:02:19.200> game<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:20.400> time

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
could tell with one game and this time

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.800 
could tell with one game and this time
around<00:02:20.700> what<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:21.180> wanted<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.510> give<00:02:21.690> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
around what we wanted to give the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.860 
around what we wanted to give the
players<00:02:22.019> is<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.590> fantasy<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.370> being<00:02:24.060> leader

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
players is the fantasy of being leader

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.470 
players is the fantasy of being leader
of<00:02:25.230> an<00:02:25.409> assassin<00:02:25.890> order

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480
