look<00:00:06.390> into<00:00:06.629> this<00:00:06.750> plant<00:00:07.130> and<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.189> plant<00:00:08.250> is

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
look into this plant and this plant is

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.509 
look into this plant and this plant is
actually<00:00:08.820> called<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.690> dumb<00:00:10.320> cane<00:00:10.740> or

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
actually called a dumb cane or

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.539 
actually called a dumb cane or
dieffenbachia<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:13.070> it's<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.130> common<00:00:14.400> house

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
dieffenbachia and it's a common house

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.540 
dieffenbachia and it's a common house
plant<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.089> can<00:00:15.179> buy<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.480> most<00:00:15.630> garden<00:00:16.139> centers

plant you can buy in most garden centers

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.310 
plant you can buy in most garden centers
but<00:00:17.550> I've<00:00:17.940> noticed<00:00:18.359> over<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.900> past<00:00:18.990> few

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
but I've noticed over the past few

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.000 
but I've noticed over the past few
months<00:00:19.560> now<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.310> plant<00:00:20.730> has<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> particular

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
months now this plant has a particular

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.650 
months now this plant has a particular
sensitivity<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.880> electromagnetic

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660

particular lighting products and the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.390 
particular lighting products and the
reason<00:01:24.810> why<00:01:24.869> I'm<00:01:24.930> doing<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.590> because<00:01:25.680> if

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
reason why I'm doing this is because if

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.130 
reason why I'm doing this is because if
you<00:01:26.490> look<00:01:26.670> at<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.909> particular<00:01:27.060> plant<00:01:27.630> it's

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
you look at this particular plant it's

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.859 
you look at this particular plant it's
the<00:01:28.290> same<00:01:28.560> variety<00:01:29.210> look<00:01:30.210> at<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> size<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the same variety look at the size of the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.890 
the same variety look at the size of the
leaf<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.320> comparison<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.950> my<00:01:32.159> hand<00:01:32.900> conferred

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.170 
the growth pan to go back to this so
didn't<00:02:17.590> you've<00:02:18.099> seen<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.370> reason<00:02:18.640> why<00:02:18.790> i'm

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
didn't you've seen the reason why i'm

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.180 
didn't you've seen the reason why i'm
doing<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:19.480> experiment<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.470> whole

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
doing this experiment so the whole

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.149 
doing this experiment so the whole
purpose<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:21.879> experiment<00:02:22.209> is<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.659> verify

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
purpose of this experiment is to verify

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.430 
purpose of this experiment is to verify
how<00:02:24.159> the<00:02:24.819> quality<00:02:25.239> of<00:02:25.299> white<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.720> compared<00:02:26.379> to

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
how the quality of white is compared to

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.890 
how the quality of white is compared to
daylight<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.250> i<00:02:27.340> have<00:02:27.519> some<00:02:27.730> control<00:02:28.299> plants

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
daylight and i have some control plants

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.649 
daylight and i have some control plants
of<00:02:29.019> these<00:02:29.230> around<00:02:30.040> house<00:02:30.370> just<00:02:30.970> growing<00:02:31.329> in

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
of these around house just growing in

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.300 
of these around house just growing in
natural<00:02:32.560> window<00:02:33.370> white<00:02:33.849> and<00:02:35.099> they<00:02:36.099> are<00:02:36.220> going

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
natural window white and they are going

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.330 
natural window white and they are going
to<00:02:36.370> be<00:02:36.489> used<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:37.090> verify<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.840> growth<00:02:38.769> defects

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
to be used to verify the growth defects

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.360 
to be used to verify the growth defects
in<00:02:39.640> these<00:02:40.120> particular<00:02:40.480> plants<00:02:41.129> so<00:02:42.129> it's<00:02:42.159> my

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
in these particular plants so it's my

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.580 
in these particular plants so it's my
latest<00:02:42.579> experiment<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.660> thought<00:02:44.349> I<00:02:44.379> would

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
latest experiment I thought I would

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.319 
latest experiment I thought I would
share<00:02:44.769> a<00:02:44.829> video<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.430> as<00:02:45.790> soon<00:02:45.940> as<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.090> get<00:02:46.269> the

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
share a video and as soon as I get the

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.780 
share a video and as soon as I get the
results<00:02:46.450> in<00:02:47.049> a<00:02:47.140> few<00:02:47.290> months<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.799> will<00:02:48.489> post

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
results in a few months I will post

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.129 
results in a few months I will post
another<00:02:49.299> YouTube<00:02:50.049> thank<00:02:50.980> you
