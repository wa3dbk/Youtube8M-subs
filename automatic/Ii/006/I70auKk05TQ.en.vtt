00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.440
 let's replace an air filter in 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.260
 a peugeot 206 h 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.120
 we open the hood we have the small 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.120
 opening right here in the center 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.960
 we push and we raise it 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.430
 we hold it and put the insurance and 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.430
 our hood is subject 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.870
 for the replacement of the air filter 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.340
 in a peugeot 206 h of the only 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.190
 necessary tool is a 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.830
 large size screwdriver you have 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.309
 four cross-shaped screws here 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.740
 here and here and a clamp too 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.930
 to unscrew 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.350
 let's start by unscrewing the 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.350
 clamp 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.880
 once unscrewed we go to the others 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.880
 four filter screws 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.539
 we raise it we get it out of this way 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.690
 here we have our filter that we take 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:59.470
 with your fingers we turn it simply and 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.330
 we can substitute it verifies well that 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.240
 the filter matches the old 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.610
 a valley 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.610
 everything is fine are the same filter 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.610
 I put it 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.610
 and verify that it is well placed 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.849
 take your box again 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.670
 entering inside 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.670
 and the jce fits 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.100
 once the process is finished 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.820
 immediately screw back the 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.820
 clamps 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.340
 and screw is the rest 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.720
 and it's already changed 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.430
 I'm going to start the car to verify 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.970
 that the air filter is fine 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.970
 placed 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.280
 Well, everything is fine 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.580
 our filter is well placed all 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.580
 it is going well 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.790
 Y
