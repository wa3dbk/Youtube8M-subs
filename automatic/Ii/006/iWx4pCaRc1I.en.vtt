00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
people doing a lot of different jobs up

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.840 
people doing a lot of different jobs up
here<00:04:27.169> but<00:04:27.380> it's<00:04:27.500> all<00:04:27.650> for<00:04:27.890> one<00:04:27.919> common<00:04:28.370> goal

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
here but it's all for one common goal

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.060 
here but it's all for one common goal
yet<00:04:29.510> certainly<00:04:29.810> is<00:04:30.020> we<00:04:30.680> have<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:30.950> all<00:04:31.040> work

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.850 
yet certainly is we have to all work
very<00:04:31.580> closely<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:33.070> whilst<00:04:34.180> yeah<00:04:35.680> thanks<00:04:36.680> Rick

very closely and whilst yeah thanks Rick
I<00:04:37.630> think<00:04:38.630> one<00:04:38.840> of<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.050> one<00:04:39.590> of<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.830> key<00:04:39.980> things

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
I think one of the one of the key things

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.520 
I think one of the one of the key things
to<00:04:40.640> mention<00:04:41.180> is<00:04:41.450> that<00:04:41.930> whilst<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.200> technical

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
to mention is that whilst the technical

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.230 
to mention is that whilst the technical
side<00:04:42.620> is<00:04:42.770> very<00:04:42.950> important<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:43.580> that<00:04:43.730> talks

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
side is very important and that talks

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.880 
side is very important and that talks
about<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.630> showcasing<00:04:45.170> how<00:04:45.290> fast<00:04:45.530> our<00:04:45.710> race

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
about and showcasing how fast our race

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.730 
about and showcasing how fast our race
cars<00:04:46.130> can<00:04:46.280> go<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:46.460> a<00:04:46.880> degree<00:04:47.350> we<00:04:48.350> are<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:48.590> money

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
cars can go to a degree we are the money

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.500 
cars can go to a degree we are the money
behind<00:04:48.920> the<00:04:49.160> business<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.610> a<00:04:49.640> degree<00:04:49.820> we<00:04:50.090> have

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
behind the business to a degree we have

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.210 
behind the business to a degree we have
to<00:04:50.630> drive<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.320> income<00:04:51.680> that<00:04:51.770> comes<00:04:51.980> to<00:04:52.130> the

to drive the income that comes to the

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.920 
to drive the income that comes to the
team<00:04:52.430> which<00:04:52.850> also<00:04:53.060> goes<00:04:53.330> into<00:04:53.540> all<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.780> veldt

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
team which also goes into all the veldt

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.570 
team which also goes into all the veldt
development<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:54.710> helps<00:04:54.980> make<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.250> team<00:04:55.430> go

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
development and helps make the team go

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.270 
development and helps make the team go
faster<00:04:56.090> in<00:04:56.270> a<00:04:56.450> nutshell<00:04:56.630> so<00:04:57.050> up<00:04:57.920> here<00:04:58.190> it's

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
faster in a nutshell so up here it's

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.560 
faster in a nutshell so up here it's
very<00:04:58.340> important<00:04:58.850> that<00:04:58.970> we<00:04:59.060> work<00:04:59.090> closely

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
very important that we work closely

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.020 
very important that we work closely
because<00:05:00.050> our<00:05:00.170> partners<00:05:00.680> it's<00:05:01.460> not<00:05:01.640> just<00:05:01.880> about

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
because our partners it's not just about

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.160 
because our partners it's not just about
what<00:05:02.300> I<00:05:02.330> mentioned<00:05:02.450> before<00:05:02.660> it's<00:05:02.900> not<00:05:02.990> just

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
what I mentioned before it's not just

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.390 
what I mentioned before it's not just
about<00:05:03.230> branding<00:05:03.650> on<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:03.740> race<00:05:03.950> car<00:05:04.220> it's

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
about branding on a race car it's

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.160 
about branding on a race car it's
certainly<00:05:04.820> about<00:05:05.060> all<00:05:05.420> the<00:05:05.750> different<00:05:06.080> ways

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
certainly about all the different ways

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.780 
certainly about all the different ways
that<00:05:06.230> they<00:05:06.500> can<00:05:06.680> interact<00:05:06.920> and<00:05:07.160> integrate<00:05:07.460> and

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
that they can interact and integrate and

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.970 
that they can interact and integrate and
maximizing<00:05:08.390> it<00:05:08.480> return<00:05:08.750> on<00:05:08.870> investment<00:05:09.350> so

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
maximizing it return on investment so

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.680 
maximizing it return on investment so
it's<00:05:10.130> extremely<00:05:10.340> competitive<00:05:10.730> on<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.450> track

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
it's extremely competitive on the track

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.720 
it's extremely competitive on the track
but<00:05:12.050> as<00:05:12.230> commercial<00:05:12.770> director<00:05:13.250> do<00:05:13.370> you<00:05:13.460> find

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
but as commercial director do you find

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.250 
but as commercial director do you find
it<00:05:13.850> even<00:05:14.060> more<00:05:14.210> competitive<00:05:14.570> off<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:15.050> track

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
it even more competitive off the track

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.650 
it even more competitive off the track
it<00:05:16.130> certainly<00:05:16.550> is<00:05:16.700> very<00:05:16.760> competitive<00:05:17.240> off<00:05:17.510> the

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
it certainly is very competitive off the

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.650 
it certainly is very competitive off the
track<00:05:17.930> it's<00:05:18.350> one<00:05:19.250> thing<00:05:19.460> not<00:05:19.820> just<00:05:20.270> v8

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
track it's one thing not just v8

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.920 
track it's one thing not just v8
