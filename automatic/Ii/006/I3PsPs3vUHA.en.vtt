00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.960
 They took us one piece 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.040
 individuality and help each other 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.900
 identify 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.150
 for a better understanding in 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.289
 conversations we give people places and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.289
 also names of objects 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.430
 but not always one agrees on 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.170
 the correct pronunciation of things 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.000
 leave many languages ​​and dialects 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.590
 sometimes puzzle you and do it 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.980
 difficult to right the wording 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.980
 Find 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.210
 a problem that also in the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.320
 automotive industry is finding again 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.180
 Here prevails through the many 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.460
 international automotive manufacturer 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.320
 proper pronunciation is called 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.079
 now for example lamborghini or 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.260
 Lamborghini says citroen or sees 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.260
 purely 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.820
 Often it helps if you know 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.710
 which country the car manufacturer comes from 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.239
 do you know the emphasis or maybe 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.470
 even some vocabulary of this language 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.100
 you can take the name alone 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.100
 piece together 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.630
 so you can get up to speed as well 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.250
 derive renault and tried 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.479
 without problems peugeot becomes difficult 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.190
 However, if the manufacturer 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.020
 determine pronunciation of the name itself 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.450
 language skills and help 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:31.700
 reading ability little like for example 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:32.810
 at vw phaeton or traitor yes so 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.070
 at the fathers and is it something 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.110
 I admit it is more complicated 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.869
 the name comes from the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.060
 greek mythology 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.280
 so far, one would say he was but 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.369
 and French used as one says 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.840
 Beton and we have virtually the 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.899
 approximated and say French 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.789
 fathers where we are at vw know 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.750
 she actually the legendary scirocco 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.310
 No 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.470
 does not matter because there is not 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.470
 right is called scirocco 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.789
 Another classic is of course 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.840
 also the karmann ghia or what is his name 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.700
 right 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.680
 of course, karmann ghia is right 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.849
 from the Italian and only speaks 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.370
 a gh as sharp g from oh as at 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.260
 spaghetti so but it is still 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.129
 nevertheless Lamborghini like that from the 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.129
 miracle lamp or 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.220
 Lamborghini also has several 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.830
 Candidates who have the pronunciation 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.830
 make heavy like the gallardo right 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.459
 a spanish name also comes from this one 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.680
 from the animal world so out of the world 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.530
 the colleague and man opposite one calls one 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.230
 the 211 does not have any co 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.470
 there is not an apostrophe on the e 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.769
 So everyone would have to gesture yes 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.709
 written is ok but you speak that 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.690
 it ok but lamborghini still has 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.980
 a complicated stock how it came 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.110
 for whose name you already know 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.549
 who I mean the countach this one 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.549
 or bra anyway 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.349
 it is a thematic expression and the 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.040
 testifies of amazement times said that 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:31.620
 He is a designer from the team who is so 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.139
 he wondered that he had this expression 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.280
 used to his positive 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.380
 to express surprise 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.060
 in the category premium sports cars there 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.709
 Of course it is still a manufacturer of 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.050
 in the name of his models 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.010
 creative is the speech of porsche 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.819
 and its series cayman or gills 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.819
 What is your name really? 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.550
 he actually does not call cayman 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.170
 So we have him in the 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.570
 English writing wise on the 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.740
 rear of the car attached to the 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.180
 lettering and it stays with you 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.650
 also came porsche but with 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.140
 his suv still a difficult one 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.720
 Candidates released this cayenne 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.100
 or cheyenne or how do you say it 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.260
 right if you are me personally 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.120
 I also know the concept 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.190
 I already have everything cheyenne 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.990
 but in fact if one is exactly 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.550
 It looks like you'll notice it 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.900
 also writes like you speak 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.450
 that is cayenne speak like you 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.210
 just write or how 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.890
 then one speaks citroen the correct one 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.400
 pronunciation as we have a French 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.780
 brand is sind is citroen but that 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.100
 whole has a prehistory I know in 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.190
 germany, many people say citroen 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.550
 is not that wrong then andré 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.370
 citroën comes from a family of 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.870
 diamond dealers 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.060
 Jews from Holland to Poland 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.530
 immigrated to France as the 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.260
 ancestors of and risk someday 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.060
 mountains I give a surname 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.430
 had 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.560
 acted with the relevant ancestor 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.050
 and therefore gave it to the 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.630
 name was high that was his first name 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.960
 mimoun the word in dutch 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.699
 written with as the family 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.770
 poland wandered because a man for him 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.440
 Poland not to speak out on track 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.530
 they then called themselves lemons 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.590
 So to do with described as today 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:35.169
 the citroen and then you from poland 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.910
 emigrated to paris decided 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.520
 The primary school teacher at the job 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.199
 the little andré that has a name with 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.360
 this spelling for French not 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.370
 was pronounce and sat because of it 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.300
 the double dots the theme about the 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.100
 e to indicate that the vowels and e 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.919
 be pronounced separated and so came 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.660
 it then to the pronunciation citroen like 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.880
 was fixed for so and later 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.590
 as Citroen his company then founded 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:05.260
 but it was taken over for the 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:06.070
 pronunciation of the brand name but it works 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.870
 also easier 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.550
 luckily with all the difficulties 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.470
 there are complex names 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.270
 also some automakers on the 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.270
 completely renounce creative names 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.500
 Models like the Audi R8 or A6 or the 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.720
 bmw z4 or simply the e 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.550
 class of mercedes spare the 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.350
 car fans given a disgrace when 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.350
 Pronounce your favorite vehicles 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.740
 nevertheless, it is certainly more exciting 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.300
 when behind a vehicle also took 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.130
 a story is the dare 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.130
 shapes and identifies 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.850
 Besides, it sounds quite funny 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:53.330
 if one or the other is his best 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:56.020
 piece of honda civic or micic or ford 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.020
 Fiesta calls
