00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.490 

and<00:00:56.030> I<00:00:56.120> think<00:00:56.329> those<00:00:56.480> two<00:00:56.510> corners<00:00:56.929> are<00:00:57.050> just

and I think those two corners are just

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.860 
and I think those two corners are just
enough<00:00:57.829> for<00:00:58.070> Hamlin<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:59.089> get<00:00:59.239> to<00:01:00.019> keep<00:01:00.170> that<00:01:01.870> if

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
enough for Hamlin to get to keep that if

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.179 
enough for Hamlin to get to keep that if
we<00:01:02.989> get<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.230> white<00:01:03.409> flag<00:01:03.440> here<00:01:03.949> there<00:01:04.100> will
