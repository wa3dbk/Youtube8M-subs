will<00:02:46.260> claw<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.530> hub<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.040> bag<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:50.010> you

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
will claw the hub of the bag so you

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.500 
will claw the hub of the bag so you
better<00:02:50.340> chance<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.760> having<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:51.060> nice<00:02:51.180> clean

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
better chance of having a nice clean

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.150 
better chance of having a nice clean

than trying to save and publish
something<00:03:37.799> all<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.129> them<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.549> think<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.120> works

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
something all of them I think it works

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.960 
something all of them I think it works
out<00:03:39.480> better<00:03:39.750> when<00:03:40.019> you<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:41.099> did<00:03:41.280> with<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.609> the

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
out better when you you did with it the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.470 
out better when you you did with it the
natural<00:03:42.329> figure<00:03:42.599> itself<00:03:43.700> I'll<00:03:44.700> try<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.060> overly

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
natural figure itself I'll try to overly

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.929 
natural figure itself I'll try to overly
manipulate<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.109> so<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:47.400> think<00:03:47.489> you're<00:03:47.760> going<00:03:47.849> to

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
manipulate it so I think you're going to

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.470 
manipulate it so I think you're going to
take<00:03:48.060> your<00:03:48.269> we're<00:03:49.019> always<00:03:49.170> trying<00:03:49.439> to<00:03:49.560> improve

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
take your we're always trying to improve

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
take your we're always trying to improve
the<00:03:51.480> figure<00:03:51.750> obviously<00:03:53.239> so<00:03:54.239> it's<00:03:55.170> what<00:03:55.379> you

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
the figure obviously so it's what you

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.140 
the figure obviously so it's what you
feel<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.829> best<00:03:57.889> the<00:03:58.889> client<00:03:59.220> so<00:03:59.370> there<00:04:00.030> are

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
feel is best the client so there are
