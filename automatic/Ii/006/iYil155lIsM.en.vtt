meaty stuff you are essentially Ironman
this<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.150> one<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.480> my<00:00:15.570> favorite<00:00:15.990> parts<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
this is one of my favorite parts of the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.680 
this is one of my favorite parts of the
trailer<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.250> seems<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.699> place<00:00:17.970> something<00:00:18.330> in

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
trailer it seems you place something in

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.570 
trailer it seems you place something in
this<00:00:18.930> wheel<00:00:19.289> kind<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.830> thing<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.220> back<00:00:20.400> of

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
this wheel kind of thing on the back of

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.730 
this wheel kind of thing on the back of
the<00:00:20.670> power<00:00:20.910> armor<00:00:21.359> which<00:00:21.720> causes<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.320> open

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the power armor which causes it to open

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.410 
the power armor which causes it to open
up<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.100> allow<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.580> enter<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.970> I'm

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
up and allow you to enter it I'm

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.060 
up and allow you to enter it I'm
assuming<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.140> your<00:00:25.260> own<00:00:25.380> personal<00:00:25.650> suit

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
assuming this is your own personal suit

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.769 
assuming this is your own personal suit
of<00:00:26.189> armor<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.760> accessed<00:00:27.210> by<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.599> little

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
of armor that is accessed by that little

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.720 
of armor that is accessed by that little
battery<00:00:28.349> looking<00:00:28.769> thing<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.220> seems<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.550> act

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
battery looking thing that seems to act

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.560 
battery looking thing that seems to act
like<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> key

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
like a key

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.479 
like a key
you<00:00:30.900> know<00:00:31.019> how<00:00:31.230> exactly<00:00:31.769> how<00:00:31.949> you'd<00:00:32.099> access<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
you know how exactly how you'd access a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.819 
you know how exactly how you'd access a
car<00:00:32.790> or<00:00:33.239> perhaps<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.930> power<00:00:34.170> device<00:00:34.380> that

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
car or perhaps it's a power device that

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.440 
car or perhaps it's a power device that
makes<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.190> power<00:00:35.340> armor<00:00:35.610> function<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
makes the power armor function so it

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.319 
makes the power armor function so it
opens<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.649> tell<00:00:37.980> us<00:00:38.100> what<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.460> think<00:00:38.730> now

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
opens so you tell us what you think now

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.850 
opens so you tell us what you think now
once<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.660> were<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.780> these<00:00:40.050> beasts<00:00:40.410> looking

once you were in these beasts looking
power<00:00:41.040> armor<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.730> notice<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.270> heads-up

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
power armor you can notice the heads-up

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.779 
power armor you can notice the heads-up
display<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.200> HUD<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.950> different<00:00:44.610> the

display or HUD is different the
aesthetic<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.480> quite<00:00:45.719> different<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.530> it

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
aesthetic is quite different but it

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.990 
aesthetic is quite different but it
still<00:00:46.890> displays<00:00:47.039> health

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
still displays health

Rad's action points ammo the compass end
what<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.829> new<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.610> meter<00:00:53.969> called<00:00:54.420> core

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
what is new is this meter called core

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.810 
what is new is this meter called core
which<00:00:55.620> could<00:00:55.829> support<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> idea<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
which could support the idea that the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.430 
which could support the idea that the
thing<00:00:57.059> plugged<00:00:57.390> into<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> back<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> power

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
thing plugged into the back of the power

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.229 
thing plugged into the back of the power
armor<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.920> what<00:00:59.100> powers<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.879> that's

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
armor is what powers it and that's

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.479 
armor is what powers it and that's
measured<00:01:00.480> by<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.840> little<00:01:01.140> core<00:01:01.559> level<00:01:01.980> which

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
measured by this little core level which

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.759 
measured by this little core level which
means<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.120> could<00:01:03.390> need<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.690> recharge<00:01:04.379> these

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
means you could need to recharge these

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.859 
means you could need to recharge these
little<00:01:05.070> cores<00:01:05.369> or<00:01:05.700> find<00:01:06.090> more<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.570> continue

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
little cores or find more to continue

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.870 
little cores or find more to continue
using<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.409> power<00:01:07.650> armor<00:01:07.979> once<00:01:08.549> again<00:01:08.760> I'll

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
using the power armor once again I'll

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.179 
using the power armor once again I'll
remind<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.600> only<00:01:09.810> speculation<00:01:10.590> it

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
remind you this is only speculation it

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.890 
remind you this is only speculation it
also<00:01:11.369> shows<00:01:11.790> what<00:01:11.820> looks<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.330> condition

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
also shows what looks like a condition

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.690 
also shows what looks like a condition
meter<00:01:13.110> measuring<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> durability<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.400> each

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
meter measuring the durability of each

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.120 
meter measuring the durability of each
piece<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> armor<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> left<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.770> maybe<00:01:16.920> it

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
piece of armor on the left so maybe it

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.160 
piece of armor on the left so maybe it
can<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.280> broken<00:01:17.549> down<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.060> damaged<00:01:18.450> as<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:19.020> can

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
can be broken down and damaged as we can

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.690 
can be broken down and damaged as we can
see<00:01:19.350> here<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.799> rocket<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.280> shot<00:01:20.520> at<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
see here this rocket is shot at a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.940 
see here this rocket is shot at a
brotherhood<00:01:21.150> initiate<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.810> pieces<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.590> power

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
brotherhood initiate and pieces of power

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.340 
brotherhood initiate and pieces of power
armor<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.490> seen<00:01:23.670> flying<00:01:24.119> off<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.780> perhaps<00:01:24.990> this

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
armor as seen flying off so perhaps this

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.840 
armor as seen flying off so perhaps this
could<00:01:25.500> happen<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.430> were<00:01:26.490> damaged

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
could happen to you if you were damaged

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.640 
could happen to you if you were damaged
too<00:01:27.060> much<00:01:27.270> also<00:01:27.630> power<00:01:27.990> armor<00:01:28.290> seems<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.560> be

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
too much also power armor seems to be

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.950 
too much also power armor seems to be
bigger<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> game<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.850> lot<00:01:30.119> taller<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.689> lot

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
bigger in the game a lot taller a lot

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.080 
bigger in the game a lot taller a lot
bulkier<00:01:31.409> which<00:01:31.650> i<00:01:31.770> think<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.130> awesome<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.700> like

into a big powerful suit rather than

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.990 
into a big powerful suit rather than
just<00:01:36.540> wearing<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.049> as<00:01:37.200> an<00:01:37.380> armor<00:01:37.740> choice<00:01:38.040> now

we can also see LED plating an explosive
shielding<00:02:10.349> which<00:02:10.440> would<00:02:10.590> imply<00:02:10.800> some<00:02:11.160> sort<00:02:11.190> of

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
shielding which would imply some sort of

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.970 
shielding which would imply some sort of
resistance<00:02:11.849> benefit<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.440> customers

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
resistance benefit so the customers

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.580 
resistance benefit so the customers
seems<00:02:14.370> quite<00:02:14.640> expansive<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.840> expansive<00:02:16.470> in

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
seems quite expansive so expansive in

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.710 
seems quite expansive so expansive in
fact<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.310> can<00:02:17.489> equip<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:18.000> fucking

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
fact that you can equip a fucking

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.589 
fact that you can equip a fucking
jetpack<00:02:19.409> to<00:02:19.769> your<00:02:19.920> power<00:02:20.159> armor<00:02:20.459> as<00:02:20.730> we<00:02:21.330> see

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
jetpack to your power armor as we see

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.229 
jetpack to your power armor as we see
this<00:02:21.750> monster<00:02:22.500> jumps<00:02:22.920> off<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.190> roof<00:02:23.430> uses<00:02:24.120> his

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
this monster jumps off a roof uses his

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.509 
this monster jumps off a roof uses his
jetpack<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.019> then<00:02:25.110> slams<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.040> ground<00:02:26.310> and

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
jetpack and then slams to the ground and

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.850 
jetpack and then slams to the ground and
continues<00:02:27.030> fighting<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.599> badass<00:02:27.900> the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
continues fighting like a badass the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.559 
continues fighting like a badass the
jetpack<00:02:29.250> also<00:02:29.580> seems<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.909> drain<00:02:30.209> action

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
jetpack also seems to drain action

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.630 
jetpack also seems to drain action
points<00:02:30.900> like<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.290> sprinting<00:02:31.739> function<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.519> it

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
points like the sprinting function so it

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.100 
points like the sprinting function so it
seems<00:02:32.910> like<00:02:33.120> there<00:02:33.299> will<00:02:33.360> be<00:02:33.420> functional

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
seems like there will be functional

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.630 
seems like there will be functional
upgrades<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.709> actually<00:02:35.160> change<00:02:35.459> the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
upgrades that actually change the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.910 
upgrades that actually change the
gameplay<00:02:35.879> when<00:02:36.330> in<00:02:36.480> armor<00:02:36.959> another<00:02:37.650> small

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
gameplay when in armor another small

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.530 
gameplay when in armor another small
example<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.580> light<00:02:38.819> attached<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.239> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
example is the light attached to the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.630 
example is the light attached to the
helmet<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:40.049> this<00:02:40.290> scene<00:02:40.560> I'm<00:02:40.950> super<00:02:41.519> happy

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
helmet in this scene I'm super happy

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.550 
helmet in this scene I'm super happy
about<00:02:41.819> this<00:02:42.090> new<00:02:42.150> approach<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.660> power<00:02:43.049> armor<00:02:43.409> I

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
about this new approach to power armor I

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.199 
about this new approach to power armor I
like<00:02:44.129> how<00:02:44.280> you're<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.640> just<00:02:44.940> your<00:02:45.030> normal

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
like how you're in just your normal

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.059 
like how you're in just your normal
clothes<00:02:45.569> armor<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.170> just<00:02:46.319> jump<00:02:46.680> into<00:02:46.860> your

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
clothes armor and just jump into your

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.759 
clothes armor and just jump into your
giant<00:02:47.400> mech<00:02:47.610> suit<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.090> looks<00:02:48.420> super<00:02:48.750> dope<00:02:49.230> this

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
giant mech suit it looks super dope this

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.770 
giant mech suit it looks super dope this
also<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.370> me<00:02:50.670> would<00:02:50.849> make<00:02:51.030> enemies<00:02:51.450> in<00:02:51.599> power

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
also to me would make enemies in power

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.630 
also to me would make enemies in power
armor<00:02:52.079> more<00:02:52.379> intimidating<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.129> hopefully

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
armor more intimidating and hopefully

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.670 
armor more intimidating and hopefully
tough<00:02:53.879> to<00:02:54.060> fight<00:02:54.299> another<00:02:54.989> brief<00:02:55.290> thing<00:02:55.560> we

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
tough to fight another brief thing we

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.500 
tough to fight another brief thing we
also<00:02:55.829> see<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:56.400> rate<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.849> veteran<00:02:57.209> wearing

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
also see this rate of veteran wearing

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.180 
also see this rate of veteran wearing
power<00:02:57.750> armor<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.319> perhaps<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:58.920> Raider

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
power armor and perhaps this Raider

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.099 
power armor and perhaps this Raider
psycho<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.790> also<00:03:00.150> wearing<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.510> type<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.720> power

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
psycho is also wearing a type of power

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.990 
psycho is also wearing a type of power
armor<00:03:01.379> this<00:03:01.650> would<00:03:01.829> explain<00:03:02.190> his<00:03:02.489> really<00:03:02.970> big

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
armor this would explain his really big

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.839 
armor this would explain his really big
size<00:03:03.480> so<00:03:04.349> maybe<00:03:04.560> power<00:03:04.859> armor<00:03:05.220> isn't<00:03:05.400> just<00:03:05.790> in

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
size so maybe power armor isn't just in

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.490 
size so maybe power armor isn't just in
the<00:03:05.910> hands<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.269> Brotherhood<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.200> truly
