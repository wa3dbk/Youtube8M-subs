piece for and I think I come to the
point<00:01:19.619> where<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> only<00:01:20.130> way<00:01:20.249> I<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.490> answer

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729

that<00:01:20.969> one<00:01:21.119> question<00:01:21.209> that<00:01:21.740> properly<00:01:22.740> was

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that one question that properly was

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.129 
that one question that properly was
through<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.520> speech<00:01:23.729> again<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.719> toy<00:01:24.899> to<00:01:25.109> a

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:25.139 
through a speech again in a toy to a

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:27.559 
through a speech again in a toy to a
register<00:01:25.649> the<00:01:26.399> picture<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.789> the<00:01:26.880> smoke<00:01:27.090> rising

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
it just reminds me of a certain moment

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.179 
it just reminds me of a certain moment
of<00:01:30.329> confrontation<00:01:30.600> I'm<00:01:31.200> lost<00:01:31.529> all<00:01:32.100> these

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
of confrontation I'm lost all these

was<00:01:36.810> much<00:01:36.959> more<00:01:37.139> like<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.349> conversational

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
was much more like a conversational

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.160 
was much more like a conversational
piece<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.909> was<00:01:39.149> one<00:01:39.420> take<00:01:39.689> there<00:01:39.899> was<00:01:40.020> no

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
piece it was one take there was no

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.569 
piece it was one take there was no
script<00:01:40.409> there<00:01:40.709> was<00:01:40.829> not<00:01:40.979> much<00:01:41.130> editing

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
script there was not much editing

afterwards<00:01:41.969> either<00:01:42.209> it<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.569> more<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:42.899> less<00:01:42.929> a

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
afterwards either it was more or less a

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.440 
afterwards either it was more or less a
piece<00:01:44.039> without<00:01:44.429> an<00:01:44.549> audience<00:01:44.700> without<00:01:45.119> that

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
piece without an audience without that

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.370 
piece without an audience without that
live<00:01:45.689> aspect<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:47.689> felt<00:01:48.689> very<00:01:48.869> much<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.139> I

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
live aspect I felt very much that I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.859 
live aspect I felt very much that I
needed<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.889> disembody<00:01:50.669> myself<00:01:51.209> in<00:01:51.479> terms<00:01:51.689> of

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
needed to disembody myself in terms of

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.599 
needed to disembody myself in terms of
that<00:01:51.990> sense<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.499> voice<00:01:52.709> on<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.399> body

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
that sense of the voice on the body

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.389 
that sense of the voice on the body
being<00:01:53.969> there<00:01:54.270> live<00:01:54.929> performing<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.219> by

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
being there live performing and by

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.069 
being there live performing and by
making<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:56.849> work<00:01:57.060> PostScript<00:01:57.599> it<00:01:57.719> was<00:01:57.810> also

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
making this work PostScript it was also

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
making this work PostScript it was also
a<00:01:58.109> sense<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.529> saying<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.130> voice<00:01:59.310> belongs<00:01:59.579> with

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
a sense of saying the voice belongs with

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.429 
a sense of saying the voice belongs with
the<00:01:59.939> body's<00:02:00.240> gone<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.509> can't<00:02:00.869> perform<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.319> that

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the body's gone I can't perform in that

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.169 
the body's gone I can't perform in that
way<00:02:01.590> live<00:02:02.039> to<00:02:02.219> an<00:02:02.310> audience<00:02:02.609> to<00:02:02.789> hold<00:02:02.969> all<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
way live to an audience to hold all the

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.800 
way live to an audience to hold all the
elements<00:02:03.509> together

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.850 

I<00:02:07.780> think<00:02:09.280> presence<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:11.450> it's<00:02:12.319> something<00:02:12.740> that

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
I think presence is it's something that

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.740 
I think presence is it's something that
I'm<00:02:12.950> only<00:02:13.160> coming<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.670> terms<00:02:13.850> with<00:02:14.000> now<00:02:14.330> now

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
I'm only coming to terms with now now

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.020 
I'm only coming to terms with now now
that<00:02:14.930> I'm<00:02:15.050> performing<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.800> lot<00:02:15.920> less<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.459> there

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
that I'm performing a lot less and there

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.780 
that I'm performing a lot less and there
are<00:02:17.180> elements<00:02:17.959> components<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.280> have<00:02:19.520> that

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
are elements components that I have that

are elements components that I have that
come<00:02:20.090> together<00:02:20.270> during<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.840> install<00:02:21.140> phase

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
come together during the install phase

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.080 
come together during the install phase
so<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.190> sense<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.489> presence<00:02:22.760> of

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
so that sense of presence of

is<00:02:25.760> important<00:02:26.180> for<00:02:26.300> me<00:02:26.450> in<00:02:27.020> order<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.440> kind<00:02:27.560> of

is important for me in order to kind of

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.190 
is important for me in order to kind of
maintain<00:02:27.920> our<00:02:28.370> logic<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:28.940> inner<00:02:29.150> logic<00:02:29.330> to

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
maintain our logic and inner logic to

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.660 
maintain our logic and inner logic to
bring<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:30.530> all<00:02:30.650> together<00:02:35.860> there<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:37.010> like<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.370> a

recycling lots of old images from the

15<00:02:47.390> years<00:02:47.980> predating<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.070> works<00:02:49.280> existence

15 years predating the works existence

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.140 
15 years predating the works existence
or<00:02:50.650> trying<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.680> like<00:02:51.920> discovering<00:02:52.880> them<00:02:53.120> I

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
or trying to like discovering them I

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.790 
or trying to like discovering them I
think<00:02:53.330> it's<00:02:53.540> also<00:02:53.690> about<00:02:53.870> discovering<00:02:54.650> the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
think it's also about discovering the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.309 
think it's also about discovering the
images<00:02:55.100> that<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.280> have<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.850> my<00:02:56.060> archive<00:02:59.319> working

images that I have in my archive working
with<00:03:00.410> this<00:03:00.560> fragile<00:03:00.950> technology<00:03:01.940> that

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
with this fragile technology that

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.570 
with this fragile technology that
freedom<00:03:02.989> of<00:03:03.110> continuously<00:03:03.590> shifting<00:03:04.430> and

freedom of continuously shifting and
changing<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:05.360> work<00:03:05.600> it's<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.650> massive

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
changing the work it's a massive

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.210 
changing the work it's a massive
advantage<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.989> it's<00:03:09.620> also<00:03:09.769> how<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:09.950> work<00:03:10.190> with

advantage and it's also how I work with

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.100 
advantage and it's also how I work with
speech<00:03:10.579> and<00:03:10.790> performing<00:03:11.299> there<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:11.900> kind

speech and performing there is this kind

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.380 
speech and performing there is this kind
