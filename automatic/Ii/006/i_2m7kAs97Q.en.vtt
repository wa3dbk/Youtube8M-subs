animated a long time ago but i was

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.490 
animated a long time ago but i was
impressed<00:00:33.210> at<00:00:33.510> how<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.660> didn't<00:00:34.110> really<00:00:34.230> notice

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
impressed at how I didn't really notice

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.229 
impressed at how I didn't really notice
that<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.829> was<00:00:34.920> done<00:00:35.100> by<00:00:35.250> another<00:00:35.370> studio<00:00:35.820> but

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
that it was done by another studio but

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.610 
that it was done by another studio but
then<00:00:36.360> again<00:00:36.450> my<00:00:36.660> memories<00:00:36.960> not<00:00:37.170> really<00:00:37.440> that

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
then again my memories not really that

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.139 
then again my memories not really that
good<00:00:37.890> because<00:00:38.190> i<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:38.579> i<00:00:38.700> watch<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> fur

I seem like I don't know a lot about the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.440 
I seem like I don't know a lot about the
series<00:00:43.829> as<00:00:43.980> much<00:00:44.010> as<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.700> rest<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.180> who

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
oh dear now usually sequels are really

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.150 
oh dear now usually sequels are really
really<00:00:54.719> bad<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.739> wasn't<00:00:56.039> really

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
really bad and so I wasn't really

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.950 
really bad and so I wasn't really
expecting<00:00:56.309> much<00:00:56.699> from<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.180> gun<00:00:57.420> chicken<00:00:57.690> but

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
expecting much from this gun chicken but

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.510 
expecting much from this gun chicken but
i<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.109> i<00:00:58.289> was<00:00:58.410> pleasantly<00:00:58.649> surprised

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
i think i was pleasantly surprised

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.369 
i think i was pleasantly surprised
especially<00:00:59.940> with<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> facts<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:00.960> i<00:01:01.079> skimmed

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
again kind of centered more around the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.910 
again kind of centered more around the
female<00:01:03.420> animation<00:01:04.019> more<00:01:04.439> than<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> male

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
female animation more than the male

mm-hmm<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.409> then<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> came<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.159> conclusion

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
mm-hmm and then I came to the conclusion

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.719 
mm-hmm and then I came to the conclusion
that<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.390> don't<00:01:33.720> do<00:01:34.020> pairings<00:01:34.740> at<00:01:35.130> all<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that I just don't do pairings at all and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.460 
that I just don't do pairings at all and
I<00:01:35.880> think<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.240> me<00:01:36.270> i'm<00:01:36.570> more<00:01:36.780> into<00:01:37.020> kind<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
I think for me i'm more into kind of the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.200 
I think for me i'm more into kind of the
creation<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> all<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.700> how<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.880> was<00:01:38.970> all

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
creation of it all and how it was all

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.760 
creation of it all and how it was all
put<00:01:39.360> together<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.750> how<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.530> put<00:01:40.680> it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
put together and how they put it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.499 
put together and how they put it
together<00:01:40.890> anyway<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.759> realized<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.270> guess

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
together anyway so I realized that guess

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.819 
together anyway so I realized that guess
you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.810> kind<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.020> make<00:01:43.140> me<00:01:43.259> think<00:01:43.409> about<00:01:43.560> my

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
you can kind of make me think about my

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.880 
you can kind of make me think about my
own<00:01:43.860> kind<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.640> anime<00:01:45.390> fan<00:01:45.659> identity<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.860> I

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
own kind of anime fan identity what I

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.410 
own kind of anime fan identity what I
liked<00:01:47.159> about<00:01:47.250> good<00:01:47.579> skin<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.149> there<00:01:48.329> were

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
different levels of interests some more

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.670 
different levels of interests some more
extreme<00:01:51.090> than<00:01:51.210> others<00:01:51.360> some<00:01:51.960> more<00:01:52.200> hilarious

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
extreme than others some more hilarious

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.130 
extreme than others some more hilarious
than<00:01:53.009> others<00:01:53.490> which<00:01:53.820> brings<00:01:54.090> me<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.360> kuchiki<00:01:54.930> I

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
really loved him mainly because he was

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.289 
really loved him mainly because he was
very<00:01:58.439> reminiscent<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.310> guess<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.939> know<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.180> was

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
very reminiscent I guess you know it was

here

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.100 
here
nobody<00:02:12.260> talks<00:02:12.710> to<00:02:12.980> him<00:02:13.430> but<00:02:14.090> we<00:02:14.330> invite<00:02:14.780> him

nobody talks to him but we invite him
anyways<00:02:15.350> I<00:02:16.250> guess<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:16.760> just<00:02:16.790> kind<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.240> adds

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
anyways I guess it just kind of adds

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.960 
anyways I guess it just kind of adds
color<00:02:17.960> to<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.500> group<00:02:18.710> me<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.550> being<00:02:19.790> racist

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
color to the group me of being racist

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.970 
color to the group me of being racist
again<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.690> also<00:02:20.840> like<00:02:21.110> most<00:02:21.380> of<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.620> character

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
again I also like most of the character

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.530 
again I also like most of the character
development<00:02:22.430> specifically<00:02:23.180> how<00:02:23.420> they

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
development specifically how they

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.450 
development specifically how they
changed<00:02:23.960> in<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.110> lot<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.470> their<00:02:24.650> views<00:02:24.980> from<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
changed in a lot of their views from the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.280 
changed in a lot of their views from the
beginning<00:02:25.880> of<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.060> season<00:02:26.240> to<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.600> end<00:02:26.630> at

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
beginning of the season to the end at

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.930 
beginning of the season to the end at
first<00:02:27.560> yeah<00:02:27.800> Jima<00:02:28.100> was<00:02:28.130> really<00:02:28.610> taken<00:02:28.880> aback

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
first yeah Jima was really taken aback

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.449 
first yeah Jima was really taken aback
about<00:02:29.540> huddles<00:02:30.020> cross<00:02:30.440> dressing<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.130> I<00:02:31.310> don't

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
about huddles cross dressing and I don't

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.740 
about huddles cross dressing and I don't
even<00:02:31.520> know<00:02:31.730> across<00:02:31.940> Justin<00:02:32.360> was<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.570> word

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
even know across Justin was the word

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.030 
even know across Justin was the word
because<00:02:33.080> they<00:02:33.170> didn't<00:02:33.320> really<00:02:33.410> confirm<00:02:33.830> in

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
because they didn't really confirm in

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.130 
because they didn't really confirm in
the<00:02:34.130> series<00:02:34.430> alone<00:02:34.670> if<00:02:34.850> he<00:02:34.910> was<00:02:35.690> simply<00:02:36.020> a

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
the series alone if he was simply a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.350 
the series alone if he was simply a
crossdresser<00:02:36.830> or<00:02:36.860> if<00:02:37.190> he<00:02:37.280> was<00:02:37.370> transgender<00:02:37.790> or

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
crossdresser or if he was transgender or

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.030 
crossdresser or if he was transgender or
maybe<00:02:38.990> he<00:02:39.170> was<00:02:39.200> still<00:02:39.440> trying<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.709> figure<00:02:39.830> it

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
maybe he was still trying to figure it

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.500 
maybe he was still trying to figure it
out<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.400> really<00:02:40.670> like<00:02:40.850> tell<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.209> team<00:02:41.420> up

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
that hot occurred was the way that she

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
more to it and I was a little

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.900 
more to it and I was a little
comfortable<00:02:49.220> however<00:02:49.580> they're<00:02:49.730> always

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
comfortable however they're always

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.210 
comfortable however they're always
trying<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.300> peek<00:02:50.420> at<00:02:50.570> Hutto<00:02:50.780> coons<00:02:51.110> stuff<00:02:51.770> it's

trying to peek at Hutto coons stuff it's

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.550 
trying to peek at Hutto coons stuff it's
not<00:02:52.580> sexual<00:02:52.910> assault<00:02:53.450> it's<00:02:53.660> just<00:02:53.959> shenanigans

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
not sexual assault it's just shenanigans

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.500 
not sexual assault it's just shenanigans
and<00:02:54.860> they<00:02:55.100> did<00:02:55.310> feel<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.060> series<00:02:56.390> was

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
and they did feel that the series was

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.120 
and they did feel that the series was
kind<00:02:56.780> of<00:02:56.810> centered<00:02:57.230> around<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.680> hut<00:02:57.830> hakuna

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
kind of centered around the hut hakuna

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.770 
kind of centered around the hut hakuna
and<00:02:58.370> mother<00:02:58.700> loved<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.300> was<00:02:59.510> really

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
and mother loved it I was really

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.600 
and mother loved it I was really
surprised<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.410> transgender<00:03:01.070> was<00:03:01.220> kind<00:03:01.489> of

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
surprised that a transgender was kind of

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.160 
surprised that a transgender was kind of
the<00:03:01.730> main<00:03:01.910> character<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.600> series<00:03:02.750> and

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
the main character in the series and

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.930 
the main character in the series and
also<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.590> think<00:03:03.739> I've<00:03:04.040> really<00:03:04.340> fallen<00:03:04.489> in<00:03:04.730> love

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
also I think I've really fallen in love

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.670 
also I think I've really fallen in love
with<00:03:05.090> mother<00:03:05.360> damas<00:03:05.720> character<00:03:06.290> because<00:03:06.590> I

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
with mother damas character because I

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.080 
with mother damas character because I
felt<00:03:06.920> mother<00:03:07.130> Mneme<00:03:07.430> was<00:03:07.580> beginning<00:03:07.970> to

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
felt mother Mneme was beginning to

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.729 
felt mother Mneme was beginning to
realize<00:03:08.480> at<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.930> end<00:03:08.959> of<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.230> series<00:03:09.410> that<00:03:09.590> he

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
realize at the end of the series that he

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.500 
realize at the end of the series that he
was<00:03:09.830> more<00:03:10.040> of<00:03:10.100> a<00:03:10.190> pansexual<00:03:10.640> than<00:03:11.150> he<00:03:11.300> was<00:03:11.480> a

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
was more of a pansexual than he was a

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.180 
was more of a pansexual than he was a
heterosexual<00:03:12.320> and<00:03:12.590> so<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:12.890> was<00:03:12.950> kind<00:03:13.130> of

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
heterosexual and so it was kind of

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.830 
heterosexual and so it was kind of
really<00:03:13.340> excited<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.060> get<00:03:14.150> some<00:03:14.390> sort<00:03:14.750> of

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
really excited to get some sort of

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.300 
really excited to get some sort of
confirmation<00:03:15.200> on<00:03:15.590> whether<00:03:15.739> or<00:03:15.920> not<00:03:16.070> he<00:03:16.280> was

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
confirmation on whether or not he was

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.310 
confirmation on whether or not he was
pansexual<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.120> whether<00:03:17.630> or<00:03:17.720> not<00:03:17.870> had<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.110> goon

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
pansexual and whether or not had a goon

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.229 
pansexual and whether or not had a goon

lines<00:03:41.120> were<00:03:41.420> rather<00:03:41.630> really<00:03:42.049> short<00:03:42.350> her

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860

Japanese<00:03:43.340> was<00:03:43.489> actually<00:03:43.970> not<00:03:44.150> bad<00:03:44.329> at<00:03:44.510> all<00:03:44.630> I

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
Japanese was actually not bad at all I

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.690 
Japanese was actually not bad at all I
think<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.320> voice<00:03:45.470> actress<00:03:46.010> tried<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.430> kind<00:03:46.579> of

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
think the voice actress tried to kind of

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.430 
think the voice actress tried to kind of
slow<00:03:46.970> down<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.360> Japanese<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.840> little<00:03:48.170> bit<00:03:48.290> and

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
slow down the Japanese a little bit and

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.840 
slow down the Japanese a little bit and
to<00:03:48.620> make<00:03:48.769> it<00:03:48.799> sound<00:03:49.160> a<00:03:49.400> little<00:03:49.519> bit<00:03:49.700> more

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
to make it sound a little bit more

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.580 
to make it sound a little bit more
primitive<00:03:50.180> she<00:03:50.720> was<00:03:50.840> nothing<00:03:51.019> like<00:03:51.170> that<00:03:51.380> big

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
primitive she was nothing like that big

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.380 
primitive she was nothing like that big
Russian<00:03:51.920> guy<00:03:52.070> and<00:03:52.250> do<00:03:52.340> nada<00:03:52.459> anyway<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:53.209> was

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
Russian guy and do nada anyway I was

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.120 
Russian guy and do nada anyway I was
really<00:03:53.660> expecting<00:03:53.840> this<00:03:54.200> stupid<00:03:54.530> betrayal<00:03:54.980> of

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
really expecting this stupid betrayal of

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.280 
really expecting this stupid betrayal of
a<00:03:55.370> foreigner<00:03:55.820> in<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.150> club<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.690> because<00:03:57.140> she

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
a foreigner in the club and because she

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.259 
a foreigner in the club and because she
wasn't<00:03:57.470> so<00:03:57.769> articulate<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:58.579> guess<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.120> can

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
wasn't so articulate I guess you can

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.150 
wasn't so articulate I guess you can
kind<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.570> argue<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.110> she<00:04:00.320> was<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.590> little<00:04:00.860> bit

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
kind of argue that she was a little bit

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.800 
kind of argue that she was a little bit
stupid<00:04:01.459> but<00:04:01.700> I<00:04:02.180> don't<00:04:02.329> really<00:04:02.420> agree<00:04:02.720> with

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
stupid but I don't really agree with

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.090 
stupid but I don't really agree with
that<00:04:02.930> because<00:04:03.170> she<00:04:03.440> had<00:04:03.590> really<00:04:03.890> solid

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
that because she had really solid

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.770 
that because she had really solid
relationships<00:04:04.910> with<00:04:05.150> a<00:04:05.180> lot<00:04:05.269> of<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.600> members

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
relationships with a lot of the members

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.410 
relationships with a lot of the members
for<00:04:06.440> example<00:04:06.829> she<00:04:06.950> genuinely<00:04:07.280> cared<00:04:08.060> about<00:04:08.269> a

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
for example she genuinely cared about a

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.120 
for example she genuinely cared about a
lot<00:04:08.750> of<00:04:08.780> their<00:04:09.049> situations<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:09.860> a<00:04:09.950> lot<00:04:10.100> of
