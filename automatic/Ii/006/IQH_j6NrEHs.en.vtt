might be able to get a little better but

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.460 
might be able to get a little better but
but<00:02:38.360> he<00:02:38.450> can't<00:02:38.660> hold<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.960> as<00:02:39.050> an<00:02:39.140> underslung

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
but he can't hold it as an underslung

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.590 
but he can't hold it as an underslung

dreadwing<00:03:19.760> because<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:20.810> really<00:03:21.080> do<00:03:21.200> think<00:03:21.410> I

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
dreadwing because I really do think I

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.250 
dreadwing because I really do think I
prefer<00:03:21.770> these<00:03:21.950> colors<00:03:22.250> on<00:03:22.430> him<00:03:22.959> more<00:03:23.959> than<00:03:24.170> the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
prefer these colors on him more than the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.690 
prefer these colors on him more than the
blue<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:24.530> yellow<00:03:24.860> although<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.280> really<00:03:25.520> like

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
blue and yellow although I really like

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.199 
blue and yellow although I really like
dreadwing<00:03:25.910> as<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> character<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:26.690> it<00:03:26.780> evens<00:03:27.170> out

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
dreadwing as a character so it evens out

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.490 
dreadwing as a character so it evens out
yeah<00:03:29.209> I<00:03:29.270> really<00:03:29.450> like<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.690> that<00:03:30.110> Gatlin<00:03:30.470> gun
