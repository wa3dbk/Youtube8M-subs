00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
you can be a computer scientist and

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.179 
you can be a computer scientist and
dance<00:02:47.629> you<00:02:48.319> can<00:02:48.439> be<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.530> computer<00:02:48.709> scientist<00:02:49.069> to

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:49.189 
dance you can be a computer scientist to

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.099

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.470 
scientist and do international
development<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:52.819> I<00:02:52.849> think<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.150> was<00:02:53.299> what

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
development and I think that was what

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.509 
development and I think that was what
was<00:02:53.599> so<00:02:53.629> powerful<00:02:53.810> about<00:02:54.379> today's<00:02:54.709> message<00:02:54.950> so

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
was so powerful about today's message so

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.909 
was so powerful about today's message so
he<00:02:55.639> went<00:02:55.849> around<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.419> scouted<00:02:56.870> super<00:02:57.709> rock

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:57.919 
he went around and scouted super rock

have<00:03:13.519> been<00:03:13.579> like<00:03:13.669> of<00:03:13.939> a<00:03:14.000> program<00:03:14.419> like<00:03:14.450> this

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
have been like of a program like this

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.539 
have been like of a program like this
that<00:03:14.959> existed<00:03:15.409> when<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.709> were<00:03:15.829> seven<00:03:16.340> or

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
that existed when you were seven or

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.089 
that existed when you were seven or
eight<00:03:16.729> or<00:03:16.940> nine<00:03:17.229> could<00:03:18.229> have<00:03:18.349> been<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:18.859> much

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
eight or nine could have been a much

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.520 
eight or nine could have been a much
happier<00:03:19.280> girl<00:03:19.900> because<00:03:20.900> when<00:03:21.019> I<00:03:21.079> was<00:03:21.260> younger

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
happier girl because when I was younger

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.259 
happier girl because when I was younger
I<00:03:21.680> mean<00:03:21.859> it<00:03:21.979> wasn't<00:03:22.159> something<00:03:22.790> that<00:03:22.970> people

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
I mean it wasn't something that people

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.719 
I mean it wasn't something that people
did<00:03:23.449> I<00:03:23.479> was<00:03:24.019> kind<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:24.829> a<00:03:24.919> loner<00:03:25.159> because<00:03:25.639> I

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:25.729 
did I was kind of a loner because I

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:27.399 
did I was kind of a loner because I
wanted<00:03:25.909> to<00:03:25.970> write<00:03:26.090> code<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:26.389> no<00:03:26.629> one<00:03:26.780> around

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
wanted to write code and no one around

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.020 
wanted to write code and no one around
me<00:03:27.590> really<00:03:27.709> understood<00:03:28.159> what<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.430> was<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.970> it

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
me really understood what it was and it

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.569 
me really understood what it was and it
was<00:03:29.060> pretty<00:03:29.299> new<00:03:29.629> so<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:30.349> had<00:03:31.069> a<00:03:31.099> program<00:03:31.459> like

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
was pretty new so I had a program like

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.490 
was pretty new so I had a program like
this<00:03:31.729> would<00:03:31.879> have<00:03:31.970> been<00:03:32.060> incredible<00:03:32.659> a<00:03:32.959> lot<00:03:33.409> of

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
this would have been incredible a lot of

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.449 
this would have been incredible a lot of
the<00:03:33.560> people<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:33.889> I've<00:03:33.979> talked<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.340> have<00:03:34.430> said

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
the people that I've talked to have said

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.770 
the people that I've talked to have said
the<00:03:34.729> kind<00:03:34.939> of<00:03:35.030> difference<00:03:35.449> that<00:03:35.510> they<00:03:35.720> see

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
the kind of difference that they see

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.569 
the kind of difference that they see
between<00:03:36.349> girls<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.829> boys<00:03:36.919> and<00:03:37.340> this<00:03:37.400> is

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
between girls and boys and this is

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.129 
between girls and boys and this is
somewhat<00:03:37.879> reflected<00:03:38.359> in<00:03:38.449> the<00:03:38.540> research<00:03:38.870> is

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
somewhat reflected in the research is

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.129 
somewhat reflected in the research is
that<00:03:39.169> like<00:03:39.470> girls<00:03:40.310> really<00:03:41.299> want<00:03:41.509> like<00:03:41.689> to<00:03:41.900> see

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
that like girls really want like to see

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.229 
that like girls really want like to see
an<00:03:42.229> end<00:03:42.470> product<00:03:42.829> and<00:03:43.220> so<00:03:43.400> coding<00:03:43.819> isn't<00:03:44.120> so

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
an end product and so coding isn't so

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.819 
an end product and so coding isn't so
much<00:03:44.299> about<00:03:44.389> solving<00:03:44.930> problems<00:03:44.989> for<00:03:45.530> them

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
much about solving problems for them

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.409 
much about solving problems for them
whereas<00:03:46.159> guys<00:03:46.340> really<00:03:46.759> like<00:03:46.939> the<00:03:47.120> actual

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
whereas guys really like the actual

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:48.849 
whereas guys really like the actual
problem<00:03:47.840> solving<00:03:48.259> piece<00:03:48.439> of<00:03:48.620> it<00:03:48.739> not

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
problem solving piece of it not

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.069 
problem solving piece of it not
necessarily<00:03:48.919> the<00:03:49.549> end<00:03:49.579> product<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.359> mean<00:03:50.810> like

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
necessarily the end product I mean like

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.170 
necessarily the end product I mean like
what<00:03:51.530> do<00:03:51.680> you<00:03:51.739> think<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.189> we<00:03:52.340> can<00:03:52.579> do<00:03:52.729> as<00:03:52.970> like

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
what do you think that we can do as like

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.969 
what do you think that we can do as like
people<00:03:53.569> who<00:03:53.689> are<00:03:53.810> maybe<00:03:54.139> older<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.769> in<00:03:54.859> the

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:54.979 
people who are maybe older and in the

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:56.979 
people who are maybe older and in the
industry<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.699> encourage<00:03:56.120> young<00:03:56.359> girls<00:03:56.389> to<00:03:56.840> get

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
industry to encourage young girls to get

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.749 
industry to encourage young girls to get
into<00:03:57.199> coding<00:03:57.530> I<00:03:57.709> think<00:03:58.400> we<00:03:58.489> have<00:03:58.609> to<00:03:58.729> just

00:03:58.749 --> 00:03:58.759 
into coding I think we have to just

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.909 
into coding I think we have to just
relate<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.329> to<00:03:59.359> things<00:03:59.449> I<00:03:59.720> like<00:03:59.930> I'm<00:04:00.590> really

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
relate it to things I like I'm really

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.920 
relate it to things I like I'm really
excited<00:04:01.189> to<00:04:01.400> be<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.549> maker<00:04:01.819> I<00:04:02.150> created<00:04:02.720> an

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
excited to be a maker I created an

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.390 
excited to be a maker I created an
artificial<00:04:03.259> neural<00:04:03.620> network<00:04:04.040> which<00:04:04.250> is<00:04:04.370> a

artificial neural network which is a

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.099 
artificial neural network which is a
