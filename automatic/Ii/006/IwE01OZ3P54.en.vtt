sniping<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:27.029> my<00:00:27.210> thought<00:00:27.480> process<00:00:27.930> on

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
sniping and in my thought process on

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.099 
sniping and in my thought process on
where<00:00:28.380> snipers<00:00:28.859> belong<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:30.510> kind<00:00:31.080> of

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
where snipers belong and it's kind of

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.930 
where snipers belong and it's kind of
weird<00:00:31.500> thought<00:00:31.949> i<00:00:32.189> don't<00:00:32.460> know<00:00:32.550> if<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.850> guys

will agree with me or not i know a lot
of<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.469> guys<00:00:34.559> will<00:00:34.829> probably<00:00:34.890> disagree<00:00:35.489> but

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
of you guys will probably disagree but

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
thought process on where snipers belong

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.619 
thought process on where snipers belong
in<00:00:53.039> call<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.250> duty<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.699> think<00:00:54.059> they<00:00:54.149> belong<00:00:54.390> in

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
in call of duty I think they belong in

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.049 
in call of duty I think they belong in
to<00:00:55.050> game<00:00:55.230> types<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:56.370> guys<00:00:56.520> might<00:00:56.730> think<00:00:56.760> this

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
to game types you guys might think this

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.549 
to game types you guys might think this
is<00:00:57.210> weird<00:00:57.390> or<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.809> don't<00:00:58.020> know<00:00:58.230> I've<00:00:58.530> just

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
is weird or not I don't know I've just

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.650 
is weird or not I don't know I've just
this<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.190> how<00:00:59.340> i<00:00:59.370> was<00:00:59.640> when<00:00:59.760> i<00:01:00.059> watched<00:01:00.300> videos

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
this is how i was when i watched videos

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900 
this is how i was when i watched videos
in<00:01:00.840> model<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.230> two<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.250> where<00:01:02.399> snipers

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
in model for two this is where snipers

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.440 
in model for two this is where snipers
were<00:01:03.090> always<00:01:03.449> at<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:05.210> SMD<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
were always at and it was in SMD and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.929 
were always at and it was in SMD and
free<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.200> all<00:01:07.290> um<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.250> that's<00:01:08.369> that's<00:01:08.760> my

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
free for all um and that's that's my

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.160 
free for all um and that's that's my
personal<00:01:09.240> opinion<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.659> think<00:01:09.689> that's<00:01:10.020> where

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
personal opinion I think that's where

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.289 
personal opinion I think that's where
snipers<00:01:10.560> belongs<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.130> free-for-all<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.640> S&amp;D

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
snipers belongs in free-for-all in S&amp;D

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.450 
snipers belongs in free-for-all in S&amp;D
there's<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.229> lot<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.619> one-on-one

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
there's a lot of one one-on-one

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.230 
there's a lot of one one-on-one
engagements<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.320> in<00:01:16.460> free-for-all<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.490> SMD

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
engagements in in free-for-all and SMD

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.850 
engagements in in free-for-all and SMD
and<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> think<00:01:18.960> that's<00:01:19.140> where<00:01:19.259> snipers<00:01:19.619> are

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and I think that's where snipers are

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.190 
and I think that's where snipers are
supposed<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.460> one-on-one<00:01:20.960> you<00:01:21.960> going

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
supposed to be in one-on-one you going

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.899 
supposed to be in one-on-one you going
against<00:01:22.470> people<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:22.979> gun<00:01:23.460> skill<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.820> it's

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
against people with gun skill and it's

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.010 
against people with gun skill and it's
just<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.119> little<00:01:24.270> one-on-one<00:01:24.509> confrontation

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
just a little one-on-one confrontation

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.170 
just a little one-on-one confrontation
in<00:01:25.710> ground<00:01:25.979> war<00:01:26.220> i<00:01:26.250> don't<00:01:26.520> i<00:01:26.670> don't<00:01:26.790> feel<00:01:27.000> like

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
in ground war i don't i don't feel like

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.600 
in ground war i don't i don't feel like
it's<00:01:27.330> supposed<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.170> there<00:01:28.200> because

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
it's supposed to be in there because

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.580 
it's supposed to be in there because
usually<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.850> these<00:01:29.939> one-on-ones<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.780> FFA<00:01:31.290> and
