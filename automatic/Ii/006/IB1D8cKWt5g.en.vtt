gamers<00:01:06.659> really<00:01:07.350> liked<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.830> G<00:01:07.979> 302<00:01:08.510> but

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
gamers really liked the G 302 but

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.539 
gamers really liked the G 302 but
unfortunately<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.439> sensor<00:01:10.799> was<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.220> fast

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
unfortunately the sensor was not fast

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.429 
unfortunately the sensor was not fast
enough<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.030> keep<00:01:12.210> track<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.689> their<00:01:13.170> fast

enough to keep track of their fast

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.170 
enough to keep track of their fast
movements<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> fix<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.970> problem

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
