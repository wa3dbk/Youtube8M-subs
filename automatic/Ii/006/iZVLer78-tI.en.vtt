00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
abilities before come in and they can

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.749 
abilities before come in and they can
really<00:01:49.500> change<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.950> game<00:01:50.009> depending<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.610> what

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
really change the game depending on what

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.289 
really change the game depending on what
you<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:51.079> download<00:01:52.850> it's<00:01:53.850> really<00:01:54.149> good

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
you get download it's really good

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.609 
because if you can get a Pokemon it has
a<00:01:57.329> weak<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.630> special<00:01:57.960> defense<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> lot

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
damage and then analytic look if you're

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.100 
damage and then analytic look if you're
slower<00:02:05.729> pouring<00:02:06.270> onto<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.630> fairly<00:02:06.810> slow

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
slower pouring onto is a fairly slow

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.559 
slower pouring onto is a fairly slow
Pokemon<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.129> you're<00:02:08.489> slower<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.910> get<00:02:09.090> 30%

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
Pokemon if you're slower you get 30%

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.040 
Pokemon if you're slower you get 30%
more<00:02:10.170> damage

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
okay so all of his abilities are really

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.180 
okay so all of his abilities are really
good<00:02:13.330> I'd<00:02:13.600> recommend<00:02:14.170> analytic<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:14.980> if<00:02:15.100> you

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
good I'd recommend analytic and if you

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.040 
good I'd recommend analytic and if you
do<00:02:15.340> go<00:02:15.520> analytic<00:02:16.000> go<00:02:16.180> with<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.420> sassy<00:02:16.780> nature

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
do go analytic go with the sassy nature

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.650 
do go analytic go with the sassy nature
that<00:02:17.200> way<00:02:17.290> your<00:02:17.440> speed<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.830> even<00:02:18.100> lowered

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
that way your speed is even lowered

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.060 
that way your speed is even lowered
makes<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:20.110> makes<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.350> really<00:02:20.410> strong<00:02:20.830> and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
makes it just makes it really strong and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.820 
makes it just makes it really strong and

to<00:02:39.640> almost<00:02:39.880> any<00:02:40.120> scenario<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.950> we<00:02:42.280> go<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:42.640> look

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
to almost any scenario so we go and look

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.840 
to almost any scenario so we go and look
at<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.120> basic<00:02:44.080> move<00:02:44.230> set<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.430> basic<00:02:45.730> move

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
at the basic move set so the basic move

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.690 
at the basic move set so the basic move
set<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.210> going<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.540> be<00:02:46.690> recover<00:02:47.400> toxic<00:02:48.400> charge

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
set is going to be recover toxic charge

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.480 
set is going to be recover toxic charge
beam<00:02:48.910> psyshock<00:02:49.360> why<00:02:50.140> all<00:02:50.320> these<00:02:50.560> things<00:02:50.890> well

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
beam psyshock why all these things well

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.430 
beam psyshock why all these things well
mostly<00:02:52.000> because<00:02:52.150> when<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:52.930> have<00:02:53.020> a<00:02:53.050> pokemon

mostly because when you have a pokemon

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.020 
mostly because when you have a pokemon
it's<00:02:53.590> this<00:02:53.680> tanking<00:02:54.010> has<00:02:54.190> access<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.640> recover

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
it's this tanking has access to recover

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.940 
it's this tanking has access to recover
that's<00:02:55.870> kind<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.320> best<00:02:56.500> thing<00:02:56.740> that<00:02:56.770> you

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
could have ever so if you look at it

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.170 
could have ever so if you look at it
like<00:03:00.040> this<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.250> know<00:03:00.460> recovery<00:03:00.850> is<00:03:00.910> going<00:03:01.090> to

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180

that's going to be really nice to have
top<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.150> can<00:03:13.270> set<00:03:13.450> up<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.600> toxic<00:03:13.780> stall

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
top of that you can set up a toxic stall

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.350 
top of that you can set up a toxic stall
you<00:03:14.290> know<00:03:14.380> first<00:03:14.620> turn<00:03:14.800> toxic<00:03:15.430> now<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.180> can

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
you know first turn toxic now you can

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.699 
you know first turn toxic now you can
kind<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.570> walk<00:03:16.720> yourself<00:03:16.900> into<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.410> recovery

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
kind of walk yourself into a recovery

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.670 
kind of walk yourself into a recovery
until<00:03:18.100> they<00:03:18.340> eventually<00:03:18.520> whittle<00:03:19.090> away<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:20.470> a

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
until they eventually whittle away so a

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.470 
until they eventually whittle away so a
lot<00:03:21.070> of<00:03:21.100> porygon<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.580> like<00:03:21.790> doing<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.209> and

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
lot of porygon to like doing that and

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.570 
lot of porygon to like doing that and
what<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.110> decided<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.680> do<00:03:23.830> is<00:03:24.040> instead<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.400> going

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
what I decided to do is instead of going

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.720 
what I decided to do is instead of going
on<00:03:24.820> with<00:03:25.180> like<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.500> less<00:03:26.500> defensive<00:03:27.160> more

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
on with like a less defensive more

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.880 
on with like a less defensive more
special<00:03:28.570> attack<00:03:28.810> based<00:03:29.050> set<00:03:29.230> go<00:03:29.530> with<00:03:29.680> charge

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
special attack based set go with charge

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.800 
special attack based set go with charge
beam<00:03:30.130> I'd<00:03:30.280> mention<00:03:31.060> charge<00:03:31.270> beam<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.480> lot<00:03:31.690> of

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
beam I'd mention charge beam a lot of

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.380 
beam I'd mention charge beam a lot of
times<00:03:31.990> and<00:03:32.260> for<00:03:32.920> tanky<00:03:33.250> Pokemon<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:34.000> really

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
times and for tanky Pokemon you really

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.180 
times and for tanky Pokemon you really
can't<00:03:34.600> beat<00:03:34.780> it<00:03:34.930> now<00:03:35.470> it's<00:03:35.830> kind<00:03:36.010> of<00:03:36.040> like

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
can't beat it now it's kind of like

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.770 
can't beat it now it's kind of like
powerup<00:03:36.550> punch<00:03:36.580> in<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:37.330> know<00:03:37.450> if<00:03:37.690> you

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
powerup punch in that you know if you

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.420 
powerup punch in that you know if you
use<00:03:38.020> it<00:03:38.170> you<00:03:38.260> have<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.410> good<00:03:38.590> full<00:03:38.860> power<00:03:39.220> punch

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
use it you have a good full power punch

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.250 
use it you have a good full power punch
is<00:03:39.520> 100%<00:03:39.880> chance<00:03:40.240> to<00:03:40.390> gain<00:03:40.510> an<00:03:40.630> attack<00:03:40.990> stat

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
is 100% chance to gain an attack stat

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.100 
is 100% chance to gain an attack stat
charge<00:03:41.920> beam<00:03:42.100> is<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.280> 70%<00:03:42.700> chance<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.450> it's

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
charge beam is a 70% chance and it's

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.990 
charge beam is a 70% chance and it's
still<00:03:44.470> very<00:03:44.709> very<00:03:45.100> worth<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.520> because<00:03:45.670> if<00:03:45.880> you

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
still very very worth it because if you

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.750 
still very very worth it because if you
have<00:03:46.180> toxic<00:03:47.110> set<00:03:47.320> up<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:47.860> know<00:03:47.980> you<00:03:48.040> hit<00:03:48.610> them

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
have toxic set up you know you hit them

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.070 
have toxic set up you know you hit them
with<00:03:48.880> charge<00:03:49.120> beam<00:03:49.300> once<00:03:49.570> or<00:03:49.690> twice<00:03:49.840> as

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
with charge beam once or twice as

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.390 
with charge beam once or twice as
they're<00:03:50.230> going<00:03:50.470> down<00:03:50.620> they're<00:03:51.160> going<00:03:51.310> to

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
they're going down they're going to

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.400 
they're going down they're going to
mostly<00:03:51.640> go<00:03:51.970> down<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.360> toxic<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.260> have<00:03:53.350> a

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
mostly go down to toxic and you have a

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.780 
mostly go down to toxic and you have a
chance<00:03:53.560> of<00:03:53.800> boosting<00:03:54.250> your<00:03:54.370> stats<00:03:54.550> really

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
chance of boosting your stats really

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.850 
chance of boosting your stats really
well<00:03:54.940> it's<00:03:55.180> real<00:03:55.330> also<00:03:55.870> getting<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.410> decent

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
well it's real also getting a decent

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.540 
well it's real also getting a decent
coverage<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:58.420> have<00:03:58.510> decent

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
coverage you have decent

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.500 
coverage you have decent
electric<00:04:00.550> coverage<00:04:00.910> so<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.090> can<00:04:01.270> hit<00:04:01.450> a

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
electric coverage so you can hit a

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.730 
electric coverage so you can hit a
little<00:04:01.690> harder<00:04:01.900> against<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.380> water<00:04:02.560> and

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
little harder against the water and

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.800 
little harder against the water and
flying<00:04:02.980> types<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.490> then<00:04:04.060> with<00:04:04.270> size<00:04:04.510> shock

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
flying types and then with size shock

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.860 
flying types and then with size shock
what<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.680> like<00:04:05.920> about<00:04:06.040> size<00:04:06.400> shock<00:04:06.670> is<00:04:06.870> damages

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
what I like about size shock is damages

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.840 
what I like about size shock is damages
based<00:04:08.110> on<00:04:08.260> defense<00:04:08.620> not<00:04:08.950> special<00:04:09.400> defense

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
based on defense not special defense

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.030 
based on defense not special defense
so<00:04:10.120> now<00:04:10.239> porygon<00:04:10.630> -<00:04:10.930> he's<00:04:11.560> not<00:04:11.739> going<00:04:11.920> to<00:04:11.950> get

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
so now porygon - he's not going to get

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.560 
so now porygon - he's not going to get
walled<00:04:12.310> out<00:04:12.489> by<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:12.700> specially<00:04:13.150> defensive

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
walled out by a specially defensive

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.840 
walled out by a specially defensive
Pokemon<00:04:13.989> he's<00:04:14.709> going<00:04:15.070> to<00:04:15.340> be<00:04:15.459> able<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.730> hit

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
Pokemon he's going to be able to hit

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.930 
Pokemon he's going to be able to hit
anything<00:04:16.359> really<00:04:17.020> well<00:04:17.290> so<00:04:17.919> this<00:04:18.489> was<00:04:18.549> mostly

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
anything really well so this was mostly

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.330 
anything really well so this was mostly
a<00:04:19.030> set<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:19.270> made<00:04:19.540> back<00:04:19.750> when<00:04:20.020> up<00:04:20.229> 15<00:04:20.890> when<00:04:21.220> you

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
saw a lot more Blissey a lot more chancy

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.910 
saw a lot more Blissey a lot more chancy
with<00:04:23.770> feo<00:04:24.040> light<00:04:24.310> that

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
with feo light that

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.230 
with feo light that
sigh<00:04:25.130> shot<00:04:25.370> can<00:04:25.550> hit<00:04:25.730> it<00:04:25.850> for<00:04:26.030> its<00:04:26.120> low

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
sigh shot can hit it for its low

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.910 
sigh shot can hit it for its low
defenses<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:26.810> you're<00:04:26.930> going<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.200> do<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.320> lot<00:04:27.710> of

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
defenses and you're going to do a lot of

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.720 
defenses and you're going to do a lot of
damage<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.280> it

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730

so just kind of really rounding out the

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.410 
so just kind of really rounding out the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.620 
coverage overall going to be just a
strong<00:04:43.100> thing<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.610> really<00:04:44.000> enjoy<00:04:44.240> umm

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
strong thing and I really enjoy umm

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.390 
strong thing and I really enjoy umm
other<00:04:45.440> options<00:04:46.210> try<00:04:47.210> attack<00:04:48.070> try<00:04:49.070> attack<00:04:49.250> is

other options try attack try attack is

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.270 
other options try attack try attack is
pretty<00:04:49.940> good<00:04:50.660> because<00:04:51.350> 20<00:04:51.680> percent<00:04:51.980> chance<00:04:52.010> to

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
pretty good because 20 percent chance to

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.640 
pretty good because 20 percent chance to
burn<00:04:52.970> paralyze<00:04:53.480> or<00:04:53.750> freeze<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.170> target<00:04:54.530> I

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
burn paralyze or freeze the target I

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.020 
burn paralyze or freeze the target I
think<00:04:54.830> it<00:04:55.190> actually<00:04:55.460> breaks<00:04:55.580> down<00:04:55.760> to<00:04:55.910> like

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
think it actually breaks down to like

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.870 
think it actually breaks down to like
six<00:04:56.420> point<00:04:56.660> three<00:04:56.750> percent<00:04:57.110> for<00:04:57.590> each<00:04:57.820> so<00:04:58.820> it

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
six point three percent for each so it

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.550 
six point three percent for each so it
does<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.150> 20%<00:04:59.720> chance<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.140> then<00:05:00.230> if<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:00.410> would

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
does the 20% chance and then if it would

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.740 
does the 20% chance and then if it would
it<00:05:00.650> does<00:05:00.800> an<00:05:00.890> extra<00:05:01.220> like<00:05:01.430> 33<00:05:02.150> percent<00:05:02.600> for

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
it does an extra like 33 percent for

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.120 
it does an extra like 33 percent for
each<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:03.170> think<00:05:03.320> that's<00:05:03.710> how<00:05:03.770> I<00:05:03.800> remember

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
each I think that's how I remember
