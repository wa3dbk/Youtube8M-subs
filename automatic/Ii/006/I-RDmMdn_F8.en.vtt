00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:30.630
 [Music] 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:34.140
 So we will intervene on this horse 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.090
 is an 11 month old thoroughbred who has been 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.480
 presented at the consultation for a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.220
 joint distension of the joint 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.809
 by will be left so 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.649
 the hinge of the left hock 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.739
 X-rays have helped to 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.170
 evidence of fragmentation of osteoporosis 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.790
 at the base of the side lip of the embankment 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.280
 this ghost and to condroz what can 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.989
 to take two forms the cocoon dridi 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.179
 that's when it's the case of this horse a 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.550
 lack of these fication of the second 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.369
 rattle and that resulted in the release of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.160
 cartilaginous fragments also proud to 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.630
 inside the joints 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.710
 so the purpose of the intervention 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.289
 of today is to go do 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.060
 the excision of bone fragments 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.800
 are released from this cocoon so he says 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.390
 that's when they are released in 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.250
 the hock joint technique 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.319
 employee is a technique 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.200
 arthroscopic which is practiced using 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.700
 of a camera that is here the light is 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.280
 brought into the joint by a cape 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.409
 from the umih light the whole thing is connected to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.310
 an optics that represent here on 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.340
 which we know that the cable of 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.049
 light and the camera so we'll put 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.840
 in place the arthroscopy material 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.860
 properly speaking the camera so the cape 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.509
 of light that's what will allow 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.490
 to illuminate inside 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.619
 the articulation this is a cape with 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.390
 fiber optics inside the light 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.159
 who arrives at the end of this cable on 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.390
 connects to the optics so as to 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.490
 to be able to find this time the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.350
 camera at the end of the optics here and 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.090
 then we will connect the camera to 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.299
 end that will allow us to visualize 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.890
 our images on the screen to see whatever 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.270
 thing in a joint if we want 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.100
 can have a little more room to 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.060
 the interior is actually lagoon with 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.890
 liquids so with serum 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.989
 physiological that will allow us to 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.940
 correctly visualize our structures 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.730
 we will practice a small incision of 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.680
 the palm about 4 to 5 mm so 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.440
 able to introduce this shirt on 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.870
 which we will return to connect our fluid 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.230
 and where we will be able to enter our scop 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.850
 inside the liquid that we injected 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.790
 inside it's cool 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.540
 returned the camera so we went back 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.340
 in the articulation 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.250
 in fact what interests us is 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.160
 to go deep down there who is 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.630
 the fragment withdrew first thing 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.340
 we always make in the area 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.440
 joints this is called a 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.260
 runaway piper it's pretty much free 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.400
 except maybe below there so in 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.380
 do what interests us is to go 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.420
 basically search there for the fragment a 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:00.150
 removed in its entirety to land 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.740
 remove it that's the fragment so 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.490
 the interest of this technique 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.710
 surgical 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.180
 is that without arthroscopy there the only 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.160
 solution to fetch a fragment 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.780
 inside a joint like 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.030
 that is to practice a dinars too 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.930
 early me ie to incise 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.330
 enough to be able to see at 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.920
 inside so putting on 5 cm including 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.170
 something like that scarring 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.230
 of the joint capsule is always 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.940
 a delicate step and more incision and 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.290
 little high best will be the 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.660
 functional recovery behind 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.310
 it's a technique that has allowed 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.710
 to bring shows that initially with a 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.690
 sports prognosis reserved by the 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.430
 presence of these fragments despite everything 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.140
 hope to make them run 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.150
 at the level at which he was destined he 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.950
 without being hampered by fragments or by 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.610
 the complications of surgeries 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.610
 retreat these fragments
