came out in all the Call of Duty's but I
really<00:03:28.190> just<00:03:28.519> dislike<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.420> way<00:03:29.510> they're

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
really just dislike the way they're

Duty Elite System

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.479 
Duty Elite System
I<00:03:32.239> think<00:03:32.720> it's<00:03:32.840> complete<00:03:33.230> garbage<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.920> I<00:03:34.220> kind

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
I think it's complete garbage and I kind

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.190 
I think it's complete garbage and I kind
of<00:03:34.519> wish<00:03:34.670> him<00:03:34.820> go<00:03:35.000> back<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.480> old<00:03:35.750> way<00:03:35.900> just

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
of wish him go back to the old way just

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.220 
of wish him go back to the old way just
because<00:03:36.850> you<00:03:37.850> know<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:37.970> like<00:03:38.299> rolling<00:03:38.900> out<00:03:39.019> and

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
because you know I like rolling out and

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.860 
because you know I like rolling out and
getting<00:03:39.350> my<00:03:39.530> PSN<00:03:40.070> or<00:03:40.340> my<00:03:40.670> Microsoft<00:03:41.660> Points

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
getting my PSN or my Microsoft Points

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.600 
getting my PSN or my Microsoft Points
and<00:03:42.230> buying<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.650> maps<00:03:42.829> that<00:03:43.100> way<00:03:43.280> I'm<00:03:43.430> much

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
and buying the maps that way I'm much

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.240 
and buying the maps that way I'm much
more<00:03:43.760> comfortable<00:03:43.970> like<00:03:44.600> that<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.220> really<00:03:46.220> I

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
more comfortable like that and really I

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.860 
more comfortable like that and really I
think<00:03:46.310> elites<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.880> bit<00:03:47.030> of<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.180> ripoff<00:03:47.510> for

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
think elites a bit of a ripoff for

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.330 
think elites a bit of a ripoff for
myself<00:03:48.440> some<00:03:48.650> people<00:03:48.890> might<00:03:49.010> think<00:03:49.040> it's

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
myself some people might think it's

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.729 
myself some people might think it's
valid<00:03:49.670> you<00:03:50.239> know<00:03:50.269> purchase<00:03:51.110> I<00:03:51.320> don't<00:03:51.560> really

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
valid you know purchase I don't really

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:52.990 
valid you know purchase I don't really
think<00:03:51.799> it<00:03:52.070> was<00:03:52.160> worth<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.430> money<00:03:52.549> that<00:03:52.850> I

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
think it was worth the money that I

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.430 
think it was worth the money that I
spent<00:03:53.269> for<00:03:53.540> it

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
spent for it

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.470 
spent for it
I<00:03:54.500> don't<00:03:55.430> think<00:03:55.489> elites<00:03:55.910> really<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.269> greatest

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
I don't think elites really the greatest

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.150 
I don't think elites really the greatest
thing<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:56.989> nothing<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.680> mall<00:03:57.829> for<00:03:58.010> three

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
thing and nothing the mall for three

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.039 
thing and nothing the mall for three
maps<00:03:58.400> are<00:03:58.579> bad<00:03:58.760> I<00:03:58.790> actually<00:03:59.060> like<00:03:59.390> all<00:03:59.570> of<00:03:59.930> the

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
maps are bad I actually like all of the

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.770 
maps are bad I actually like all of the
modern<00:04:00.350> warfare<00:04:00.530> 3<00:04:00.739> maps<00:04:01.299> there's<00:04:02.299> not<00:04:02.420> any<00:04:02.690> of

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
modern warfare 3 maps there's not any of

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.259 
modern warfare 3 maps there's not any of
them<00:04:03.079> the<00:04:03.470> model<00:04:03.650> for<00:04:03.859> three<00:04:04.070> dlc<00:04:04.489> dlc<00:04:04.730> keep

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
them the model for three dlc dlc keep

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.090 
them the model for three dlc dlc keep
them<00:04:05.450> pint-sized

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
them pint-sized

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.580 
them pint-sized
I wasn't<00:04:06.310> very<00:04:06.400> specific<00:04:06.580> there<00:04:07.140> DLC<00:04:08.140> maps<00:04:08.350> I

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
I wasn't very specific there DLC maps I

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.350 
I wasn't very specific there DLC maps I
think<00:04:08.860> are<00:04:08.980> bad<00:04:09.190> I<00:04:09.460> think<00:04:09.760> all<00:04:10.060> of<00:04:10.090> them<00:04:10.300> are

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
think are bad I think all of them are

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.760 
think are bad I think all of them are
very<00:04:10.540> good<00:04:10.630> but<00:04:12.330> personally<00:04:13.530> like<00:04:14.530> I<00:04:14.650> was

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
very good but personally like I was

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.150 
very good but personally like I was
saying<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.940> black<00:04:16.209> ops<00:04:16.480> DLC<00:04:17.140> was<00:04:17.530> pretty

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
saying the black ops DLC was pretty

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.010 
saying the black ops DLC was pretty
decent<00:04:18.520> there<00:04:18.640> was<00:04:18.730> some<00:04:18.880> not-so-great<00:04:19.600> maps

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
decent there was some not-so-great maps

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.479 
decent there was some not-so-great maps
in<00:04:20.290> my<00:04:20.410> opinion<00:04:20.800> some<00:04:20.980> of<00:04:21.070> them<00:04:21.190> weren't<00:04:21.340> the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
in my opinion some of them weren't the

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.370 
in my opinion some of them weren't the
greatest<00:04:21.820> discovery<00:04:22.600> wasn't<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:22.990> greatest

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
greatest discovery wasn't the greatest

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.490 
greatest discovery wasn't the greatest
but<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:24.220> just<00:04:24.970> like<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.330> way<00:04:25.360> overall<00:04:26.020> that

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
but I just like the way overall that

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.190 
but I just like the way overall that
black<00:04:27.490> ops<00:04:27.700> made<00:04:28.000> their<00:04:28.150> map<00:04:28.300> acts<00:04:28.540> as<00:04:28.750> well<00:04:28.930> as

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
black ops made their map acts as well as

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.010 
black ops made their map acts as well as
model<00:04:29.590> for<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:29.980> mod<00:04:30.280> for<00:04:30.490> to<00:04:30.610> had<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:31.330> good<00:04:31.480> DLC

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
model for to mod for to had the good DLC

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.110 
model for to mod for to had the good DLC
as<00:04:32.110> well<00:04:32.380> for<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.340> fact<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:33.670> you<00:04:33.820> could<00:04:33.970> just

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
as well for the fact that you could just

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.030 
as well for the fact that you could just
go<00:04:34.210> out<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:34.360> buy<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.630> points<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.650> one<00:04:35.890> of<00:04:35.980> the

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
go out and buy the points and one of the

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.530 
go out and buy the points and one of the
reasons<00:04:36.310> I<00:04:36.400> like<00:04:36.580> that<00:04:36.820> is<00:04:37.030> that<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.330> fact

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
reasons I like that is that the fact

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.170 
reasons I like that is that the fact
that<00:04:37.770> both<00:04:38.770> black<00:04:39.100> ops<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.550> models<00:04:39.850> are<00:04:40.000> to

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
that both black ops and models are to

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.540 
that both black ops and models are to
put<00:04:40.450> it<00:04:40.540> right<00:04:40.780> into<00:04:41.110> matchmaking<00:04:42.100> right<00:04:42.340> away

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
put it right into matchmaking right away

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.880 
put it right into matchmaking right away

into better players that way but uh I'd

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
rather just go into normal matchmaking

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.980 
rather just go into normal matchmaking
something<00:05:09.940> like<00:05:10.060> domination<00:05:10.660> so<00:05:10.810> I<00:05:10.840> don't

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
something like domination so I don't

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.510 
something like domination so I don't
have<00:05:11.080> to<00:05:11.170> deal<00:05:11.380> with<00:05:11.410> coke<00:05:11.740> and<00:05:11.890> firm<00:05:12.160> and<00:05:12.340> team

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
have to deal with coke and firm and team

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.220 
have to deal with coke and firm and team
deathmatch<00:05:12.730> and<00:05:13.090> I'd<00:05:13.240> really<00:05:13.420> just<00:05:13.540> play<00:05:13.870> just

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
deathmatch and I'd really just play just

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.620 
deathmatch and I'd really just play just
straight-up<00:05:14.530> domination<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.550> be<00:05:16.420> able<00:05:16.510> to

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
straight-up domination and be able to

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.080 
straight-up domination and be able to
play<00:05:16.840> on<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.170> DLC<00:05:18.010> maps<00:05:18.220> from<00:05:18.370> alpha<00:05:18.700> 3<00:05:18.910> but

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
play on the DLC maps from alpha 3 but

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.280 
play on the DLC maps from alpha 3 but
apparently<00:05:19.720> that's<00:05:19.840> not<00:05:19.930> an<00:05:20.110> option

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
apparently that's not an option

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.840 
apparently that's not an option
considering<00:05:20.950> they're<00:05:21.070> not<00:05:21.220> being<00:05:21.430> put<00:05:21.670> into

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
considering they're not being put into

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.820 
considering they're not being put into
the<00:05:21.970> map<00:05:22.150> rotation<00:05:22.780> or<00:05:22.990> at<00:05:23.080> least<00:05:23.230> I<00:05:23.350> have<00:05:23.650> not

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
the map rotation or at least I have not

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.070 
the map rotation or at least I have not
ran<00:05:24.100> into<00:05:24.370> it<00:05:24.460> myself<00:05:24.610> and<00:05:25.240> I<00:05:25.360> no<00:05:25.450> wings<00:05:25.870> the

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
ran into it myself and I no wings the

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.440 
ran into it myself and I no wings the
redemption<00:05:26.440> hasn't<00:05:26.800> either<00:05:26.920> so<00:05:27.220> I<00:05:27.640> kind<00:05:28.390> of

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
redemption hasn't either so I kind of

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.910 
redemption hasn't either so I kind of
wish<00:05:28.600> that<00:05:28.630> they<00:05:28.870> do<00:05:29.050> it<00:05:29.170> just<00:05:29.350> like<00:05:29.440> black<00:05:29.710> ops

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
wish that they do it just like black ops

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.310 
wish that they do it just like black ops
and<00:05:30.040> model<00:05:30.340> for<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:30.580> too

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
and model for it too

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.420 
and model for it too
the<00:05:32.320> one<00:05:32.470> thing<00:05:32.650> that<00:05:32.800> I<00:05:32.860> also<00:05:32.950> liked<00:05:33.310> about

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
the one thing that I also liked about

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.610 
the one thing that I also liked about
those<00:05:33.730> two<00:05:33.940> games<00:05:34.210> as<00:05:34.390> well<00:05:34.660> with<00:05:35.350> the<00:05:35.470> map

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
those two games as well with the map

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.140 
those two games as well with the map
packs<00:05:35.890> is<00:05:36.070> that<00:05:36.220> they<00:05:36.340> released<00:05:36.610> five<00:05:36.880> at<00:05:37.120> a

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
packs is that they released five at a

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.330 
packs is that they released five at a
time<00:05:37.210> not<00:05:37.750> like<00:05:37.900> one<00:05:38.200> every<00:05:38.440> month<00:05:38.590> I'd<00:05:38.860> rather

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
time not like one every month I'd rather

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.680 
time not like one every month I'd rather
just<00:05:39.580> get<00:05:39.790> them<00:05:39.910> all<00:05:40.030> out<00:05:40.060> of<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.360> way<00:05:40.480> and
