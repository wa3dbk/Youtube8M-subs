for<00:03:44.079> a<00:03:44.109> little<00:03:44.319> matchbox<00:03:45.040> vehicle<00:03:45.609> then<00:03:46.359> here

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
for a little matchbox vehicle then here

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.210 
for a little matchbox vehicle then here
you<00:03:46.780> got<00:03:47.049> a<00:03:47.290> helicopter<00:03:47.859> oh<00:03:48.430> this<00:03:49.329> must<00:03:49.569> be<00:03:49.810> the

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
this says isla new bar transport and it

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.740 
this says isla new bar transport and it
does<00:03:58.630> have<00:03:58.840> rotors<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.380> actually<00:04:00.040> spin<00:04:00.750> so

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
does have rotors that actually spin so

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.170 
does have rotors that actually spin so
that<00:04:01.900> looks<00:04:02.139> cool<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.650> rotor<00:04:02.859> spins<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.940> the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
that looks cool the rotor spins and the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.530 
that looks cool the rotor spins and the
tail<00:04:04.420> rotor<00:04:04.750> spins<00:04:05.370> it's<00:04:06.370> got<00:04:06.760> three<00:04:07.209> tires

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
tail rotor spins it's got three tires

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.250 
tail rotor spins it's got three tires

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
for landing the front of it looks really

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.680 
for landing the front of it looks really
cool<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:12.730> other<00:04:12.849> side<00:04:13.180> is

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
cool and the other side is

be<00:04:13.750> much<00:04:13.960> the<00:04:14.170> same<00:04:14.410> is<00:04:14.740> Lanoue<00:04:15.160> bar<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.760> says

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
be much the same is Lanoue bar and says

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
be much the same is Lanoue bar and says
molecular<00:04:17.370> transport<00:04:18.600> Wow

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
molecular transport Wow

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.750 
molecular transport Wow
these<00:04:21.360> awesome<00:04:22.360> matchbox<00:04:22.990> vehicles<00:04:23.760> Glen

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
these awesome matchbox vehicles Glen

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.360 
these awesome matchbox vehicles Glen
here<00:04:25.210> you<00:04:25.540> got<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.930> coolest<00:04:26.380> one<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:27.070> think

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
here you got the coolest one I think

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.000 
here you got the coolest one I think
these<00:04:27.550> are<00:04:27.720> Ospreys<00:04:28.720> these<00:04:29.530> are<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.800> ones

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
these are Ospreys these are the ones

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.430 
these are Ospreys these are the ones
that<00:04:30.220> have<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.520> tilting<00:04:31.000> wings<00:04:31.270> see<00:04:32.260> when

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
that have the tilting wings see when

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.860 
that have the tilting wings see when
they<00:04:32.560> they<00:04:32.890> can<00:04:33.070> take<00:04:33.280> off<00:04:33.490> vertically<00:04:34.060> like<00:04:34.840> a

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
they they can take off vertically like a

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.470 
they they can take off vertically like a
helicopter<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:36.070> rotors<00:04:36.430> actually<00:04:36.910> do<00:04:37.090> spin

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
helicopter the rotors actually do spin

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.230 
helicopter the rotors actually do spin
and<00:04:38.080> once<00:04:38.290> they're<00:04:38.560> in<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.920> air<00:04:39.130> then<00:04:40.060> they

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
and once they're in the air then they

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.290 
and once they're in the air then they
push<00:04:40.510> put<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.350> wings<00:04:41.560> down<00:04:41.890> forward<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:42.790> they

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
push put the wings down forward and they

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.860 
push put the wings down forward and they
fly<00:04:43.720> at<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.470> speed<00:04:44.830> of<00:04:45.010> an<00:04:45.130> airplane<00:04:45.670> so<00:04:46.540> here

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
fly at the speed of an airplane so here

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.900 
fly at the speed of an airplane so here
you've<00:04:47.050> got<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.550> maneuverability<00:04:48.550> of<00:04:48.580> a

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
you've got the maneuverability of a

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.620 
you've got the maneuverability of a
helicopter<00:04:49.570> to<00:04:49.720> come<00:04:49.930> straight<00:04:50.320> up<00:04:50.350> once<00:04:51.040> it's

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
helicopter to come straight up once it's

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.880 
helicopter to come straight up once it's
forward<00:04:52.630> you<00:04:52.900> have<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.230> speed<00:04:53.590> of<00:04:53.770> an

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
forward you have the speed of an

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.160 
forward you have the speed of an
airplane<00:04:54.370> let's<00:04:55.180> take<00:04:55.360> a<00:04:55.390> closer<00:04:55.720> look<00:04:55.870> at

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
airplane let's take a closer look at

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.920 
airplane let's take a closer look at
this<00:04:56.640> it<00:04:57.640> says<00:04:57.670> M<00:04:58.120> 1<00:04:58.390> here<00:04:58.840> o<00:04:58.990> 5<00:04:59.590> it<00:05:00.250> says<00:05:00.730> it<00:05:01.720> has

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
this it says M 1 here o 5 it says it has

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.960 
this it says M 1 here o 5 it says it has
a<00:05:01.960> JW<00:05:02.920> and<00:05:03.190> a<00:05:03.610> picture<00:05:03.910> of<00:05:04.120> a<00:05:04.240> dinosaur<00:05:04.480> there

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
a JW and a picture of a dinosaur there

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.670 
a JW and a picture of a dinosaur there
wow<00:05:06.970> this<00:05:07.300> is<00:05:07.540> cool<00:05:07.930> I<00:05:08.580> really<00:05:09.580> like<00:05:09.820> this<00:05:10.090> one

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
wow this is cool I really like this one

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.000 
wow this is cool I really like this one
then<00:05:11.680> here<00:05:12.010> on<00:05:12.130> the<00:05:12.160> cockpit<00:05:12.520> it<00:05:13.090> says<00:05:13.300> o<00:05:13.510> 5<00:05:14.010> the

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
then here on the cockpit it says o 5 the

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.220 
then here on the cockpit it says o 5 the
cockpits<00:05:15.610> like<00:05:15.970> a<00:05:16.000> little<00:05:16.450> it's<00:05:17.020> like<00:05:17.110> a

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
cockpits like a little it's like a

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.510 
cockpits like a little it's like a
plastic<00:05:17.650> white<00:05:18.280> piece<00:05:18.669> there<00:05:19.060> oh<00:05:20.310> it<00:05:21.310> doesn't

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
plastic white piece there oh it doesn't

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.920 
plastic white piece there oh it doesn't
open<00:05:21.970> but<00:05:22.120> it<00:05:22.210> does<00:05:22.419> pop<00:05:22.690> off<00:05:23.020> so<00:05:24.720> let's<00:05:25.720> go

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
open but it does pop off so let's go

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.430 
open but it does pop off so let's go
ahead<00:05:26.020> and<00:05:26.260> put<00:05:26.440> that<00:05:26.710> back<00:05:27.870> and<00:05:28.870> then<00:05:29.140> the

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
ahead and put that back and then the

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.470 
ahead and put that back and then the
bottom<00:05:29.890> it<00:05:30.310> looks<00:05:30.490> cool<00:05:30.880> even<00:05:31.060> from<00:05:31.360> the

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
bottom it looks cool even from the

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.680 
bottom it looks cool even from the
bottom<00:05:31.870> it<00:05:31.990> says<00:05:32.020> sky<00:05:32.530> Safari<00:05:33.360> let's<00:05:34.360> see<00:05:34.510> the

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
bottom it says sky Safari let's see the

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.470 
bottom it says sky Safari let's see the
rotors<00:05:35.080> do<00:05:35.290> actually<00:05:35.740> spin<00:05:36.130> so<00:05:36.580> that<00:05:36.790> is<00:05:37.030> cool

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
rotors do actually spin so that is cool

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.400 
rotors do actually spin so that is cool
