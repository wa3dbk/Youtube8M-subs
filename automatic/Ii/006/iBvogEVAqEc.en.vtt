difference<00:00:06.879> between<00:00:07.080> what<00:00:08.080> I<00:00:08.109> think<00:00:08.350> is<00:00:08.440> a

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:08.469 
difference between what I think is a

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.190 
difference between what I think is a
size<00:00:08.709> too<00:00:09.040> big<00:00:09.070> on<00:00:09.670> a<00:00:09.730> horse<00:00:09.969> for<00:00:10.840> an<00:00:10.900> easy<00:00:11.019> good

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
size too big on a horse for an easy good

size too big on a horse for an easy good
glove<00:00:11.410> which<00:00:11.620> is<00:00:11.740> a<00:00:11.769> size<00:00:12.040> that<00:00:12.250> is<00:00:12.370> just<00:00:12.580> right

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
glove which is a size that is just right

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:40.890 
point-five usually I put a nod on this
horse<00:00:39.400> so<00:00:39.879> I<00:00:40.120> just<00:00:40.269> want<00:00:40.449> to<00:00:40.510> show<00:00:40.629> you<00:00:40.720> how

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.850 
horse so I just want to show you how
different<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:43.000> boots<00:00:43.210> are<00:00:43.449> really<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:44.710> best

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
different the boots are really the best

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.380 
different the boots are really the best
way<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:45.129> tell<00:00:45.400> is<00:00:45.549> the<00:00:45.670> way<00:00:45.760> they<00:00:45.909> go<00:00:46.059> on<00:00:46.089> and

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
way to tell is the way they go on and

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.560 
way to tell is the way they go on and
off<00:00:46.510> so<00:00:47.369> if<00:00:48.369> you<00:00:48.489> look<00:00:48.640> at<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:48.850> way<00:00:49.000> this<00:00:49.239> boot

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
off so if you look at the way this boot

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.969 
off so if you look at the way this boot
comes<00:00:49.930> off<00:00:51.960> fold<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.080> Gator<00:00:53.260> back<00:00:53.500> see<00:00:53.830> how

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:53.979 
comes off fold the Gator back see how

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:55.859 
comes off fold the Gator back see how
easily<00:00:54.220> that<00:00:54.580> just<00:00:54.879> slipped<00:00:55.119> right<00:00:55.299> off<00:00:55.360> now

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:55.869 
easily that just slipped right off now

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:56.670 
easily that just slipped right off now
we've<00:00:55.960> been<00:00:56.019> going<00:00:56.260> through<00:00:56.350> some<00:00:56.500> water

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
we've been going through some water

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.829 
we've been going through some water
crossings<00:00:57.129> but<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.059> boot<00:00:58.210> really<00:00:58.390> shouldn't

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
crossings but the boot really shouldn't

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.460 
crossings but the boot really shouldn't
be<00:00:58.930> coming<00:00:59.199> off<00:00:59.290> that<00:00:59.530> easily<00:01:01.110> if<00:01:02.110> your<00:01:02.290> boots

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
be coming off that easily if your boots

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.350 
be coming off that easily if your boots
are<00:01:02.650> that<00:01:02.739> easy<00:01:02.920> to<00:01:03.040> get<00:01:03.280> on<00:01:03.430> even<00:01:04.180> though<00:01:04.239> this

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
are that easy to get on even though this

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.720 
are that easy to get on even though this
boot<00:01:04.600> has<00:01:04.629> stayed<00:01:05.019> on<00:01:05.229> I<00:01:05.470> wouldn't<00:01:06.340> expect<00:01:06.520> it

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
boot has stayed on I wouldn't expect it

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.730 
boot has stayed on I wouldn't expect it
to<00:01:06.820> stay<00:01:07.000> on<00:01:07.030> if<00:01:07.270> I<00:01:07.360> was<00:01:07.480> going<00:01:07.720> on<00:01:07.900> great<00:01:08.410> speed

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.350 
to stay on if I was going on great speed
especially<00:01:09.220> without<00:01:09.550> a<00:01:09.670> power<00:01:09.880> strap<00:01:10.180> on<00:01:10.330> that

this<00:01:19.480> is<00:01:19.600> an<00:01:19.690> art<00:01:19.900> boot<00:01:20.230> you<00:01:21.220> can<00:01:21.400> see<00:01:21.660> going<00:01:22.660> to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
this is an art boot you can see going to

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.410 
this is an art boot you can see going to
go<00:01:22.870> on<00:01:23.050> get<00:01:23.620> it<00:01:23.710> over<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.980> quarters<00:01:24.310> twist<00:01:25.300> it

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
go on get it over the quarters twist it

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.180 
go on get it over the quarters twist it
a<00:01:25.480> little<00:01:25.660> bit<00:01:26.640> pull<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.790> Gator<00:01:27.970> up<00:01:29.100> set<00:01:30.100> it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
a little bit pull the Gator up set it

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.340 
a little bit pull the Gator up set it
down<00:01:30.250> lift<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.390> other<00:01:31.480> leg<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.930> this<00:01:35.080> one<00:01:35.200> has

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
down lift the other leg so this one has

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.540 
down lift the other leg so this one has
a<00:01:35.380> power<00:01:35.620> strap<00:01:35.890> which<00:01:36.130> makes<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.460> little

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
a power strap which makes it a little

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.360 
a power strap which makes it a little
more<00:01:36.820> difficult<00:01:37.480> to<00:01:37.600> see<00:01:38.040> exactly<00:01:39.040> what's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
more difficult to see exactly what's

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.440 
more difficult to see exactly what's
going<00:01:39.550> on<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:43.360> can<00:01:43.510> see<00:01:43.540> from<00:01:43.900> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
going on but you can see from the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.390 
going on but you can see from the
coronet<00:01:46.450> band<00:01:46.690> it's<00:01:47.200> pretty<00:01:47.530> equal<00:01:48.130> all<00:01:48.280> the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
coronet band it's pretty equal all the

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.830 
coronet band it's pretty equal all the
way<00:01:48.490> around<00:01:48.790> so<00:01:48.970> I'm<00:01:49.030> not<00:01:49.150> concerned<00:01:49.330> too<00:01:49.690> much

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
way around so I'm not concerned too much

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.080 
way around so I'm not concerned too much
about<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.170> heel<00:01:50.320> being<00:01:50.590> in<00:01:50.770> completely<00:01:51.760> I

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
about the heel being in completely I

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.990 
about the heel being in completely I
don't<00:01:52.570> see<00:01:52.720> any<00:01:52.840> rocks<00:01:53.050> -<00:01:53.229> you<00:01:53.409> do<00:01:53.560> vicinity

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
don't see any rocks - you do vicinity
