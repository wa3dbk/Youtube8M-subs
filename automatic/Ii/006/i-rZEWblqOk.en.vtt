00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
some amazing features the first thing is

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.630 
some amazing features the first thing is
as<00:00:21.390> always<00:00:21.930> all<00:00:22.230> t-fal<00:00:22.890> pans<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
as always all t-fal pans have the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.820 
as always all t-fal pans have the
nonstick<00:00:24.180> coating<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:25.170> when<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.560> look<00:00:25.710> at

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
nonstick coating but when you look at

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.070 
nonstick coating but when you look at
this<00:00:25.920> crazy<00:00:26.430> pattern<00:00:26.939> here<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.599> means<00:00:27.810> it's

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
this crazy pattern here that means it's

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.589 
this crazy pattern here that means it's
metal-on-metal<00:00:28.590> safe<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.670> also<00:00:29.880> has<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
metal-on-metal safe it also has the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.110 
metal-on-metal safe it also has the
world<00:00:30.960> renowned<00:00:31.349> thermo<00:00:31.920> spot<00:00:32.219> basically<00:00:32.759> you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
world renowned thermo spot basically you

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.209 
world renowned thermo spot basically you
see<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> pattern<00:00:33.660> there<00:00:33.809> as<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.620> place<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.070> onto

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
see the pattern there as I place it onto

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.069 
see the pattern there as I place it onto
the<00:00:35.370> heat<00:00:35.670> we're<00:00:36.210> gonna<00:00:36.300> see<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> pattern

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the heat we're gonna see the pattern

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.020 
the heat we're gonna see the pattern
turn<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.590> red<00:00:37.829> dot<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.399> that'll<00:00:38.730> let<00:00:38.879> us

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
turn to a red dot and that'll let us

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.630 
turn to a red dot and that'll let us
know<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.719> pan<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.200> ready<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> cook<00:00:40.739> now

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
know that the pan is ready to cook now

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.700 
know that the pan is ready to cook now
the<00:00:42.090> other<00:00:42.300> great<00:00:42.540> thing<00:00:42.840> about<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.260> pan<00:00:43.500> is

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the other great thing about this pan is

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.590 
the other great thing about this pan is
the<00:00:43.770> pattern<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.489> bottom<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.000> has<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the pattern on the bottom it has the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.450 
the pattern on the bottom it has the
optimal<00:00:45.989> technology<00:00:46.590> now<00:00:47.039> optimal

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
optimal technology now optimal

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.729 
optimal technology now optimal
technology<00:00:48.059> means<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.780> heat<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.200> spread

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
technology means that the heat is spread

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.770 
technology means that the heat is spread
evenly<00:00:50.370> all<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.120> way<00:00:51.210> through<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> pan

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
evenly all the way through the pan

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.200 
evenly all the way through the pan
meaning<00:00:52.350> there<00:00:52.469> are<00:00:52.500> no<00:00:52.620> cold<00:00:53.160> spots<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.760> then

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
meaning there are no cold spots and then

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.180 
meaning there are no cold spots and then
we<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.379> handle<00:00:55.800> which<00:00:56.039> is

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
we also have the handle which is

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.279 
we also have the handle which is
basically<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> beautiful<00:00:57.239> silicon<00:00:57.719> green<00:00:57.989> here

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
basically a beautiful silicon green here

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.080 
basically a beautiful silicon green here
but<00:00:58.620> actually<00:00:58.739> pick<00:00:59.010> up<00:00:59.070> into<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.670> them<00:00:59.760> up

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
but actually pick up into you of them up

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.930 
but actually pick up into you of them up
to<00:01:00.149> 350<00:01:01.050> degrees<00:01:01.350> now<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.010> pan<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
to 350 degrees now the pan is on the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.579 
to 350 degrees now the pan is on the
thermal<00:01:03.329> spot<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.600> working<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.170> we're<00:01:04.500> gonna

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
thermal spot is working and we're gonna

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.990 
thermal spot is working and we're gonna
let<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> pan<00:01:05.100> heat<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.880> get

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
let the pan heat up so we can get

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700 
let the pan heat up so we can get
cooking<00:01:06.390> some<00:01:06.570> scallops<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.140> minute<00:01:07.380> but

is called a wasabi mash it's a really
simple<00:01:16.320> dish<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.670> wasabi<00:01:18.180> powder

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
simple dish it's just wasabi powder

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:33.690 
simple dish it's just wasabi powder
we're<00:01:21.180> gonna<00:01:21.270> scoop<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.310> whole<00:01:23.310> avocado

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.160

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
together so that's our avocado mash it's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.830 
together so that's our avocado mash it's
sort<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:54.980> like<00:01:55.250> an<00:01:55.940> Asian<00:01:56.450> version<00:01:56.780> of

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
sort of like an Asian version of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.720 
sort of like an Asian version of

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.230 
and start cooking our scallops and
pancetta<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:01.340> first<00:02:01.640> of<00:02:01.760> all<00:02:01.820> I'm<00:02:02.000> going<00:02:02.150> to

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
pancetta so first of all I'm going to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.170 
pancetta so first of all I'm going to
add<00:02:02.450> some<00:02:03.350> pancetta<00:02:03.560> I'm<00:02:04.130> not<00:02:04.550> adding<00:02:04.730> olive

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
add some pancetta I'm not adding olive

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.360 
add some pancetta I'm not adding olive
oil<00:02:05.390> or<00:02:05.600> butter<00:02:05.630> I'm<00:02:06.140> just<00:02:06.500> gonna<00:02:06.590> use<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:07.040> fat

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
oil or butter I'm just gonna use the fat

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.490 
oil or butter I'm just gonna use the fat
from<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.090> pancetta<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:09.290> cook<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.740> scallops

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
from the pancetta to cook the scallops

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.470 
from the pancetta to cook the scallops
okay<00:02:12.500> so<00:02:12.950> our<00:02:13.100> pancetta<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.940> rendered<00:02:14.420> a

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
okay so our pancetta is rendered a

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.640 
okay so our pancetta is rendered a
little<00:02:14.660> bit<00:02:14.750> of<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.870> fat<00:02:15.110> off<00:02:15.260> now<00:02:15.530> we're

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
little bit of the fat off now we're

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:23.449 
little bit of the fat off now we're
gonna<00:02:15.740> add<00:02:16.070> our<00:02:16.540> scallops

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.920 

and<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.060> great<00:02:24.209> thing<00:02:24.239> about<00:02:24.390> scallops<00:02:24.840> is

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
and the great thing about scallops is

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.089 
and the great thing about scallops is
they<00:02:25.019> don't<00:02:25.200> take<00:02:25.409> too<00:02:25.620> long<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:25.980> we're<00:02:26.069> just

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
they don't take too long so we're just

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.440 
they don't take too long so we're just
gonna<00:02:26.250> get<00:02:26.400> them<00:02:26.549> a<00:02:26.579> little<00:02:26.879> bit<00:02:26.969> color<00:02:27.209> and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
gonna get them a little bit color and

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.240 
gonna get them a little bit color and
then<00:02:27.659> we're<00:02:27.750> gonna<00:02:27.840> start<00:02:28.109> plating<00:02:28.409> up<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.129> as

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
then we're gonna start plating up so as

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.890 
then we're gonna start plating up so as
you<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.430> see<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.819> optimal<00:02:30.209> technology<00:02:30.540> is

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
you can see the optimal technology is

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.080 
you can see the optimal technology is
working<00:02:31.319> every<00:02:32.010> part<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.430> pan<00:02:32.640> has<00:02:32.819> heat

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
working every part of the pan has heat

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.910 
working every part of the pan has heat
and<00:02:33.269> everything<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:34.109> the<00:02:34.260> pan<00:02:34.439> is<00:02:34.590> cooking

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
and everything in the pan is cooking

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.190 
and everything in the pan is cooking
evenly<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.790> then<00:02:36.299> look<00:02:36.510> at<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.689> nonstick

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
evenly and then look at the nonstick

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.289 
evenly and then look at the nonstick
coating<00:02:37.439> what<00:02:38.040> how<00:02:38.159> it<00:02:38.280> works<00:02:38.519> we<00:02:38.969> just<00:02:39.150> keep

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
coating what how it works we just keep

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.170 
coating what how it works we just keep
flipping<00:02:39.689> over<00:02:40.319> our<00:02:40.469> scallops<00:02:41.000> nicely<00:02:42.000> a

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
flipping over our scallops nicely a

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.030 
flipping over our scallops nicely a
pancetta<00:02:42.810> now<00:02:43.109> is<00:02:43.260> going<00:02:43.379> to<00:02:43.439> move<00:02:43.620> out<00:02:43.829> of<00:02:43.859> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
pancetta now is going to move out of the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:53.340 
pancetta now is going to move out of the
pan<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.459> onto<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.790> plate
