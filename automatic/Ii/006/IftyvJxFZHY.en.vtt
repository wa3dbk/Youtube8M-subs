00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.110 

okay<00:00:00.960> I<00:00:00.989> have<00:00:01.199> a<00:00:01.230> rainbow<00:00:01.740> of<00:00:02.010> primary<00:00:02.879> colors

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
okay I have a rainbow of primary colors

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.349 
okay I have a rainbow of primary colors
primary<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.170> I<00:00:04.680> guess<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.609> print<00:00:05.879> primaries

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
primary and I guess the print primaries

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.500 
primary and I guess the print primaries
is<00:00:06.509> well<00:00:06.690> red<00:00:07.049> yellow<00:00:07.830> green<00:00:07.859> cyan<00:00:08.519> blue<00:00:08.940> and

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
is well red yellow green cyan blue and

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.080 
is well red yellow green cyan blue and
magenta<00:00:09.660> so<00:00:10.290> I've<00:00:10.380> got<00:00:10.530> RGB<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.460> I've<00:00:11.910> got

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
magenta so I've got RGB and I've got

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.689 
magenta so I've got RGB and I've got
yellow<00:00:12.420> cyan<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.870> magenta<00:00:16.070> if<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.190> ask<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:17.520> a

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
yellow cyan and magenta if I ask for a

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.960 
yellow cyan and magenta if I ask for a
curve<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:19.400> I<00:00:20.630> drop<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.900> red<00:00:24.320> and<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.410> can<00:00:25.590> see

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
curve and I drop the red and you can see

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.890 
curve and I drop the red and you can see
that<00:00:27.949> the<00:00:28.949> red<00:00:29.099> goes<00:00:29.310> away

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
that the red goes away

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.479 
that the red goes away
the<00:00:30.900> yellow<00:00:31.320> becomes<00:00:31.650> green<00:00:31.949> because<00:00:32.309> there

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
the yellow becomes green because there

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.549 
the yellow becomes green because there
was<00:00:32.640> red<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> yellow<00:00:33.570> now<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> same

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
was red in the yellow now it's the same

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.860 
was red in the yellow now it's the same
as<00:00:34.710> green<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:36.000> blue<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.450> magenta

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
as green and the blue and the magenta

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.970 
as green and the blue and the magenta
are<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> same<00:00:37.260> because<00:00:37.530> there<00:00:37.680> used<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> be

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
are the same because there used to be

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.910 
are the same because there used to be
red<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> magenta<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.660> well<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.710> that's

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
red in the magenta as well and that's

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.970 
red in the magenta as well and that's
gone<00:00:42.200> if<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.820> ask<00:00:44.820> for<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:46.039> black<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.070> white

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
gone if I ask for a black and white

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.250 
gone if I ask for a black and white
adjustment<00:00:49.980> layer<00:00:50.629> then<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.809> first<00:00:51.989> thing<00:00:52.170> it

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
adjustment layer then the first thing it

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.420 
adjustment layer then the first thing it
does<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.680> comes<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> bunch<00:00:53.370> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
does is it comes in with a bunch of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.709 
does is it comes in with a bunch of
default<00:00:53.730> weights<00:00:54.149> 40<00:00:55.140> 60<00:00:55.590> 40<00:00:55.980> 60<00:00:56.430> 20<00:00:56.789> 80<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
default weights 40 60 40 60 20 80 and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.590 
default weights 40 60 40 60 20 80 and
you<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.899> see<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.320> makes<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:59.570> into<00:01:00.570> a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
you can see that that makes this into a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.630 
you can see that that makes this into a
series<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.079> different<00:01:01.469> Gray's<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.890> kind<00:01:02.550> of

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
series of different Gray's that kind of

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.189 
series of different Gray's that kind of
look<00:01:02.789> nice<00:01:03.000> because<00:01:03.329> they're<00:01:03.539> somewhat<00:01:04.049> based

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
look nice because they're somewhat based

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.859 
look nice because they're somewhat based
or<00:01:04.500> they're<00:01:04.769> they're<00:01:05.040> largely<00:01:05.309> based<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.869> how

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
or they're they're largely based on how

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.170 
or they're they're largely based on how
we<00:01:06.930> think<00:01:07.260> they<00:01:07.439> should<00:01:07.650> look<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.909> some<00:01:09.150> of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
we think they should look so the some of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.440 
we think they should look so the some of
the<00:01:09.299> brighter<00:01:09.479> colors<00:01:09.810> are<00:01:09.960> brighter<00:01:10.170> Gray's

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
the brighter colors are brighter Gray's

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.160 
the brighter colors are brighter Gray's
but<00:01:12.450> if<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:12.810> make<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.500> 0<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:15.270> 0<00:01:15.540> and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
but if we make this 0 and this 0 and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.340 
but if we make this 0 and this 0 and
this<00:01:16.439> 0<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.580> 0<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.479> 0<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.290> 0

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
this 0 and this 0 and this 0 and this 0

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.200 
this 0 and this 0 and this 0 and this 0
we<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> things<00:01:21.060> that's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
we can see that one of the things that's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.090 
we can see that one of the things that's
interesting<00:01:21.330> about<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.080> black<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.920> white

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
interesting about the black and white

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.890 
interesting about the black and white
adjustment<00:01:23.430> layer<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.720> very

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
adjustment layer is that it's very

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.630 
adjustment layer is that it's very
targeted<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:26.340> red<00:01:26.549> slider<00:01:27.020> addresses<00:01:28.020> red

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
targeted the red slider addresses red

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.530 
targeted the red slider addresses red
the<00:01:29.640> green<00:01:30.540> slider<00:01:30.900> addresses<00:01:31.890> green<00:01:32.540> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
the green slider addresses green the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.749 
the green slider addresses green the
yellow<00:01:33.570> slider<00:01:34.290> addresses<00:01:35.130> yellow<00:01:35.520> and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
yellow slider addresses yellow and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.929 
yellow slider addresses yellow and
there's<00:01:36.180> no<00:01:36.390> crosstalk<00:01:37.110> between<00:01:37.939> these

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
there's no crosstalk between these

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.590 
there's no crosstalk between these
different<00:01:39.420> channels<00:01:40.110> because<00:01:41.390> I'm<00:01:42.390> using

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
different channels because I'm using

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.170 
different channels because I'm using
very<00:01:42.840> saturated<00:01:43.049> primaries<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.850> seems

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
very saturated primaries but it seems

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.899 
very saturated primaries but it seems
like<00:01:45.710> it<00:01:46.710> does<00:01:46.979> something<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.579> address

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
like it does something like address

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.270 
like it does something like address
these<00:01:48.119> colors<00:01:48.509> I'm<00:01:48.659> guessing<00:01:49.110> addressee<00:01:49.680> puts

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
these colors I'm guessing addressee puts

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.679 
these colors I'm guessing addressee puts
these<00:01:50.399> colors<00:01:50.729> into<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> higher<00:01:51.149> dimensional

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
these colors into a higher dimensional

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.520 
these colors into a higher dimensional
space<00:01:52.310> where<00:01:53.540> it<00:01:54.540> does<00:01:54.869> sort<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.350> dot

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
space where it does sort of a dot

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.170 
space where it does sort of a dot
product<00:01:55.829> between<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.579> color<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.030> you're

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
product between the color that you're

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.179 
product between the color that you're
interested<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> color<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.740> on

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
interested in the color that you have on

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.060 
interested in the color that you have on
your<00:01:59.729> in<00:02:00.299> your<00:02:00.450> image<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.020> decides<00:02:01.710> how<00:02:01.890> much

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
your in your image and decides how much

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.060 
your in your image and decides how much
of<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.880> color<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.600> color<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.350> higher

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
of this color is in that color in higher

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.749 
of this color is in that color in higher
than<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.520> RGB<00:02:06.979> 3-dimensional<00:02:07.979> space

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
than just RGB 3-dimensional space

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.530 
than just RGB 3-dimensional space
that<00:02:10.569> would<00:02:10.660> be<00:02:10.780> my<00:02:11.080> guess<00:02:11.849> but<00:02:12.849> what's

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
that would be my guess but what's

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.850 
that would be my guess but what's
interesting<00:02:13.720> about<00:02:14.019> this<00:02:14.319> is<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.590> it's

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
interesting about this is that it's

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.449 
interesting about this is that it's
useful<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:16.080> playing<00:02:17.080> around<00:02:17.230> with<00:02:17.590> color

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
useful for playing around with color

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.250 
useful for playing around with color
even<00:02:19.150> though<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.510> don't<00:02:19.540> mean<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.019> tint

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
even though and I don't mean the tint

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.040 
even though and I don't mean the tint
thing<00:02:21.069> down<00:02:21.310> here<00:02:21.730> that's<00:02:22.660> something

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
thing down here that's something

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.210 
thing down here that's something
different<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:24.610> basically<00:02:25.209> takes<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.690> gray

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
different that basically takes the gray

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.290 
different that basically takes the gray
puts<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.310> tint<00:02:27.550> into<00:02:27.819> it<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.030> then<00:02:28.120> when<00:02:28.209> it

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
puts a tint into it and then when it

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.790 
puts a tint into it and then when it
goes<00:02:28.390> white<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.810> goes<00:02:28.959> that<00:02:29.170> loses<00:02:29.440> its<00:02:29.620> color

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
goes white it goes that loses its color

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.009 
goes white it goes that loses its color
again<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.370> notice<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.420> color<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:31.900> it

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
again and notice that the color that it

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.470 
again and notice that the color that it
becomes<00:02:32.410> has<00:02:32.680> nothing<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.040> do<00:02:33.250> with<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:34.269> color

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
becomes has nothing to do with the color

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.030 
becomes has nothing to do with the color
that<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:34.810> started<00:02:35.170> as<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.319> can<00:02:35.620> make<00:02:35.830> that

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
that it started as you can make that

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.729 
that it started as you can make that
slider<00:02:36.959> whatever<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.080> want<00:02:38.319> it<00:02:38.379> to<00:02:38.410> be<00:02:38.590> so

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
slider whatever you want it to be so

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.229 
slider whatever you want it to be so
that<00:02:38.769> has<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.220> do<00:02:39.340> with<00:02:39.459> tinting<00:02:39.849> black<00:02:40.060> and

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
that has to do with tinting black and

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.970 
that has to do with tinting black and
white<00:02:40.390> images<00:02:40.780> that's<00:02:41.349> not<00:02:41.560> what<00:02:41.709> I'm<00:02:41.799> talking

white images that's not what I'm talking

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.800 
white images that's not what I'm talking
about<00:02:42.340> what<00:02:42.489> I'm<00:02:42.580> talking<00:02:42.610> about<00:02:43.000> is<00:02:43.180> taking

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
about what I'm talking about is taking

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.589 
about what I'm talking about is taking
the<00:02:44.080> different<00:02:44.349> components<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.069> yellow<00:02:45.910> or

the different components of yellow or
green<00:02:47.230> or<00:02:47.590> cyan<00:02:48.130> or<00:02:48.280> blue<00:02:48.549> tinting<00:02:49.540> them<00:02:49.690> back

combining them together to form an image

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.720 
combining them together to form an image
I'll<00:02:54.940> show<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.150> what<00:02:55.269> I<00:02:55.299> mean<00:02:55.480> in<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.690> minute

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
I'll show you what I mean in a minute

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.430 
I'll show you what I mean in a minute
okay<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.910> have<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.180> full<00:02:58.540> color<00:02:58.750> image<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.349> I've

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
okay I have a full color image and I've

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.199 
okay I have a full color image and I've
put<00:02:59.650> this<00:02:59.829> sort<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.130> rainbow<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.640> primaries

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
put this sort of rainbow of primaries

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.819 
put this sort of rainbow of primaries
into<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.569> corner<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.349> we<00:03:02.470> can<00:03:02.650> see

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
into the corner so that we can see

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.130 
into the corner so that we can see
what's<00:03:03.010> going<00:03:03.099> on<00:03:03.430> here's<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.450> image<00:03:04.720> and

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
what's going on here's the image and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.839 
what's going on here's the image and
I've<00:03:05.860> put<00:03:06.130> a<00:03:06.160> black<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.610> white<00:03:06.700> adjustment

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
I've put a black and white adjustment

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.050 
I've put a black and white adjustment
layer<00:03:07.299> on<00:03:07.660> top<00:03:07.959> of<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.319> and<00:03:08.860> I've<00:03:09.519> set<00:03:09.849> that

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
layer on top of it and I've set that

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.039 
layer on top of it and I've set that
adjustment<00:03:10.569> layer<00:03:10.860> such<00:03:11.860> that<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.579> emphasizes

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
adjustment layer such that it emphasizes

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.840 
adjustment layer such that it emphasizes
red<00:03:14.049> so<00:03:14.709> red<00:03:14.920> is<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.130> a<00:03:15.190> hundred<00:03:15.310> percent

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
red so red is it a hundred percent

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.879 
red so red is it a hundred percent
yellow<00:03:16.569> and<00:03:16.780> everything<00:03:17.170> else<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.530> at<00:03:17.650> zero

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
yellow and everything else is at zero

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.800 
yellow and everything else is at zero
percent<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.940> can<00:03:19.060> see<00:03:19.239> over<00:03:19.389> here<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:19.720> the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
percent you can see over here in the

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.289 
percent you can see over here in the
rainbow<00:03:20.220> red<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:21.370> white<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:21.970> everything<00:03:22.239> else

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
rainbow red is white and everything else

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.920 
rainbow red is white and everything else
is<00:03:22.510> black<00:03:24.269> not<00:03:25.269> really<00:03:25.329> sure<00:03:25.660> what<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.900> does

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
is black not really sure what it does

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.020 
is black not really sure what it does
with<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.290> mid-tones<00:03:26.709> or<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.310> less<00:03:27.489> saturated

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
with the mid-tones or the less saturated

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.360 
with the mid-tones or the less saturated
colors<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.630> seems<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:28.959> sort<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.230> leave<00:03:30.160> them

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
colors it seems to sort of leave them

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.550 
colors it seems to sort of leave them
alone<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:31.000> attack<00:03:31.780> mainly<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.319> more

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
alone and attack mainly the more

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.819 
alone and attack mainly the more
saturated<00:03:33.160> colors<00:03:33.609> if<00:03:34.209> you<00:03:34.389> make<00:03:34.630> that<00:03:34.959> and

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
saturated colors if you make that and

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.210 
saturated colors if you make that and
that<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:36.970> negative<00:03:37.359> 200<00:03:38.200> or<00:03:38.680> or<00:03:38.920> better

that and that negative 200 or or better

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.729 
that and that negative 200 or or better
still<00:03:39.340> if<00:03:39.970> I<00:03:40.299> what<00:03:40.630> I'm<00:03:40.720> trying<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:40.959> say<00:03:41.170> is<00:03:41.319> if

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
still if I what I'm trying to say is if

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.569 
still if I what I'm trying to say is if
I<00:03:41.889> make<00:03:42.069> everything<00:03:43.620> zero<00:03:47.280> including<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.400> red

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
I make everything zero including the red

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.670 
I make everything zero including the red
I<00:03:48.910> don't<00:03:49.389> have<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.750> black<00:03:50.019> image<00:03:50.380> even<00:03:50.560> though

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
I don't have a black image even though

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.229 
I don't have a black image even though
all<00:03:50.859> the<00:03:50.980> primaries<00:03:51.430> are<00:03:51.579> black<00:03:51.760> so<00:03:52.000> I'm<00:03:52.060> not

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
all the primaries are black so I'm not

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.870 
all the primaries are black so I'm not
really<00:03:52.450> sure<00:03:52.780> exactly<00:03:53.220> what<00:03:54.220> it's<00:03:54.370> doing<00:03:54.730> but

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
really sure exactly what it's doing but

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.759 
really sure exactly what it's doing but
I'm<00:03:54.970> gonna<00:03:55.120> press<00:03:55.569> onward

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
I'm gonna press onward

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.809 
I'm gonna press onward
there's<00:03:57.220> red<00:03:57.489> at<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:57.760> hundred<00:03:57.940> percent<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:59.819> now

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
there's red at a hundred percent and now

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.460 
there's red at a hundred percent and now
I'm<00:04:00.910> gonna<00:04:01.030> tint<00:04:01.389> it<00:04:01.510> by<00:04:01.660> red<00:04:01.930> so<00:04:02.319> that's

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
I'm gonna tint it by red so that's

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.979 
I'm gonna tint it by red so that's
multiplied<00:04:03.099> by<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.400> color<00:04:03.670> red<00:04:03.970> there<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:04.840> is

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
multiplied by the color red there it is

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.650 
multiplied by the color red there it is
and<00:04:05.620> that<00:04:06.220> forms<00:04:06.700> what<00:04:07.000> I'm<00:04:07.090> calling<00:04:07.389> the<00:04:07.480> red

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
and that forms what I'm calling the red

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.170 
and that forms what I'm calling the red
group<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.319> do<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.130> same<00:04:09.340> thing<00:04:09.519> with<00:04:09.639> green<00:04:09.910> and

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
group I do the same thing with green and

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.089 
group I do the same thing with green and
I<00:04:10.389> screen<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.900> red<00:04:11.019> group<00:04:11.260> onto<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.889> green

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
I screen the red group onto the green

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.740 
I screen the red group onto the green
group<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.609> the<00:04:12.940> green<00:04:13.150> group<00:04:13.299> is<00:04:13.480> screened

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
group and the green group is screened

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.660 
group and the green group is screened
onto<00:04:14.049> the<00:04:14.139> blue<00:04:14.319> group

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
onto the blue group

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.080 
onto the blue group
so<00:04:15.440> here's<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.920> green<00:04:17.100> contribution<00:04:17.790> added

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
so here's the green contribution added

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.210 
so here's the green contribution added
and<00:04:18.329> here<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.079> blue<00:04:19.260> contribution<00:04:19.920> added

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
and here is the blue contribution added

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.160 
and here is the blue contribution added
so<00:04:20.790> you<00:04:20.880> can<00:04:21.000> see<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.269> we've<00:04:21.390> reconstructed

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
so you can see that we've reconstructed

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.590

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
invert it I apply this black and white

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.450 
invert it I apply this black and white
procedure<00:05:54.479> to<00:05:54.750> get<00:05:54.870> the<00:05:55.220> contribution<00:05:56.220> from

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
and then I invert it again and that

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:15.330 
and then I invert it again and that
becomes<00:06:08.080> Group<00:06:08.770> one<00:06:09.220> and<00:06:13.830> when<00:06:14.830> I<00:06:14.860> do<00:06:14.980> the<00:06:15.160> same

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
becomes Group one and when I do the same

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:24.680 
becomes Group one and when I do the same
thing<00:06:15.630> for<00:06:18.240> group<00:06:19.240> 2<00:06:19.840> and<00:06:20.460> group<00:06:22.290> 3<00:06:23.290> and

multiply<00:06:25.690> them<00:06:25.840> all<00:06:25.930> together<00:06:26.110> I<00:06:27.120> get<00:06:28.120> this

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
multiply them all together I get this

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.840 
multiply them all together I get this

image and just for the heck of it I

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.420 
image and just for the heck of it I
boosted<00:06:31.810> the<00:06:31.930> brightness<00:06:32.320> a<00:06:32.410> little<00:06:32.620> bit<00:06:32.770> and

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
boosted the brightness a little bit and

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.990 
boosted the brightness a little bit and
I<00:06:33.880> goose<00:06:34.540> the<00:06:35.340> saturation<00:06:36.340> just<00:06:36.370> a<00:06:36.640> little<00:06:36.850> bit

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
I goose the saturation just a little bit

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.930 
I goose the saturation just a little bit
but<00:06:37.570> you<00:06:37.660> can<00:06:37.690> see<00:06:37.840> that<00:06:38.400> from<00:06:39.400> this<00:06:39.610> kind<00:06:39.850> of
