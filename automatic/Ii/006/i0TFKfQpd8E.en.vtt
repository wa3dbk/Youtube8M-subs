00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
of course is a pretty short yeah it's a

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.110 
of course is a pretty short yeah it's a
very<00:03:41.110> short<00:03:41.500> of<00:03:41.560> course<00:03:41.740> but<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.070> mean<00:03:42.220> for<00:03:42.760> a

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
very short of course but I mean for a

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.030 
very short of course but I mean for a
mile<00:03:43.690> you<00:03:43.720> get<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.170> feel<00:03:44.290> everything<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:44.950> you

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
mile you get to feel everything that you

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.520 
mile you get to feel everything that you
would<00:03:45.190> normally<00:03:45.430> feel<00:03:45.940> then<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:47.050> get<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.290> feel

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
would normally feel then you get a feel

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.230 
would normally feel then you get a feel
the<00:03:47.680> acceleration<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.340> feel<00:03:48.640> it<00:03:48.730> corner<00:03:49.090> on

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
the acceleration you feel it corner on

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.360 
the acceleration you feel it corner on
that<00:03:49.420> corner<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:50.500> get<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.650> feel<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:51.070> sharp

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
that corner you get a feel the sharp

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
turn up here yeah and you feel all the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.560 
turn up here yeah and you feel all the
bumps<00:03:55.630> that<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:55.990> can<00:03:56.170> possibly<00:03:56.320> feel<00:03:57.570> overall

bumps that you can possibly feel overall
it's<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.780> fairly<00:03:59.050> good<00:03:59.170> course<00:03:59.410> it<00:03:59.620> would<00:03:59.709> be

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
it's a fairly good course it would be

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.560 
it's a fairly good course it would be
nice<00:04:00.010> if<00:04:00.040> there's<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.400> little<00:04:00.610> bit<00:04:00.700> longer<00:04:00.880> a

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
nice if there's a little bit longer a

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.970 
nice if there's a little bit longer a
little<00:04:01.600> bit<00:04:01.780> faster

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.320 
Challenger you're looking at a $45,000
car<00:04:19.810> that<00:04:20.080> we've<00:04:20.170> compared<00:04:20.530> to<00:04:20.620> this<00:04:20.800> and<00:04:21.330> you

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
car that we've compared to this and you

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.469 
car that we've compared to this and you
get<00:04:22.480> the<00:04:22.600> agreed<00:04:22.870> tonight

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.999 

if<00:04:28.809> you<00:04:28.900> do<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.110> next<00:04:29.289> one<00:04:29.409> attacks<00:04:29.740> on<00:04:29.919> that

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
if you do the next one attacks on that

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:36.010 
if you do the next one attacks on that
actually<00:04:30.309> I<00:04:30.370> can<00:04:30.400> achieve<00:04:30.580> three<00:04:31.029> minutes

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.840 

priced<00:04:37.020> differently<00:04:37.470> aid

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
priced differently aid

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.600 
priced differently aid
these<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.810> ones<00:04:41.050> we<00:04:41.290> have<00:04:41.500> the<00:04:41.860> v6<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.430> blue

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
these the ones we have the v6 the blue

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.440 
these the ones we have the v6 the blue
one<00:04:42.820> is<00:04:43.290> 31,000<00:04:44.290> this<00:04:44.470> one's<00:04:44.820> 37,000<00:04:45.820> but

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
one is 31,000 this one's 37,000 but

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.080 
one is 31,000 this one's 37,000 but
starting<00:04:47.020> price<00:04:47.230> for<00:04:47.470> this<00:04:47.560> one<00:04:47.800> is<00:04:48.010> 32,000<00:04:48.940> so

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
starting price for this one is 32,000 so

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.550 
starting price for this one is 32,000 so
for<00:04:49.300> an<00:04:49.360> extra<00:04:49.570> thousand<00:04:49.930> dollars<00:04:49.960> compared

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
for an extra thousand dollars compared

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.450 
for an extra thousand dollars compared
to<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.710> blue<00:04:50.890> one<00:04:51.040> you're<00:04:51.520> getting<00:04:51.820> a<00:04:51.910> BA<00:04:53.460> Plus

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
to the blue one you're getting a BA Plus

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.950 
to the blue one you're getting a BA Plus
this<00:04:54.670> has<00:04:54.820> an<00:04:54.970> automatic<00:04:55.270> transmission<00:04:55.840> which

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
this has an automatic transmission which

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.860 
this has an automatic transmission which
adds<00:04:56.170> another<00:04:56.560> $1,200<00:04:57.520> under<00:04:57.730> your<00:04:57.850> ticket<00:04:58.150> so

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
adds another $1,200 under your ticket so

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.440 
adds another $1,200 under your ticket so
if<00:04:59.770> you<00:04:59.860> cut<00:05:00.070> that<00:05:00.100> off<00:05:00.400> you<00:05:00.970> can<00:05:01.000> actually<00:05:01.240> go

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
if you cut that off you can actually go

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.670 
if you cut that off you can actually go
and<00:05:01.570> get<00:05:02.560> around<00:05:02.830> them

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.900 

so<00:05:07.680> you're<00:05:07.980> splitting<00:05:08.130> an<00:05:08.340> extra<00:05:08.550> thousand

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
so you're splitting an extra thousand

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.670 
so you're splitting an extra thousand
dollars<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.330> not<00:05:09.360> have<00:05:09.660> to<00:05:09.780> stay<00:05:09.990> in<00:05:10.050> a

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
dollars to not have to stay in a

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:20.540 
dollars to not have to stay in a
transmission<00:05:17.090> power<00:05:18.230> torque<00:05:19.230> and<00:05:19.430> just<00:05:20.430> the

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
transmission power torque and just the

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.280 
transmission power torque and just the
whole<00:05:20.670> overall<00:05:21.030> feel<00:05:21.360> of<00:05:21.390> the<00:05:21.540> jobs<00:05:21.900> is<00:05:22.140> you're

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
whole overall feel of the jobs is you're

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:41.720 
whole overall feel of the jobs is you're
controlling<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.890> power

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730
