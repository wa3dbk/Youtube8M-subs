00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hi i am fa from the words of fa and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.220
 today's do is have a boyfriend or friend saw 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.400
 I do not have a super experience in the 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.530
 field of the friend god says proud 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.139
 not so much in the boyfriends but 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.900
 of drinks in the field in the couple that 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.789
 the friends but I have a couple of friends and 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.880
 friends who have decided to leave for the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.380
 way of friends and by those of boy 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.970
 that do not have as many commitments with the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.740
 other not from outings with the family 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.370
 to walk necessarily in the hand 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.020
 My friends say there is no jealousy but 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.420
 I do not think so I think it's a 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.710
 more like it bothers me that sometimes with her 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.270
 but I can tell you nothing because it is not a 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.399
 commanded merchant officer I suppose 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.800
 depends what you want at that moment of 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.260
 your life is preferred to have a relationship 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.539
 it would be like a boyfriend or something more casual 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.489
 as a friend saw here we got to 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.860
 our favorite part of the video that 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.289
 says the voice of experience for 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.660
 some people will be father there is no 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.240
 so much commitment but there is also the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.400
 another side of the coin where 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.590
 there are people who like to walk 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.840
 hand and they like to know that the 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.520
 person for whom they care 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.770
 what they are interested in or what they want 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.890
 sister grabbing love feels the same 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.150
 and not as much as a classification of that 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.850
 You are mine and I am yours 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.790
 but more like a clarification of 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.130
 formality not that if he never tells you that 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.440
 wants to go out with you or wants to 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.320
 this one that is his girlfriend or wants him to be 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.120
 her boyfriend does not mean that he does not 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.880
 amount is the only thing I'm saying 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.620
 is that there are people who enjoy more 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.510
 have something formal 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.040
 apart from the dinners you 're going to have with 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.900
 your boyfriend's family maybe they're going to 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.940
 make uncomfortable means at the beginning 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.550
 because it's like then also 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.860
 come in like I have purple hair 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.900
 It's super understandable but already after 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.610
 you usually do not and if you like them and you 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.290
 they fall well because it's fine father and 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.930
 talks well father with everything if sometimes 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.280
 this you forget that you are there with your 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.530
 boyfriend because these rudeness with the 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.990
 cousins or aunts or mom no and apart 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.040
 they cook rich or things like that I think 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.940
 but 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.770
 what do you prefer boyfriends or friends or 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.150
 at this moment I had to think better 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.340
 the formal or informal 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.590
 tell me down here in the comments of 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.530
 video or also on twitter with the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.850
 hashtag the doubt that I enjoy to myself or to the 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.470
 koala whoever you want to write but 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.530
 remember to spend because if you do not know 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.940
 lose your tweet let's solve the doubt that 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.990
 it's all for today so I'll see you in the 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.990
 next question bye 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.129
 to have a boyfriend or a son of mine but many 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.790
 of the words amigovio to have no 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.790
 we had friends
