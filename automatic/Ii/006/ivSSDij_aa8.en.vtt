 good afternoon hello good afternoon tense 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:38.330
 here of cold winter with sun but cold 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.970
 let's talk today about tactics but that 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.640
 it is necessary to have a tactic one 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.930
 good tactic or what is the tactic that 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.930
 It depends on the player 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:55.679
 It is technique that you have to be able to do 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:55.679
 one or another thing and to be able 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.820
 there are exercises to work to be able 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.640
 the exercises you do on the track 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.790
 we say that what you train is 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.080
 the trips if you do not train it you can have 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.229
 the talent to do it but if not 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.050
 you will train much better 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.210
 of the four rings 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.190
 it means we're going to do what we're going to 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.030
 put 4 hours on track and go to 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.550
 try to change or catch the opponent 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.850
 to contrarpié in fact it is a good 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.790
 Tactics if you are able to do it 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.330
 what we are going to do today is how to make 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.780
 change the player make two directions 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.020
 two directions that way moves to 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.530
 player to the side makes him a 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.480
 contrapié moves it towards the other makes it 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.970
 another against foot this is one of the 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.880
 exercises that way you always have 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.820
 your opponent in motion requires 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.420
 that you can change the address very well 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.960
 but if you do not work it 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.960
 it does 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.400
 now it cuts a long change of 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.170
 address one short one long 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.790
 it's a tactic 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.550
 to have a player always in 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.069
 movement is a kind of tactics other 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.060
 kind of tactics is what we are 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.770
 watching here 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:58.030
 5 1 circle 2 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:03.580
 circle 3 circle 4 to each circle you 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:05.170
 we give a number 1 2 3 and 4 and mentally 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.480
 in the points you do it in four 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.569
 four strokes and you think what numbers you're going 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.690
 to do 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.980
 for example 1 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.340
 two short three 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.919
 and four lengths that way always 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.690
 you have the player in motion we are going to 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:28.520
 see it one long two short backhand three 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.520
 on the other side four there 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:58.460
 we see it from right 1 2 3 and 4 and so what 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.280
 you are working depending on what 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.830
 player are you can do one or the other 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.060
 thing now we explain the types the 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.060
 four types of players
