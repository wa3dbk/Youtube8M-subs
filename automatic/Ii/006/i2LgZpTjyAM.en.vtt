 it was the nature of Mexican blood what 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.350

 support endure interest departure 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.820
 mission contribution 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.840
 all right 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.010
 hi what am i dancing he can 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.730
 be teaching a little how to use 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.450
 the letter that is the attack 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.390
 they were asking me 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.130
 and I'm going to start doing this cheeks 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.470
 well this guy for those who go 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.860
 starting to play it or not having so much 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.270
 experience 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.100
 I had a little bit of the mind is 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.410
 Downloading a project is fine 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.740
 signs how the letter is used and at the same 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.690
 I'll show you how to train 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.900
 and what to download and all that this 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:25.530
 the letter the letter is the letter of attack 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.930
 with this you can do several 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:34.250
 functions so to speak the first one is 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:37.220
 as a kind of movement 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.650
 either let 's say what for example press 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.130
 the letter lights the red circle if 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.610
 you can see it and apart it gives you the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.380
 attack range of the auto attack this what 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.640
 I can press with the left click 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.909
 where I'm going 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.299
 and so I can see it possible for back 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.980
 What is the letter for and how is it used? 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.950
 as if you were saying the movement 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.350
 but when you press with the letter and what 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.910
 you click backwards it's going to hit 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:13.540
 to the adversary or the child or what he has 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.000
 enemy closer to that of the champion who 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.290
 we are using let's say there's no 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.049
 none 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.459
 this random minion must be used 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:27.280
 then he did this pendeja this 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.500
 stupid advance in this and have a lot 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.510
 potential changos there we going 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.700
 nothing if they are fixed because they are outside the 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.799
 rank but what if I put myself here 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.530
 and although I walk backwards but to the 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.280
 time to do that press the letter and it 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.640
 Opera 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.120
 to the nearest enemy this you can 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.100
 do to be called remove at the time 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.170
 to be fighting and this is like a 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.960
 to go running backwards and attacking 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.690
 to bad weather always to the hero more 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.380
 closest to you I recommend this 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.200
 a lot for there are carts more than anything 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.260
 because the focus the last in fact and things 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.260
 A) Yes 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.420
 you see normally they say hit him the 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.970
 lane then if you click on it 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.920
 right is going to be worth a kilo of real 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.689
 is the criticism is going to get in the way 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.489
 of the media in the midst of the others 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.840
 champions can be tucked up inside 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.090
 the tower to hit the champion that 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.280
 you chose but if you do it by means of 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.250
 What you do, throwing on the floor is 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.510
 always hit the closest one always 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.510
 you're going to hit the nearby sea 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.230
 and with this it helps you a little bit more 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.849
 movement of your champion but that's 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.099
