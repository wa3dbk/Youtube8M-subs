or you know something somehow you got
tricked<00:00:28.880> into<00:00:29.060> installing<00:00:29.689> this<00:00:29.960> thing<00:00:30.170> on

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
tricked into installing this thing on

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.790 
tricked into installing this thing on
your<00:00:30.439> PC<00:00:31.149> and<00:00:32.149> then<00:00:32.210> there's<00:00:33.050> a<00:00:33.109> rootkit<00:00:33.319> part

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
your PC and then there's a rootkit part

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.369 
your PC and then there's a rootkit part
the<00:00:34.249> rootkit<00:00:34.460> is<00:00:34.850> you<00:00:35.359> know<00:00:35.449> it's<00:00:35.719> malware<00:00:36.260> or

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
the rootkit is you know it's malware or

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.869 
the rootkit is you know it's malware or
malicious<00:00:36.409> software<00:00:36.920> that<00:00:37.339> gains<00:00:37.579> rude

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
malicious software that gains rude

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.229 
malicious software that gains rude
access<00:00:38.479> to<00:00:39.109> your<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.799> your<00:00:39.889> PC<00:00:40.370> root<00:00:40.819> access

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
access to your to your PC root access

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.939 
access to your to your PC root access
means<00:00:41.479> like<00:00:41.600> administrative<00:00:42.350> capabilities

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
means like administrative capabilities

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:44.309 
means like administrative capabilities
so<00:00:43.069> it<00:00:43.249> can<00:00:43.370> go<00:00:43.519> in<00:00:43.639> and<00:00:43.760> do<00:00:43.819> anything<00:00:44.030> it<00:00:44.239> wants

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:44.319 
so it can go in and do anything it wants

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:47.020 
so it can go in and do anything it wants
so<00:00:45.319> once<00:00:45.559> it<00:00:45.709> does<00:00:45.889> that<00:00:46.129> then<00:00:46.429> it<00:00:46.549> you<00:00:46.940> know

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
so once it does that then it you know

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.549 
so once it does that then it you know
it's<00:00:47.179> particularly<00:00:47.539> nasty<00:00:47.899> because<00:00:48.229> it<00:00:48.379> can

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
it's particularly nasty because it can

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.199 
it's particularly nasty because it can
interweave<00:00:48.979> itself<00:00:49.429> in<00:00:49.609> with<00:00:49.729> your<00:00:49.879> operating

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:50.209 
interweave itself in with your operating

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:53.079 
interweave itself in with your operating
system<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:50.629> they<00:00:50.749> do<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.739> that<00:00:51.769> if<00:00:52.609> you<00:00:52.969> do

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
system and they do so that if you do

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:54.279 
system and they do so that if you do
something<00:00:53.329> like<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:53.629> do<00:00:53.839> a<00:00:53.869> directory

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
something like you do a directory

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.109 
something like you do a directory
listing<00:00:54.409> or<00:00:54.979> you're<00:00:55.100> trying<00:00:55.249> to<00:00:55.399> find<00:00:55.670> it<00:00:55.940> you

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:56.119 
listing or you're trying to find it you

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:57.549 
listing or you're trying to find it you
know<00:00:56.149> say<00:00:56.389> in<00:00:56.479> the<00:00:56.569> process<00:00:56.780> table<00:00:57.440> or

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
know say in the process table or

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.109 
know say in the process table or
something<00:00:57.769> well<00:00:58.219> you<00:00:58.309> can<00:00:58.489> see<00:00:58.670> it<00:00:58.789> doing<00:00:59.089> that

00:00:59.109 --> 00:00:59.119 
something well you can see it doing that

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:01.899 
something well you can see it doing that
and<00:00:59.869> it<00:01:00.199> can<00:01:00.649> block<00:01:01.219> itself<00:01:01.670> from<00:01:01.850> being

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
and it can block itself from being

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.420 
and it can block itself from being
listed<00:01:02.510> in<00:01:02.749> the<00:01:02.959> in<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.559> directory<00:01:04.070> listing

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
listed in the in the directory listing

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.999 
listed in the in the directory listing
or<00:01:04.640> in<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.479> process<00:01:06.020> table<00:01:06.320> or<00:01:06.710> whatever

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
or in the process table or whatever

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:08.740 
or in the process table or whatever
you're<00:01:07.250> doing<00:01:07.520> it<00:01:07.909> can<00:01:08.119> also<00:01:08.299> monitor<00:01:08.719> your

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
you're doing it can also monitor your

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.389 
you're doing it can also monitor your
network<00:01:09.140> traffic<00:01:09.289> and<00:01:09.799> redirect<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:10.369> to

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
network traffic and redirect you to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:12.730 
network traffic and redirect you to
other<00:01:10.640> places<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:11.479> can<00:01:11.840> monitor<00:01:12.619> your

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
other places it can monitor your

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.490 
other places it can monitor your
keyboard<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.909> it's<00:01:14.509> just<00:01:14.750> it's<00:01:15.109> really<00:01:15.350> a

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
keyboard and it's just it's really a

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.959 
keyboard and it's just it's really a
nasty<00:01:15.920> thing<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.159> have<00:01:16.310> on<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:16.789> it's<00:01:16.909> very

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
nasty thing to have on it and it's very

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:18.490 
nasty thing to have on it and it's very
difficult<00:01:17.329> to<00:01:17.630> get<00:01:17.750> rid<00:01:17.929> of<00:01:17.960> because<00:01:18.200> it's

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
difficult to get rid of because it's

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.990 
difficult to get rid of because it's
inter<00:01:18.740> woven<00:01:19.070> in<00:01:19.280> with<00:01:19.429> the<00:01:19.520> operating<00:01:19.909> system

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
inter woven in with the operating system

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.800 
inter woven in with the operating system
so<00:01:20.450> if<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:21.170> do<00:01:21.380> things<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:22.729> it's<00:01:23.210> aware<00:01:23.600> of

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
so if you do things that it's aware of

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.690 
so if you do things that it's aware of
and<00:01:23.990> it's<00:01:24.049> programmed<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:24.920> can<00:01:25.070> block<00:01:25.310> stuff

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
and it's programmed it can block stuff

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.050 
and it's programmed it can block stuff
but<00:01:26.240> there<00:01:26.329> are<00:01:26.479> some<00:01:26.719> free<00:01:27.640> anti-rootkit<00:01:28.640> or

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
then you can run a tool this the reason

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.250 
then you can run a tool this the reason
why<00:03:16.640> safe<00:03:16.970> mode<00:03:17.209> works<00:03:17.420> better<00:03:17.690> because<00:03:17.959> safe
