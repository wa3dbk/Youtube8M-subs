this<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.370> how<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.609> works

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.130

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
alright many others have also asked for

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.440 
alright many others have also asked for
the<00:03:46.410> touch<00:03:46.590> screen<00:03:46.770> support<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:47.970> was<00:03:48.090> added

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
the touch screen support so it was added

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.500 
the touch screen support so it was added
to<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.600> game<00:03:49.130> however<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.460> still<00:03:50.760> requires

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
to the game however it still requires

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.750 
to the game however it still requires
you<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:53.390> touch<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.840> screen<00:03:55.160> hold<00:03:56.160> down<00:03:56.490> and

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
you to touch the screen hold down and

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.080 

so<00:04:13.810> basically<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.890> money<00:04:15.070> you<00:04:15.790> move<00:04:15.970> the

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
so basically you money you move the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.630 
so basically you money you move the
cross<00:04:16.270> right<00:04:16.510> cross<00:04:16.810> curl<00:04:17.590> on<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.160> screen<00:04:18.430> and

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
cross right cross curl on the screen and

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:26.980 
cross right cross curl on the screen and
then<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.330> talk<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.750> fire

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.080 

still<00:04:27.590> you<00:04:27.830> need<00:04:27.949> to<00:04:28.160> be<00:04:28.550> really<00:04:28.819> quick<00:04:29.030> to

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
still you need to be really quick to

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.879 
still you need to be really quick to
make<00:04:29.389> sure<00:04:29.599> that<00:04:29.810> you<00:04:29.930> can<00:04:30.080> blow<00:04:30.319> the<00:04:30.530> right<00:04:30.710> up

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
make sure that you can blow the right up

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.320 
make sure that you can blow the right up
there<00:04:31.130> before<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.789> reaches<00:04:32.060> your<00:04:32.180> city<00:04:32.509> right

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
there before it reaches your city right

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.820 
there before it reaches your city right
the<00:04:35.330> touchscreen<00:04:35.870> controls<00:04:36.470> were

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
the touchscreen controls were

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.350 
the touchscreen controls were
implemented<00:04:37.160> in<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:37.460> way<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.060> doesn't

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
implemented in a way that it doesn't

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.029 
implemented in a way that it doesn't
really<00:04:38.449> matter<00:04:38.660> where<00:04:39.259> you<00:04:39.289> tap<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.919> screen

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
really matter where you tap the screen

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.820 
really matter where you tap the screen
or<00:04:40.400> put<00:04:40.610> your<00:04:40.759> finger<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.630> still<00:04:41.960> are<00:04:42.139> able<00:04:42.349> to

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
or put your finger you still are able to

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.520 
or put your finger you still are able to
aim<00:04:43.039> and<00:04:43.220> fire<00:04:43.460> so<00:04:44.270> it<00:04:44.509> doesn't<00:04:44.720> mean<00:04:44.840> that<00:04:45.169> we

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
aim and fire so it doesn't mean that we

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.439 
aim and fire so it doesn't mean that we
need<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.680> cover<00:04:45.979> the<00:04:46.250> crosshair<00:04:46.729> and<00:04:46.849> move<00:04:47.270> it

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
need to cover the crosshair and move it

00:04:47.449 --> 00:05:02.930 
need to cover the crosshair and move it
you<00:04:48.139> basically<00:04:48.349> tap<00:04:48.740> anywhere<00:04:49.099> on<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.370> screen

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:13.070 

so<00:05:04.740> top<00:05:05.740> hold<00:05:06.370> down<00:05:06.639> move<00:05:08.039> top<00:05:09.039> again<00:05:09.370> to<00:05:10.120> fire

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.140 

basically<00:05:14.080> that<00:05:14.110> would<00:05:14.590> be<00:05:14.740> in<00:05:15.130> this<00:05:15.310> I<00:05:15.639> guess

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
basically that would be in this I guess

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.450 
basically that would be in this I guess
short<00:05:16.479> video<00:05:16.720> tutorial<00:05:17.199> have<00:05:17.979> fun<00:05:18.190> with<00:05:18.340> the
