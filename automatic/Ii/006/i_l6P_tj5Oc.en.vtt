00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.760
 to be the protagonist I think the team 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.230
 he understood it that way we look for it at all times 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.309
 without despairing things that in others 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.710
 matches has passed we finished 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.320
 falling in the pitch I think today 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.750
 We kept calm and that's why the 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.520
 goal more than action against we had 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.980
 created situations like to open the 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.230
 marker yes we knew it was going to be 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.570
 that way most teams 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.550
 on this court 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.619
 pose in the game well and good 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.510
 we knew that it was going to be a 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.880
 hard match they unfold well and 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.220
 they try to get out fast against but 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.300
 but I think what we find space 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.170
 there we had no end or in the last 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.670
 pass that one thing to improve but 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.230
 yes we handle the ball well and we do not 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.500
 we despair if obvious that victory 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.239
 it helps to keep working a little 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.739
 calmer and try to cut that 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.289
 streak and good now we have another match 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.300
 and we know that this shirt always 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.660
 you have to try to win every game that 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.969
 I played like to finish this semester 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.220
 that has not been good but with another 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.909
 image and think about what's coming I think 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.090
 that is out there I had 45 inaccuracies in 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.939
 the first time but I also think that 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.560
 and many many correct passes or try 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.350
 of managing well the ball that was what 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.969
 that the technician had not requested 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.810
 good the second time go out and leave 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:29.969
 fast but but good I think it was a 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.969
 general good team match 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.530
 Well, I know that maybe a little more is missing 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.799
 children with them as you watched the game not 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.600
 I saw that the forwards we 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.700
 our intention was that manu 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.709
 will close and you will end up getting hitched 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.349
 I think he has been able to do it several times 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.119
 that's why I say that the stitch out there 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:51.849
 final we do not lack a little and maybe 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.619
 that's why you do not notice but but I think that 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:55.929
 the forwards felt good 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.299
 accompanied in a statement that they 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.950
 they replicate well there are many people in the 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.079
 medium and it gets complicated but I think that 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.039
 even so we find our spaces and 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:07.810
 We could always try to play a lot of 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.009
 that maybe you can go some 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.929
 players and also want the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.450
 monumental was necessary yes or yes the 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.739
 time itself but beyond that which 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.110
 he spoke I think that we as a group 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.670
 we are united we know for 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.710
 so we were confident what 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.530
 we have and we know that the technician 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.950
 they have all the respect and everything 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.950
 our support
