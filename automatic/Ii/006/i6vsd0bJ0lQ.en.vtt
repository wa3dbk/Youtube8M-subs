of<00:00:46.250> a<00:00:46.340> nightmare<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:46.760> this<00:00:47.030> one<00:00:47.180> over<00:00:47.210> here

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
of a nightmare and this one over here

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.940 
of a nightmare and this one over here
has<00:00:47.570> been<00:00:47.660> sensitive<00:00:48.260> every<00:00:48.440> time<00:00:48.590> I've<00:00:48.740> taken

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
has been sensitive every time I've taken

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.100 
has been sensitive every time I've taken
the<00:00:49.100> filter<00:00:49.460> out<00:00:49.640> it's<00:00:50.360> been<00:00:50.480> really<00:00:50.690> hard<00:00:50.990> to

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
the filter out it's been really hard to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.320 
the filter out it's been really hard to
get<00:00:51.200> it<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.440> stop<00:00:51.650> leaking<00:00:51.980> again<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:53.000> anyway<00:00:53.300> I

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
get it to stop leaking again so anyway I

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.360 
get it to stop leaking again so anyway I
come<00:00:53.630> up<00:00:53.750> with<00:00:53.780> I<00:00:54.380> come<00:00:54.680> up<00:00:54.800> with<00:00:54.830> something

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
come up with I come up with something

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.480 
come up with I come up with something
that<00:00:55.520> I<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:56.350> think<00:00:57.350> will<00:00:57.500> really<00:00:57.710> alleviate

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
that I I think will really alleviate

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.820 
that I I think will really alleviate
that<00:00:58.520> in<00:00:58.910> there<00:00:59.090> like<00:00:59.330> really<00:00:59.750> freeing<00:01:00.530> dead

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
that in there like really freeing dead

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.010 
that in there like really freeing dead
simple<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:01.220> make<00:01:01.430> it's<00:01:02.360> an<00:01:02.510> inline<00:01:02.810> filter

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
simple to make it's an inline filter

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.140 
simple to make it's an inline filter
that<00:01:03.470> you<00:01:03.650> can<00:01:03.920> put<00:01:04.220> right<00:01:04.430> at<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:04.670> top<00:01:04.879> of

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
that you can put right at the top of

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.499 
that you can put right at the top of
your<00:01:05.630> reservoir<00:01:06.430> if<00:01:07.430> you're<00:01:07.759> using<00:01:08.030> half<00:01:08.299> inch

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
your reservoir if you're using half inch

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.209 
your reservoir if you're using half inch
tubing<00:01:08.780> like<00:01:08.990> I<00:01:09.020> am<00:01:09.289> like<00:01:09.530> you<00:01:09.829> know<00:01:09.920> my<00:01:10.070> whole

tubing like I am like you know my whole

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:12.580 
tubing like I am like you know my whole
system<00:01:10.850> up<00:01:10.969> my<00:01:11.119> whole<00:01:11.299> supply<00:01:11.810> is<00:01:11.929> is<00:01:12.259> built

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
system up my whole supply is is built

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.289 
system up my whole supply is is built
like<00:01:12.649> this<00:01:12.770> with<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.159> water<00:01:13.340> supply<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:13.880> then

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
like this with the water supply and then

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.899 
like this with the water supply and then
my<00:01:14.450> diverter<00:01:14.780> at<00:01:14.929> the<00:01:15.049> top<00:01:15.520> so<00:01:16.520> what<00:01:16.759> I've<00:01:16.880> done

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
my diverter at the top so what I've done

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.840 
my diverter at the top so what I've done
is<00:01:17.090> I've<00:01:17.420> turned<00:01:18.350> this<00:01:18.499> into<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:19.100> little<00:01:19.640> filter

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
is I've turned this into a little filter

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.370 
is I've turned this into a little filter
and<00:01:21.640> it's<00:01:22.640> just<00:01:23.030> a<00:01:23.179> piece<00:01:23.929> of<00:01:23.960> half<00:01:24.170> inch

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
and it's just a piece of half inch

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.649 
and it's just a piece of half inch
tubing<00:01:24.679> that<00:01:24.829> I<00:01:24.979> have<00:01:25.369> expanded<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.149> edges<00:01:26.509> on

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
tubing that I have expanded the edges on

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.020 
tubing that I have expanded the edges on
the<00:01:27.049> ends<00:01:27.319> on<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:27.679> that'll<00:01:27.920> fit<00:01:28.159> well<00:01:28.369> and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.840 

inside<00:01:32.259> I'm<00:01:33.280> slipping<00:01:34.280> one<00:01:34.399> of<00:01:34.549> these<00:01:34.639> you

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
to get flexible I'll let her get real

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.600 
to get flexible I'll let her get real
good<00:05:16.100> and<00:05:16.190> flexible

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
there's one end of the fitting made now

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.959 
there's one end of the fitting made now
this<00:05:45.729> time<00:05:46.000> I<00:05:46.530> just<00:05:47.530> hold<00:05:48.009> it<00:05:48.129> with<00:05:48.639> the<00:05:48.759> tip<00:05:48.909> of
