00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
through the cards in order to try and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.560 
through the cards in order to try and
memorize<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:04.019> order<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.220> deck<00:01:05.570> now

memorize the order of the deck now

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.020 
memorize the order of the deck now
usually<00:01:07.380> I'll<00:01:07.439> take<00:01:07.619> about<00:01:07.740> 10<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.130> 15<00:01:08.580> seconds

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
usually I'll take about 10 to 15 seconds

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.850 
usually I'll take about 10 to 15 seconds
to<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.290> case<00:01:10.530> I'll<00:01:10.830> just

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
to do this but in this case I'll just

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.219 
to do this but in this case I'll just
end<00:01:11.220> five<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.939> ten<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> should<00:01:13.110> have

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
end five to ten so I should have

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.200 
end five to ten so I should have
memorized<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> order<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.820> make<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.000> more

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
memorized the order but to make it more

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.800 
memorized the order but to make it more
difficult

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
difficult

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.140 
difficult

craft I'm going to set it down to one

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.480 
craft I'm going to set it down to one
side<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.210> case<00:01:27.450> way<00:01:27.659> over<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:28.490> so
