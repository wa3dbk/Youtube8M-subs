00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Dieter I just said sketchup and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.460
 zokora are worlds in between and 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.870
 Both of these actually keep you entertained 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.890
 a lot of fun that you notice every time you 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.349
 enjoy it here 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.269
 I recently read sketchup 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.820
 definitely not coming over again 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.820
 you did not want any more we did not want to 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.130
 more because we never wanted to do that 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.779
 not allowed then , of course , I have to 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.330
 ask we wanted to do it one 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.369
 a little bit more grip so sometimes 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.010
 the things to the corners and edges ans 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.940
 canned go and wanted that 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.170
 gentlemen from the transmitter not so one can 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.640
 Of course you could say something 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.129
 of course theoretically say im now 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.050
 end effect is indeed the spectator 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.700
 the one who says we want something 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.950
 So you could actually times 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.570
 Write me to the colleagues of the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.480
 West German radio chancellor wants yes 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.320
 that was not that was the Bavarian 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.700
 maybe everything about the Bavarian 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.379
 just write white comes anyway 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.329
 otherwise the ketchup niesslein is easy 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.469
 I want to say that as ketchup 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.879
 actually like to see you again then 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.579
 Can you clean it in when Michael? 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.320
 another form yes or yes everything was always 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.550
 very funny had us much trouble 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.500
 given and we were very concerned about the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.510
 acceptance for that means in German 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.640
 from the audience very happy 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.979
 thank you again not only 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.479
 interpret something that others 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.479
 but he writes yes 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.310
 also very much for yourself but also for 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.380
 others yes, if I always come to that 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.470
 Again this is always between the things 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.110
 which you have to do then and the last ones 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.250
 Years were a bit filled there 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.110
 you do not get there but if it is 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.370
 a bit quieter then I will sit 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.560
 also and just says soko says 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.000
 his last role was that you have 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.070
 itself written the exit sequence 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.330
 I wrote myself but means 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.130
 just a few things like mine 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.780
 can imagine lying on the table 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.870
 just in things where you then already 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.910
 longer, big comedy series six works 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.680
 I share now or so then 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.020
 a flyer story could also be one 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.680
 series from it will be the flight ticket 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.060
 unfortunately flew 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.780
 it is not captured is no no no 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.950
 that's what I was going to do about it though 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.780
 Always gone because you are not long enough 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.040
 not often enough did not succeed often 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.200
 if i could not almost weather it 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.180
 and if it suits then weather could 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.370
 you and then a ticket 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.020
 eventually gone really well from 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.110
 front remakes now I would have very 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.560
 to test again from the beginning and 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.870
 I had actually sworn to myself 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.910
 then the last exam and she still 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.630
 I can do all this 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.670
 do not say guilty 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.470
 President of the Government and are to be learned 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.480
 that would not have it anymore 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.280
 I do not need to know if I do that again 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.140
 but if you just just exam 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.610
 You said that you have an idea that I like very much 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.530
 nice because we all believe me 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.209
 somewhere everyone thinks of the person 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.709
 Back to school remembers one 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.220
 one or the other forms to the one 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.650
 or other poker to one or more 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.570
 others dispute the first love everything 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.350
 what does that mean you have everything 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.000
 wrote 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.860
 your own guilt is not yet 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.360
 all a bit of material collection 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.070
 I started at some point 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.780
 time to do a book that way 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.440
 actually starts on the first day of school 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.600
 the diether cancer at 67 years and 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.280
 stops with the last day on the 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.140
 acting school because in time for 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.480
 I was really busy 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.640
 and also very funny things happened 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.680
 that should not be sad 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.209
 book will be very enjoyable 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.000
 You're better off following the book 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.680
 Dear seriously I already liked 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.269
 but there is very little to laugh about 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.970
 That's why I write my son 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.330
 To laugh tells where it is cool and 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:35.530
 moritz motor is over there on the salza 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:38.620
 But it is now too 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.500
 a very funny mask is not in a good mood 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.370
 he has invented the altistin is im 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.530
 october 2011 in september september 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.069
 8 so moritz it kocks and the ten 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.900
 is already sleeping at height again 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:55.519
 I hope he has come home 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.799
 been when the plants in the 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.030
 winning round moves on the finder 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.959
 to take the device apart or 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.959
 anyway nonsense
