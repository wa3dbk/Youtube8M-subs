00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
past now from crossing that can be

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.039 
past now from crossing that can be
deadly<00:03:14.340> because<00:03:14.760> he<00:03:14.909> puts<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.299> ball<00:03:15.510> in<00:03:15.719> the

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
deadly because he puts that ball in the

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.289 
deadly because he puts that ball in the
corridor<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.620> uncertainty<00:03:20.090> keeper<00:03:21.090> can't
