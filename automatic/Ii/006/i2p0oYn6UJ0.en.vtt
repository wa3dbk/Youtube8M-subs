 Underwear is one of the most 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.979
 innovations of the century is what 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.439
 transformations has had throughout 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.080
 the years and how it has developed 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.280
 technologically obviously so that by 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.280
 please the clothes 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.620
 inside the male underwear there are 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.480
 three let's say three styles that more than 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.380
 most common are that they are the ones that have just 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.149
 See the boxer hairstyle and the tight boxer 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.970
 which is ideal when you have clothes 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.770
 trousers and so on that I do not know 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.110
 it shows you that it is very comfortable because it is 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:20.390
 100% cotton leaves conspire the skin and 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.850
 these this signature that today I bring that 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.100
 It's more than 100 years old, that's why I chose it 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.860
 so that you knew her and are the 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.540
 pioneers of men's underwear and 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.739
 they have had 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.950
 many variants what the truffle is like 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.989
 we know her usually crosses it with 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.810
 one thing that is called that they created 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.239
 what cool call 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.370
 it is an inverted that is a cut 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.650
 special is the cut that you have in the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.690
 front what a good thing that this year 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.239
 as part of what they highlighted 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.390
 more with seasonal colors and with 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.280
 special colors that present these and 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.700
 these colors which if for this 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.349
 season is of all variants of 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.150
 the spring that is the turquoise that 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.090
 we just saw also the coral there 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.370
 yellows there are fluorescent and good 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.860
 obviously the best-selling garment 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.470
 at least in Mexico are the boxers 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.750
 adjusted because they are the most comfortable that 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.690
 really there are also loose boxers that 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.180
 is when the do not have so much thread 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.830
 Elastane and go looser is like a 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.740
 pants with short shorts 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:33.280
 let's say with or without waistband 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.470
 but you know they are not so comfortable for 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.300
 exercise for example to be 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.180
 comfortable in your house now red for 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.520
 sleep those are like we said but these 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.190
 which are the adjusted boxer is 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.690
 really the one that is most appropriate 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.580
 to do all the activities at 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.440
 long day does not decide what is the 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.490
 material that predominates in each of 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.460
 these little clothes and you know what is the 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.070
 cotton and conil or the aspan or what 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.700
 we know as line craft or what before 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:06.340
 of lycra and this but there is in this 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.730
 variant 1 that is madrid and that is good 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.250
 super technology that makes you not go up 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.990
 So much so that we regulate the 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.440
 body temperature that is 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.290
 wonderful for men and it is also 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.730
 super comfortable do not notice the seams of 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.290
 so that behind a pair of trousers 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.240
 dress or jeans are not going to notice 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.160
 super necessary precisely because one 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.780
 of the main cares of man 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.210
 they have to be at a temperature more 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.070
 cool precisely not exactly and 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.780
 animal we do not see what the colors are 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.420
 citric 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:41.449
 the colors of spring-summer and 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:44.599
 It is very good and good with 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:47.900
 front is a special cut that is very 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:50.629
 comfortable and also the elastic that has in 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.400
 the waist and in the calf is also 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:54.710
 very comfortable is very comfortable for 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.150
 men for that kind of clothes and their 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.779
 record if you're in dress pants 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.520
 you also do not notice a fabric is you 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:03.289
 it hits like a second skin really 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.939
 surely and good also the clothes 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:09.169
 interior would also encompass what they are 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:10.520
 the desserts this the so much for the 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.469
 people mostly for men who 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.719
 sweat a lot so they do not stain the 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:17.449
 shirt well if there are some men that 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:20.870
 such prefer to bring a picture 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.699
 put so much or something not but and something else 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.189
 which is also to say the care for 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.680
 to wash these types of garments is that 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:31.960
 it is recommended to wash 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:36.830
 in warm water in cold water and leave 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.210
 hung up because I'm starting to what 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:47.539
 better to leave them 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:49.130
 the sun also really very comfortable that is 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.570
 because many times we think that the 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.400
 food the woman's clothes and that the detail 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.169
 of the moon also has to be like 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.990
 he has to think that he's leading up and he 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.720
 already adjusts better and also like the 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.460
 women not an undergarment that 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.259
 It would seem that you can not see but the truth is 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.120
 what makes you feel safe makes you feel 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:07.729
 comfortable back before which you look very good 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.039
 not if this is a difference between clothes 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.680
 interior and male lingerie too 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.690
 there is a hand of liberals and it is the 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.840
 underwear but there has been a series 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.360
 of changes in command throughout the 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.130
 the times that since good were the 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.030
 pants has been in males with 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:28.790
 suspenders like the like the complete with 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:32.240
 sleeves and pants is like a pajama 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.320
 and then good they innovated with what 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.169
 what are things 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.300
 they are the creators of this one 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.009
 of this short pants of this clothes 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.289
 outside is very interesting the truth the 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.879
 history of men's underwear and 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:46.409
 feminine is that we have seen it 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:48.629
 long history and if good at 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:50.189
 better and then my brother no longer uses the 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:51.779
 same underwear that my dad already 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:54.930
 better my dad married the idea that 

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:56.610
 I use nothing else like cross cut to me 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.319
 I do not like to wear pants I felt 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.300
 as the best because they have not had the 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:02.520
 opportunity but it 's time that 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.979
 meet at the opportunity to try something 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.110
 different and something to say too very 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:09.990
 very important we also have 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.479
 that the right to choose what we want to 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.069
 we tell them that women are 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:16.289
 always the one that buys from the soft 

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:18.389
 your clothes is that lady go write it down your 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:22.560
 couple her underwear decided me 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:25.650
 I loved with this is tight of 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:28.759
 accompany the women we are going to listen 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.759
 that does not have
