hello friends this video on diversity in

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.720 
hello friends this video on diversity in
living<00:00:03.240> world<00:00:03.510> part<00:00:04.049> 5<00:00:04.440> is<00:00:04.980> brought<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.520> you<00:00:05.700> by

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
living world part 5 is brought to you by

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.990 
living world part 5 is brought to you by
exampie<00:00:06.600> Oh<00:00:06.629> calm<00:00:07.170> no<00:00:07.680> more<00:00:07.950> fear<00:00:08.220> from<00:00:08.550> exam

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
exampie Oh calm no more fear from exam

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.530 
exampie Oh calm no more fear from exam
so<00:00:09.929> let<00:00:10.080> us<00:00:10.110> talk<00:00:10.469> about<00:00:10.530> yet<00:00:11.429> another<00:00:11.820> feature

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
so let us talk about yet another feature

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.620 
so let us talk about yet another feature
or<00:00:12.960> characteristic<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:13.980> defines<00:00:14.190> life<00:00:14.849> that

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
or characteristic that defines life that

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.060 
or characteristic that defines life that
distinguishes<00:00:16.350> life<00:00:16.590> from<00:00:17.250> nonliving<00:00:17.789> things

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
distinguishes life from nonliving things

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.370 
distinguishes life from nonliving things
that<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.279> cellular<00:00:21.150> organization<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
that is cellular organization of the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.679 
that is cellular organization of the
body<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.519> far<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.180> spoken<00:00:24.480> about

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
body the so far I have spoken about

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.290 
body the so far I have spoken about
quite<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.380> few<00:00:25.410> things<00:00:25.949> like<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.730> metabolic

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
quite a few things like the metabolic

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.660 
quite a few things like the metabolic
reactions<00:00:27.960> we<00:00:28.560> all<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.859> also<00:00:29.070> spoken<00:00:29.400> about

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
reactions we all have also spoken about

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.720 
reactions we all have also spoken about
reproduction<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.900> spoke<00:00:31.109> about<00:00:31.140> growth<00:00:31.800> now

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
reproduction we spoke about growth now

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.459 
reproduction we spoke about growth now
when<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:32.969> movie<00:00:33.329> speak<00:00:33.750> about<00:00:34.020> all<00:00:34.230> these

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
when I movie speak about all these

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.860 
when I movie speak about all these
things<00:00:34.770> where<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:36.000> all<00:00:36.030> these<00:00:36.570> things

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
things where do all these things

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.959 
things where do all these things
actually<00:00:37.079> happen<00:00:37.739> when<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> talk<00:00:38.340> about<00:00:38.489> growth

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
actually happen when I talk about growth

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.060 
actually happen when I talk about growth
what<00:00:39.510> was<00:00:39.690> growth<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.500> was<00:00:40.680> nothing<00:00:40.950> but

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
what was growth it was nothing but

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.240 
what was growth it was nothing but
increase<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.730> number<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.300> cells<00:00:42.809> or

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
increase the number of cells or

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.060 
increase the number of cells or
enlargement<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.550> cells<00:00:44.850> when<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> talk<00:00:45.780> about

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
enlargement of cells when I talk about

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.400 
enlargement of cells when I talk about
reproduction<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.579> at<00:00:47.789> what<00:00:48.329> level

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
reproduction so at what level

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.139 
reproduction so at what level
reproduction<00:00:49.410> star<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.610> even<00:00:51.000> for

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
reproduction star so even for

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.260 
reproduction star so even for
reproduction<00:00:51.750> also<00:00:52.350> if<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.280> talk<00:00:53.520> about<00:00:53.699> cells

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
reproduction also if we talk about cells

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.720 
reproduction also if we talk about cells
right<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.680> talk<00:00:55.739> about<00:00:56.039> sexual

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
right so if I talk about sexual

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.360 
right so if I talk about sexual
reproduction<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.719> like<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.379> male<00:00:58.710> cell<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
reproduction it is like a male cell and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.700 
reproduction it is like a male cell and
a<00:00:59.609> female<00:01:00.030> sex<00:01:00.390> cell<00:01:00.719> they<00:01:01.260> will<00:01:01.440> combine

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
a female sex cell they will combine

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.600 
a female sex cell they will combine
together<00:01:02.309> they<00:01:02.609> will<00:01:02.730> fuse<00:01:03.059> together<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.960> form

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
together they will fuse together to form

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.760 
together they will fuse together to form
the<00:01:05.610> new<00:01:05.850> organism<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:06.990> also<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.409> talk

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the new organism so there also we talk

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.370 
the new organism so there also we talk
about<00:01:07.799> cells<00:01:08.600> when<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> talk<00:01:09.930> about<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
about cells when I talk about the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.620 
about cells when I talk about the
metabolic<00:01:10.710> reactions<00:01:11.640> where<00:01:12.150> do<00:01:12.390> these

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
metabolic reactions where do these

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.649 
metabolic reactions where do these
reactions<00:01:12.930> take<00:01:13.650> place<00:01:13.680> inside<00:01:14.250> our<00:01:14.760> body<00:01:15.060> so

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
reactions take place inside our body so

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.440 
reactions take place inside our body so
inside<00:01:15.990> our<00:01:16.140> body<00:01:16.439> where<00:01:16.740> inside<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.970> cells

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
inside our body where inside the cells

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.870 
inside our body where inside the cells
so<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:19.290> people<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.680> talk<00:01:19.890> about<00:01:20.100> everything

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
so what people we talk about everything

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.960 
so what people we talk about everything
happens<00:01:21.600> inside<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.409> cells<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> cells

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
happens inside the cells so the cells

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.140 
happens inside the cells so the cells
are<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.630> or<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:26.009> presence<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.850> cells

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
are the one or the presence of the cells

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.130 
are the one or the presence of the cells
itself<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.640> characteristic<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.820> life<00:01:30.479> when

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
itself is a characteristic of life when

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.130 
itself is a characteristic of life when
I<00:01:31.170> talk<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:32.009> any<00:01:32.340> nonliving<00:01:33.060> thing<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.840> not

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
I talk of any nonliving thing I do not

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.410 
I talk of any nonliving thing I do not
talk<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.619> cells<00:01:35.009> or<00:01:35.400> tissues<00:01:35.880> because<00:01:36.270> there

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
talk of cells or tissues because there

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.899 
talk of cells or tissues because there
is<00:01:36.570> no<00:01:36.810> living<00:01:37.110> component<00:01:37.860> present<00:01:38.280> inside<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
is no living component present inside a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.109 
is no living component present inside a
non<00:01:39.150> living<00:01:39.560> organism<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.549> whenever<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.000> think

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
non living organism so whenever I think

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.440 
non living organism so whenever I think
of<00:01:42.570> life<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.140> think<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.950> its<00:01:44.189> basic<00:01:44.729> constituent

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
of life I think of its basic constituent

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.530 
of life I think of its basic constituent
and<00:01:45.570> its<00:01:45.869> basic<00:01:46.320> constituent<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.399> same<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and its basic constituent is a same the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.359 
and its basic constituent is a same the
cells<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.350> again<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.829> many<00:01:50.130> different

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
cells can be again of many different

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.550 
cells can be again of many different
types<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:51.060> example<00:01:51.509> inside<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.869> human<00:01:52.350> body

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
types for example inside the human body

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.370 
types for example inside the human body
we<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:54.119> many<00:01:54.270> cells<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.930> different

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
we have so many cells of different

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.230 
we have so many cells of different
shapes<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.009> sizes<00:01:56.250> performing<00:01:57.090> different

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
shapes and sizes performing different

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.929 
shapes and sizes performing different
functions<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.560> nerve<00:01:58.740> cell<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.670> fat

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
functions like the nerve cell the fat

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.330 
functions like the nerve cell the fat
cell<00:02:00.329> which<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.719> quite<00:02:00.960> bigger<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.500> size<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
cell which is quite bigger in size the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.690 
cell which is quite bigger in size the
ovum<00:02:02.850> sperm<00:02:03.600> bone<00:02:04.229> cell<00:02:04.590> blood<00:02:04.920> cells<00:02:05.250> so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
ovum sperm bone cell blood cells so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.690 
ovum sperm bone cell blood cells so
there<00:02:06.000> are<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.479> variety<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.990> cells<00:02:07.770> each

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
there are a variety of cells each

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.010 
there are a variety of cells each
performing<00:02:09.450> its<00:02:09.629> own<00:02:09.989> specific<00:02:10.649> function

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
performing its own specific function

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.140 
performing its own specific function
so<00:02:12.140> cellular<00:02:12.680> organization<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.910> body

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
so cellular organization of the body

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.690 
so cellular organization of the body
also<00:02:14.570> is<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.310> characteristic<00:02:16.310> feature<00:02:16.490> of

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
also is a characteristic feature of

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.840 
also is a characteristic feature of
living<00:02:17.690> organism<00:02:18.410> now<00:02:18.920> last<00:02:19.220> but<00:02:19.430> not<00:02:19.790> the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
living organism now last but not the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.620 
living organism now last but not the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
least that is consciousness this is a

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.140 
least that is consciousness this is a
very<00:02:24.050> very<00:02:24.440> important<00:02:25.220> characteristic<00:02:26.030> of

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
very very important characteristic of

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.320 
very very important characteristic of
life<00:02:26.620> well<00:02:27.620> as<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.010> consciousness<00:02:28.520> what

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
life well as the consciousness what

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.750 
life well as the consciousness what
comes<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.840> your<00:02:29.930> mind

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
comes to your mind

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.410 
comes to your mind
consciousness<00:02:31.760> means<00:02:32.750> being<00:02:33.560> aware<00:02:34.100> of

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
consciousness means being aware of

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.580 
consciousness means being aware of
anything<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.600> everything<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.260> is

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
anything and everything that is

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.590 
anything and everything that is
happening<00:02:36.800> around<00:02:37.280> us<00:02:37.640> when<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.660> say<00:02:38.960> that<00:02:39.230> I

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
happening around us when I say that I

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.990 
happening around us when I say that I
was<00:02:41.600> quite<00:02:41.630> conscious<00:02:42.440> about<00:02:42.890> my<00:02:43.430> looks

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
was quite conscious about my looks

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.660 
was quite conscious about my looks
what<00:02:44.870> does<00:02:45.050> that<00:02:45.080> mean<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.710> means<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.190> I

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
what does that mean that means that I

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
what does that mean that means that I
really<00:02:47.360> bother<00:02:47.690> about<00:02:48.310> how<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.580> look<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.180> really

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
really bother about how I look I really

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.560 
really bother about how I look I really
bother<00:02:50.900> about<00:02:51.140> how<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.800> look<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.280> others<00:02:52.640> right

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
bother about how I look to others right

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.720 
bother about how I look to others right
so<00:02:53.840> whenever<00:02:53.990> is<00:02:54.320> consciousness<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.490> means

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
so whenever is consciousness it means

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.450 
so whenever is consciousness it means
that<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.720> are<00:02:56.990> bothered<00:02:57.350> about<00:02:57.710> things

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
that you are bothered about things

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.730 
that you are bothered about things
happening<00:02:59.360> around<00:02:59.540> you<00:03:00.020> that<00:03:00.680> is

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
happening around you that is

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.650 
happening around you that is
consciousness

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
consciousness

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.080 
consciousness
so<00:03:02.660> in<00:03:02.870> living<00:03:03.260> for<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.920> non<00:03:04.250> living<00:03:04.610> object<00:03:04.970> for

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
so in living for a non living object for

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.260 
so in living for a non living object for
example<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.600> bottle<00:03:05.930> of<00:03:06.020> water<00:03:06.230> or<00:03:06.670> or<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.700> pen

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
example a bottle of water or or a pen

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.510 
example a bottle of water or or a pen
lying<00:03:08.570> on<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.840> table<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:09.860> do<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.070> think<00:03:10.130> that

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
lying on the table so do you think that

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.310 
lying on the table so do you think that
pen<00:03:10.760> has<00:03:11.000> any<00:03:11.210> kind<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.570> consciousness<00:03:12.170> the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
pen has any kind of consciousness the

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.960 
pen has any kind of consciousness the
pen<00:03:12.530> doesn't<00:03:12.980> bother<00:03:13.190> about<00:03:13.580> what<00:03:13.820> is

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
pen doesn't bother about what is

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.110 
pen doesn't bother about what is
happening<00:03:14.150> around<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:15.190> right<00:03:16.190> but<00:03:16.760> when<00:03:16.820> I

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
happening around it right but when I

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.390 
happening around it right but when I
talk<00:03:17.450> about<00:03:17.630> life<00:03:18.080> when<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.410> talk<00:03:18.710> about<00:03:18.860> living

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
talk about life when I talk about living

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.270 
talk about life when I talk about living
organism<00:03:20.000> they<00:03:20.540> actually<00:03:21.260> do<00:03:21.500> bother<00:03:21.830> about

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
organism they actually do bother about

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.370 
organism they actually do bother about
things<00:03:22.730> happening<00:03:23.210> around<00:03:23.330> them<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.930> they

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
things happening around them and they

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.550 
things happening around them and they
also<00:03:24.680> react<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.720> things<00:03:27.020> happening

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
also react to the things happening

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.130 
also react to the things happening
around<00:03:27.710> them<00:03:28.130> for<00:03:28.760> example<00:03:29.360> so<00:03:29.720> we<00:03:29.840> can<00:03:29.990> say

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
around them for example so we can say

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.380 
around them for example so we can say
that<00:03:30.320> ability<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.160> sense<00:03:31.460> the<00:03:31.760> surroundings

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
that ability to sense the surroundings

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.960 
that ability to sense the surroundings
and<00:03:32.630> respond<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.560> them<00:03:33.800> that<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.280> what<00:03:34.520> we<00:03:34.730> talk

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
and respond to them that is what we talk

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.290 
and respond to them that is what we talk
about<00:03:35.000> in<00:03:35.560> consciousness<00:03:36.560> for<00:03:37.130> example<00:03:37.640> when

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
about in consciousness for example when

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.230 
about in consciousness for example when
a<00:03:38.330> person<00:03:38.720> gets<00:03:38.870> an<00:03:39.050> electric<00:03:39.560> shock<00:03:40.240> what

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
a person gets an electric shock what

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.720 
a person gets an electric shock what
happens<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.750> him<00:03:41.870> he<00:03:42.470> immediately<00:03:42.890> responds

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
happens to him he immediately responds

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.180 
happens to him he immediately responds
to<00:03:43.880> it<00:03:44.000> by<00:03:44.210> jumping<00:03:44.570> off<00:03:44.870> from<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.350> point<00:03:45.620> so

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
to it by jumping off from that point so

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.160 
to it by jumping off from that point so
that<00:03:46.340> means<00:03:46.550> he<00:03:46.640> is<00:03:46.670> aware<00:03:47.270> what<00:03:47.540> is<00:03:47.570> happening

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
that means he is aware what is happening

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.400 
that means he is aware what is happening
around<00:03:48.380> him<00:03:48.860> or<00:03:49.730> when<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.270> guy<00:03:50.450> sees<00:03:50.750> a<00:03:50.930> tiger

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
around him or when the guy sees a tiger

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.050 
around him or when the guy sees a tiger
coming<00:03:51.770> towards<00:03:52.130> him<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.490> guy<00:03:52.640> starts

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
coming towards him the guy starts

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.200 
coming towards him the guy starts
running<00:03:53.390> immediately<00:03:54.020> why<00:03:54.820> it<00:03:55.820> is<00:03:56.060> his

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
running immediately why it is his

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.260 
running immediately why it is his
response<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:57.190> whatever<00:03:58.190> is<00:03:58.670> happening<00:03:59.150> around

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
response to whatever is happening around

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.190 
response to whatever is happening around
him<00:03:59.710> or<00:04:00.710> when<00:04:01.280> you<00:04:01.400> suddenly<00:04:01.670> step<00:04:02.630> on<00:04:02.840> fire

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
him or when you suddenly step on fire

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.320 
him or when you suddenly step on fire
and<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:03.620> feel<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.160> heat<00:04:04.460> and<00:04:04.700> immediately

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
and you feel the heat and immediately

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.440 
and you feel the heat and immediately
take<00:04:05.840> your<00:04:06.080> step<00:04:06.320> back<00:04:06.730> why<00:04:07.730> is<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:08.030> so<00:04:08.209> because

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
take your step back why is it so because

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.610 
take your step back why is it so because
you<00:04:09.080> can<00:04:09.260> feel<00:04:09.650> that<00:04:09.680> heat<00:04:11.350> when<00:04:12.350> you<00:04:12.380> see

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
you can feel that heat when you see

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.620 
you can feel that heat when you see
something<00:04:13.070> very<00:04:13.100> delicious<00:04:13.850> in<00:04:14.030> front<00:04:14.300> of<00:04:14.450> you

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
something very delicious in front of you

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.220 
something very delicious in front of you
your<00:04:15.260> mouth<00:04:15.470> starts<00:04:16.100> watering<00:04:16.630> so<00:04:17.630> again<00:04:17.959> you

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
your mouth starts watering so again you

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.250 
your mouth starts watering so again you
are<00:04:18.380> reacting<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:19.160> your<00:04:19.400> surroundings<00:04:20.260> right

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
are reacting to your surroundings right

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.040 
are reacting to your surroundings right
so<00:04:21.950> this<00:04:22.400> consciousness<00:04:23.150> is<00:04:23.419> again<00:04:23.720> something

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
so this consciousness is again something

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.420 
so this consciousness is again something
which<00:04:24.770> happens

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
which happens

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.180 
which happens
only<00:04:25.729> in<00:04:25.910> case<00:04:26.210> of<00:04:26.240> living<00:04:27.050> organisms<00:04:27.289> now

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
only in case of living organisms now

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.370 
only in case of living organisms now
when<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.430> talk<00:04:28.669> about<00:04:28.850> human<00:04:29.419> beings<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:30.050> is<00:04:30.259> the

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
when I talk about human beings it is the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.379 
when I talk about human beings it is the
endocrine<00:04:30.979> system<00:04:31.039> and<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.970> nervous<00:04:32.120> system

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
endocrine system and the nervous system

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.950 
endocrine system and the nervous system
together<00:04:32.960> which<00:04:33.830> give<00:04:34.160> rise<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.539> this<00:04:35.539> these

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
together which give rise to this these

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.950 
together which give rise to this these
consciousness<00:04:36.740> right<00:04:37.520> in<00:04:37.850> we<00:04:38.570> have<00:04:38.720> already

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
consciousness right in we have already

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.810 
consciousness right in we have already
learned<00:04:39.440> about<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.830> nervous<00:04:40.280> system<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:40.729> the

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
learned about the nervous system and the

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.760 
learned about the nervous system and the
endocrine<00:04:41.000> system<00:04:41.240> right<00:04:41.720> when<00:04:42.259> I<00:04:42.289> talk<00:04:42.590> about

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
endocrine system right when I talk about

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.010 
endocrine system right when I talk about
like<00:04:43.340> many<00:04:44.090> of<00:04:44.270> us<00:04:44.419> under<00:04:44.780> different

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
like many of us under different

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.900 
like many of us under different
situations<00:04:45.410> depending<00:04:46.190> upon<00:04:46.580> our

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
situations depending upon our

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.999 
situations depending upon our
surroundings<00:04:47.690> sometimes<00:04:48.380> you<00:04:48.560> feel<00:04:48.770> very

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
surroundings sometimes you feel very

surroundings sometimes you feel very
happy<00:04:49.340> for<00:04:49.460> example<00:04:49.940> you<00:04:50.030> scored<00:04:50.360> really<00:04:50.539> well

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
happy for example you scored really well

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.170 
happy for example you scored really well
in<00:04:51.050> your<00:04:51.169> exams<00:04:51.350> so<00:04:52.280> what<00:04:52.430> is<00:04:52.580> that<00:04:52.759> that<00:04:53.150> is

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
in your exams so what is that that is

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.879 
in your exams so what is that that is
your<00:04:53.449> surroundings<00:04:53.960> so<00:04:54.080> how<00:04:54.199> do<00:04:54.259> you<00:04:54.410> react<00:04:54.710> to

your surroundings so how do you react to

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.430 
your surroundings so how do you react to
it<00:04:54.919> you<00:04:55.400> are<00:04:55.430> very<00:04:55.669> happy<00:04:56.169> sometimes<00:04:57.169> you<00:04:57.350> are

it you are very happy sometimes you are
very<00:04:57.590> sad<00:04:57.919> due<00:04:58.220> to<00:04:58.370> something<00:04:58.580> or<00:04:59.030> you<00:05:00.020> are

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
hungry happy sleepy so all these kind of

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.640 
hungry happy sleepy so all these kind of
feelings<00:05:03.919> come<00:05:04.250> because<00:05:04.820> of<00:05:05.150> it<00:05:06.050> these<00:05:06.410> are

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
feelings come because of it these are

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.080 
feelings come because of it these are
all<00:05:06.770> governed<00:05:07.160> by<00:05:07.400> your<00:05:07.520> endocrine<00:05:08.030> system

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
all governed by your endocrine system

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.480 
all governed by your endocrine system
their<00:05:08.660> endocrine<00:05:09.110> glands<00:05:09.500> which<00:05:10.190> give<00:05:10.460> rise

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
their endocrine glands which give rise

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.689 
their endocrine glands which give rise
to<00:05:10.759> different<00:05:11.030> types<00:05:11.509> of<00:05:11.690> feelings<00:05:12.580> one<00:05:13.580> of

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
to different types of feelings one of

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.520 
to different types of feelings one of
the<00:05:13.849> best<00:05:14.120> things<00:05:14.479> that<00:05:14.599> human<00:05:15.050> beings<00:05:15.320> have

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
the best things that human beings have

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.580 
the best things that human beings have
that<00:05:16.009> is<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.310> ability<00:05:16.639> to<00:05:16.910> think<00:05:17.199> that<00:05:18.199> comes

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
that is the ability to think that comes

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.339 
that is the ability to think that comes
from<00:05:18.919> our<00:05:19.220> brain<00:05:19.729> so<00:05:20.330> that<00:05:20.389> is<00:05:20.660> the<00:05:20.840> nervous

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
from our brain so that is the nervous

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.560 
from our brain so that is the nervous
system<00:05:21.830> so<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.580> language<00:05:22.759> system<00:05:23.120> and<00:05:23.449> the

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
system so the language system and the

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.589 
system so the language system and the
endocrine<00:05:23.780> system<00:05:24.020> takes<00:05:24.680> care<00:05:24.860> of<00:05:25.220> this

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
endocrine system takes care of this

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.150 
endocrine system takes care of this
consciousness<00:05:26.599> part<00:05:26.840> and<00:05:27.139> consciousness<00:05:27.949> is

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
consciousness part and consciousness is

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.300 
consciousness part and consciousness is
a<00:05:28.400> very<00:05:28.639> important<00:05:29.300> feature<00:05:29.599> of<00:05:29.979> life<00:05:30.979> it

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
a very important feature of life it

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.180 
a very important feature of life it
characterizes<00:05:31.970> life<00:05:32.780> so<00:05:33.770> what<00:05:34.010> do<00:05:34.159> we

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
characterizes life so what do we

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.210 
characterizes life so what do we
conclude<00:05:34.460> from<00:05:34.970> this<00:05:35.210> discussion<00:05:35.810> we<00:05:36.409> what

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
conclude from this discussion we what

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.740 
conclude from this discussion we what
we'll<00:05:37.430> be<00:05:37.669> discussing<00:05:38.000> we<00:05:38.270> were<00:05:38.389> discussing

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
we'll be discussing we were discussing

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.480 
we'll be discussing we were discussing
what<00:05:39.440> are<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.680> things<00:05:39.949> that<00:05:40.099> can<00:05:40.340> actually

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
what are the things that can actually

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.570 
what are the things that can actually
tell<00:05:41.030> which<00:05:41.659> is<00:05:41.870> a<00:05:41.990> living<00:05:42.530> thing<00:05:42.949> and<00:05:43.159> which

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
tell which is a living thing and which

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.930 
tell which is a living thing and which
is<00:05:43.729> a<00:05:43.880> nonliving<00:05:44.360> thing<00:05:44.389> so<00:05:45.260> we<00:05:45.409> can<00:05:45.590> say<00:05:45.830> that

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
is a nonliving thing so we can say that

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.370 
is a nonliving thing so we can say that
living<00:05:46.940> organisms<00:05:47.659> are<00:05:48.340> self-replicating

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
living organisms are self-replicating

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.580 
living organisms are self-replicating
evolving<00:05:51.380> and<00:05:52.750> self-regulating<00:05:53.750> interactive

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
evolving and self-regulating interactive

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.040 
evolving and self-regulating interactive
systems<00:05:55.039> capable<00:05:55.909> of<00:05:56.090> responding<00:05:56.750> to

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
systems capable of responding to

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.730 
systems capable of responding to
external<00:05:57.460> stimuli<00:05:58.460> so<00:05:59.180> when<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.389> say

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
external stimuli so when I say

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.689 
external stimuli so when I say
self-replicating<00:06:00.740> that<00:06:01.099> means<00:06:01.310> they<00:06:01.520> can

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:01.699 
self-replicating that means they can

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:03.600 
self-replicating that means they can
replicate<00:06:01.940> themselves<00:06:02.659> they<00:06:03.110> can<00:06:03.289> produce

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
replicate themselves they can produce

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.700 
replicate themselves they can produce
new<00:06:04.610> organisms<00:06:05.449> similar<00:06:05.900> to<00:06:06.050> themselves<00:06:06.259> so

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
new organisms similar to themselves so

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.320 
new organisms similar to themselves so
we<00:06:06.889> are<00:06:07.009> talking<00:06:07.370> about<00:06:07.580> the<00:06:07.759> ability<00:06:08.060> to

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
we are talking about the ability to

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.430 
we are talking about the ability to
reproduce<00:06:09.880> evolving<00:06:10.880> that<00:06:11.479> means<00:06:11.720> they<00:06:12.169> can

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
reproduce evolving that means they can

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.300 
reproduce evolving that means they can
give<00:06:13.340> rise<00:06:13.699> to<00:06:13.729> new<00:06:14.570> things<00:06:14.930> that<00:06:15.289> means<00:06:15.500> we

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
give rise to new things that means we

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.060 
give rise to new things that means we
already<00:06:16.699> studied<00:06:17.389> about<00:06:17.599> evolution<00:06:18.470> right<00:06:18.650> so

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
already studied about evolution right so

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.790 
already studied about evolution right so
from<00:06:19.250> simpler<00:06:19.729> organisms<00:06:20.440> gradually<00:06:21.440> over<00:06:21.770> a

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
from simpler organisms gradually over a

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.529 
from simpler organisms gradually over a
period<00:06:22.070> of<00:06:22.340> time<00:06:22.550> you<00:06:22.820> with<00:06:23.030> small<00:06:23.300> small

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
period of time you with small small

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.920 
period of time you with small small
variations<00:06:24.400> over<00:06:25.400> a<00:06:25.610> long<00:06:26.120> large<00:06:26.539> number<00:06:26.870> of

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
variations over a long large number of

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.469 
variations over a long large number of
years<00:06:27.229> can<00:06:27.620> give<00:06:27.919> rise<00:06:28.130> to<00:06:28.159> new<00:06:28.550> organisms<00:06:29.300> so

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
years can give rise to new organisms so

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.510 
years can give rise to new organisms so
they<00:06:29.630> are<00:06:29.780> they<00:06:30.199> can<00:06:30.380> evolve<00:06:30.770> they<00:06:31.130> can<00:06:31.280> give

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
they are they can evolve they can give

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.670 
control and coordination so they can

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.330

responding to external stimuli
responding<00:06:53.430> to<00:06:53.580> stimuli<00:06:53.910> is<00:06:54.240> nothing<00:06:54.690> by<00:06:54.870> the

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
responding to stimuli is nothing by the

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.400 
responding to stimuli is nothing by the
nervous<00:06:55.680> system<00:06:56.280> so<00:06:57.000> that<00:06:57.450> is<00:06:57.690> how<00:06:57.900> we<00:06:57.960> can

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
nervous system so that is how we can

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.100 
nervous system so that is how we can
define<00:06:58.830> living<00:06:59.570> organisms<00:07:00.570> so<00:07:00.720> these<00:07:00.840> are

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
define living organisms so these are

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.340 
define living organisms so these are
some<00:07:01.320> of<00:07:01.350> the<00:07:01.680> traits<00:07:01.980> which<00:07:02.640> define<00:07:03.450> life<00:07:04.020> or

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
some of the traits which define life or

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.430 
some of the traits which define life or
which<00:07:04.620> defines<00:07:05.100> the<00:07:05.340> living<00:07:05.910> organisms<00:07:06.720> now

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 
which defines the living organisms now

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.400 
which defines the living organisms now
that<00:07:07.740> we<00:07:07.980> have<00:07:08.130> got<00:07:08.340> a<00:07:08.520> fair<00:07:08.850> idea<00:07:09.120> about<00:07:09.750> what

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410 
that we have got a fair idea about what

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.670 
that we have got a fair idea about what
are<00:07:10.650> living<00:07:11.100> organisms<00:07:11.540> so<00:07:12.540> I<00:07:12.570> think<00:07:12.810> that<00:07:13.530> we

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
are living organisms so I think that we

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.130 
are living organisms so I think that we
can<00:07:13.860> now<00:07:14.010> go<00:07:14.310> ahead<00:07:14.730> with<00:07:14.910> how<00:07:15.240> are<00:07:15.570> we<00:07:15.930> going

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.140 
can now go ahead with how are we going

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.980 
can now go ahead with how are we going
to<00:07:16.380> study<00:07:16.620> the<00:07:17.280> diversity<00:07:17.580> of<00:07:18.270> life<00:07:18.450> I<00:07:18.720> mean

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990 
to study the diversity of life I mean

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.110 
to study the diversity of life I mean
the<00:07:19.290> variety<00:07:19.830> of<00:07:19.860> life<00:07:20.100> which<00:07:20.430> we<00:07:20.610> have<00:07:20.820> around

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
the variety of life which we have around

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.240 
the variety of life which we have around
us<00:07:21.300> how<00:07:21.780> are<00:07:22.020> we<00:07:22.140> going<00:07:22.380> to<00:07:22.500> study<00:07:22.710> about<00:07:23.040> each
