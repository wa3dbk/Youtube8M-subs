00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.190
 and beauty guys, I'm going to spend here one 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.010
 rhythm used in Corinthians and fire, right? 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.750
 a rhythm more forrÃ³ and quieter 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.830
 also cause neither good nor simple nor 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.250
 easy 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.250
 come on 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:27.779
 the rhythm it stays like that again we go 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:36.020
 do it very slowly now on camera 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:36.020
 slow in the case of new 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.050
 ok I will go step by step now to 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.480
 The one with the most difficulty is the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.360
 next you use your thumb to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.840
 low 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.040
 then thumb up thumb to 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.490
 low 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:04.940
 thumb up thumb down is 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:08.380
 alternately then 12345 are five 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.380
 movements like thumb or 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.710
 But you might not think so, but I 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:19.140
 I can not use a pick 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:24.330
 Of course that can be so the same count 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:27.510
 one two three four five the important thing is 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.830
 that the last beat that the beaten basket 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.500
 in case it is strong so I in case if I 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.840
 I was not wearing his jacket do so 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.400
 opening my hand 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:45.000
 here I will touch the tip of the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:52.399
 fingers with fingernail on then with up to 6 1 2 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.399
 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.370
 beauty, if it is with the palette how 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:04.230
 will stay as I make that impact on the 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.540
 end of which the palette is not the same 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.920
 Gonna change the sound, change the place I 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.960
 I have liked it if I have touching it. 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.570
 more in the middle on the middle back so 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.630
 and then in the end play only the three 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:23.820
 daughters already gives a great sound already gives a 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:28.950
 The biggest impact is an attack so much that I 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:35.209
 I do is the weakest topic after 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.209
 strong then 123456 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.170
 beauty can use in various corns 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.760
 this kind of rhythm is for example I go 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:56.850
 make one smaller and one become more effective 34 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.850
 or is to the machar 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.959
 thinks 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.959
 Never 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.870
 do not you think 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.870
 do not find 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:24.989
 think it alone but I think today 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.989
