just feel it you won't be able to see it

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.910 
just feel it you won't be able to see it
on<00:02:45.670> camera<00:02:45.880> but<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.870> can<00:02:47.049> feel<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.560> damage

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
on camera but I can feel the damage

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.250 
on camera but I can feel the damage
right<00:02:48.340> at<00:02:48.549> that<00:02:48.640> point<00:02:48.700> there<00:02:49.239> which<00:02:49.930> was<00:02:50.110> the

right at that point there which was the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.780 
right at that point there which was the

original price where the stock was

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.470 
original price where the stock was
squeezed<00:02:52.030> down<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:53.620> they're<00:02:53.860> useful<00:02:54.820> but

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
squeezed down so they're useful but

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.449 
squeezed down so they're useful but
they're<00:02:55.630> marginally<00:02:56.380> dangerous<00:02:57.010> if<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.250> want

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
they're marginally dangerous if you want

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.550 
they're marginally dangerous if you want

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
line this one what you're asking the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.910 
line this one what you're asking the
soft<00:03:06.579> beads<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.239> do<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.720> push<00:03:08.170> each<00:03:08.410> other<00:03:08.680> and

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
soft beads to do is push each other and

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.280 
soft beads to do is push each other and
they<00:03:09.220> just<00:03:09.459> won't<00:03:09.670> do<00:03:09.880> that<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.920> I'm<00:03:11.980> going<00:03:12.190> to

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
they just won't do that so I'm going to

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.259 
they just won't do that so I'm going to
cut<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.440> off<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:15.190> normal<00:03:15.579> use<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:15.790> course<00:03:16.120> you

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
cut that off in normal use of course you

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.120 
cut that off in normal use of course you
thread<00:03:16.540> your<00:03:16.570> feeder<00:03:17.440> or<00:03:17.680> your<00:03:17.859> bomb<00:03:18.100> on<00:03:18.310> first

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
thread your feeder or your bomb on first

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.400 
thread your feeder or your bomb on first
but<00:03:21.130> this<00:03:21.310> is<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:23.400> 70<00:03:24.400> gram<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:25.570> effectively<00:03:26.170> two

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
but this is a 70 gram so effectively two

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
but this is a 70 gram so effectively two
and<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.560> half<00:03:26.769> ounce<00:03:27.060> feeder<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:29.040> can<00:03:30.040> see<00:03:30.250> what

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
and a half ounce feeder you can see what

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.250 
and a half ounce feeder you can see what
the<00:03:30.519> beads<00:03:30.730> do<00:03:31.000> they<00:03:31.989> tend<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:33.329> stand<00:03:34.329> the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
the beads do they tend to stand the

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.199 
the beads do they tend to stand the
hooklink<00:03:35.470> out<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.609> side

hooklink out to the side

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.390

so<00:03:37.510> it's<00:03:37.660> an<00:03:37.780> anti<00:03:38.140> tangle<00:03:38.410> device<00:03:38.799> as<00:03:39.070> much<00:03:39.250> as

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
so it's an anti tangle device as much as

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.090 
so it's an anti tangle device as much as
anything<00:03:39.639> else<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:41.230> reason<00:03:41.650> for<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.859> third

on<00:03:42.849> this<00:03:43.150> occasion<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:44.170> so<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.920> can<00:03:45.099> see

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
on this occasion is so that you can see

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.449 
on this occasion is so that you can see
it<00:03:45.790> doesn't<00:03:46.269> slide<00:03:46.510> or<00:03:46.840> move<00:03:47.220> now<00:03:48.220> what<00:03:48.370> I'm

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
it doesn't slide or move now what I'm

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.339 
it doesn't slide or move now what I'm
going<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.640> do<00:03:48.849> dry<00:03:49.390> line<00:03:49.629> of<00:03:49.810> course<00:03:50.049> it<00:03:50.200> won't

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
going to do dry line of course it won't

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.199 
going to do dry line of course it won't

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
actually fishing it that's a different

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.000 
actually fishing it that's a different
matter<00:03:54.599> so<00:03:55.599> with<00:03:55.780> my<00:03:55.959> bowl<00:03:56.170> of<00:03:56.200> water

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
matter so with my bowl of water

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.360 
matter so with my bowl of water
I<00:03:57.040> can<00:03:57.519> wet<00:03:57.700> that<00:03:57.909> line<00:03:58.150> up<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:58.599> I<00:03:59.410> can<00:03:59.680> jerk

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
I can wet that line up and I can jerk

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.839 
I can wet that line up and I can jerk
that<00:04:00.670> feeder<00:04:00.970> up<00:04:01.599> and<00:04:01.870> down<00:04:02.049> and<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:03.640> worse

that feeder up and down and the worse

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.660 
that feeder up and down and the worse
that<00:04:04.090> will<00:04:04.209> do<00:04:04.360> with<00:04:04.900> 70<00:04:05.290> grams<00:04:05.560> is<00:04:05.890> moved<00:04:06.400> to

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
that will do with 70 grams is moved to

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.500 
that will do with 70 grams is moved to
the<00:04:06.790> next<00:04:06.970> stop

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
the next stop

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.000 
the next stop
it<00:04:07.569> won't<00:04:07.930> go<00:04:08.140> any<00:04:08.319> further<00:04:08.410> than<00:04:08.950> that

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
it won't go any further than that

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.430 
it won't go any further than that
because<00:04:10.000> you're<00:04:10.299> asking<00:04:10.510> all<00:04:10.930> those<00:04:11.140> that<00:04:11.319> all

you won't jag it like that on the cast

you've got a really big weight on is

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.219 
you've got a really big weight on is
striking<00:04:29.889> at<00:04:30.340> close<00:04:30.639> range<00:04:31.000> then<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:31.900> can<00:04:32.050> move

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
striking at close range then it can move

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.790 
striking at close range then it can move
very<00:04:32.260> slightly<00:04:32.740> but<00:04:33.610> it's<00:04:33.760> a<00:04:33.850> failsafe<00:04:34.800> ledger

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
very slightly but it's a failsafe ledger

very slightly but it's a failsafe ledger
stop<00:04:36.190> very<00:04:36.970> useful<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.720> it's<00:04:38.169> my<00:04:38.350> preference

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
stop very useful and it's my preference
