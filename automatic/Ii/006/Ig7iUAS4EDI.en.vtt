gamma missile this is a skill that is
kind<00:01:28.700> of<00:01:28.729> debated<00:01:29.299> on<00:01:29.420> whether<00:01:29.509> or<00:01:30.020> not<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.229> max

knock-back<00:01:39.770> skill<00:01:40.249> for<00:01:41.119> LHC<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:41.869> this<00:01:42.109> is<00:01:42.259> the

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
knock-back skill for LHC and this is the

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.469 
knock-back skill for LHC and this is the
only<00:01:42.590> knock<00:01:42.829> back<00:01:43.069> skill<00:01:43.310> that<00:01:43.340> jet<00:01:43.700> has<00:01:43.939> so

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
only knock back skill that jet has so

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.489 
only knock back skill that jet has so
yeah<00:01:45.020> max<00:01:45.439> that<00:01:45.819> next<00:01:46.819> high<00:01:47.030> life<00:01:47.350> this<00:01:48.350> is

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
yeah max that next high life this is

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.340 
yeah max that next high life this is
crucial<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.280> need<00:01:49.549> it<00:01:49.700> because<00:01:50.630> jet<00:01:51.020> has

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
crucial you need it because jet has

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.859 
crucial you need it because jet has
terrible<00:01:51.920> defense<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:52.579> terrible<00:01:53.149> HP<00:01:53.659> and

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
terrible defense and terrible HP and

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.870 
terrible defense and terrible HP and
when<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:54.799> go<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:54.979> LHC<00:01:55.460> you're<00:01:55.549> going<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.729> see

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
when you go to LHC you're going to see

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.429 
when you go to LHC you're going to see
this<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.270> it's<00:01:56.359> going<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.569> be<00:01:56.630> very<00:01:56.659> evident

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
this and it's going to be very evident

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.739 
this and it's going to be very evident
that<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:57.710> need<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.639> lot<00:01:58.939> more<00:01:58.999> defense<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.600> lot

00:01:59.739 --> 00:01:59.749 
that you need a lot more defense a lot

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:02.469 
that you need a lot more defense a lot
more<00:01:59.810> HP<00:02:00.109> than<00:02:00.319> you<00:02:00.590> have<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:01.069> this<00:02:01.850> helps<00:02:02.299> at

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
more HP than you have and this helps at

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.099 
more HP than you have and this helps at
least<00:02:02.719> a<00:02:02.869> little<00:02:03.020> bit<00:02:03.249> next<00:02:04.249> is<00:02:04.340> cutting<00:02:04.700> edge

this<00:02:06.109> obviously<00:02:06.469> is<00:02:07.219> required<00:02:07.819> it<00:02:08.090> gives<00:02:08.270> you

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
this obviously is required it gives you

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.419 
this obviously is required it gives you
thirty<00:02:08.929> percent<00:02:09.200> critical<00:02:09.590> which<00:02:09.709> is<00:02:09.860> a<00:02:10.069> which

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
thirty percent critical which is a which

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.660 
thirty percent critical which is a which
is<00:02:10.930> necessary<00:02:11.930> it's<00:02:12.380> necessary<00:02:12.890> obviously

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
is necessary it's necessary obviously

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.610 
is necessary it's necessary obviously
here<00:02:13.850> my<00:02:14.240> critical<00:02:14.630> rates<00:02:14.750> actually<00:02:14.930> 70<00:02:15.470> but

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
here my critical rates actually 70 but

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.600 
here my critical rates actually 70 but
that's<00:02:15.740> because<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.070> fourth

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
that's because of a fourth

that's because of a fourth
skill<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:17.090> have<00:02:17.240> which<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.690> collateral

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
only thing I want out of this is a five

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.180 
only thing I want out of this is a five
or<00:02:37.700> six<00:02:38.240> and<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.570> five<00:02:38.870> or<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.560> four<00:02:39.830> or<00:02:39.890> five<00:02:40.040> or

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.000 
or six and a five or a four or five or
six<00:02:40.550> maybe<00:02:41.000> not<00:02:41.210> even<00:02:41.240> a<00:02:41.420> four<00:02:41.660> but<00:02:41.840> five<00:02:42.230> gives

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
six maybe not even a four but five gives

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.190 
six maybe not even a four but five gives
you<00:02:43.130> 20<00:02:43.490> percent<00:02:43.790> damage<00:02:43.880> boost<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.900> 6

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
you 20 percent damage boost and a 6

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.100 
you 20 percent damage boost and a 6
gives<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.709> 30-percent<00:02:46.490> exp<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.110> that's

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
gives you a 30-percent exp and that's

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.680 
gives you a 30-percent exp and that's
always<00:02:48.440> cool<00:02:48.650> band<00:02:48.950> for<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.640> reason<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.209> kind

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
always cool band for the reason I kind

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.449 
always cool band for the reason I kind
of<00:02:50.720> took<00:02:50.840> that<00:02:50.900> out<00:02:51.080> less<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.470> came<00:02:51.650> was<00:02:52.430> because

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
of took that out less I came was because

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.790 
of took that out less I came was because
it<00:02:52.760> gives<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:52.970> critical<00:02:53.360> rate<00:02:53.540> but<00:02:53.810> it's

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
it gives you critical rate but it's

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.990 
it gives you critical rate but it's
really<00:02:55.040> high<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.310> don't<00:02:55.459> really<00:02:55.640> need<00:02:55.820> it<00:02:55.970> but

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
really high you don't really need it but

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.800 
really high you don't really need it but
whatever<00:02:56.330> um<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.860> in<00:02:58.160> fourth<00:02:58.459> job<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:59.270> need

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
whatever um and in fourth job you need

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.140 
whatever um and in fourth job you need
to<00:02:59.930> max<00:03:00.110> in<00:03:00.290> order<00:03:00.440> to<00:03:00.530> get<00:03:00.680> double<00:03:01.100> down<00:03:01.280> which

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
to max in order to get double down which

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.880 
to max in order to get double down which
is<00:03:02.180> basically<00:03:02.720> gives<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:03.560> ten<00:03:03.800> percent

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
is basically gives you ten percent

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.860 
is basically gives you ten percent
chance<00:03:04.190> of<00:03:04.370> rolling<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.730> double<00:03:04.970> down<00:03:05.120> or<00:03:05.570> at

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
chance of rolling a double down or at

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.500 
chance of rolling a double down or at
least<00:03:06.020> level<00:03:06.170> one<00:03:06.380> does<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:07.550> don't<00:03:08.030> give

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
least level one does and I don't give

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.760 
least level one does and I don't give
you<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.660> better<00:03:08.780> buff<00:03:09.020> I<00:03:09.200> guess<00:03:09.380> I<00:03:09.560> don't<00:03:09.680> know

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
you a better buff I guess I don't know

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.030 
you a better buff I guess I don't know
and<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:11.209> last<00:03:11.360> skill<00:03:11.720> this<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.709> one<00:03:12.860> I

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
and the last skill this is the one I

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.530 
and the last skill this is the one I
didn't<00:03:13.400> max<00:03:13.580> as<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.030> can<00:03:14.150> see<00:03:14.270> imax

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
didn't max as you can see imax

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.830 
didn't max as you can see imax
everything<00:03:14.989> except<00:03:15.350> for<00:03:15.530> drone<00:03:16.130> blast<00:03:16.430> and

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
everything except for drone blast and

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.280 
everything except for drone blast and
that's<00:03:17.840> because<00:03:18.050> um<00:03:18.620> this<00:03:19.190> skill<00:03:20.140> rapid<00:03:21.140> fire

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
that's because um this skill rapid fire

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.680 
that's because um this skill rapid fire
Matt<00:03:21.620> really<00:03:22.340> quickly<00:03:22.970> replaces<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.510> like

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
Matt really quickly replaces it like

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.350 
Matt really quickly replaces it like
it's<00:03:24.440> automatically<00:03:24.980> better<00:03:25.220> than<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.610> at

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
it's automatically better than it at

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.699 
it's automatically better than it at
level<00:03:26.630> one<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:26.989> it's<00:03:27.200> really<00:03:27.350> no<00:03:27.530> point

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
level one so it's really no point

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.530 
level one so it's really no point
because<00:03:28.220> you<00:03:28.310> know<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.489> rapid<00:03:29.060> fire<00:03:29.209> shoots

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
because you know a rapid fire shoots

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.780 
because you know a rapid fire shoots
eight<00:03:29.750> point<00:03:30.110> something<00:03:30.860> errors<00:03:31.280> per<00:03:31.430> second

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
eight point something errors per second

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.750

arrows<00:03:32.330> bullets<00:03:33.140> per<00:03:33.200> second<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.610> this

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
arrows bullets per second so and this

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.820 
arrows bullets per second so and this
shoots<00:03:35.180> eight<00:03:35.390> so<00:03:35.870> all<00:03:36.200> you<00:03:36.260> see<00:03:36.560> is<00:03:36.620> better
