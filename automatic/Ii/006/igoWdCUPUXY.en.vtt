00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
the right hand side instead of being

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.590 
the right hand side instead of being
split<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:45.450> both<00:00:45.750> sides<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:47.000> they<00:00:48.000> come<00:00:48.329> with

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
split up both sides and they come with

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.490 
split up both sides and they come with
the<00:00:48.899> Akron<00:00:49.500> brand<00:00:50.899> aluminum<00:00:51.899> wheels<00:00:52.110> very
