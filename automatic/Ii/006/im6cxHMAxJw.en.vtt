oh<00:03:30.230> it's<00:03:31.159> loaded<00:03:35.439> there<00:03:36.439> they<00:03:36.590> are

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.180 

look<00:03:41.240> at<00:03:41.360> that<00:03:41.510> huh<00:03:41.900> these<00:03:42.620> are<00:03:42.800> bigger<00:03:42.980> than

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
look at that huh these are bigger than

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:57.160 
look at that huh these are bigger than
the<00:03:43.340> other<00:03:43.490> ones<00:03:44.590> wool<00:03:46.840> like<00:03:47.840> ants<00:03:56.170> the

stump<00:03:58.850> it's<00:03:59.060> really<00:03:59.390> easy<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.720> come<00:03:59.930> off<00:03:59.960> here

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
stump it's really easy to come off here

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.730 
stump it's really easy to come off here
you<00:04:02.480> can<00:04:02.630> see<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.900> different<00:04:03.230> color<00:04:03.440> in<00:04:03.620> the

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
you can see the different color in the
