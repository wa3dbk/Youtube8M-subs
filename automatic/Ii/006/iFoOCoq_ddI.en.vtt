Prince Khalid I suppose that the

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.340 
Prince Khalid I suppose that the
significance<00:03:02.030> is<00:03:02.180> not<00:03:02.209> just<00:03:02.630> a<00:03:02.750> brilliant

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
significance is not just a brilliant

and error and preparation and the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.240 
and error and preparation and the
thought<00:03:09.019> that<00:03:09.049> goes<00:03:09.380> into<00:03:09.440> breeding<00:03:09.980> a

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
thought that goes into breeding a

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.009 
thought that goes into breeding a
top-class<00:03:10.640> horse<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.180> how<00:03:11.359> you<00:03:11.420> do<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.900> it's

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
top-class horse and how you do it it's

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.550 
top-class horse and how you do it it's
an<00:03:12.109> inexact<00:03:12.380> science<00:03:12.680> three<00:03:13.640> generations

an inexact science three generations
back<00:03:16.510> started<00:03:17.510> in<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.780> sort<00:03:17.989> of<00:03:18.019> late<00:03:18.200> 70s

back started in the sort of late 70s
early<00:03:19.670> eighties<00:03:20.600> when<00:03:20.630> Prince<00:03:21.019> Khalid<00:03:21.230> was

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
to finish up with a horse like Franco

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.740 
to finish up with a horse like Franco
will<00:03:27.440> not<00:03:27.560> finish<00:03:27.739> up<00:03:28.069> but<00:03:28.280> come<00:03:29.239> up<00:03:29.420> with<00:03:29.630> the

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
horse like Franco is is just

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.540 
horse like Franco is is just
perfection<00:03:34.290> will<00:03:34.740> you<00:03:34.860> say<00:03:35.040> finish<00:03:35.370> up

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
perfection will you say finish up

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.650

it it can't get any better well we're

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.770 
it it can't get any better well we're

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
but I would I would think this this is a

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.760 
but I would I would think this this is a
pretty<00:03:47.070> sort<00:03:47.820> of<00:03:47.910> career<00:03:48.750> defining<00:03:49.380> moment

going to be very very important sort of
a<00:04:09.980> making<00:04:10.980> sure<00:04:11.010> we<00:04:11.370> get<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.670> right<00:04:11.700> quality

you'll<00:04:35.370> see<00:04:35.580> that<00:04:35.820> certain<00:04:36.510> patterns<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:37.290> will

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
you'll see that certain patterns of will

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.400 
you'll see that certain patterns of will
emerge<00:04:38.160> in<00:04:38.550> terms<00:04:38.790> of<00:04:39.000> pedigree<00:04:39.480> and<00:04:39.690> in<00:04:39.960> in

emerge in terms of pedigree and in in

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.880 
emerge in terms of pedigree and in in
conformation<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.550> and<00:04:41.760> so<00:04:42.210> we'll<00:04:42.450> be

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
conformation and and so we'll be

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.470 
conformation and and so we'll be
monitoring<00:04:43.890> that<00:04:43.980> throughout<00:04:44.669> to<00:04:45.030> try<00:04:45.270> and

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
monitoring that throughout to try and

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.470 
monitoring that throughout to try and
streamline<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.830> into<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.340> making<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.270> best

streamline it into the making the best

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.900 
streamline it into the making the best
we<00:04:48.660> can<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.110> I<00:04:49.440> suspect<00:04:49.890> from<00:04:49.980> here<00:04:50.220> on<00:04:50.370> in<00:04:50.520> so

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
we can and I suspect from here on in so

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.040 
we can and I suspect from here on in so
long<00:04:51.000> as<00:04:51.150> he<00:04:51.270> lives<00:04:51.480> you<00:04:51.600> will<00:04:51.750> be<00:04:51.840> getting

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
long as he lives you will be getting

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.880 
long as he lives you will be getting
many<00:04:52.770> many<00:04:53.040> requests<00:04:53.820> from<00:04:54.540> prospective<00:04:54.930> I

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
many many requests from prospective I

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.409 
many many requests from prospective I
think<00:04:56.160> he's<00:04:56.280> going<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.580> be<00:04:56.669> a<00:04:56.700> millipede<00:04:57.060> in

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
think he's going to be a millipede in

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.120 
think he's going to be a millipede in
terms<00:04:57.690> of<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:57.990> shoes<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:58.740> people<00:04:59.370> want<00:04:59.720> but

terms of the shoes that people want but

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.310 
terms of the shoes that people want but
it<00:05:02.130> really<00:05:02.610> has<00:05:02.760> been<00:05:03.030> just<00:05:03.480> fantastic<00:05:03.570> the

the Kip Co British champion series right
from<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.400> outset<00:05:11.850> thinking<00:05:12.300> it<00:05:12.390> would<00:05:12.480> do

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
from the outset thinking it would do

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.060 
from the outset thinking it would do
great<00:05:12.810> things<00:05:12.840> for<00:05:13.260> British<00:05:13.560> racing<00:05:13.800> how

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
great things for British racing how

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.400 
great things for British racing how
satisfying<00:05:14.640> is<00:05:14.820> it<00:05:14.850> for<00:05:15.120> you<00:05:15.330> that<00:05:15.930> he<00:05:16.200> has

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
satisfying is it for you that he has

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.090 
satisfying is it for you that he has
been<00:05:16.650> a<00:05:16.680> great<00:05:17.130> gift<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.610> them<00:05:17.940> I<00:05:18.780> think<00:05:19.620> it's<00:05:19.800> I

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
been a great gift to them I think it's I

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.430 
been a great gift to them I think it's I
think<00:05:20.700> we<00:05:20.910> have<00:05:21.150> to<00:05:21.360> sort<00:05:21.720> of<00:05:21.870> take<00:05:22.050> a<00:05:22.080> good

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
think we have to sort of take a good

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.219 
think we have to sort of take a good
view<00:05:22.770> on<00:05:22.800> British<00:05:23.430> racing<00:05:23.729> and<00:05:24.270> think<00:05:25.020> how

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
view on British racing and think how

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.980 
view on British racing and think how
lucky<00:05:25.710> we<00:05:25.860> are<00:05:25.890> especially<00:05:26.610> I<00:05:27.330> think<00:05:27.630> the

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
lucky we are especially I think the

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.570 
lucky we are especially I think the
Queen's<00:05:28.260> involvement<00:05:29.040> is<00:05:29.220> well

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
Queen's involvement is well

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.900 
Queen's involvement is well
pivotal<00:05:31.510> in<00:05:31.800> everything<00:05:32.800> that<00:05:33.460> happens

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
pivotal in everything that happens

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.150 
pivotal in everything that happens
especially<00:05:34.060> a<00:05:34.510> tasket<00:05:34.960> obviously<00:05:35.530> and<00:05:35.770> I

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
especially a tasket obviously and I

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.010 
especially a tasket obviously and I
think<00:05:36.400> the<00:05:36.520> champion<00:05:36.970> says<00:05:37.210> we<00:05:37.480> needed

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
think the champion says we needed

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.900 
think the champion says we needed
something<00:05:38.310> to<00:05:40.440> really<00:05:41.440> focus<00:05:42.070> on<00:05:42.520> and

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
something to really focus on and

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.280 
something to really focus on and
highlight<00:05:43.570> our<00:05:43.900> own<00:05:44.770> national<00:05:45.960> racing<00:05:46.960> sport

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
and and this has given in that platform

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.470 
and and this has given in that platform
