let's look at the Icelandic volcano and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.130 
let's look at the Icelandic volcano and
the<00:00:46.460> threat<00:00:46.730> it<00:00:46.760> poses<00:00:47.090> now<00:00:47.720> such<00:00:47.990> an

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
explosion would play havoc with our

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.760

days<00:01:01.699> which<00:01:02.000> is<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.150> longest<00:01:02.690> period<00:01:02.960> air

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
Second World War but as you may imagine

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.400 
Second World War but as you may imagine
there<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:07.850> a<00:01:07.940> great<00:01:08.240> deal<00:01:08.420> more<00:01:08.450> air<00:01:08.990> traffic

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
there is a great deal more air traffic

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.170 
there is a great deal more air traffic
now<00:01:09.619> than<00:01:10.130> there<00:01:10.250> was<00:01:10.430> 60<00:01:10.820> years<00:01:10.850> ago

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
now than there was 60 years ago

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.969 
now than there was 60 years ago
disrupted<00:01:11.900> air<00:01:12.080> traffic<00:01:12.500> might<00:01:12.680> seem<00:01:12.950> like

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
disrupted air traffic might seem like

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.760 
disrupted air traffic might seem like
only<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.670> minor<00:01:14.119> annoyance<00:01:14.540> to<00:01:14.840> many<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.260> us<00:01:15.380> but

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
only a minor annoyance to many of us but

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.460 
only a minor annoyance to many of us but
a<00:01:15.800> volcano<00:01:16.280> poses<00:01:17.240> far<00:01:17.479> greater<00:01:17.869> threats<00:01:18.259> than

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
a volcano poses far greater threats than

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.499 
a volcano poses far greater threats than
that<00:01:18.649> so<00:01:19.190> let's<00:01:19.369> put<00:01:19.520> it<00:01:19.640> into<00:01:19.759> context<00:01:20.270> the

that so let's put it into context the
2010<00:01:21.259> eruption<00:01:21.740> was<00:01:21.830> quite<00:01:22.100> small<00:01:22.430> but

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
2010 eruption was quite small but
