00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.060 
Vincente by Don McLean beautiful tune
that<00:00:42.640> has<00:00:42.960> some<00:00:43.960> kind<00:00:44.199> of<00:00:44.350> tricky<00:00:44.649> things<00:00:44.890> in

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
that has some kind of tricky things in

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.490 
that has some kind of tricky things in
it<00:00:45.190> because<00:00:45.969> Don's<00:00:46.329> finger-picking<00:00:46.809> style<00:00:46.989> is

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
it because Don's finger-picking style is

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.770 
it because Don's finger-picking style is
very<00:00:47.530> freeform<00:00:48.129> and<00:00:48.730> it<00:00:49.000> doesn't<00:00:49.360> have<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.659> go

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
very freeform and it doesn't have to go

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.780 
very freeform and it doesn't have to go
exactly<00:00:50.320> one<00:00:50.470> way<00:00:50.649> if<00:00:50.860> you<00:00:51.010> listen<00:00:51.309> to<00:00:51.489> or

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
exactly one way if you listen to or

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.000 
exactly one way if you listen to or
watch<00:00:51.839> half<00:00:52.839> a<00:00:52.960> dozen<00:00:53.110> versions<00:00:53.589> of<00:00:53.769> him

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
watch half a dozen versions of him

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.740 
watch half a dozen versions of him
playing<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.460> singing<00:00:54.610> this<00:00:54.820> song<00:00:55.030> they're

playing and singing this song they're
all<00:00:56.370> they<00:00:57.370> all<00:00:57.489> have<00:00:57.640> some<00:00:58.149> differences<00:00:58.600> and

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
all they all have some differences and

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.469 
all they all have some differences and
but<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.920> technique<00:01:00.339> is<00:01:00.579> really<00:01:00.940> important<00:01:01.360> so

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
but the technique is really important so

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
need to play two of them so if I was

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.319 
need to play two of them so if I was
just<00:01:29.860> doing<00:01:29.920> this<00:01:30.130> on<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.310> G<00:01:30.549> chord<00:01:30.579> for<00:01:31.060> maybe

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
just doing this on a G chord for maybe

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.679 
just doing this on a G chord for maybe
two<00:01:31.570> measures<00:01:31.960> I'd<00:01:32.170> have<00:01:32.409> thumb<00:01:33.159> thumb<00:01:33.759> maybe

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
two measures I'd have thumb thumb maybe

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.170 
two measures I'd have thumb thumb maybe
index<00:01:35.020> and<00:01:35.229> middle<00:01:35.640> second<00:01:36.640> time<00:01:36.760> I<00:01:36.790> might<00:01:37.060> do

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
index and middle second time I might do

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.830 
index and middle second time I might do
thumb<00:01:37.510> thumb<00:01:37.960> ring<00:01:38.620> middle<00:01:39.570> third<00:01:40.570> time<00:01:40.810> I

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
thumb thumb ring middle third time I

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.700 
thumb thumb ring middle third time I
might<00:01:41.110> do<00:01:41.229> thumb<00:01:41.530> thumb<00:01:42.010> middle<00:01:42.700> index<00:01:43.710> fourth

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
might do thumb thumb middle index fourth

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.440 
might do thumb thumb middle index fourth
time<00:01:44.979> or<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.610> second<00:01:45.850> half<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.150> second

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
time or the second half of the second

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.120 
time or the second half of the second
measure<00:01:46.540> thumb<00:01:47.260> thumb<00:01:47.920> index<00:01:48.990> great<00:01:49.990> now<00:01:50.740> what

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
measure thumb thumb index great now what

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.340 
measure thumb thumb index great now what
I<00:01:51.159> just<00:01:51.400> played<00:01:51.610> there<00:01:51.850> was<00:01:52.090> four<00:01:52.540> sets<00:01:52.990> of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
I just played there was four sets of

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.370 
I just played there was four sets of
four<00:01:54.250> eighth<00:01:54.400> notes<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.060> every<00:01:55.840> set<00:01:56.080> was<00:01:56.350> a

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
four eighth notes and every set was a

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.250 
four eighth notes and every set was a
thumb<00:01:56.830> another<00:01:57.670> thumb<00:01:57.940> finger<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:58.990> another

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
thumb another thumb finger and another

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.890 
thumb another thumb finger and another
finger<00:01:59.620> two<00:02:00.040> thumbs<00:02:00.310> two<00:02:00.580> fingers<00:02:00.970> sounds

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
finger two thumbs two fingers sounds

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:11.900 
finger two thumbs two fingers sounds
something<00:02:02.080> like<00:02:02.200> this

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.000 

so<00:02:12.910> if<00:02:13.209> you<00:02:13.390> work<00:02:13.569> on<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.900> technique<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.709> get

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
so if you work on that technique and get

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.440 
so if you work on that technique and get
to<00:02:15.160> where<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.340> can<00:02:15.489> randomly<00:02:15.970> change<00:02:16.269> your

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
to where you can randomly change your

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.330 
to where you can randomly change your
fingers<00:02:16.810> around<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.410> then<00:02:17.860> play<00:02:18.069> through<00:02:18.250> the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
fingers around and then play through the

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.650 
fingers around and then play through the
chord<00:02:18.550> progression<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.030> couple<00:02:19.300> measures<00:02:19.540> of

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
chord progression a couple measures of

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:29.210 
chord progression a couple measures of
GE<00:02:19.840> couple<00:02:20.170> measures<00:02:20.379> of<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.590> minor

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.850 

place<00:02:30.220> your<00:02:30.370> cd7<00:02:31.300> they<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:32.409> will<00:02:32.530> sound<00:02:32.739> like

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
place your cd7 they it will sound like

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.160 
place your cd7 they it will sound like
the<00:02:33.040> song<00:02:33.250> but<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.659> lesson<00:02:34.989> that<00:02:35.019> I<00:02:35.110> have

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
the song but in the lesson that I have

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.530 
the song but in the lesson that I have
together<00:02:35.620> on<00:02:35.830> this<00:02:35.980> we<00:02:36.280> start<00:02:36.940> with<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.269> and

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
together on this we start with that and

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.390 
together on this we start with that and
then<00:02:37.750> we<00:02:37.870> work<00:02:38.049> in<00:02:38.230> two<00:02:38.440> very<00:02:39.040> detailed

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
then we work in two very detailed

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.039 
then we work in two very detailed
tablature<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.150> wrote<00:02:40.360> out<00:02:40.569> of<00:02:40.780> how<00:02:40.989> he

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
tablature that I wrote out of how he

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.770 
tablature that I wrote out of how he
played<00:02:41.349> it<00:02:41.500> on<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:42.159> 1971<00:02:42.849> recording<00:02:43.330> American

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
played it on the 1971 recording American
