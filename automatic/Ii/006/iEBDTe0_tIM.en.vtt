00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.660 
beautiful you got this beautiful slicked
hair<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.110> beautiful<00:01:31.409> flower<00:01:31.650> perhaps<00:01:32.400> over

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
hair and a beautiful flower perhaps over

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.830 
hair and a beautiful flower perhaps over
the<00:01:32.759> year<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.119> connects<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.540> look<00:01:33.659> quite

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840

the year that connects you look quite
stunning<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.380> then<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.950> think<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.280> more

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
stunning and then I think it's more

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.100 
stunning and then I think it's more
about<00:01:35.520> adding<00:01:36.119> more<00:01:36.240> makeup<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
about adding more makeup so it's a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.719 
about adding more makeup so it's a
balancing<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.650> also<00:01:37.890> depends<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> dress

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
balancing it also depends on the dress

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.109 
balancing it also depends on the dress
so<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.229> all<00:01:40.409> fits<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.100> together<00:01:41.340> really
