00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
almost like one of those midweek games

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.590

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
for a weekend and then you know you're

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.400 
for a weekend and then you know you're
playing<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.939> midweek<00:00:24.269> game<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.810> not<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.170> you

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
playing a midweek game and not that you

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.310 
playing a midweek game and not that you
minimize<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.670> midweek<00:00:27.029> game<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.779> it's

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
minimize the midweek game but it's it's

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.769 
minimize the midweek game but it's it's
so<00:00:29.189> much<00:00:29.369> adrenaline<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.060> energy<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.539> used

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
so much adrenaline and energy is used

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.049 
so much adrenaline and energy is used
there<00:00:31.439> they<00:00:32.040> trying<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.489> get<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.700> back<00:00:32.730> up

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
there they trying to get it back up

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.970 
there they trying to get it back up
again<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.630> they<00:00:34.200> were<00:00:34.290> playing<00:00:34.530> against<00:00:34.860> each

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
again and they were playing against each

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.020 
again and they were playing against each
other<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:36.450> think<00:00:37.260> we've<00:00:37.620> done<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:38.129> good<00:00:38.969> job

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
other so I think we've done a good job

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.030 
other so I think we've done a good job
of<00:00:39.270> providing<00:00:40.260> competition<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> fall<00:00:41.579> to

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
of providing competition in the fall to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.190 
of providing competition in the fall to
to<00:00:44.040> start<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.700> january<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.450> i<00:00:45.930> think

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to start with in january and i think

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.650 
to start with in january and i think
from<00:00:46.610> comfort<00:00:47.610> level<00:00:47.910> these<00:00:48.059> guys<00:00:48.270> will<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.629> a

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
from comfort level these guys will be a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.880 
from comfort level these guys will be a
little<00:00:48.840> bit<00:00:48.989> more<00:00:49.170> comfortable<00:00:49.530> when<00:00:49.739> they

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
little bit more comfortable when they

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.799 
little bit more comfortable when they
get<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> field<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.730> when<00:00:51.510> they<00:00:51.629> get

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
get on the field and when they get

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.420 
get on the field and when they get
comfortable<00:00:52.170> they<00:00:52.410> learn<00:00:52.680> quicker<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
comfortable they learn quicker and the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.970 
comfortable they learn quicker and the
game<00:00:53.610> speeds<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.329> or<00:00:54.600> slows<00:00:54.840> down<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.500> them

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
game speeds up or slows down for them

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.119 
game speeds up or slows down for them
but<00:00:56.219> they<00:00:56.760> seem<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.239> improve<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.350> think<00:00:59.010> our

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
but they seem to improve so I think our

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.560 
but they seem to improve so I think our
structure<00:00:59.489> during<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.820> course<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> fall<00:01:00.390> was

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
structure during the course the fall was

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.299 
structure during the course the fall was
good<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.960> took<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.199> team<00:01:01.410> trip<00:01:01.710> then<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.100> went<00:01:02.219> to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
good we took a team trip then we went to

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
a little bit faster because it's going

talking about a little bit everything
really<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.280> don't<00:01:29.400> feel<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.700> outfield

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
really you don't feel in the outfield

we have the versatility to bring a kid

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.170 
we have the versatility to bring a kid
off<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.140> bench<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:25.280> face<00:02:25.520> a<00:02:25.550> pitcher<00:02:26.000> which

off the bench to to face a pitcher which

off the bench to to face a pitcher which
we<00:02:26.360> we<00:02:26.780> couldn't<00:02:27.110> as<00:02:27.170> much<00:02:27.350> last<00:02:27.620> year<00:02:27.830> we

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
we we couldn't as much last year we

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.200 
we we couldn't as much last year we
right-handed<00:02:28.550> dominated<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.150> the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
right-handed dominated in the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.610 
right-handed dominated in the
right-handed<00:02:29.630> breaking<00:02:29.960> ball<00:02:30.110> gave<00:02:30.320> us<00:02:30.470> some

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
right-handed breaking ball gave us some

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.990 
right-handed breaking ball gave us some
fits<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.840> hence<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.170> double<00:02:33.770> plays<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.040> the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
fits and hence the double plays and the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.030 
fits and hence the double plays and the
inability<00:02:35.570> maybe<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.230> have<00:02:36.320> bigger<00:02:36.620> innings

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
inability maybe to have bigger innings

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.890 
inability maybe to have bigger innings
than<00:02:37.250> what<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.610> thought<00:02:37.730> we<00:02:38.090> could<00:02:38.120> create<00:02:38.450> so

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
than what I thought we could create so

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.840 
than what I thought we could create so
hopefully<00:02:39.710> this<00:02:39.860> will<00:02:40.040> will<00:02:40.370> add<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:40.760> our

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
hopefully this will will add to our

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.640 
hopefully this will will add to our
offensive<00:02:41.360> structure<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.750> little<00:02:41.990> bit<00:02:42.110> have

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
offensive structure a little bit have

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.140 
offensive structure a little bit have
enough<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.070> save<00:02:43.280> got<00:02:43.580> three<00:02:43.790> more<00:02:43.940> months

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
enough to save got three more months

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.150 
enough to save got three more months
nearly<00:02:44.870> four<00:02:45.080> more<00:02:45.290> months<00:02:45.440> before<00:02:45.680> we<00:02:45.980> play

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
nearly four more months before we play

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.700 
nearly four more months before we play
in<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.370> SEC<00:02:46.460> but<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.330> think<00:02:47.840> Tony's<00:02:48.140> capable<00:02:48.590> of

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
in the SEC but I think Tony's capable of

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.440 
in the SEC but I think Tony's capable of
doing<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.070> I<00:02:49.130> think<00:02:49.280> Conrad's<00:02:49.850> capable<00:02:50.330> of

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
doing that I think Conrad's capable of

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.430 
doing that I think Conrad's capable of
doing<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:52.010> think<00:02:52.460> there's<00:02:52.610> some<00:02:52.760> pitching

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
doing that I think there's some pitching

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.070 
doing that I think there's some pitching
like<00:02:54.440> like<00:02:54.710> so<00:02:54.920> max<00:02:55.160> arm<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.700> like<00:02:56.300> pecoraro<00:02:56.810> and

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
like like so max arm I like pecoraro and

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.170 
like like so max arm I like pecoraro and
I<00:02:57.170> know<00:02:57.230> I'm<00:02:57.380> going<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.590> forget<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:58.100> guy<00:02:58.880> here

I know I'm going to forget a guy here

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.180 
I know I'm going to forget a guy here

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.640 
to figure out the pace and and how to
move<00:03:24.590> your<00:03:24.620> feet<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:27.110> everyday

move your feet and the everyday

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.290 
move your feet and the everyday
progression<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.610> takes<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:29.000> become<00:03:29.150> a

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
progression that it takes to become a

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.570 
progression that it takes to become a
ballplayer<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:30.440> that's<00:03:30.650> just<00:03:30.770> time<00:03:31.010> that

spent a lot of time out here and it was

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.270 
spent a lot of time out here and it was
good<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.519> see<00:03:43.550> it<00:03:43.790> click<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:45.380> you<00:03:45.680> know<00:03:45.800> all

three of them were or struck well I mean
I<00:03:48.800> I<00:03:48.830> know<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.340> wind<00:03:49.550> was<00:03:49.790> blowing<00:03:50.030> out<00:03:50.180> a

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
I I know the wind was blowing out a

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.930 
I I know the wind was blowing out a
little<00:03:50.450> bit<00:03:50.630> today<00:03:50.870> but<00:03:51.160> nonetheless<00:03:52.160> he<00:03:52.700> he

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
little bit today but nonetheless he he

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.420 
little bit today but nonetheless he he
earned<00:03:53.239> all<00:03:53.360> three<00:03:53.630> of<00:03:53.660> them<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.250> he<00:03:55.250> took

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
earned all three of them and he took

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.460 
earned all three of them and he took
advantage<00:03:55.580> of<00:03:56.000> some<00:03:56.390> mistake<00:03:56.720> pitches<00:03:57.140> off<00:03:57.320> a

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
advantage of some mistake pitches off a

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.590 
advantage of some mistake pitches off a
young<00:03:57.650> kid<00:03:57.950> which<00:03:58.190> is<00:03:58.400> is<00:03:59.000> what<00:03:59.239> should<00:03:59.420> happen

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
young kid which is is what should happen

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.940 
young kid which is is what should happen
you<00:03:59.959> know<00:04:00.050> he's<00:04:00.170> four<00:04:00.410> years<00:04:00.440> into<00:04:00.830> the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
you know he's four years into the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.190 
you know he's four years into the
program<00:04:01.160> so<00:04:01.640> that's<00:04:02.390> what<00:04:02.600> he<00:04:02.720> should<00:04:02.930> be<00:04:03.080> able

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
program so that's what he should be able

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.960 
program so that's what he should be able
to<00:04:03.470> do<00:04:03.620> but<00:04:03.800> he's<00:04:03.950> got<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.190> strength<00:04:04.550> to<00:04:04.820> be

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
to do but he's got the strength to be

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.699 
to do but he's got the strength to be
able<00:04:05.000> to<00:04:05.480> take<00:04:05.900> that<00:04:05.959> ball<00:04:06.290> over<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.680> fence

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
able to take that ball over the fence

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.910 
able to take that ball over the fence
like<00:04:07.130> that<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.550> with<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.660> bat<00:04:08.870> it's<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:09.769> little

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
like that and with the bat it's a little

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.320 
like that and with the bat it's a little
bit<00:04:10.010> more<00:04:10.190> difficult<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.640> do<00:04:10.760> than<00:04:10.910> was<00:04:11.120> last

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
bit more difficult to do than was last

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.320 
bit more difficult to do than was last
year<00:04:11.600> well<00:04:12.410> yeah<00:04:12.800> I<00:04:13.040> guess<00:04:13.550> I'm<00:04:13.820> not<00:04:13.970> ready<00:04:14.209> to

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
year well yeah I guess I'm not ready to

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.000 
year well yeah I guess I'm not ready to
say<00:04:14.600> too<00:04:14.660> much<00:04:14.959> about<00:04:15.019> the<00:04:15.440> bat<00:04:15.620> right<00:04:15.860> now

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
say too much about the bat right now

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.370 
say too much about the bat right now
there<00:04:16.310> is<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.459> difference<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.539> it's<00:04:17.750> seeable

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
there is a difference and it's seeable

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.000 
there is a difference and it's seeable
to<00:04:18.560> everyone<00:04:19.060> we<00:04:20.060> played<00:04:20.630> a<00:04:20.830> Thursday<00:04:21.830> night

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
two hours and eight minutes we played

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.020 
two hours and eight minutes we played
today's<00:04:24.259> game<00:04:24.500> in<00:04:24.680> two<00:04:24.800> hours<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.160> 19<00:04:26.000> minutes

today's game in two hours and 19 minutes
so<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.139> game<00:04:27.319> has<00:04:27.530> changed<00:04:27.830> right<00:04:28.610> before<00:04:28.669> our

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
so the game has changed right before our

so the game has changed right before our
eyes<00:04:29.120> but<00:04:30.020> i'm<00:04:30.110> not<00:04:30.259> i'm<00:04:30.560> not<00:04:30.620> going<00:04:31.009> to<00:04:31.690> jump

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
eyes but i'm not i'm not going to jump

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.839 
eyes but i'm not i'm not going to jump
to<00:04:32.780> conclusions<00:04:33.410> because<00:04:33.770> i<00:04:34.130> do<00:04:34.340> know<00:04:34.639> there's

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
to conclusions because i do know there's

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.629 
to conclusions because i do know there's
a<00:04:34.910> learning<00:04:35.120> curve<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.539> these<00:04:35.840> bats<00:04:36.139> and<00:04:36.639> you

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
a learning curve to these bats and you

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.460 
a learning curve to these bats and you
know<00:04:37.759> today<00:04:38.180> was<00:04:38.330> an<00:04:38.449> anomaly<00:04:38.690> in<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.169> amount

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
know today was an anomaly in the amount

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.800 
know today was an anomaly in the amount
of<00:04:39.560> home<00:04:39.710> runs<00:04:39.919> were<00:04:40.160> hit<00:04:40.220> we<00:04:40.460> had<00:04:40.580> four<00:04:40.849> and<00:04:41.569> we

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
of home runs were hit we had four and we

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.180 
of home runs were hit we had four and we
haven't<00:04:42.020> hit<00:04:42.199> for<00:04:42.470> out<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:43.039> long<00:04:43.430> time<00:04:43.759> but

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
haven't hit for out and long time but

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.920 
haven't hit for out and long time but
people<00:04:46.190> that<00:04:46.669> are<00:04:46.819> good<00:04:47.000> hitters<00:04:47.030> have<00:04:47.780> the

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
people that are good hitters have the

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.839 
people that are good hitters have the
chance<00:04:48.199> to<00:04:48.410> be<00:04:48.590> continued<00:04:49.520> be<00:04:49.639> in<00:04:49.729> good

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
chance to be continued be in good

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.730 
chance to be continued be in good
hitters<00:04:50.030> and<00:04:50.360> hit<00:04:50.509> the<00:04:50.630> ball<00:04:50.810> out<00:04:50.840> it's<00:04:51.620> just

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
hitters and hit the ball out it's just

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.589 
hitters and hit the ball out it's just
probably<00:04:52.009> going<00:04:52.370> to<00:04:52.430> take<00:04:52.580> some<00:04:52.789> reps<00:04:53.060> but<00:04:53.300> i

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
probably going to take some reps but i

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.029 
probably going to take some reps but i
don't<00:04:53.840> think<00:04:53.900> it's<00:04:54.169> too<00:04:54.349> much<00:04:54.530> different<00:04:54.919> than

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
don't think it's too much different than

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.800 
don't think it's too much different than
would<00:04:55.280> you<00:04:55.759> got<00:04:55.910> to<00:04:56.000> get<00:04:56.120> your<00:04:56.270> hands<00:04:56.599> going

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
would you got to get your hands going

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.999 
would you got to get your hands going
you<00:04:57.020> got<00:04:57.169> to<00:04:57.259> hit<00:04:57.349> through<00:04:57.530> the<00:04:57.560> middle<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:57.949> the

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
you got to hit through the middle of the

00:04:58.009 --> 00:04:59.980 
you got to hit through the middle of the
baseball<00:04:58.280> those<00:04:59.000> are<00:04:59.150> all<00:04:59.180> the<00:04:59.419> components<00:04:59.690> of

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
baseball those are all the components of

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.450 
baseball those are all the components of
being<00:05:00.229> a<00:05:00.320> good<00:05:00.500> hitter<00:05:00.710> at<00:05:00.919> the<00:05:01.039> next<00:05:01.310> level

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
being a good hitter at the next level

two years ago with a bat that was a

two years ago with a bat that was a
nuclear<00:05:22.580> stick<00:05:22.940> and<00:05:23.380> now<00:05:24.380> we're<00:05:24.620> playing<00:05:24.830> with
