00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
all right we're going to talk a little

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.940 
all right we're going to talk a little
bit<00:00:12.760> about<00:00:13.080> my<00:00:14.080> approach<00:00:14.410> to<00:00:14.620> some<00:00:14.800> of<00:00:14.889> the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
bit about my approach to some of the

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.370 
bit about my approach to some of the
arranging<00:00:15.490> on<00:00:15.730> andy<00:00:16.720> timmons<00:00:16.840> band<00:00:17.200> plays

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
arranging on andy timmons band plays

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.519 
arranging on andy timmons band plays
Sergeant<00:00:17.770> Pepper<00:00:17.890> CD<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.869> in<00:00:19.990> general<00:00:20.410> the

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
Sergeant Pepper CD and in general the

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.760 
Sergeant Pepper CD and in general the
way<00:00:20.680> I<00:00:21.070> think<00:00:21.730> about<00:00:22.200> melody<00:00:23.200> on<00:00:23.320> the<00:00:23.349> guitar

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
way I think about melody on the guitar

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.000 
way I think about melody on the guitar
and<00:00:24.490> an<00:00:25.360> improvisation<00:00:26.200> too<00:00:26.410> I<00:00:26.440> think<00:00:26.590> a<00:00:26.860> lot

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
and an improvisation too I think a lot

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.189 
and an improvisation too I think a lot
more<00:00:27.039> horizontally<00:00:28.000> than<00:00:28.869> I<00:00:28.900> do

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
more horizontally than I do

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.220 
more horizontally than I do
vertically<00:00:30.039> so<00:00:30.340> if<00:00:31.330> I<00:00:31.480> had<00:00:31.600> a<00:00:31.660> chance<00:00:31.869> to<00:00:31.990> play

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
vertically so if I had a chance to play

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.170 
vertically so if I had a chance to play
a<00:00:32.260> line<00:00:32.500> that<00:00:32.860> would<00:00:33.010> be<00:00:33.160> these<00:00:33.340> notes<00:00:36.180> instead

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
a line that would be these notes instead

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.030 
a line that would be these notes instead
of<00:00:37.300> staying<00:00:37.540> in<00:00:37.780> that<00:00:37.840> position<00:00:38.110> I<00:00:38.680> would

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
of staying in that position I would

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.040 
of staying in that position I would
usually<00:00:39.910> want<00:00:40.239> to<00:00:40.330> hear<00:00:40.659> something<00:00:40.930> that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
usually want to hear something that

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.070 
usually want to hear something that
would<00:00:41.140> be<00:00:41.229> a<00:00:41.260> bit<00:00:41.409> more<00:00:41.530> lyrical<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:46.600> way<00:00:46.780> I'm

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
would be a bit more lyrical that way I'm

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.689 
would be a bit more lyrical that way I'm
sliding<00:00:47.500> a<00:00:47.979> lot<00:00:48.400> on<00:00:48.519> one<00:00:48.729> strings<00:00:50.550> which<00:00:51.550> is

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
sliding a lot on one strings which is

00:00:51.699 --> 00:01:26.480 
sliding a lot on one strings which is
fine

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.889 

it's<00:01:27.490> got<00:01:27.640> noodling<00:01:27.909> around<00:01:28.210> but<00:01:28.359> just<00:01:28.569> to

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
it's got noodling around but just to

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.319 
it's got noodling around but just to
kind<00:01:29.109> of<00:01:29.229> give<00:01:30.100> some<00:01:30.130> insight<00:01:30.609> to<00:01:30.640> how<00:01:31.149> I<00:01:31.179> think

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
kind of give some insight to how I think

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.130 
kind of give some insight to how I think
about<00:01:32.219> melodies<00:01:33.219> in<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:34.030> infinite<00:01:34.750> amount<00:01:35.049> of

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
about melodies in the infinite amount of

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.199 
about melodies in the infinite amount of
ways<00:01:35.289> there<00:01:35.530> are<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:35.740> express<00:01:36.549> the<00:01:36.729> same<00:01:36.909> notes

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:37.209 
ways there are to express the same notes

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:39.359 
ways there are to express the same notes
especially<00:01:37.450> on<00:01:37.719> the<00:01:37.810> guitar<00:01:38.109> on<00:01:38.709> a<00:01:38.979> piano

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
especially on the guitar on a piano

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.789 
especially on the guitar on a piano
you've<00:01:39.549> got<00:01:39.729> one<00:01:39.939> middle<00:01:40.240> C<00:01:40.450> but<00:01:41.349> you<00:01:41.709> know

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
you've got one middle C but you know

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.859 
you've got one middle C but you know
here<00:01:42.039> you<00:01:42.159> have<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:46.240> many<00:01:46.329> places<00:01:46.599> you<00:01:46.780> can

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
here you have so many places you can

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.230 
here you have so many places you can
play<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.349> same<00:01:47.530> phrase<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.579> I<00:01:48.640> experiment<00:01:49.060> a

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
play the same phrase so I experiment a

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.270 
play the same phrase so I experiment a
lot<00:01:49.390> around<00:01:49.959> quite<00:01:50.229> a<00:01:50.259> bit<00:01:50.380> while<00:01:50.770> I'm<00:01:50.890> working

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
lot around quite a bit while I'm working

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.260 
lot around quite a bit while I'm working
on<00:01:51.369> melodies<00:01:51.849> to<00:01:52.119> see<00:01:52.799> what<00:01:53.799> what<00:01:54.549> string<00:01:55.000> and

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
on melodies to see what what string and

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.089 
on melodies to see what what string and
what<00:01:55.420> was<00:01:55.539> you<00:01:55.989> know<00:01:56.110> spot<00:01:56.379> on<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.619> neck<00:01:56.829> it

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
what was you know spot on the neck it

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:59.279 
what was you know spot on the neck it
will<00:01:57.219> give<00:01:57.429> the<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:58.750> this<00:01:58.899> is<00:01:58.959> the<00:01:59.049> type<00:01:59.259> of

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
will give the that this is the type of

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.319 
will give the that this is the type of
inflection<00:02:00.129> of<00:02:00.219> motion<00:02:00.489> that<00:02:00.700> I'm<00:02:00.789> emotion

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
inflection of motion that I'm emotion

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.130 
inflection of motion that I'm emotion
that<00:02:01.420> I'm<00:02:01.539> trying<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.810> get<00:02:01.929> out<00:02:01.959> of<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.259> phrase

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
that I'm trying to get out of the phrase

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.020 
that I'm trying to get out of the phrase
so<00:02:05.140> like<00:02:05.500> with<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.920> little<00:02:06.189> help<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.399> my<00:02:06.520> friends

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
so like with a little help of my friends

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.389 
so like with a little help of my friends
on<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:08.079> my<00:02:08.530> arrangement<00:02:08.920> of<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.069> Sergeant

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
on the my arrangement of the Sergeant

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:25.430 
on the my arrangement of the Sergeant
Pepper<00:02:09.519> record<00:02:09.910> the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.390 

so<00:02:26.440> right<00:02:26.590> there<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:26.860> could<00:02:27.100> have<00:02:27.160> played<00:02:27.250> that

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
so right there I could have played that

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.920 
so right there I could have played that
whole<00:02:27.550> phrase

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.259 

Oh<00:02:34.400> but<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.430> thought<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.819> might<00:02:35.849> be<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.060> little

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
Oh but I thought it might be a little

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:58.140 
Oh but I thought it might be a little
nicer<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:36.780> know

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.000 

so<00:02:59.150> occasionally<00:02:59.510> supporting<00:03:00.230> with<00:03:00.379> with

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
so occasionally supporting with with

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.910 
so occasionally supporting with with
other<00:03:01.250> chord<00:03:01.640> tones<00:03:02.319> with<00:03:03.319> distortion<00:03:03.830> you

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
other chord tones with distortion you

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.589 
other chord tones with distortion you
can't<00:03:04.129> get<00:03:04.250> away<00:03:04.340> with<00:03:04.430> too<00:03:05.150> many<00:03:05.360> other

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
can't get away with too many other

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.539 
can't get away with too many other
voices<00:03:06.080> so<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:06.709> would<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:07.099> would<00:03:07.250> largely

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
voices so I would I would largely

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.369 
voices so I would I would largely
support<00:03:08.060> my<00:03:08.180> melodies<00:03:08.540> with<00:03:08.750> either<00:03:08.959> single

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
support my melodies with either single

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:34.120 
support my melodies with either single
notes<00:03:09.590> or<00:03:09.709> sometimes<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:10.280> so<00:03:10.730> here<00:03:11.599> it<00:03:11.659> is

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.400 

you

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.290 

so<00:03:41.410> I<00:03:41.710> figured<00:03:42.190> out<00:03:42.310> where<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:42.820> wanted<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.150> play

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
so I figured out where I wanted to play

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.940 
so I figured out where I wanted to play
the<00:03:43.420> melody<00:03:43.570> I<00:03:43.810> was<00:03:44.080> supported<00:03:44.590> with

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
the melody I was supported with

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.190 
the melody I was supported with
sometimes<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.490> root<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.390> sometimes<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.930> fifth

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
sometimes a root and sometimes a fifth

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.950 
sometimes a root and sometimes a fifth
and<00:03:47.530> then<00:03:48.040> work<00:03:48.580> in<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.820> guitar<00:03:49.270> chords<00:03:49.780> and

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
and then work in the guitar chords and

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.900 
and then work in the guitar chords and
the<00:03:50.110> soloing<00:03:50.980> bits<00:03:51.720> orchestrations<00:03:53.700> just<00:03:54.700> all

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
the soloing bits orchestrations just all

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.430
