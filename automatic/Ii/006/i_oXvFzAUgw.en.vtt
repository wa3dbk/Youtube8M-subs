00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 yes 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.969
 all right 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.020
 the second generation of the audi a3 cabrio 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.150
 comes loaded with news we will start 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.730
 for its body that has more cantilever 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.160
 rear in the style of the 3 sedan and its 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.170
 more than hypothetical rival the bmw series 2 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.720
 change 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.270
 the second its length as it grows 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.300
 to 44 meters long and also 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.489
 has improved its wheelbase 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.230
 now they are 26 meters which is redundant 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.640
 that the rear seats are more 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.920
 usable 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.630
 although you do not expect wonders they serve 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.180
 for short trips and we're all boys 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.129
 the best for you to leave your girlfriend in 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.129
 home and you go with three of her friends 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.420
 okay baby you take the car 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.140
 under its aluminum hood we find 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.940
 another novelty its engine releases this 1.4 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.260
 with turbo it disconnects two of its 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.030
 four cylinders to save 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.830
 fuel when you do not need much 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.700
 power 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.700
 and 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.850
 on paper is great and homologous 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.860
 average consumption of 5 liters to the times 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.780
 but in practice you have to make an effort 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.560
 in making an economic driving for 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.560
 that the thing is noticeable 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.100
 in motion you do not hear crunches would be missing 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.720
 more and we have 140 horses that are 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.119
 enough to move with ease the 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.700
 car has good stability and poise 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.250
 but we will enjoy more of the sky for 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.590
 roof that of pure driving by 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.360
 example with these new air vents 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.369
 at the height of the neck and they will do more 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.369
 comfortable the descapotados trips 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.120
 the hood and its mechanism only weigh 50 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.070
 kilos the drive can be done in 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.500
 stopped or robbing less than 50 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.500
 kilometers per hour and it takes 18 seconds 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.180
 and the trunk has also improved now 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.870
 are 320 liters that stay at 275 if 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.870
 we keep the hood 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.650
 but that can be extended to beating 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.650
 the backs of the back 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.560
 with the a3 cabrio we will have a very good 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.780
 car and what is more important a good 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.090
 convertible the bad thing is that the version 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.640
 access with this engine costs 34 thousand 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.650
 euros we are not going to discuss is an audi and 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.240
 the price is what it is but if we have 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.400
 have to keep in mind that getting stuck in 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:48.040
 expenses there is a highly recommended tdi of 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.040
 150 horses per thousand 340 euros more
