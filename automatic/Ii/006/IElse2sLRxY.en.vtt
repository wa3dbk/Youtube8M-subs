the first one and then I'll just go
through<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.420> bunch<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.140> other<00:01:07.380> exercises<00:01:08.250> where

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
through a bunch of other exercises where

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.520 
through a bunch of other exercises where
you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.180> actually<00:01:09.390> doing<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you can see that I'm actually doing the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.060 
you can see that I'm actually doing the
isometric<00:01:12.020> contraction<00:01:13.020> -<00:01:13.260> okay<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
isometric contraction - okay so the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.010 
isometric contraction - okay so the
first<00:01:14.220> time<00:01:14.400> remainin<00:01:14.760> straight<00:01:15.090> for<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.390> is

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
first time remainin straight for you is

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.890 
first time remainin straight for you is
a<00:01:16.290> standard<00:01:16.710> bicep<00:01:17.159> curl<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.720> I'm

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
a standard bicep curl so I'm

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.170 
a standard bicep curl so I'm
concentrating<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.400> curl<00:01:20.820> when<00:01:21.090> I'm

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
concentrating this curl when I'm

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.600 
concentrating this curl when I'm
isolating<00:01:21.900> my<00:01:22.020> bicep<00:01:22.409> over<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.430> left

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
isolating my bicep over here on the left

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.810 
isolating my bicep over here on the left
with<00:01:23.759> my<00:01:23.909> left<00:01:24.180> arm<00:01:24.500> I'm<00:01:25.500> excite<00:01:25.979> Aeneas<00:01:26.610> lis
