00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
the machine gun case one from basically

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.650 
the machine gun case one from basically
to<00:00:12.809> get<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.519> we<00:00:14.519> need<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.849> get<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
to get this we need to get to the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
from the hall

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.090 
from the hall
basically<00:00:20.310> climb<00:00:20.609> all<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.820> way<00:00:20.939> up<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.300> and

basically climb all the way up it and
you'll<00:00:23.100> see<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.460> door<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> solarium<00:00:25.460> from

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
you'll see the door to the solarium from

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.710 
you'll see the door to the solarium from
there

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
there

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.929 
there
we<00:00:28.140> basically<00:00:28.349> need<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.070> jump<00:00:29.310> into<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.640> pool

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
we basically need to jump into this pool

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.299 
we basically need to jump into this pool
and<00:00:30.269> get<00:00:30.810> over<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.560> diving<00:00:31.859> board<00:00:32.040> out

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
and get over to the diving board out

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.680 
and get over to the diving board out
there<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:33.540> actually<00:00:34.140> get<00:00:34.530> access<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.460> pool

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
there to actually get access to the pool

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.299 
there to actually get access to the pool
early<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> game<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.860> need<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.040> enter

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
early on in the game you need to enter

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.590 
early on in the game you need to enter
through<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.579> door<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.059> turn<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> water

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
through this door and turn on the water

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.770 
through this door and turn on the water
purification<00:00:40.489> system<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.910> what<00:00:42.329> that'll<00:00:42.510> do

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
purification system and what that'll do

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.160 
purification system and what that'll do
is<00:00:43.219> basically<00:00:44.219> over<00:00:45.030> time<00:00:45.270> get<00:00:45.719> rid<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.020> all

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
is basically over time get rid of all

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.860 
is basically over time get rid of all
the<00:00:46.379> pink<00:00:46.950> goo<00:00:47.160> stuff<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.239> here<00:00:48.450> in

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the pink goo stuff that you see here in

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.479 
the pink goo stuff that you see here in
front<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> pool<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.070> when<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.370> do

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
front of the pool so when you do

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.250 
front of the pool so when you do
actually<00:00:50.820> return<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.899> can<00:00:52.079> just

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
actually return to this you can just

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.490 
actually return to this you can just
jump<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> pool<00:00:52.890> right<00:00:53.129> hander<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.640> now<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
jump in the pool right hander in now and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.799 
jump in the pool right hander in now and
get<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> option<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.949> dive<00:00:56.480> as<00:00:57.480> soon<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.750> you

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
get the option to dive as soon as you

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.110 
get the option to dive as soon as you
dive<00:00:58.020> turn<00:00:58.440> immediately<00:00:58.859> immediately<00:00:59.280> right

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
dive turn immediately immediately right

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.010 
dive turn immediately immediately right
and<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.620> climb<00:01:01.859> up<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:03.180> ladder<00:01:03.390> here

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.899 

from<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.170> ladder<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:08.070> pretty<00:01:08.400> much<00:01:08.549> kinda

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
from that ladder you pretty much kinda

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.530 
from that ladder you pretty much kinda
like<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.180> look<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.869> diving<00:01:10.080> board<00:01:11.540> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
like that look to the diving board and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.990 
like that look to the diving board and
it's<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:12.900> simple<00:01:13.020> as<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.880> get<00:01:14.880> some

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
it's as simple as that you get some

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.359 
it's as simple as that you get some
rifle<00:01:15.299> ammo<00:01:15.470> as<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.710> see<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.310> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
rifle ammo as you can see here this is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.340 
rifle ammo as you can see here this is
the<00:01:17.549> first<00:01:17.880> ammo<00:01:18.360> case<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.990> machine<00:01:19.320> gun

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the first ammo case for the machine gun

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.700 
the first ammo case for the machine gun
so<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:21.060> will<00:01:21.810> take<00:01:22.080> us<00:01:22.380> from<00:01:23.689> a<00:01:24.689> capacity<00:01:25.680> of

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
so this will take us from a capacity of

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.819 
so this will take us from a capacity of
holding<00:01:26.220> 80<00:01:26.869> some<00:01:27.869> machine<00:01:28.170> gun<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.650> soul

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
holding 80 some machine gun and a soul

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.320 
holding 80 some machine gun and a soul
rifle<00:01:29.189> rounds

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.550 

so<00:01:34.330> now<00:01:34.480> a<00:01:34.810> capacity<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.680> 180<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:38.320> there<00:01:38.500> we

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
so now a capacity of 180 so there we

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.100 
so now a capacity of 180 so there we
have<00:01:38.680> it<00:01:38.710> that's<00:01:39.370> pretty<00:01:39.640> easy<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:40.060> do<00:01:40.210> just

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
have it that's pretty easy to do just

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.290 
have it that's pretty easy to do just
while<00:01:41.740> we're<00:01:41.890> on<00:01:41.980> this<00:01:42.130> topic<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.150> while

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
while we're on this topic and while

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.510 
while we're on this topic and while
we're<00:01:43.420> in<00:01:43.480> this<00:01:43.600> area<00:01:43.980> if<00:01:44.980> you<00:01:45.040> dive<00:01:45.220> off<00:01:45.370> with

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
we're in this area if you dive off with

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.930 
we're in this area if you dive off with
that<00:01:45.640> rod<00:01:46.920> continue<00:01:47.920> straight<00:01:48.130> forward<00:01:48.430> you

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
that rod continue straight forward you

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.990 
that rod continue straight forward you
can<00:01:49.120> guess<00:01:49.240> my<00:01:49.270> mama<00:01:50.340> unfortunately<00:01:51.340> you

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
can guess my mama unfortunately you

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.150 
can guess my mama unfortunately you
can't<00:01:52.240> carry<00:01:52.510> a<00:01:52.810> great<00:01:53.230> deal<00:01:53.470> of<00:01:53.500> that<00:01:53.830> this

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
can't carry a great deal of that this
