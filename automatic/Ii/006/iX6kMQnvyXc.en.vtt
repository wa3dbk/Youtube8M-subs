me so I use those totals I use Dina's

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.039 
me so I use those totals I use Dina's
pallet<00:00:46.620> knife<00:00:46.769> and<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.460> also<00:00:47.640> use<00:00:47.909> a<00:00:47.940> brain<00:00:48.239> okay

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.049 
pallet knife and I also use a brain okay

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.680 
pallet knife and I also use a brain okay
so<00:00:49.589> I'm<00:00:49.830> gonna<00:00:49.949> show<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.309> quickly<00:00:51.120> show<00:00:51.479> you<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
so I'm gonna show you quickly show you a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.180 
so I'm gonna show you quickly show you a
few<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.140> those<00:00:52.470> techniques<00:00:54.769> the<00:00:55.769> one<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.979> don't

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
few of those techniques the one I don't

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.820 
few of those techniques the one I don't
have<00:00:56.549> time<00:00:56.729> to<00:00:57.059> show<00:00:57.299> you<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.839> this<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:58.710> this

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
have time to show you is this one this

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.479 
have time to show you is this one this
is<00:00:58.890> my<00:00:59.100> block<00:00:59.600> technique<00:01:01.010> can<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.100> see<00:01:02.280> where

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
is my block technique can you see where

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.369 
is my block technique can you see where
it's<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.940> sort<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.269> in<00:01:03.360> blocks<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.869> color<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
it's it's sort of in blocks of color and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.950 
it's it's sort of in blocks of color and
and<00:01:05.339> what<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.880> take<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.240> paint<00:01:06.689> on

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
and what I do is I take the paint on

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.310 
and what I do is I take the paint on
here<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.070> block<00:01:08.430> paint<00:01:09.210> above<00:01:09.510> then<00:01:10.170> I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
here and I do a block paint above then I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.680 
here and I do a block paint above then I
go<00:01:10.500> again

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
go again

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.380 
go again
then<00:01:12.690> I<00:01:12.720> repeat<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.830> my<00:01:14.070> color<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.490> semi<00:01:14.940> opaque

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
then I repeat it my color is semi opaque

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.210 
then I repeat it my color is semi opaque
because<00:01:15.900> I'm<00:01:16.170> all<00:01:16.290> about<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> layers<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.070> want

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
because I'm all about the layers I want

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.310 
because I'm all about the layers I want
to<00:01:17.280> build<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.640> up<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.270> get<00:01:18.510> a<00:01:18.570> strong<00:01:19.050> color

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
to build it up so to get a strong color

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.780 
to build it up so to get a strong color
you<00:01:19.530> need<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.860> go<00:01:19.950> over<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.280> again

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
you need to go over it again

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.590 
you need to go over it again
for<00:01:21.180> example<00:01:22.580> where<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> dimension<00:01:24.210> paints

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
for example where the dimension paints

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.690 
for example where the dimension paints
they<00:01:25.470> are<00:01:25.650> journals<00:01:26.220> they're<00:01:26.370> like<00:01:26.520> small

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
they are journals they're like small

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.030 
they are journals they're like small
journals<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.050> painted<00:01:28.500> each<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.890> those

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
journals and we painted each of those

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.690 
journals and we painted each of those
twice<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.820> get<00:01:29.940> that<00:01:30.150> solid

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
twice to get that solid

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.350 
twice to get that solid
so<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:33.860> this<00:01:34.070> was<00:01:34.250> we<00:01:34.520> did<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:34.790> twice

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
so so this was we did this twice

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.170 
so so this was we did this twice
and<00:01:35.450> then<00:01:35.570> I<00:01:35.600> went<00:01:35.840> back<00:01:35.960> over<00:01:36.369> with<00:01:37.369> stems<00:01:37.729> in

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
and then I went back over with stems in

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.030 
and then I went back over with stems in
each<00:01:38.330> week<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:38.900> I<00:01:38.930> don't<00:01:39.290> really<00:01:39.439> have<00:01:39.590> time<00:01:39.830> to

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
each week so I don't really have time to

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.530 
each week so I don't really have time to
show<00:01:40.250> back<00:01:40.490> up<00:01:42.700> but<00:01:43.700> it's<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:43.939> really<00:01:44.149> really

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
show back up but it's a really really

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.719 
show back up but it's a really really
popular<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:44.960> it's<00:01:45.110> really<00:01:45.470> easy<00:01:45.860> as<00:01:46.220> usual

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
popular and it's really easy as usual

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.570 
popular and it's really easy as usual
everything<00:01:47.149> I<00:01:47.390> do<00:01:47.450> is<00:01:47.780> really<00:01:48.049> really<00:01:48.530> easy<00:01:48.860> so

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
everything I do is really really easy so

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.490 
everything I do is really really easy so
I<00:01:49.640> won't<00:01:49.909> be<00:01:49.970> showing<00:01:50.149> that<00:01:50.420> but<00:01:50.960> I'll<00:01:51.080> start

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
I won't be showing that but I'll start

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.410 
I won't be showing that but I'll start
at<00:01:51.740> first<00:01:51.950> with<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.310> baby<00:01:52.490> wipe<00:01:52.789> one<00:01:53.060> because

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
at first with a baby wipe one because

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.719 
at first with a baby wipe one because
it's<00:01:53.570> just<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.110> simple<00:01:54.140> taught<00:01:55.130> children<00:01:55.580> for

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
it's just so simple taught children for

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.480 
it's just so simple taught children for
years<00:01:56.080> and<00:01:57.080> just<00:01:57.560> got<00:01:57.649> to<00:01:57.860> make<00:01:58.039> things<00:01:58.189> really

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
years and just got to make things really

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.710 
years and just got to make things really
simple<00:01:58.850> for<00:01:59.299> them<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:04.399> jars<00:02:04.789> are<00:02:05.179> really

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
simple for them so the jars are really

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.400 
simple for them so the jars are really
really<00:02:06.729> large<00:02:07.729> jars<00:02:08.300> because<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:08.810> want<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.229> put

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
really large jars because I want to put

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.020 
really large jars because I want to put
my<00:02:09.530> baby<00:02:09.709> like<00:02:09.950> saying<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.310> want<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.729> put<00:02:10.910> my

my baby like saying I want to put my

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.330 
my baby like saying I want to put my
scraps<00:02:11.299> and<00:02:11.510> crafts<00:02:11.780> drapery<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.410> downside

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
scraps and crafts drapery the downside

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.759 
scraps and crafts drapery the downside
to<00:02:13.519> that<00:02:13.549> is<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.880> bigger<00:02:14.180> surface<00:02:14.510> area<00:02:14.870> means

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
to that is a bigger surface area means

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.860 
to that is a bigger surface area means

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
compatible with my English it was really

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.130 
compatible with my English it was really
really<00:04:22.130> important<00:04:22.760> to<00:04:22.850> me<00:04:22.970> that<00:04:23.480> the<00:04:23.660> inks

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
really important to me that the inks

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.350 
really important to me that the inks
dried<00:04:24.830> on<00:04:25.010> top<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:25.669> they<00:04:25.790> dried<00:04:26.060> quickly

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
dried on top and that they dried quickly

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.320 
dried on top and that they dried quickly
because<00:04:27.200> again<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.770> don't<00:04:27.860> like<00:04:28.669> hanging

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
because again I don't like hanging

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.890 
because again I don't like hanging
around<00:04:29.570> so<00:04:30.500> I<00:04:31.120> don't<00:04:32.120> want<00:04:32.480> people<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:32.870> think

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
around so I don't want people to think

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.840 
around so I don't want people to think
you<00:04:33.230> know<00:04:33.410> she's<00:04:33.710> not<00:04:33.830> using<00:04:34.010> inks<00:04:34.310> anymore<00:04:34.640> I

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
you know she's not using inks anymore I

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.930 
you know she's not using inks anymore I
will<00:04:35.150> be<00:04:35.240> combining<00:04:35.720> them<00:04:36.130> together<00:04:37.130> as<00:04:37.490> usual

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
will be combining them together as usual

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.460 
will be combining them together as usual
but<00:04:38.270> again<00:04:38.570> look<00:04:38.870> it's<00:04:39.110> not<00:04:39.260> subtle<00:04:39.500> at<00:04:39.770> all

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
but again look it's not subtle at all

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.800
