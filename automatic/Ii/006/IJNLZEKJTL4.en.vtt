00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:18.320
 actually transition to vegetarianism 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:20.390
 on syroedenii this indeed 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.940
 from the inside somehow this must come 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.100
 condition and probably only rely on 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.539
 moral reasons that this is impossible 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.850
 there is a pity or even there about salvation 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.600
 humanity think just understand me too 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.269
 I think that we have the strength to do this yes 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.659
 on this energy then you already think about 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:44.379
 moral principles here and when i 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:46.850
 said that I don't consider eating meat 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.819
 reckless i mean i don't 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.620
 condemn it but in fact if we 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:54.260
 really somehow let it be less 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.139
 do something for the planet will be better well 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.299
 even if it is destined to disappear, but 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:01.549
 then it will happen anyway well how 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.229
 here's about it to understand what 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:05.870
 say this inner state 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.090
 internal solution and operation is needed yes 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.400
 on some internal desire here 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.920
 movement that it's me because I want to 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.740
 dad wanna try it wanna live 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.900
 This experience is interesting and there already 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.740
 can come and moral of course 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.630
 principles that pity is not there kindness 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.420
 compassion is very important in our 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.490
 Life is such softness is really and 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.850
 in children now it is very obvious of course 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.010
 Well that does not want to say do not go like 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.620
 nobody needs to eat like that 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.630
 so yes it is actually better to put 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.350
 inner goal of mashed potatoes and moving to 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.880
 raw foods 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.409
 Well, that is, some internal 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.750
 better not to set a goal associated with 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.729
 syroedenii here really should 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.340
 be something inside her something own 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.020
 maybe some kind of develop ability 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.350
 maybe some kind of skill maybe some 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.130
 feeling up to but no transition to 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.770
 raw foods 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.080
 then the transition be easy and external 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.020
 communication parameters are nowhere to run 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.179
 not only raw food in general in life but 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.640
 external oriented very difficult 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.959
 because everything changes 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.510
 abrupt transition on among actually 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.880
 maybe i think harm is health 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.940
 aggravation let's say someone Bind 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.450
 then maybe this was the case with my 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.510
 husband though we tried completely only 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.190
 tyrannical products he has what 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.980
 can be with an ulcer but it was 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.730
 aggravation here is a very serious sharp 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.769
 the transition is not for everyone 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.170
 wrote and his book that 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.630
 psychosomatics has not been canceled 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.180
 In fact, this is the very same title that 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.280
 man is from the fact that he is not and 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.280
 unknown at all 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.110
 can only disappear when resolving 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.290
 some internal personal problems 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.269
 in fact and 90 percent if not 100 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.489
 because they are psychosomatic 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.720
 diseases so rely only on 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.400
 raw foods well, somehow it's stupid 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.160
 unwise let's say go to raw foods 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.880
 when they support family with such 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.660
 conditions difficult but again perhaps the same 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.579
 if you decide it for yourself that is if 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.450
 it really matters to you yes it will 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.579
 different cuisine 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.950
 but the issue does not need to condemn 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.709
 the one who eats differently and you 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.989
 use it for yourself as an experiment 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.049
 that is, you decide to try it 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.500
 eat and everything and then I think will 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.660
 okay somehow somehow not to fight but just 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.489
 on yourself experiment this same your 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.690
 the body is your right whatever you want 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.500
 do a lot of men raw i am about 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.140
 it was intended 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.150
 depends probably not here as I do not share 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.010
 usually men and women have of course 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.680
 differences between us but as a person as 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.840
 biological organism and those and others we 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.570
 about the same but inside by 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.030
 needs up amino acids and something all 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.010
 it is required the same man 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.770
 depending on which woman depending on which 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.530
 man if man is so internal 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.620
 strong there wants something life and ready 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.120
 to new sensations to new experiences then 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.490
 I understand a man 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.190
 if a woman is the same to that woman easier 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.769
 will come in if you know why I need it 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.100
 week by gender in general 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.780
 It does not seem so without a difference though 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.400
 power raids very much on the very 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.290
 I think it may be 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.500
 indeed they have easier it produces 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.200
 I do not know women softer somehow more 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.810
 avid seems to me to 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.280
 raw food children grow up but quite 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.100
 healthy more so more developed 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.140
 as children, I somehow believe in it more 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.810
 here probably from the preparation of the mother herself 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:49.140
 to this fact let's say yes that is because 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.210
 that she will be so his body already 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.340
 there must be such that its microflora 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.090
 produce all kind of substances and she 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.560
 should already 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.840
 be examined and understand what she has 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.580
 its accuracy is enough and then I think 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.370
 next to the child will not be problems 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.440
 if it feels like all the same because 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.330
 we have developed over the years and 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.460
 may really miss something 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.040
 it is definitely no matter what 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.540
 some vitamins may be special 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.729
 dishes even tragically or 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.700
 vegetarian will already need to cook 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:21.330
 and you need to take this into account to be 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.970
 very attentive is all good and not 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.640
 need nothing so i think is not worth of 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.710
 fire yes in the fire somehow throw and in 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.419
 In general, there is a healthy cheese. 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.740
 already examined feel good 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.940
 I think everything will be fine 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:39.289
 I believe in it just somehow I know for sure 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:41.319
 learn more on conceptual rf 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.319
 but
