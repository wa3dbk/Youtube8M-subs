00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.140
 hello that such good kids I'm trenzano 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.290
 corporation and today I bring you a new 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.850
 trick here in transit agree because 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.320
 many of you were asking me 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.180
 that if I was not going to upload some trick 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.640
 trànsit that please upload any 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.919
 Well, this week I present this 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.169
 new trick is a trick for a single 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.000
 player specifically but good can 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.590
 be several in game 1 doing the 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.020
 trick and the others can go 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.430
 moving a little bit around there but what 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.250
 What happens is that there is not a place 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.620
 concrete where they can put themselves but 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.140
 it can be fun according to all 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.060
 ways I present it as a trick for 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.370
 one player 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.560
 well first of all tell you that the 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.770
 trick is more complicated than it seems 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.930
 you know I'm not going to paint it like a trick 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.970
 easy because it is not, but it is 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.020
 truth is a curious trick 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.460
 we need a turbine and a shield to 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.170
 then I have put the camera in 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.640
 third person this movie camera that 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.800
 has useful heat so you can see the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.910
 detail what happens when you get 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.190
 do the trick you see 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.950
 we get right in the trunk of the 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.870
 car since I put it to you first 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.700
 person as you see it in the game for 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.280
 give you an idea of ​​the measures 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.220
 that you can take you can guide a 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.810
 little at the time of putting the objects but 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.240
 I 'm telling you , it's not easy to agree 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.790
 you have to pull forward and release 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.470
 the shield if it breaks like in this case 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.880
 the good that you have inside the shield and 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.520
 you can pick it up again without any 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.680
 problem we return to catch the shield 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.810
 we went outside the turbine always the 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.450
 corner to remember it we throw a little 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.340
 forward and let's go back and 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.320
 you have to do this to me 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.390
 watching in the video a kind of how 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.100
 the agreement screen starts to shake 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.330
 to tremble like he wants to take us out 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.690
 somewhere 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.630
 we started jumping and so on 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.150
 until we get into the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.590
 trunk we are already inside be careful 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.140
 because it is a trick from which we can 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.540
 leave easily and inadvertently we could 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.729
 leave not now you can make rounds 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.220
 very high and you had some weapon in the 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.560
 farm to choose we can catch 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.750
 all the bonuses I also bought the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.940
 galvanized cuffs because when you want 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.800
 leave to keep money in the bank then 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.110
 it is always useful to have them for 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.270
 beings of the fog so they do not bother 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.940
 so much so the trick is sometimes 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.340
 I've only tested it until round 20 already 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.720
 you know that I like to deepen 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.940
 very much the tricks and get to rounds 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.250
 very high but due to circumstances or 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.980
 I was freezing the play or my voice goes 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.350
 of the game or I had some bullshit 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.020
 agreement then I decided to finish to 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.880
