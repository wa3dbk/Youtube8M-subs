00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.760
 He did fit if one of them has been going on for two months and it is boring 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.350
 it never in mountains on zoom in a short time had team of coach erik braal 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.030
 saying goodbye to bennink adjuster he was caught canadian as it turned out 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.169
 a doping test and defenses has been dismissed 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.230
 and both blue returned to argentina and where he has been before 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.090
 played that is also good news last Tuesday to get amongst the locals 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.880
 eiffeltowers den bosch this weekend came upcoming but I am driving to Amsterdam 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.989
 visit the current national champion the comment comes from outside 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.480
 despite the bad weather conditions yesterday afternoon in the west of Brabant 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.330
 nevertheless the mercury high number of visitors comes to the boulevard sports hall 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.470
 So we are watching the match between Bergen op Zoom and Amsterdam 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.089
 amsterdam it is the leader 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.319
 of the competition in the Netherlands and Bergen op Zoom is fourth 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.620
 Bergen op zoom starts well 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.710
 37 36 is a benefit of West Brabant with the win 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.260
 but after the break came that the final sprint to have problems 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.090
 dealing with new players due to the absence of bemmel job and with 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.080
 button that are both with the German 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.700
 If there are nine players then usual at basketball that is also twelve to 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.610
 thirteen players on the team 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.210
 The result is that determining players are the first to sell them 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.210
 how many minutes to make than usual 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.950
 and Amsterdam that can benefit from this, the fatigue hits in the third quarter 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.360
 a little bit 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.970
 And they make a so-called streak to think that there are more than ten points on it 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.970
 to be scored in a row Amsterdam itself did not score Noordwijk 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.980
 the underlying value to tim a trend 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.760
 seventeen points ahead for the Amsterdam team 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.530
 so problems for us that you last week against the forest well 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.530
 made a difference between day and translators in-house 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.890
 via, among others, this hit by arvin slagter, the team will come to the past 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.440
 quarter closer together 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.440
 68 81 or the intermediate position 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.870
 but then brand in the world for example when selling too much trouble 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.870
 has made three pointers the tenth time at mass 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.789
 and this time unfortunately 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.530
 the order trend 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.530
 Looking outside if you are like this 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.260
 gets the ball with the right stand for three-point shot imminent Amsterdam greater 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.589
 than the standard 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:19.699
 68 84 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:23.099
 to the satisfaction of architect the police is the first coach of the 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.539
 Amsterdammers 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:27.539
 He is still gesticulating but sees that he is already in with the win 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.529
 the last attack of the matches at 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:33.529
 the structurally prandelli bank of 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.719
 75 84 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.299
 Steel was actually after a good first half which was for large portions 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.329
 we had controls over the competition and we have a few 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.789
 dot it was it was exciting the absolute top 10 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:51.049
 hey actually went with one point difference walk into peace with one 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.249
 point lead 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:57.109
 the thomas in the third quarter a little after five minutes 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.679
 the energy 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.979
 and then come anselmo good run places better defense and he who run 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:06.399
 We are never actually talking about the agreed riders day 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:08.159
 below 50 points for and 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.199
 there is still something to come back 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.139
 not enough to win the set 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.539
 religion as well as the standstill on the selections 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.779
 in the selection anyway too narrow we are looking for reinforcements that we go 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.449
 only the do that very carefully and really try to get boys there 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:22.069
 to get 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.189
 that match the guys we have now 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.409
 hey a proud why also changed because i think in essence a great one 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.780
 team we have had to change a little more for a year to make sure 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.900
 make sure that at the end we can also be the good guys on the field with it 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.669
 project the right further energy 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.779
 say, of course, new players are coming, but they must look carefully 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.539
 it is now important that someone comes quickly that this group is not overburdened 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:43.379
 touches 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.359
 after that is certain and one could certainly be working on it 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.359
 but the I think it's more important that 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.999
 those are guys who fit in with this group they need to defend them 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:58.290
 in terms of personality, this group must fit like one or another 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:01.259
 bring in star player who shoots in the 30 but what the rest are thinking about 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:02.669
 from that comes that do 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:06.489
 then we take something that is in building that that would then be lost that 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.479
 did we give everything we do this today was not enough a decos we 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.109
 have been completely complete and that it was born to another son 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.669
 how tough is playing with a complete team 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:16.909
 Rome 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:20.679
 she talks much more pleasantly, so being able to stand still is everywhere on the field 

00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:22.189
 and the 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:24.860
 winehouse can handle it but you notice that 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.069
 just the points 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.619
 it just gets a bit tired for the whole team against the woods 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.400
 french from wooden just the board to be admitted until it can very well 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.469
 being able to do very well out of thousands 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:38.740
 Klaus must play a good match in Sparta 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.740
 and why the owner was enough of that 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.309
 also turn it further on to make more minutes 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:46.990
 oh yes certainly but me 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.270
 As mentioned earlier limited space players come but I did like that 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.599
 also win for care 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.599
 geert about my much better environment and was playing 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.830
 family will come 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.889
 according to Monday 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:00.889
 but then do nothing about it
