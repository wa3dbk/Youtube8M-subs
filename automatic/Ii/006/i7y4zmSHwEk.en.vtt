00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello this video we will talk about 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.530
 armor key ligatures in videos 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.530
 among those we know the musical guidelines 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.990
 in clear musical notes 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.959
 the rite of compass shapes between several 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.510
 musical scales light armor 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.780
 basically indicate which chile says 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.180
 the forest yesterday at our scale 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.080
 if you remember the class on scales 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.360
 musical 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.250
 we saw each scale happened together 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.990
 specific notes 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.410
 let's see for example the sound scale 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.649
 the larger the salt scale contracted 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.300
 replaced Chinese as well as 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.070
 we have already seen when we want to indicate a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.640
 any substitute on the agenda 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.670
 we put the symbol before the note then 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.649
 we imagine in the day in greater sun 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.319
 whenever it appears in the fact note we would have 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.420
 that put the replaced armor of 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:57.929
 clodo is not to describe 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.239
 this nice all over the staff 's armor 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.850
 classic consists of one or more symbols 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.450
 replaced the bi mobile placed in the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.420
 the key front means so ever 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.299
 played a note on the line the space of that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.360
 musical accident of cra note replaced 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.219
 album according to the symbol 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.350
 continuing with the example of greater sun 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.130
 we already know that the only major scale has a 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.799
 sushi pedro 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.990
 the easy Chinese instead of putting one of the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.899
 symbols united in each fan on the agenda 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.829
 we put the symbol on the line of pha logo 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.409
 face clear 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.250
 so whenever you 're a partner, you 're talking about 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.039
 Schedule 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.689
 we touch the janitor on any fact not 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.180
 only in the duel in one of the symbols if 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.670
 find the class armor was 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.409
 enough reading of scores and if 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.020
 they wanted to join a music tonality 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.840
 simply modify the nail 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.359
 move one day so the tonic has the same 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.350
 relationship with scale that had previously 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:57.390
 for example same day in D major is 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.799
 better have the links replaced 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.619
 pha pity so now let's hear the mud in 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.369
 largest sun and then in greater 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.369
 the same woman 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.450
 now in D major 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.590
 note that the notes will not 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.470
 the tonic left the sun route and went to 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.900
 note but all intervals between the 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.440
 notes keep the same 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.680
 This is called the transposition or be a 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.900
 damage to the tone music we could also 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.459
 find the notes in the same place and one 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.770
 its hard shape and keyboard 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.160
 but then we will have some time in D major 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.530
 margin olidio sun which is the Greek way 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.950
 we'll leave the moods for another 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.050
 video order in which those of our 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.840
 customers appear on the firearm's 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.800
 always the same and the place where they write 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.489
 also 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.310
 this because the musician has to absorb a 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.580
 very large amount of information 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.730
 while playing it is much easier to have a 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.620
 always the same pattern because so after 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.500
 some training a musician looks at the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.380
 armor of clovis 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.709
 indirectly to a very common question 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:30.430
 which is the following when using us 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.970
 and when to use the brother as already 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.870
 We saw some notes have the same sound but 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:41.590
 may have front names for example the 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.310
 between there and if we can call it 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.590
 home replaced by simão 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.640
 which of the two kleber both names 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.280
 are correct 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.680
 however, depending on the scale 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.690
 it is more accurate to use one of the 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.970
 two 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.640
 the tonic scales are carlos with 8 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.070
 All grades must contain all grades 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.600
 first to eighth grade SOFTEAM the 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.760
 first and eighth grade for example let's 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.620
 look at the piano keyboard and use the 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:17.229
 shape tontons mton tones mton as it already 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.519
 we came to discover the notes of the scale 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.220
 of the greater ri 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:25.240
 we started in reverse and added a tone 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:33.010
 less to me but an easy tone china 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:36.650
 milton sun a tone there but a tone if more 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:40.250
 a sharp tone but the milton 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:45.289
 and then renew the notes of the royal scale 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:50.650
 the greater the sun the better 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:53.680
 and we have all the notes of r 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:05:00.289
 2 and experience the largest lighthouse scale 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:06.350
 make a sun tone a tone up there tone there 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:09.820
 cynicism a tone to a back tone but a tone 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:14.500
 limited me a fact 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:23.600
 so I think she's added feature notes 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:25.789
 sun there there C - sharp re mi do is 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.970
 let's not miss the note 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:31.699
 so despite the note lácio chinnici we 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.180
 and in practice the same note is more correct 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.530
 call it that way on the family scale 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:45.860
 so we will have all the notes of the scale 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:47.930
 diatonic is there sunshine there if you donate my faith is yes 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.570
 we decided we should use the symbol of 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.729
 smile or evil 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.340
 now let's see the bandages this is a 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:58.430
 complement to the video of the scored notes 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.050
 the bandages as well as the stitches serve 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.909
 to increase the duration of a note 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:08.389
 musical with is simple when a note 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:12.020
 musical bandage has an ex ink years to 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:15.260
 the duration of the note to which the 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:19.120
 to be linked to a simpler form 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:23.120
 with a bandage we fuse the notes 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:27.199
 for example the minimum is the duration of 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.889
 a hit if this is excited to unite 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:33.050
 next cinema to which we have a minimum 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.630
 two beats 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.690
 the value of the first but the value of the 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:42.409
 urns, bandages can only happen 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:44.030
 with notes of the same height the ligature 

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:47.800
 You can cross with steps as in 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.800
 saying let's hear 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.520
 then the ligature serves to join the 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.940
 duration of two musical notes of the same 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.940
 height and this soul is completed 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.480
 so our channel I am put like 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.480
 to the next
