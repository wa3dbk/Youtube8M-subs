the plate again there are a lot of

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.679 
the plate again there are a lot of
different<00:00:26.760> activities<00:00:26.850> that<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.599> do

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
different activities that you can do

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.290 
different activities that you can do
with<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.170> could<00:00:28.320> do<00:00:28.640> letter<00:00:29.640> sequencing

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
with this you could do letter sequencing

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.970 
with this you could do letter sequencing
where<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> children<00:00:31.380> would<00:00:31.500> need<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> put<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
where the children would need to put the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.549 
where the children would need to put the
letters<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.369> alphabetical<00:00:33.150> order<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.750> expand

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
letters in alphabetical order and expand

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.520 
letters in alphabetical order and expand
upon<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.610> have<00:00:35.820> them<00:00:36.350> do<00:00:37.350> either

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
upon that you can have them do either

upon that you can have them do either
uppercase<00:00:37.980> uppercase<00:00:38.610> match<00:00:39.030> upper

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870

lowercase match or lower to lowercase

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.910 
lowercase match or lower to lowercase
match<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> children<00:00:43.800> or<00:00:43.860> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
match so if you have the children or you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.770 
match so if you have the children or you
have<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> letters<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.489> sequence<00:00:45.090> or<00:00:45.360> an<00:00:45.450> order

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
have the letters in sequence or an order

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.810 
have the letters in sequence or an order
they<00:00:46.289> would<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.530> take<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.800> matching<00:00:47.640> paper

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
they would then take the matching paper

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.869 
they would then take the matching paper
plate<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.270> put<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.129> where<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.160> belongs

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
plate and put it where it belongs

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.200 
plate and put it where it belongs
and<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.930> order<00:00:52.579> to<00:00:53.579> make<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.820> more<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.090> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
and in order to make that more of a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.660 
and in order to make that more of a
challenge<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.289> children<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.520> also

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
challenge the children can you can also

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.189 
challenge the children can you can also
set<00:00:56.940> these<00:00:57.059> out<00:00:57.210> peer<00:00:57.449> ranges<00:00:57.780> out<00:00:57.899> ahead<00:00:58.140> of

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
set these out peer ranges out ahead of

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.220 
set these out peer ranges out ahead of
time<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.770> mix<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.940> letters<00:01:00.239> off<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.079> only

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
time and mix the letters off now I only

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.479 
time and mix the letters off now I only
have<00:01:01.320> four<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.800> show<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.340> would<00:01:02.460> have

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
have four to show you but you would have

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.979 
have four to show you but you would have
more<00:01:02.850> out<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.329> would<00:01:03.420> mix<00:01:03.600> them<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
more out and you would mix them up and

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.679 
more out and you would mix them up and
put<00:01:04.140> them<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.379> order<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.450> then<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
put them out of order and then the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.890 
put them out of order and then the
children<00:01:06.900> would<00:01:07.110> need<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.470> find<00:01:08.659> where<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
children would need to find where the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.480 
children would need to find where the
matching<00:01:10.290> plate<00:01:10.500> would<00:01:10.650> go<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.100> these<00:01:11.280> aren't

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
matching plate would go so these aren't

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.950 
matching plate would go so these aren't
in<00:01:11.610> order<00:01:11.790> anymore<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.659> little<00:01:12.810> bit

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
in order anymore so it's a little bit

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.130 
in order anymore so it's a little bit
more<00:01:13.080> difficult<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:13.830> them<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> find<00:01:15.140> where

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
more difficult for them to find where

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.170 
more difficult for them to find where
they<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.460> would<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> matching

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
they go so that would be a matching

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.060 
they go so that would be a matching
activity<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.020> then<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.619> would<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
activity and then you would have the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.100 
activity and then you would have the
sequencing<00:01:20.670> activity<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.330> besides<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.930> if

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
sequencing activity but besides that if

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.810 
sequencing activity but besides that if
you<00:01:22.200> make<00:01:22.380> multiple<00:01:22.860> copies<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.520> letters

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
you make multiple copies of the letters

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.410 
you make multiple copies of the letters
you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.930> children<00:01:25.710> write<00:01:25.979> their<00:01:26.159> names

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
you can have children write their names

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.350 
you can have children write their names
spell<00:01:27.420> their<00:01:27.540> names<00:01:27.720> out<00:01:27.960> with<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> plate<00:01:29.360> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
spell their names out with the plate and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.880 
spell their names out with the plate and
this<00:01:30.509> one's<00:01:30.720> probably<00:01:30.900> not<00:01:31.170> going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> fit<00:01:31.619> and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
this one's probably not going to fit and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.899 
this one's probably not going to fit and
but<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.520> Liam<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:34.220> you<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.369> do<00:01:35.490> sight

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
but this is Liam and you can do sight

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.730 
but this is Liam and you can do sight
words<00:01:36.180> have<00:01:36.750> children<00:01:37.110> spell<00:01:37.350> sight<00:01:37.560> words

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
words have children spell sight words

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.929 
words have children spell sight words
you<00:01:37.860> could<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.159> little<00:01:38.430> strips<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.759> paper

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you could have little strips of paper

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.310 
you could have little strips of paper
available<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.720> words<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.200> want
