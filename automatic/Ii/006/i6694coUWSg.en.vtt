strategy<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.750> my<00:00:12.929> opinion<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.440> think<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
strategy in my opinion I think is the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.379 
strategy in my opinion I think is the
easiest<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.610> that's<00:00:14.730> why<00:00:14.880> I'm<00:00:14.969> making<00:00:15.000> a

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
easiest and that's why I'm making a

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.420 
easiest and that's why I'm making a
video<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.320> did<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.619> on<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.920> first<00:00:17.130> day

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
video of it we did this on the first day

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.220 
video of it we did this on the first day
I<00:00:17.670> think<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.270> was<00:00:18.359> actually<00:00:18.750> even<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.140> our

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
I think it was actually even in our

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.759 
I think it was actually even in our
first<00:00:19.529> game<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.220> we<00:00:20.430> played<00:00:20.699> but<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:21.630> had<00:00:21.869> no

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
first game that we played but we had no

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.769 
first game that we played but we had no
idea<00:00:23.130> what<00:00:23.430> weapons<00:00:23.789> were<00:00:23.939> good<00:00:24.150> what<00:00:24.420> weapons

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
idea what weapons were good what weapons

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.330 
idea what weapons were good what weapons
weren't<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.350> i<00:00:25.410> think<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.740> only<00:00:25.859> ended<00:00:26.099> up

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
weren't and i think we only ended up

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.550 
weren't and i think we only ended up
getting<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.640> like<00:00:26.820> around<00:00:27.029> 20<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:28.380> game

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
getting the like around 20 in that game

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.120 
getting the like around 20 in that game
um<00:00:28.789> but<00:00:29.789> then<00:00:29.939> soon<00:00:30.840> after<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.410> got<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> 27

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
um but then soon after that we got a 27

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.310 
um but then soon after that we got a 27
I<00:00:32.369> think<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> game<00:00:32.910> after<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.570> then<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.200> game

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
I think the game after and then the game

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.440 
I think the game after and then the game
after<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.340> ended<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.640> playing<00:00:35.910> with<00:00:36.059> I'm

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
that thing is really really beast in the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.899 
that thing is really really beast in the
clip<00:01:15.299> size<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.340> big<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
clip size and it is just like so big and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.810 
clip size and it is just like so big and
the<00:01:18.900> way<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.770> were<00:01:19.830> camping<00:01:20.280> right<00:01:20.640> now

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the way that we were camping right now

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.749 
the way that we were camping right now
is<00:01:21.119> because<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.220> door<00:01:23.220> behind<00:01:23.369> us

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
is because we have the door behind us

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.520 
is because we have the door behind us
closed<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.600> reason<00:01:24.900> why<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.140> camp<00:01:25.380> in

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
closed and the reason why we camp in

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.890 
closed and the reason why we camp in
this<00:01:25.680> area<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.189> because<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.759> too<00:01:27.150> long

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
this area is because it's just too long

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.859 
this area is because it's just too long
stretches<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.409> hallway<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.130> then<00:01:29.689> after<00:01:30.689> that

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
stretches of hallway and then after that

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.270 
stretches of hallway and then after that
you<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.740> decontamination<00:01:33.079> area<00:01:34.280> over

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you have the decontamination area over

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.899 
you have the decontamination area over
here<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.939> know<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:36.840> those<00:01:37.700> poisoned<00:01:38.700> dudes

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
here so you know if those poisoned dudes

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.030 
here so you know if those poisoned dudes
whatever<00:01:39.329> like<00:01:39.720> hit<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.259> then<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.860> know<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
whatever like hit you then you know you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.969 
whatever like hit you then you know you
can<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.310> easily<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:42.180> press<00:01:42.750> X<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.470> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
can just easily just press X and you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.280 
can just easily just press X and you
know<00:01:44.100> get<00:01:44.579> yourself<00:01:45.950> back<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.310> normal<00:01:47.549> but

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
know get yourself back up to normal but

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.480 
know get yourself back up to normal but
anyways<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.500> pretty<00:01:49.710> much<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.920> sip<00:01:50.250> for<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
anyways it's pretty much a sip for the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.399 
anyways it's pretty much a sip for the
strategy<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.180> definitely<00:01:51.659> recommend<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
strategy I definitely recommend the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.840 
strategy I definitely recommend the
Wonder<00:01:52.829> weapon<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.189> forgot<00:01:53.520> what<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.790> called

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
Wonder weapon I forgot what it's called

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.760 
Wonder weapon I forgot what it's called
but<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.840> gun<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.200> awesome<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.520> mle<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.770> I

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
but that gun is awesome the mle and I

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.870 
but that gun is awesome the mle and I
mean<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.430> could<00:01:59.670> try<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.090> use<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:01.490> wall<00:02:02.490> weapon

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
mean you could try to use a wall weapon

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.530 
mean you could try to use a wall weapon
and<00:02:03.119> keep<00:02:03.509> up<00:02:03.689> creating<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.200> as<00:02:04.320> well<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.540> we

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and keep up creating it as well but we

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.660 
and keep up creating it as well but we
already<00:02:06.719> tried<00:02:07.020> doing<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.619> before<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.340> think

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
already tried doing that before I think

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.490 
already tried doing that before I think
that<00:02:08.819> was<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:08.940> game<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.420> gots<00:02:09.569> around<00:02:09.810> 27

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
that was the game that we gots around 27

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.610 
that was the game that we gots around 27
and<00:02:10.709> whenever<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.849> upgrade<00:02:12.300> guns

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
and whenever you upgrade guns

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.289 
and whenever you upgrade guns
mo<00:02:14.159> starts<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.519> become<00:02:14.670> more<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.239> more

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
mo starts to become more and more

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.089 
mo starts to become more and more
expensive<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.140> whenever<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:16.590> upgrade<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.069> to

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
expensive and whenever you upgrade it to

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.960 
expensive and whenever you upgrade it to
level<00:02:17.400> 20<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.750> MP<00:02:19.260> 11<00:02:19.680> cost<00:02:20.069> four<00:02:20.459> thousand

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
level 20 the MP 11 cost four thousand

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.899 
level 20 the MP 11 cost four thousand
dollars<00:02:21.330> per<00:02:22.099> you<00:02:23.099> know<00:02:23.220> set<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.580> ammo<00:02:23.879> that

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
dollars per you know set of ammo that

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.750 
dollars per you know set of ammo that
you<00:02:24.239> wanted<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.599> buy<00:02:24.780> which<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.760> awfully

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
you wanted to buy which is awfully

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.670 
you wanted to buy which is awfully
expensive<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.840> i<00:02:28.170> would<00:02:28.349> not<00:02:28.470> recommend

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
expensive and i would not recommend

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.479 
expensive and i would not recommend
doing<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:29.959> you<00:02:30.959> know<00:02:31.079> as<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.530> day<00:02:31.769> one<00:02:32.159> just

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
doing so you know as of day one just

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.819 
doing so you know as of day one just
because<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:33.209> how<00:02:33.390> expensive<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.079> ammo<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.620> and

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
because of how expensive the ammo is and

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.160 
because of how expensive the ammo is and
anytime<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.670> guys<00:02:35.879> do<00:02:36.150> run<00:02:36.360> out<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.540> ammo<00:02:36.930> and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
anytime you guys do run out of ammo and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.809 
anytime you guys do run out of ammo and
like<00:02:37.500> your<00:02:37.680> gun<00:02:37.920> or<00:02:37.950> something<00:02:38.129> and<00:02:38.549> you<00:02:38.640> buy

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
like your gun or something and you buy

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.449

it<00:02:38.879> off<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.090> wall<00:02:39.390> if<00:02:39.629> if<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.860> still<00:02:41.099> costs

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
it off the wall if if it still costs

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.460 
it off the wall if if it still costs
less<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.790> pack<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.269> punch<00:02:42.629> I'd<00:02:42.870> recommend<00:02:43.260> that

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
last thing about pack punching guns is

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.650 
last thing about pack punching guns is

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
long as possible just so you can

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.789 
long as possible just so you can
maximize<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.989> amount<00:03:13.079> of<00:03:13.290> rounds<00:03:13.470> that

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
think that's pretty much it for this
