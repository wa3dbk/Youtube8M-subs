00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.029
 in this video we will teach you how to do 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.330
 some meatballs of beef in one of the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.630
 Mexican styles the first step that 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.210
 let's do is soften our rice 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.249
 this rice we will not be cooking 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.890
 completely but simply what 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:22.289
 let's soften a little we are using 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.800
 half a cup of rice can therefore 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.779
 use a more or less cup of water and go 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.390
 to cook for about ten 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.499
 minutes nothing more 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.680
 remember that you are only 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:36.680
 softening here we already see it softened 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:59.500
 the second step is to start chopping 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.780
 our vegetables we are going to chop a 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.560
 half onion that is going to be used for 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.500
 small pieces of meat are going to be 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.730
 using a clove of garlic also what 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.730
 they will cut small 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.000
 and we will also be using sheets of 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.300
 mint to highlight also the are going to 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 be tracing 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.160
 adding the mixture of 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.890
 the meat that is then the one that is going to 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.890
 turn into our meatballs 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.780
 but to this mix 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:51.100
 We are using seasoning here 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.610
 we are using goya seasoning one that is the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.870
 which is called total seasoning can use 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.580
 any seasoning of your choice or 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.580
 simply omit them 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.950
 to this mix we will also be 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.080
 adding rice this rice is used 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.740
 for 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.740
 and incorporate it into our meatballs 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.000
 or an average is being added 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.000
 teaspoon of salt 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.200
 Once you have prepared the mixture for 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.319
 your meatballs can proceed to 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.170
 then be cutting the 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.660
 vegetables for the sauce this is going to 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.450
 consist of three tomatoes that are going to 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.450
 cut into small cubes 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.930
 a garlic a clove of garlic that also 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.579
 they are going to cut 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.579
 a complete onion 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.580
 all these vegetables together with three 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.819
 chipotle chiles in adobo of which 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.370
 we're also going to use a little bit of his 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.450
 your sauce will go directly to a 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:16.049
 blender and let's liquefy and let's go 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.080
 to use this smoothie without straining that this 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:23.540
 it's going to be the sauce that goes where it's going 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.540
 to cook our meatballs 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.420
 here we can see how we are adding 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:33.410
 our chipotle chiles 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.410
 in marinade 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:46.130
 We are going to use approximately 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.200
 a cup two cups of water to help 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.230
 that the liquefied 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.629
 Liquefy well no 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.710
 and the rest of the water is also going to 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.080
 use for 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.300
 for the sauce when I go to the pot 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.970
 in the pot we will be using 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.640
 approximately one tablespoon of oil 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.640
 We're going to let it warm up pretty well 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.959
 let's add once it's hot 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.959
 let's add the smoothie we made 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.340
 together with him 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.590
 the rest of the water we will be using 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.590
 total 4 cups 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.349
 we have to sound with the seasoning you 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.159
 you can use the one of your average preference 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.159
 teaspoon of salt 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:58.569
 will proceed to mix their meat that already 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:02.020
 They had ready with all the vegetables 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:06.479
 the ingredients can mix well 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.479
 the better I mix better 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.090
 and then they can proceed to make their 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.600
 meatballs the size of your preference 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.980
 we make a little big 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.980
 they are very rich like this 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.569
 but you can do the size of 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.849
 your preference 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:30.830
 once they have their meatballs ready 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:33.179
 can proceed to put them in their broth or 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.749
 liquid that should already be in point of 

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:39.240
 boiling to start cooking let's go 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:42.080
 to cook for about 15 to 20 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.080
 minutes 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:51.029
 and we can then add vegetables in 

00:05:48.299 --> 00:05:53.789
 this case we are using carrots and 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:55.769
 potatoes you could use something 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:59.479
 different if they want it 

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:59.479
