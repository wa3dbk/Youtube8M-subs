was neglecting the multiplayer actor I

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.749 
was neglecting the multiplayer actor I
think<00:00:31.349> I've<00:00:31.470> been<00:00:31.619> playing<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.009> since<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
think I've been playing this since the

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.760 
think I've been playing this since the
11th<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> 12th<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.930> November<00:00:34.350> which<00:00:34.559> is

11th of the 12th of November which is
just<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.160> couple<00:00:35.460> days<00:00:35.730> after<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.719> release<00:00:36.989> I

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
just a couple days after the release I

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.979 
just a couple days after the release I
did<00:00:37.890> not<00:00:38.040> get<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.399> release<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.030> i<00:00:39.300> was<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
did not get it on release so i was a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.170 
did not get it on release so i was a
little<00:00:40.020> bit<00:00:40.320> behind<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.800> lot<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.040> people<00:00:41.340> i'd

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
little bit behind on a lot of people i'd

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.049 
little bit behind on a lot of people i'd
say<00:00:42.510> over<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.469> time<00:00:43.739> I've<00:00:44.190> become<00:00:44.610> at<00:00:44.879> least

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
say over that time I've become at least

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.720 
say over that time I've become at least
moderately<00:00:45.629> decent<00:00:45.870> i<00:00:46.289> think<00:00:47.160> my<00:00:47.309> kill<00:00:47.579> death

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
moderately decent i think my kill death

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.819 
moderately decent i think my kill death
ratio<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.840> slightly<00:00:49.079> under<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> two<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
ratio is just slightly under a two to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.340 
ratio is just slightly under a two to
one<00:00:49.860> right<00:00:50.190> now<00:00:50.340> overall<00:00:50.789> between<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.079> team

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
one right now overall between the team

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.770 
one right now overall between the team
game<00:00:52.800> types<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.399> free<00:00:53.730> pearl<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.210> think

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
game types and free pearl I think

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.209 
game types and free pearl I think
free-for-alls<00:00:55.170> my<00:00:55.320> highest<00:00:55.620> KD<00:00:55.739> are<00:00:56.010> right

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
free-for-alls my highest KD are right

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.029 
free-for-alls my highest KD are right
now<00:00:56.489> i<00:00:56.670> think<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.180> i<00:00:57.449> think<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.260> almost<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.829> 4

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
now i think it's i think it's almost a 4

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
guy thought I was dead I ended up

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.320 
guy thought I was dead I ended up
falling<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.709> ground<00:02:40.000> my<00:02:41.000> pistol

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
falling to the ground my pistol

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.210 
falling to the ground my pistol
automatically<00:02:41.870> came<00:02:42.050> out<00:02:42.230> since<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.709> last

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
automatically came out since the last

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.490 
automatically came out since the last
time<00:02:43.430> pro<00:02:43.700> was<00:02:43.850> on<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.300> I<00:02:44.630> just<00:02:44.900> shot<00:02:45.110> him<00:02:45.260> in

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
time pro was on and I just shot him in

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.690 
time pro was on and I just shot him in
the<00:02:45.530> feet<00:02:45.860> just<00:02:46.430> kill<00:02:46.670> them<00:02:46.790> outright<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:49.430> I

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
the feet just kill them outright and I

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.729 
the feet just kill them outright and I
think<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.660> main<00:02:50.810> reason<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:51.290> ended<00:02:51.440> up<00:02:51.590> going

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
think the main reason I ended up going

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.320 
think the main reason I ended up going
30<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.310> eight<00:02:52.430> was<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.820> fact<00:02:53.000> that<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.209> was

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
30 and eight was the fact that I was

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.810 
30 and eight was the fact that I was
just<00:02:53.480> looking<00:02:53.810> for<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:54.020> place<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.550> unleash<00:02:55.550> my

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
just looking for a place to unleash my

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.940 
just looking for a place to unleash my
chopper<00:02:56.239> gunner<00:02:56.510> my<00:02:56.720> dearie<00:02:56.959> but

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
chopper gunner my dearie but

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.890 
chopper gunner my dearie but
unfortunately<00:02:58.880> before<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.390> had<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.660> real

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
unfortunately before I had a real

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.810 
unfortunately before I had a real
opportunity<00:03:00.230> or<00:03:00.770> actually<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:01.370> should<00:03:01.610> say

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
opportunity or actually I should say

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.640 
opportunity or actually I should say
before<00:03:02.270> I<00:03:02.300> even<00:03:02.420> took<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.840> opportunity<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.470> do

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
before I even took the opportunity to do

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.720 
before I even took the opportunity to do
so<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:03.860> should<00:03:04.070> have<00:03:04.160> probably<00:03:04.250> done<00:03:04.459> right

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
so I should have probably done right

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.690 
so I should have probably done right
here<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:06.650> enemy<00:03:07.010> ended<00:03:07.280> up<00:03:07.370> getting<00:03:07.610> an
