00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.260
 for 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.260
 do not 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.660
 very good to all I'm a pussycat and here you are 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.720
 I bring another trick on the roofs of 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.720
 these rice with the sweeping steam and 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.150
 well here was with csi frÃ¡nkel and os 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.670
 I will leave your channels in the description and 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.290
 well I will go on to explain the trick 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.180
 simply a player has to 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.980
 knock down is worth someone who has steam 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.480
 overwhelming has to be knocked down like this 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.760
 looking at the player of these people and 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.430
 the player who is there in this case was 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.290
 I have to jump up and down and the other and 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.629
 pushing back until it hits 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.730
 on the wall I guess and have to place 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.190
 the steam supported in this way as 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.030
 you will see the steam rolled to the one you see 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.309
 another perspective 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.239
 to ebay as the steamrolling steam enters 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.360
 By the wall 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.010
 and it's placed right behind the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.869
 good window and the only thing we will have 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.759
 What is worth doing is that the player 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.220
 white so that all the changes go 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.080
 that's why they have to sign us for the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.140
 back of which is where the box comes out 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.970
 and jump as you see stays there in the middle 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.220
 I'd advise it to be the player of 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.430
 white for that reason it's worth it because 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.860
 money changers are always going to put and spend 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.659
 the others and good and simply we 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 we place on this asset of others 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.470
 players and they all pass all all the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.330
 names of us so we tell them that 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.670
 the stubborn pestosos and that we 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.369
 they come so I advise you to put 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.140
 a campaign and ahead and that's it 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.119
 you can run all the advantages and 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.310
 cowboy spots listings I hope that you 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.090
 have liked to comment favorites line and 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.090
 until next
