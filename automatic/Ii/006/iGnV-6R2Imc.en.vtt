00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 we got firewood today, October 15, 2013 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.360
 of the year 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:13.320
 and I want to answer the question which 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.920
 comes to my inbox from 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.060
 blog followers followers 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.410
 the question sounds so well this is how it should be 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.859
 every year put mulch 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:32.420
 a layer from 15 to 18 centimeters to hold 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:37.260
 and so she take a dear friend here business 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:45.980
 you know what to draw gave the country can 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:45.980
 hay and straw reworked during the year 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:57.449
 it is not processed for a year that is 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:02.820
 But if in the spring here the layer was just a little 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:07.140
 probably below the upper edge of the Karabakh here 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.970
 and look over the summer 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:16.920
 and the symbol is somewhere but think half 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:22.310
 here even let us be with you like this an hour to 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:26.900
 let's see how much soil you have somewhere 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:34.939
 probably a centimeter 4 mulch 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:36.780
 there is therefore to be imposed until 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:41.909
 top edge of the box 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.390
 absolutely not worth knowing why well 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.390
 because 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.890
 Nosachi year in this plot I will have 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.130
 grow or 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.189
 or pepper or tomato for potatoes until 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.950
 for potatoes it is desirable that mucho was 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.899
 even slightly above the top edge of the box for 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.679
 of vegetables 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:16.390
 such as peppers tomatoes cabbage especially 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:20.470
 such a high layer is not necessary you put 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.769
 the very beginning here are the bookmarks 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:29.440
 delenki you put on 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:33.260
 top and box and then 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.319
 just add the missing layer 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.799
 mulch 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:43.849
 do not put a lot well you decide 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:48.280
 what kind of vegetable will you have ? 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:56.739
 all a lot to the tray and now look 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:03:00.170
 Here I have this oat straw and the bale itself 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.210
 splits very so even gorgeous 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:09.500
 to 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:11.930
 Look, I take Yanus when I am 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.380
 about 5 centimeters but heâ€™s not 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:20.480
 homogeneous it's not like we are firewood before 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:23.510
 and it turns out one block 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.170
 slightly thicker and another slightly thicker 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.050
 thinner 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.050
 Well, that's all, and so we put 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.470
 even Vitka 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:39.830
 much he level is obtained if i 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.810
 I will release will be higher but this volume of course 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:47.240
 deceptive here snow all this pin down 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:53.060
 let's do even here so remove 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:57.340
 from here some layer is not taken but simply 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:02.600
 drag your for him and like that 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:09.100
 we will press that is, we will know the level 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:16.190
 mulch poppish here snow all this pin down 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:19.239
 thoroughly yes here's the old mulch here you are 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.100
 located somewhere saw 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:27.170
 Highly taken here so fluff and 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:32.590
 shifted here and now we will take 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.590
 he himself is not 4 centimeters but thinner 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:40.879
 there is of course and thinner 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:46.400
 1 photo cube put 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:50.810
 monologue here to shift that's all 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:54.419
 This is what I do not need every year. 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:58.759
 apply mulch very high but again 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.759
 see for what kind of vegetables 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:09.880
 vegetable growing you in this plot on 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:13.330
 Bucha here you see, I put on type 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.330
 stack here and brought here and here 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.590
 here we have a hole on the ground gathered th 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.140
 si in this hole in the queue of everything and 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.060
 now here is such thin layers 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:32.130
 thin 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:32.130
 who was selected relied still such a layer 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:43.470
 it's not even a layer over here between rows 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:51.240
 hugo put it quit still take 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:59.160
 become obsolete cut off from the hatch like that 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:06:02.160
 still laid here in this spirit in such 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
 cut 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:13.039
 mulching well rather 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:13.039
 add a new layer to torment on the old 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:25.350
 Fear not that you need it every year 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.910
 do you look at the situation if u 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.060
 you mulch 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:34.789
 It disappeared completely level that is seen 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:39.000
 soil yes here then you need a little bit so 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:40.410
 on a substantial layer put a 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.490
 you mulch everything 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:49.139
 don't recycle like that here in this wild 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:51.919
 just add a small layer all 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:54.919
 and you have to scotch and year in general will be 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:54.919
 sumptuously
