00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
off and put them in here because they're

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.790 
off and put them in here because they're
already<00:00:39.059> divided<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.989> then<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.559> take<00:00:40.770> my

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.029 
two months too much wax anyway that's
what<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.920> began<00:00:59.539> using<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.989> then<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.800> started

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
what I began using and then as I started

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.729 
what I began using and then as I started
using<00:01:02.250> smaller<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.910> smaller<00:01:03.239> canes<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:04.140> found

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
using smaller and smaller canes I found

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.830 
using smaller and smaller canes I found
it<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.070> inconvenient<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.970> wrap<00:01:06.270> each<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
it so inconvenient to wrap each of the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.870 
it so inconvenient to wrap each of the
little<00:01:07.049> tiny<00:01:07.229> kings<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.890> wax<00:01:08.189> paper<00:01:08.490> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
little tiny kings in the wax paper and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.880 
little tiny kings in the wax paper and
then<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:10.549> try<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.840> take<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.990> paper<00:01:13.170> off

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
then have to try to take the paper off

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.490 
then have to try to take the paper off
each<00:01:14.760> time<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.750> they<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.110> rewrap

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
each time and then they have to rewrap

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.249 
each time and then they have to rewrap
them<00:01:16.650> before<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.340> could<00:01:17.759> put<00:01:17.939> them<00:01:18.060> away<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:19.080> it

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
them before I could put them away so it

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.200 
them before I could put them away so it
made<00:01:19.500> me<00:01:20.960> hesitant<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.170> put<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:22.950> chains<00:01:23.939> back

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
made me hesitant to put my chains back

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.670 
made me hesitant to put my chains back
where<00:01:24.390> they<00:01:24.479> were<00:01:24.570> supposed<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.380> get

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
where they were supposed to be and get

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.190 
where they were supposed to be and get
everything<00:01:25.860> tidied<00:01:26.340> up<00:01:26.430> again<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:27.000> much<00:01:27.930> neater

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
everything tidied up again a much neater

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.880 
everything tidied up again a much neater
now<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:30.270> finally<00:01:30.840> figured<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
now I I finally figured out that the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.980 
now I I finally figured out that the
Canes<00:01:32.130> would<00:01:32.430> stick<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.090> plastic<00:01:33.420> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
Canes would stick to this plastic and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.980 
Canes would stick to this plastic and
this<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.670> not<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> hard<00:01:36.000> plastic<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
this is not the hard plastic it's the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.530 
this is not the hard plastic it's the
plastic<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.500> doesn't<00:01:37.880> let<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> Kings<00:01:39.210> weep

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
plastic that doesn't let the Kings weep

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.450 
plastic that doesn't let the Kings weep
and<00:01:42.110> destroy<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.320> plastic<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.009> destroy<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
and destroy the plastic and destroy the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.139 
and destroy the plastic and destroy the
Canes<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.350> see<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.970> you

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
Canes and as you can see if you if you

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.219 
Canes and as you can see if you if you
push<00:01:48.390> them<00:01:48.540> down<00:01:48.979> they<00:01:49.979> stay<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.750> I<00:01:51.750> was<00:01:51.990> so

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
push them down they stay and I was so

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.710 
push them down they stay and I was so
excited<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.799> find<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.820> these<00:01:54.540> are<00:01:54.659> the
