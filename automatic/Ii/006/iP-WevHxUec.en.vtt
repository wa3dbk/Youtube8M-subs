00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello everyone today, I'll tell you how to 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.859
 using one manipulation can 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.469
 get rid of the noise in the cabin like 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.490
 to fix the radio how to arrange 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.010
 more comfortable appliances and how to improve heat in 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.619
 cabin and all this with the help of one 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.680
 manipulations if you're interested put 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.090
 finger top and go and blame 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.880
 this is the previous panel held out 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.329
 six months the problem was in the mount but this 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.790
 we have excluded the problem by inserting 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.010
 back the metal plate that went 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.070
 from god on fixture 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.260
 and walked to us but she endured but not 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.750
 weathered the part under the radio 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.690
 she cracked and the body magnetron fall out 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.320
 in general, this is not an option at all and I will tell you 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.170
 I advise the brothers in each radio 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.059
 there is such a frame that it is inserted 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.920
 and there it holds everything can be poured 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.969
 insert aromka remains here this wound 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.589
 we flew right under the panel if you 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.890
 there were some problems that you we 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.060
 tamponade filed or something like this 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.280
 decides everything immediately in the second stopped 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.680
 clutter up the stove and heat from the stove 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.869
 goes immediately to the salon it is so 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.180
 increased the heat in the car especially when 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.939
 it is very cold when it is cold and remains 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.340
 the problem is where to put the devices that is 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.340
 where to put a watch cigarette lighter and a pair 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.430
 tumblers is not a problem clock 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.829
 is on such removable panels and its 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.020
 can be placed anywhere we are here 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.430
 problems solved by the fact that we placed it 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.280
 under bordachok 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.770
 on the shelf there were two empty places for 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.619
 toggle switches and we inserted a toggle switch in there 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.100
 heated rear window and toggle switch 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.380
 the inclusion of headlights that is all and 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.439
 does not interfere but at the same time at hand 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.140
 You can pull out and more importantly, what 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.479
 it became a lot more space all that was 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.810
 in this disturbing panel we have placed 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.880
 the radio tape recorder is attached just on 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.680
 I can ride it 100 percent 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.830
 it seems she will not fall off our 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.760
 mini panel is also located nearby and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.459
 does not interfere but everything else is not needed 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.310
 try to do this in your car 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.099
 I guarantee you you will not regret if 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.260
