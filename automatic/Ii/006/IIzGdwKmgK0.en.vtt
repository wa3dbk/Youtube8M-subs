00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
what we are looking at here it's the EPC

10-15<00:00:24.330> m<00:00:24.800> action<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> first<00:00:26.220> challenge<00:00:26.490> epc

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
10-15 m action the first challenge epc

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.320 
10-15 m action the first challenge epc
it<00:00:27.810> comes<00:00:28.470> with<00:00:28.680> an<00:00:28.800> intel<00:00:29.039> atom<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.490> 450<00:00:30.090> and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
it comes with an intel atom and 450 and

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.810 
it comes with an intel atom and 450 and
the<00:00:31.080> second<00:00:31.560> generation<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:32.160> nvidia<00:00:32.460> ion

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the second generation of nvidia ion

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.790 
the second generation of nvidia ion
chipset<00:00:33.149> actually<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> sheep<00:00:34.320> new<00:00:34.559> right

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
chipset actually is a sheep new right

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.389 
chipset actually is a sheep new right
now<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.989> this<00:00:36.989> comes<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.649> Optimus

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
now and this comes with Optimus

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.170 
now and this comes with Optimus
technology<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:40.070> that's<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.250> first<00:00:41.489> 10<00:00:41.879> inch

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
technology so that's the first 10 inch

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.750 
technology so that's the first 10 inch
netbook<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.960> Optimus<00:00:43.739> technology<00:00:44.280> we've

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
netbook with Optimus technology we've

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.260 
netbook with Optimus technology we've
already<00:00:44.940> seen<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.899> acer<00:00:46.410> aspire<00:00:46.500> 1<00:00:47.039> 5<00:00:47.370> 32<00:00:47.879> g

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
already seen the acer aspire 1 5 32 g

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.389 
already seen the acer aspire 1 5 32 g
which<00:00:49.110> comes<00:00:49.440> also<00:00:49.649> with<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.070> second

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
which comes also with the second

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.700 
which comes also with the second
generation<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.539> nvidia<00:00:51.870> ion<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:52.590> it

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
generation of the nvidia ion but it

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.830 
generation of the nvidia ion but it
doesn't<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.070> any<00:00:53.340> Optimus<00:00:54.210> technology<00:00:54.690> in

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
doesn't have any Optimus technology in

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.680 
doesn't have any Optimus technology in
there<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.680> ebc<00:00:56.219> 1050<00:00:56.910> am<00:00:57.059> definitely

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
there so this ebc 1050 am definitely

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.420 
there so this ebc 1050 am definitely
supports<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.350> let's<00:00:58.859> take<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.070> quick<00:00:59.399> look

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
supports this let's take a quick look

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.270 
supports this let's take a quick look
around<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.059> system<00:01:00.300> even<00:01:00.719> though<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
around the system even though this the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.950 
around the system even though this the
scans<00:01:02.579> akita<00:01:03.030> was<00:01:03.180> kind<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.449> bothering<00:01:03.629> me

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
scans akita was kind of bothering me

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.649 
scans akita was kind of bothering me

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
quick look around the system it looks to

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.370 
quick look around the system it looks to
me<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.909> six<00:01:30.210> cell<00:01:30.390> battery<00:01:30.420> I'm

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
