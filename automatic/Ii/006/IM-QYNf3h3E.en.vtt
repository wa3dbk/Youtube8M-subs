been working on no one to build a little
micro<00:00:07.500> batwing<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:09.559> got<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.710> thrust-vectoring

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
micro batwing I got the thrust-vectoring

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:23.300 
micro batwing I got the thrust-vectoring
on<00:00:11.490> there

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.560 

I'm<00:00:24.310> going<00:00:24.460> to<00:00:24.520> show<00:00:24.640> you<00:00:24.700> I<00:00:24.820> can<00:00:25.119> fly<00:00:25.300> this

I'm going to show you I can fly this

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.700 
I'm going to show you I can fly this
without<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:25.990> tails<00:00:26.230> on<00:00:26.590> it<00:00:28.410> no<00:00:29.410> vertical

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
without the tails on it no vertical

00:00:29.710 --> 00:03:47.960 
without the tails on it no vertical
stabs<00:00:30.250> anywhere

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.250 

so<00:03:48.970> as<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.210> can<00:03:49.330> see<00:03:49.510> it's<00:03:49.690> another<00:03:49.870> one<00:03:50.110> that

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
so as you can see it's another one that

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.300 
so as you can see it's another one that
flies<00:03:50.440> tailless<00:03:52.890> I'm<00:03:53.890> going<00:03:54.070> to<00:03:54.130> end<00:03:54.250> up

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
flies tailless I'm going to end up

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.950 
flies tailless I'm going to end up
putting<00:03:54.490> tails<00:03:54.850> on<00:03:55.150> it<00:03:55.300> though<00:03:55.450> I<00:03:55.480> want<00:03:55.810> my

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
putting tails on it though I want my

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.230 
putting tails on it though I want my
stabilizer<00:03:56.500> fins<00:03:56.890> I'm<00:03:57.580> going<00:03:57.790> to<00:03:57.850> still<00:03:58.060> put<00:03:58.210> a

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
stabilizer fins I'm going to still put a

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:06.240 
stabilizer fins I'm going to still put a
canopy<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.130> fuselage<00:04:00.130> here<00:04:05.130> just<00:04:06.130> thought

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
canopy and fuselage here just thought

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.230 
canopy and fuselage here just thought
I'd<00:04:06.400> show<00:04:06.610> you<00:04:06.670> how<00:04:06.850> that<00:04:06.910> thrust<00:04:07.330> vector

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
I'd show you how that thrust vector

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:26.340 
I'd show you how that thrust vector
eliminates<00:04:10.240> any<00:04:10.420> tail<00:04:24.840> one<00:04:25.840> cool<00:04:26.140> little

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
eliminates any tail one cool little

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:37.770 
eliminates any tail one cool little
batwing<00:04:35.970> alright<00:04:36.970> I'll<00:04:37.180> get<00:04:37.330> back<00:04:37.540> to<00:04:37.720> this

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
batwing alright I'll get back to this

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.450 
batwing alright I'll get back to this
with<00:04:37.990> some<00:04:38.170> more<00:04:38.320> videos<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:38.860> more<00:04:38.950> builds

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
with some more videos and more builds

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.450 
with some more videos and more builds
over<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:40.360> out
