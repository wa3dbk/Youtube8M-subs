00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.200
 that very well, well, I come to 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.450
 record a hall of example of make up 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.910
 already in principle it had to be a boxing 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.670
 but I needed the products that had 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.000
 I could not get to record and well 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.540
 that does not happen at all some products are 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.450
 I've tried them and tell them that the reason 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.689
 The main purpose of the request was to test the 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.360
 dry batiste shampoo I've been pretty 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.570
 good time hormonal changes 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.850
 things that the time is changing the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.080
 changes seasons I get lubricated a 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.660
 little more hair than what 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.560
 I usually greased myself and space 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.010
 the washings in 23 days but the 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.080
 truth is that I noticed a little 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.790
 roots a little bit more fat and I was 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.329
 happened after seeing many many 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.929
 videos 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.560
 throw me throw myself and try it and that's what 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:03.570
 fact 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.570
 the one that I took is the original 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.590
 original if you do not have anything else and 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.950
 tell you that you already know 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:19.030
 the impression has been a little weird because 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.500
 my hair is like very soft and once I've 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.590
 So I got rubbed and applied 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.479
 comb my hair is very clean is 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.030
 One pass is very clean but 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.860
 it remains with a texture a bit good 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.200
 maybe that many people are textured 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.810
 use it to give volume and so that 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.969
 fine hair are more mouldable yes more 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.560
 manageable that are better and 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:45.710
 really yes I 've noticed that it gives a 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.570
 texture that I find a bit 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.020
 annoying because I like the softness 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.090
 of the hair and I do not like him 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.850
 the feeling of hair lacquer not me 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.460
 like a feeling of weird things in the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.409
 hair have always bothered me dominas 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.119
 things and then the fact that 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.329
 this provides a bit of texture 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.750
 I do not know, I'm going to have to get used to it 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.039
 because I'll have to finish it but it's something 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.610
 Well, it has caught my attention 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.220
 the smell is very good and the price also 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.650
 it's very good 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:26.600
 375 cost me the shampoo dry and good 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.380
 I already tell you a one use I have also given 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 I took advantage and I launched with the brand 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.810
 travel I do not know what it's called if you have another 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.300
 name but good here talk ja me 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.990
 I launched with normal hair shampoo 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.270
 because I do not like it for allison and 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.160
 for curly neither for fat nor for dandruff 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.930
 considered that if you take or not for fat 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.660
 thermally so if you take one for folders 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.100
 of fat in order always the more 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:58.100
 neutral the less things the shampoo does 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.750
 in itself for me better I'm going for the 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.060
 nutrition with the good mask the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.230
 conditioner or with the oils that I 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.370
 I have to put those first cuÃ©llar 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.530
 for the normal shampoo that is the fig and 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.380
 I picked it up because I looked and commented that good 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.750
 that he liked that he was doing well and what 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.490
 used also a couple of times the smell is 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.080
 impressive also what lasts a 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:26.010
 little bit takes 500 milliliters to see in 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:30.239
 comparison with shampoos 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.790
 a scary guy does not type the 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.629
 typical brands yes that is a little bit more 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.730
 expensive because it costs 350 finally for 500 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.220
 milliliters and the smell very well leaves the 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.980
 hair also very clean leather 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.909
 scalp is also very clean 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.110
 normally what remains clean is the 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.629
 leather that has come at the tips is 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.519
 as they are always more or less they are 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.180
 more or less smooth that's an opinion 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.099
 personal 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.560
 What I have noticed is that 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:00.069
 It leaves the clean hair clean because 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.319
 when you pass the hand chirping is like 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.940
 a clean one of those that really cleans 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.430
 background and the truth is that 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.860
 very well a more enjoyable number 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.650
 I like the last little thing here 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.810
 Cojedes travels also if he has another 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.720
 pronounce this year tell me is a 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.780
 eye contour I took is the olive the 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.770
 natural or live aid cream who 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.639
 it seemed super cheap it cost 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.849
 two euros 90 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.680
 and there are 15 milliliters more or less 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.200
 Outlines usually bring those amounts 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.260
 much more 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.100
 and I thought I was good at it, I triumphed and 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.570
 If I was not doing well, I'm not very 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.420
 fond of putting on my eyes 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.850
 is that it is amateur or not is that I am 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.890
 very bad I have very little consistency with 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.910
 according to what products and the outline of 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:56.810
 eyes is one of those who keep quiet 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.760
 that is to say that it has to end so I 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.290
 I have put all the moisturizers all 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.970
 the things that cost me in the dining room 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.440
 in front of a box so that each time 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.350
 that I feel in homes do not have 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.980
 language you have to put 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:13.160
 a pretty light outline 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.230
 it's not very dense 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.780
 it spreads very well it is absorbed very 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.450
 Quick 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.400
 and what do you want me to tell you is that by 292 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.170
 I test if I do not like it because I do not like it 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.850
 I will finish because surely something of 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.639
 hydration gives me less to make me a 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.740
 rare reaction I will not stop using it and not 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.910
 is to buy an eye contour that 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.120
 besides the contours of eyes 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.970
 they are usually quite expensive 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.220
 and finally I had this sample of 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:43.080
 earth too 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.080
 for newborns 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.960
 no makeup gentlemen i do not like or 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.950
 indirect but not good is not a cream 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.650
 nothing else has to be enough 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.600
 nutritious 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.830
 I would like to continue in positions that 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.590
 paint 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.940
 it is not very good as it is always kind 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.890
 of makeup is impressive your skin is 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.740
 day to day so you have it at home 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.520
 once you have the mail from the agency 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.009
 transportation 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.150
 what is it to have a moment I'm telling you 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:16.970
 the transport agency 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.860
 it was chronoexprÃ©s and I already tell you once 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.389
 the mail arrived, right away 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.610
 often the next day he asked me 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:27.719
 at home very well I like these 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.669
 online stores where you do not have to 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:31.919
 be too aware of hans if not 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.389
 comes eyes that has not come, this is not 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.669
 they send you the mail the next day they 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.940
 present at home at least three o'clock 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.190
 four times that I have asked 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.410
 let's cross our fingers and these things always 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.570
 you can change I hope you have 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.210
 liked the makeup hall so far 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.600
 already from the last order I have made and we 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.600
 see you soon
