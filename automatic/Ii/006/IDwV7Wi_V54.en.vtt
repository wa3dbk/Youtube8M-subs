00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.150 
any kind of backs and then you can get
some<00:03:01.930> wood<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.500> can<00:03:02.680> get<00:03:02.830> some<00:03:02.980> wood

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
some wood and you can get some wood

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.490 
some wood and you can get some wood
quickly<00:03:03.670> if<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.209> find<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.570> jungle<00:03:05.080> if<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.260> find

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
quickly if you find a jungle if you find

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.610 
quickly if you find a jungle if you find
a<00:03:05.620> major<00:03:05.890> big<00:03:06.520> tree<00:03:06.910> like<00:03:07.120> this<00:03:07.200> I'll<00:03:08.200> show<00:03:08.530> you

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
a major big tree like this I'll show you

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.370 
a major big tree like this I'll show you
what<00:03:08.830> it<00:03:08.920> can<00:03:08.950> do<00:03:09.959> this<00:03:10.959> is<00:03:11.140> pretty<00:03:11.350> cool<00:03:11.440> oh<00:03:13.380> it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
what it can do this is pretty cool oh it

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.610 
what it can do this is pretty cool oh it
basically<00:03:15.040> rains<00:03:15.489> locks<00:03:16.020> so<00:03:17.020> you<00:03:17.050> could<00:03:17.380> take

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
basically rains locks so you could take

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.789 
basically rains locks so you could take
out<00:03:17.830> you<00:03:18.549> could<00:03:18.730> get<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.090> lot<00:03:19.480> of<00:03:19.510> wood<00:03:19.900> very

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
out you could get a lot of wood very

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.640 
out you could get a lot of wood very
very<00:03:21.400> quickly<00:03:21.850> in<00:03:22.209> my<00:03:22.720> opinion<00:03:23.140> this<00:03:23.440> is<00:03:23.500> a

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
very quickly in my opinion this is a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.009 
very quickly in my opinion this is a
very<00:03:23.980> cool<00:03:24.280> mod<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:24.910> I<00:03:25.390> like<00:03:25.600> how<00:03:25.750> with<00:03:25.900> the

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
very cool mod and I like how with the

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.960 
very cool mod and I like how with the
jungle<00:03:26.380> trees<00:03:26.620> even<00:03:26.830> though<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.580> trunk

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
jungle trees even though the the trunk

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.840 
jungle trees even though the the trunk
is<00:03:28.209> for<00:03:28.690> or<00:03:28.959> two<00:03:29.320> by<00:03:29.500> two<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:30.370> it's<00:03:30.580> still

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
is for or two by two that it's still

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.630 
is for or two by two that it's still
just<00:03:31.209> by<00:03:31.390> mining<00:03:31.930> out<00:03:32.080> or<00:03:32.709> axing<00:03:33.160> out<00:03:33.310> one

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
just by mining out or axing out one

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.900 
just by mining out or axing out one
block<00:03:34.030> that<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.750> takes<00:03:34.930> out<00:03:35.170> all<00:03:35.380> for<00:03:35.980> all<00:03:36.549> four

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
block that it takes out all for all four

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.699 
block that it takes out all for all four
single<00:03:37.450> stumps<00:03:37.810> I<00:03:37.900> guess<00:03:38.049> you<00:03:38.170> could<00:03:38.200> say<00:03:38.470> and
