00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:08.460
 now I want to offer you dinner 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:11.969
 which I will do myself from the fact that 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.540
 there are residues shorter than products that 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.310
 need to do so i will do it 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.020
 I have a stump left 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.779
 Of course throw but I look here 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.779
 leaves suitable for use so I 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.210
 fry them in a pan 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.369
 left tomato frozen pepper 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.349
 frozen home threw everything out 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.600
 freezers in the sink under the hot stream 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.239
 water literally two or three minutes 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.420
 unfrozen so I shuffled a look 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.570
 just onion was sliced ​​floor 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.030
 tips so now I'm all 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.059
 the pan is heated with vegetable 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.039
 butter now I will throw these 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.520
 Ingredients 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:57.270
 so first for put onions not 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.520
 necessarily in the same order as I do 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:06.150
 just it turns out such a vinaigrette 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.070
 so all the tomatoes together cut it 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.650
 homemade frozen tomatoes 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.479
 store pepper is also homemade it 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.340
 you cut it straight smell like you're 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.950
 ripped off the beds despite the fact that 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.560
 frozen such effect and smell from 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.810
 store Put and no not at all 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.670
 will achieve 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.030
 so I do not buy pepper on Bulgarian 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.159
 although it tastes delicious new store on 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.140
 I don’t like the view from lunch too 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.659
 pickled cucumbers left 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.030
 so that they do not lie like they already ate 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.220
 I will add them there as well 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.229
 I will be here this mass stew 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.970
 literally five to seven minutes maybe 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:55.229
 less I'll shred the cabbage stir 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:00.380
 straight knife on slow fire just 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.380
 so that it becomes so soft and dried 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.640
 now the cabbage just these leaves are not 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.280
 just cut into straws 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.410
 he so she was thin and 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.510
 fast fast 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:17.190
 fry the current through the stalk throw out 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.940
 so I cut the cabbage here 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.560
 stump everything will have to throw away 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.959
 so now let the action stew 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:31.860
 a little so dissect add here 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:34.950
 whole cabbage because everything is fast fast 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.080
 quickly need to do now here as a 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.930
 always favorite black pepper without it 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.200
 I don’t get along with every dish I tolerate 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:48.239
 because while you can not 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.000
 do so salt of course and more 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.730
 do not want anything seasoning nothing 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.050
 because here and cucumber and Bulgarian 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:02.010
 pepper and tomato everything will be enough here 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:05.610
 tasty effectively and also carcass minutes 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.860
 probably like cabbage me up all seven minutes 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:13.380
 steam 10 just a minute if it seems a little 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.829
 that you can be a little dry 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.860
 add some water to cabbage 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:23.340
 when tushilos and became soft then I 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.530
 Karaganda nasal testicles like my datasheets 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.250
 I'm looking for the kitchen's brands put out my 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.120
 minutes 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:34.980
 they literally open my knives 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:39.600
 added a little water to it 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:43.340
 now take 4 egg can be 3 how many 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.450
 want again crashing not 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.319
 mix 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.030
 what's just an egg shell I'm not 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.580

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.120
 plant i sweat 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:58.790
 I collect enough of them and 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.810
 good and how fertilizer goes floral 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:07.280
 pots of zemelku pouring 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:09.470
 also such a tip by the way so now I 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.319
 I will not salt because I have 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:16.250
 I tasted quite salty 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.350
 if you want you can directly stir 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:24.440

 cover and even 710 minutes, too, well, see 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.360
 just by the color of the egg he starts the protein 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.380
 turns white see how to turn off 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:55.419
 all simmer on low heat 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:58.970

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:10.610
 possible so cool cut and straight 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:15.460
 in a plate like this and it will turn out very 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:19.370
