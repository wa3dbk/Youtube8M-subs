a<00:03:11.330> mixture<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:12.020> if<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.070> add<00:03:13.280> those<00:03:13.490> up<00:03:13.550> by

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
a mixture and if you add those up by

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.990 
a mixture and if you add those up by
coins<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.480> pro<00:03:14.690> pack<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.110> 7,500<00:03:16.010> coins<00:03:16.250> the

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
coins the pro pack is 7,500 coins the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.710 
coins the pro pack is 7,500 coins the
veteran<00:03:17.390> pack<00:03:17.600> is<00:03:18.520> 17,500<00:03:19.520> so<00:03:20.120> in<00:03:20.300> a<00:03:20.420> way<00:03:20.660> you

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
veteran pack is 17,500 so in a way you

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.480 
veteran pack is 17,500 so in a way you
would<00:03:21.020> come<00:03:21.230> out<00:03:21.380> cheaper<00:03:21.800> just<00:03:21.950> buying<00:03:22.310> two

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
would come out cheaper just buying two

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.520 
would come out cheaper just buying two
pro<00:03:22.760> packs<00:03:23.060> better<00:03:23.780> than<00:03:24.050> buying<00:03:24.290> that

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
pro packs better than buying that

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.440 
pro packs better than buying that
veteran<00:03:24.950> pack<00:03:25.220> but<00:03:25.670> at<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.910> same<00:03:26.090> time<00:03:26.300> you

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
veteran pack but at the same time you

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.180 
veteran pack but at the same time you
got<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:26.690> wonder<00:03:26.840> how<00:03:27.080> those<00:03:27.290> odds<00:03:27.620> are<00:03:27.920> in<00:03:28.070> the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190
