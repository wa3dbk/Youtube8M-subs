00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
as compact as some headphones I've seen

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
as compact as some headphones I've seen
but<00:00:51.899> they<00:00:52.469> fit<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.770> my<00:00:52.860> pocket<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.460> that's<00:00:53.670> what

but they fit in my pocket so that's what
comes<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:56.789> what<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.510> pair<00:00:57.780> has<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.579> audio

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
comes and so what this pair has is audio

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.510 
comes and so what this pair has is audio
isolation<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:00.870> got<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.170> little

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
isolation so it's got this little

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.820 
isolation so it's got this little
microphone<00:01:02.520> somewhere<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.300> there<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.690> I

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
microphone somewhere in there that I

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.500 
microphone somewhere in there that I
when<00:01:04.830> you're<00:01:04.949> listening<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.460> music<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.000> puts

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
when you're listening to music it puts

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.679 
when you're listening to music it puts
out<00:01:06.950> sound<00:01:07.950> waves<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.460> are<00:01:08.670> opposite<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
out sound waves that are opposite to the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.100 
out sound waves that are opposite to the
ambience<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.409> your<00:01:11.250> surroundings<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.750> that

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
ambience of your surroundings so that

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.200 
ambience of your surroundings so that
not<00:01:13.260> only<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.740> sound<00:01:14.549> does<00:01:14.820> not<00:01:15.000> really

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
not only can sound does not really

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.030 
not only can sound does not really
filter<00:01:15.630> into<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.049> headphone<00:01:16.229> but<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.920> also

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
filter into the headphone but you also

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.080 
filter into the headphone but you also
just<00:01:17.540> all<00:01:18.830> extra<00:01:19.830> noise<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.460> guess<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.060> uh

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
just all extra noise I guess that uh

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.810 
just all extra noise I guess that uh
that<00:01:21.509> comes<00:01:21.960> through<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.500> canceled<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.040> so

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
that comes through is canceled out so

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.109 
that comes through is canceled out so
when<00:01:24.630> I'm<00:01:24.750> listening<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.229> these<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.860> can't<00:01:26.850> hear

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
when I'm listening to these I can't hear

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.880 
when I'm listening to these I can't hear

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
there or right there so you can have the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.650 
there or right there so you can have the
cord<00:02:39.200> on<00:02:39.410> either<00:02:39.710> side<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.310> headphone

is<00:04:26.650> that<00:04:26.980> the<00:04:27.960> remote<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.530> buttons<00:04:29.860> aren't

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
is that the remote the buttons aren't

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.610 
is that the remote the buttons aren't
super<00:04:30.550> sensitive<00:04:30.910> so<00:04:31.480> I<00:04:31.780> takes<00:04:32.350> a<00:04:32.470> little

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
super sensitive so I takes a little

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.379 
super sensitive so I takes a little
extra<00:04:33.070> pressure<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.180> wouldn't<00:04:34.330> expect

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
extra pressure that you wouldn't expect

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.150 
extra pressure that you wouldn't expect
to<00:04:34.750> need<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:35.710> UM<00:04:36.010> to<00:04:37.050> push<00:04:38.050> each<00:04:38.230> button<00:04:38.590> so

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
to need to UM to push each button so

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.470 
to need to UM to push each button so
that<00:04:39.190> can<00:04:39.430> be<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.550> little<00:04:39.730> annoying<00:04:40.030> but<00:04:40.330> that's

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
that can be a little annoying but that's

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.510 
that can be a little annoying but that's
not<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.690> huge<00:04:40.960> deal<00:04:41.139> and<00:04:41.280> compared<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:42.370> all<00:04:42.490> the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
not a huge deal and compared to all the

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.180 
not a huge deal and compared to all the
things<00:04:42.790> that<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.060> headphones<00:04:43.419> can<00:04:43.780> do<00:04:44.190> it's

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
things that the headphones can do it's

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.270 
things that the headphones can do it's
nothing<00:04:45.550> so<00:04:46.740> they're<00:04:47.740> also<00:04:47.889> a<00:04:48.040> little

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
nothing so they're also a little

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.520 
nothing so they're also a little
expensive<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.360> little<00:04:49.450> hard<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:49.840> get<00:04:50.020> but

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
expensive and a little hard to get but

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.430 
expensive and a little hard to get but
despite<00:04:51.460> that<00:04:51.520> I<00:04:51.880> really<00:04:52.480> recommend<00:04:52.720> that

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
despite that I really recommend that

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.620 
despite that I really recommend that
everyone<00:04:54.310> that<00:04:54.610> can<00:04:54.850> look<00:04:55.270> into<00:04:55.540> getting

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
everyone that can look into getting

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:03.000 
everyone that can look into getting
these<00:04:55.900> because<00:04:56.860> they're<00:04:57.610> amazing<00:04:59.850> Kirk<00:05:00.850> out
