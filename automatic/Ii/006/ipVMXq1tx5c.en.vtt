down and come up why do we have a need

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.269 
down and come up why do we have a need
for<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.630> p-trap<00:00:28.019> well<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.800> purpose<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.220> a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
for a p-trap well the purpose of a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.749 
for a p-trap well the purpose of a
p-trap<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:30.590> when<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> water<00:00:31.920> comes<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.369> here

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
p-trap is when the water comes in here

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.810 
p-trap is when the water comes in here
of<00:00:33.180> course<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.600> goes<00:00:33.719> out<00:00:33.899> here<00:00:34.190> but<00:00:35.190> when<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
of course it goes out here but when the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.229 
of course it goes out here but when the
water<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.210> done<00:00:36.420> running<00:00:36.710> you<00:00:37.710> still<00:00:37.950> have

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
water is done running you still have

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.260 
water is done running you still have
amount<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.450> water<00:00:39.750> that's<00:00:39.930> trapped<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.920> here

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
amount of water that's trapped in here

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.610 
amount of water that's trapped in here
that's<00:00:42.270> why<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:42.600> called<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.840> p-trap<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.350> traps

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
that's why it's called a p-trap it traps

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.240 
that's why it's called a p-trap it traps
the<00:00:43.829> water<00:00:44.629> okay<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> water<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.950> trapped

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the water okay so the water is trapped

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.100 
the water okay so the water is trapped
in<00:00:47.430> here<00:00:47.610> why<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.239> water<00:00:48.539> trapped<00:00:48.930> in

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
in here why is that water trapped in

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.819 
in here why is that water trapped in
here<00:00:49.399> so<00:00:50.399> let<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> sewer<00:00:50.969> gases<00:00:51.500> they<00:00:52.500> go<00:00:52.649> out

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
here so let the sewer gases they go out

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.470 
here so let the sewer gases they go out
to<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.070> end<00:00:53.520> won't<00:00:54.510> come<00:00:54.870> back<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.480> come

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
to this end won't come back in and come

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.779 
to this end won't come back in and come
up<00:00:57.690> through<00:00:58.050> here<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.590> come<00:00:59.399> out<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.670> your
