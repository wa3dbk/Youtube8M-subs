00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
is as I've used it I've realized it's

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.140 
is as I've used it I've realized it's
more<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.449> medium<00:00:25.199> heavy<00:00:25.730> rather<00:00:26.730> than<00:00:26.910> just

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
more of a medium heavy rather than just

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.060 
more of a medium heavy rather than just
a<00:00:27.269> straight-up<00:00:27.539> medium<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.230> let's<00:00:28.769> get<00:00:28.890> into

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
a straight-up medium and let's get into

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.880 
a straight-up medium and let's get into
it<00:00:29.510> so<00:00:30.510> as<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.840> can<00:00:30.929> see<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.650> white

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
it so as you can see it is this white

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.410 
it so as you can see it is this white
color<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.460> let<00:00:33.390> me<00:00:33.450> show<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.660> how<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.870> scoops

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
color and let me show you how to scoops

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.760 
color and let me show you how to scoops
you've<00:00:36.420> got<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.809> add<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> bit<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.230> pressure<00:00:37.530> to

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you've got to add a bit of pressure to

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.619 
you've got to add a bit of pressure to
it<00:00:37.920> which<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.480> was<00:00:39.480> not<00:00:39.629> really<00:00:41.120> expecting<00:00:42.120> not

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
it which I was not really expecting not

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.220 
it which I was not really expecting not
really<00:00:43.340> who<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.460> hoping<00:00:44.820> for<00:00:44.930> because<00:00:45.930> this

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
really who was hoping for because this

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.940 
really who was hoping for because this
is<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> medium<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.460> goes<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.879> hands

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
is the medium and it goes in the hands

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.889 
is the medium and it goes in the hands
quite<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.010> bit<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.280> clumpiness<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.780> do

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
quite a bit of clumpiness and you do

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.130 
quite a bit of clumpiness and you do
have<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.140> add<00:00:52.260> quite<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.559> bit<00:00:52.770> pressure<00:00:54.140> which

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
have to add quite a bit pressure which

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.020 
have to add quite a bit pressure which
was<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.710> me<00:00:55.829> tad<00:00:56.820> bit<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.270> letdown<00:00:58.850> because<00:00:59.850> I

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
was to me tad bit of a letdown because I

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.209 
was to me tad bit of a letdown because I
was<00:01:00.270> expecting<00:01:00.809> more<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.140> balanced<00:01:01.620> medium

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
was expecting more of a balanced medium

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.200 
was expecting more of a balanced medium
product<00:01:02.670> not<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:03.899> medium<00:01:04.260> heavy<00:01:04.439> and

way<00:02:08.030> that<00:02:08.239> you're<00:02:08.360> rubbing<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:08.720> in<00:02:08.810> your<00:02:08.869> hands

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
way that you're rubbing it in your hands

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.930 
way that you're rubbing it in your hands
it<00:02:09.440> has<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:10.660> stickiness<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:11.989> wax<00:02:12.980> enos<00:02:13.400> of

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
it has the stickiness and wax enos of

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.440 
it has the stickiness and wax enos of
something<00:02:14.360> like<00:02:14.480> voodoo<00:02:14.750> brew<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.209> kind

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
something like voodoo brew so that kind

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.740 
something like voodoo brew so that kind
of<00:02:17.599> attention<00:02:18.190> but<00:02:19.190> only<00:02:19.610> holds<00:02:20.120> like<00:02:20.720> a

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
of attention but only holds like a

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.270 
of attention but only holds like a
medium<00:02:22.270> so<00:02:23.270> in<00:02:23.450> my<00:02:23.630> opinion<00:02:23.800> not<00:02:24.800> really<00:02:25.100> worth

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
medium so in my opinion not really worth

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.430 
medium so in my opinion not really worth
it

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
it

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.930

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
a lot a lot of tension it really kind of

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.270 
a lot a lot of tension it really kind of
hurts<00:02:35.209> more<00:02:35.540> like<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.860> more<00:02:36.860> like<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:37.010> heavy

the shine is decent it has a kind of a

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.220 
the shine is decent it has a kind of a
medium<00:02:45.410> coming<00:02:46.600> not<00:02:47.600> really<00:02:47.840> anything<00:02:48.019> crazy

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
but yeah I get quite a bit of tension

when<00:02:52.760> pulling<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.180> back<00:02:53.950> I'm<00:02:54.950> going<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.340> part

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
when pulling it back I'm going to part

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:05.380 
when pulling it back I'm going to part
my<00:02:55.700> hair<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:04.610> as<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.880> can<00:03:05.000> see<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.239> don't

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
my hair and as you can see I don't

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.259 
my hair and as you can see I don't
really<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:06.080> get<00:03:07.239> handful<00:03:08.239> of<00:03:08.390> strays<00:03:08.750> going<00:03:09.200> on

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
really I get handful of strays going on

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.470 
really I get handful of strays going on
so<00:03:11.269> not<00:03:11.480> really<00:03:11.510> that<00:03:13.000> it's<00:03:14.000> kind<00:03:14.209> of<00:03:14.239> weird

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
so not really that it's kind of weird

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.900 
so not really that it's kind of weird
because<00:03:14.570> it<00:03:14.750> feels<00:03:14.959> so<00:03:15.140> sticky<00:03:15.769> but<00:03:16.670> in<00:03:16.790> the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
because it feels so sticky but in the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.620 
because it feels so sticky but in the
hair<00:03:17.180> it's<00:03:17.510> really<00:03:17.840> dry<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:19.480> doesn't<00:03:20.480> really

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
hair it's really dry and doesn't really

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.870 
hair it's really dry and doesn't really
stick<00:03:20.959> together<00:03:21.170> that<00:03:21.680> well<00:03:21.950> with<00:03:22.549> some<00:03:22.820> of

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
stick together that well with some of

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.380 
stick together that well with some of
the<00:03:22.970> shorter<00:03:23.329> hairs<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:25.670> definitely<00:03:26.090> kind<00:03:26.329> of

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
the shorter hairs so definitely kind of

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.229 
the shorter hairs so definitely kind of
weird<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:30.680> I'm<00:03:30.920> going<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.220> get<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.609> forming<00:03:32.120> my

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
weird so I'm going to get to forming my

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.030 
weird so I'm going to get to forming my
pompadour<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:35.560> probably<00:03:36.560> I'll<00:03:36.650> just<00:03:36.859> call

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
pompadour and probably I'll just call

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.120 
pompadour and probably I'll just call
this<00:03:37.220> one<00:03:37.459> early<00:03:37.790> because<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.859> don't<00:03:39.859> think<00:03:40.040> I'm

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
this one early because I don't think I'm

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.190 
this one early because I don't think I'm
getting<00:03:40.250> my<00:03:40.489> hair<00:03:40.790> looking<00:03:41.090> too<00:03:41.239> great<00:03:41.420> so

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.650 

I'll<00:03:45.200> just<00:03:45.730> do<00:03:46.730> some<00:03:46.910> little<00:03:46.940> tweaks<00:03:47.510> here<00:03:49.660> and

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660

I'll just do some little tweaks here and
I<00:03:50.900> guess<00:03:51.310> my<00:03:52.310> hair<00:03:52.459> doesn't<00:03:52.760> like<00:03:52.850> yeah<00:03:53.480> like

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
really good at all but I'll just call it

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.479 
really good at all but I'll just call it

they're<00:04:44.690> better<00:04:45.410> medium<00:04:45.890> heavy<00:04:46.040> pomades<00:04:46.520> and

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
they're better medium heavy pomades and

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.960 
they're better medium heavy pomades and
this<00:04:46.850> stuff<00:04:47.090> is<00:04:47.270> just<00:04:48.160> not<00:04:49.160> my<00:04:49.400> kind<00:04:49.610> of<00:04:49.790> pomade

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
this stuff is just not my kind of pomade

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.760 
this stuff is just not my kind of pomade
and<00:04:50.390> doesn't<00:04:50.750> have<00:04:50.840> anything<00:04:51.200> really<00:04:51.350> special

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
and doesn't have anything really special

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.740 
and doesn't have anything really special
in<00:04:51.890> it<00:04:51.980> because<00:04:52.280> even<00:04:52.790> if<00:04:53.060> adds<00:04:53.210> some<00:04:53.510> crazy

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
in it because even if adds some crazy

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.200 
in it because even if adds some crazy
wacky<00:04:54.050> scent<00:04:54.530> that'd<00:04:55.220> be<00:04:55.400> cool<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:55.880> I'd<00:04:56.030> be

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
wacky scent that'd be cool and I'd be

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.940 
wacky scent that'd be cool and I'd be
able<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.420> look<00:04:56.600> past<00:04:56.840> it<00:04:57.110> if<00:04:57.260> for<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:57.680> scent

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
able to look past it if for the scent

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.740 
able to look past it if for the scent
but<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.370> scent<00:04:58.610> is<00:04:58.700> just<00:04:59.110> hardly<00:05:00.110> anything<00:05:00.440> so

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
but the scent is just hardly anything so

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.750 
but the scent is just hardly anything so
this<00:05:02.750> was<00:05:03.110> a<00:05:03.140> real<00:05:03.470> big<00:05:03.680> letdown<00:05:03.920> because<00:05:04.310> I

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
this was a real big letdown because I

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.630 
this was a real big letdown because I
really<00:05:05.120> like<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.480> executive<00:05:05.720> slick<00:05:06.230> a<00:05:06.260> lot

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
really like the executive slick a lot

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.850 
really like the executive slick a lot
it's<00:05:07.640> definitely<00:05:08.150> I<00:05:08.450> feel<00:05:09.170> like<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:09.680> far

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
it's definitely I feel like the far

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.960 
it's definitely I feel like the far
better<00:05:10.100> pomade<00:05:10.580> in<00:05:10.670> the<00:05:10.760> line<00:05:11.080> but<00:05:12.760> let's<00:05:13.760> hope

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
better pomade in the line but let's hope

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.380 
better pomade in the line but let's hope
that<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.390> super-heavy<00:05:15.070> is<00:05:16.070> uh<00:05:16.100> is<00:05:16.610> better

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
that the super-heavy is uh is better

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.830 
that the super-heavy is uh is better
than<00:05:17.660> this<00:05:17.810> one<00:05:18.080> but<00:05:18.350> so<00:05:19.280> not<00:05:20.120> a<00:05:20.180> bad<00:05:20.360> comment

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
than this one but so not a bad comment

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.970 
than this one but so not a bad comment
just<00:05:21.410> really<00:05:22.400> really<00:05:22.850> average<00:05:23.480> so<00:05:24.080> there<00:05:24.890> you

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
just really really average so there you

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.450 
just really really average so there you
have<00:05:25.010> it

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
have it

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.110 
have it
Toro<00:05:26.150> be<00:05:26.300> the<00:05:26.690> original
