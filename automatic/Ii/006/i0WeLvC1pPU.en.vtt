00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.390
 hello very good to all my judges 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.099
 and we are here in an important video 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.500
 of the channel is a video that I've been thinking 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.330
 quite some time the truth came as a 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.309
 month thinking about making this video in 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.200
 do it and good for the truth it 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.300
 decided to do it the truth is that but 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.800
 just content of the video itself are 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.840
 some important changes that 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.420
 approach the channel of course what of 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.009
 urgent what to see them please if you can 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.259
 Pass it to all subscribers who 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.810
 you know about this channel and well 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.390
 this video is going to be based on two parts 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.010
 as you can see from the title one goes to 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.360
 I'll be going to regain the account 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.150
 of tweets with the one we left with the 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.730
 description for this one I will dedicate to 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.170
 release a ratillo from within 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.120
 of a couple of days on I'll start to 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.580
 exterminate when I see that I'm going to take 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.610
 boot cite more than anything by me 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.710
 I explain because the change to the series of 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.030
 rne that some people have liked and 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.370
 other people have done more take too much 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.710
 seriously then my best 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.780
 way for people to play in 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.640
 serious the boot and without narrating to pain 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.530
 I'll narrate but get my little music 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.060
 therefore as in youtube they do not let me 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.500
 put the music that I want but 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.700
 sincerely stand to the third channel of 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.710
 tweets that I put of the music I get 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.560
 of the balls talking in silver and I can 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.820
 play better 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.270
 be only start underestimate starts 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.340
 by tweets I was yesterday a bit with goat 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.020
 modifying the design of tweets and tola 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.479
 You can put it on twitter by putting it on 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.420
 your kit on youtube and I'll host it and be 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.940
 a little habitual the one that I extreme 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.679
 then I would like the truth that if I 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.300
 you want to see the digital boot tells you 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.220
 it's folk volcano tweets because always 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.929
 that if they have the twist when 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.610
 it rains as age stream automatically 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.960
 will skip a message send an email to 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.550
 mail in which you are associated yours 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.460
 then to account tweets 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.360
 directly know when I am 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.360
 exterminating in that case you do not see the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.119
 twitter or at that time you are all 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.130
 well that was one of the things the other 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.890
 when I think the most important one that 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.259
 I have to have this video is that I've 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.149
 made another youtube channel worth as 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.320
 you know in my channel and many sections 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.970
 many many sections 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.680
 and well I want to divide a bit 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.679
 that is the channel between quotation marks happened 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.750
 of life guides et cetera thin 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.480
 a little humor and tolete that I have 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.620
 some videos made is to say that I've 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.290
 made a new channel that is called quines 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.970
 productions that I'm going to upload to the process 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.490
 of the ass treatment of comedy about 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.350
 some parodies the bronze songs 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.960
 since I 'm doing it a little more 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.210
 the chronicles will also rise and the only 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.590
 the chronicles I want first to finish 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.090
 the main channel for people that 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.850
 followed by the beginning and then the 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.880
 I will summarize to the secondary channel as it calls 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.110
 the secondary to climb equal of three 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.700
 in three so there are not so many videos 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.500
 because I do not want here either to piss 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.660
 with old videos the new channel 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.730
 then you will say why you have done this 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.720
 basically one of the rations is that 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.430
 is that seeing that I have too many 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.080
 I 've seen a lot of sections 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.880
 Uncle people is that he still wanted to see me 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.500
 chronicles I carry systems is written to your 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.880
 channel but I have not seen them because you have 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.370
 everything comments on my playlist 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.930
 then the channel here the products was 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.460
 a little no or videos every day and not 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.230
 I know nothing like three days out there 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.690
 and it also brings me the one-player series 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.010
 hence, he has left the other 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.320
 part is that the second chapter of 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.360
 classrooms wanted to put a strike for me 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.610
 the visual content when the game is 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.160
 mine then 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.220
 I'm a bit news warning well 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.290
 thanks bike always passes that same time 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.590
 in the middle a kind of warning so that 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.520
 He does not stop doing that which was for a 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.560
 cinematic that really of the own 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.630
 game that there is no seal anything or that I 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.520
 have the de facto rights appealed and 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.310
 surely the big thing but just in case 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.780
 decided to have a bit of separate so 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.230
 so much of the chapter doubles and what of 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.220
 batman summarize the new channel also 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.630
 you have a partner with 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.300
 machinima 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.880
 machinima the truth that everyone 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.500
 he talked about her about the cock that he 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.510
 is that it gives many advantages to 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.040
 youtubers and from within I can say that 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.280
 it's not like I carry like enzymes 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.310
 exactly one year from day 15 of 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.840
 June of last year and until now 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.030
 has again not even a ticket 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.220
 have more credit to get me 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.870
 machinima account of the web itself 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.330
 same to be able to access support 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.100
 that coupled with that puts me in three years of 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.900
 contract and has not sent a shit for 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.310
 the subscribers however other 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.980
 network as for example in the retina 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.450
 eva which is next course they gave him 100 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.280
 scholarships for the wise to when not yet 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.790
 I knew no one thing that is happened 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.560
 because the mail has also given it beta 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.450
 of the voice course then what do you want 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.740
 to say that your vision now follows 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.990
 is that he has not been right now 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.440
 contest there was even possibly skin 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.910
 of the role that is something that is good for 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.930
 those subscribed separately has a system of 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.570
 support and of 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.180
 assistance to youtube rather better than 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.680
 the one that has machinima then as no 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.449
 It stops me from leaving because I'm three years old 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.310
 of contract I have two left so I 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.590
 say well a bit migrate part of the channel 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.270
 to another channel so that people too 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.850
 I followed the other channel and once I 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.889
 I can circulate maximum or lame 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.160
 I pass the whole channel to the other and I close it 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.780
 the one here from your scholarship or left it like this if 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.310
 they make Ebola how it works a little 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.750
 this being what makes the bull youtube 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.190
 it's the other way around 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.050
 it is usually done a channel of the imm place 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.729
 and then they go to a game only because I do not 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.780
 I make a game, it just happened to me 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.370
 the gay place 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.139
 basically emotional so that 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.120
 have the whole list also peta 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.410
 playlists throughout the channel and 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.910
 that people do not really find out what 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.880
 what you want to look for is a pure channel of 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.259
 the guides liked ranked and also 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.840
 news of the lawsuit the host is a 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.520
 most informative channel more day by day as 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.560
 this one in this hour but I what I want 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.090
 do a little other lete and so what 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.320
 his is to do it in ear the part for the 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.449
 people who want to laugh 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.830
 directly though the series light 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.180
 the guide is fine would it go 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.340
 different to the channel here is not 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.289
 productive and if it would be then that's a 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.760
 little really me thinking about it a lot 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.620
 because the biggest fear that I have is 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.980
 that part of the 18 thousand peak on 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.190
 everyone 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:57.120
 on the main road and do not subscribe 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:59.190
 to the secondary channel really I say 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.170
 that if subscribed in both because upload 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.910
 videos on both of them and I think the best 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.150
 way of a little bit of the mind to have something 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.270
 for you of powers you have to do 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.710
 something tonight is happening jokes or 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.870
 tristán gaming I already have the cattle that 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.920
 has contacted me and I 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.440
 What I want to imagine is that they give me something 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.020
 for you sincerely because from 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.670
 for now he is talking to 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.440
 machine with support by means of you 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.850
 that they have not listened to me either 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.970
 talking to the respondent who told me 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.980
 He recruited, they have not listened to me, I do not see 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.600
 do not leave this network either 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.490
 It is tempted to link me foundling you 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.320
 disconnected network and spend 30 days 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.880
 headlines to the vehicular team button 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.770
 Do not try to micro reject you 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.020
 automatically but I've already had several 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.810
 months tried to do it and it does not give me 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.540
 option to me then I can be do not see 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.340
 a little more edited those of us here 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.450
 production or left also those who 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.330
 produce the description as well as the 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.190
 you tile as a secondary channel in the 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.580
 main channel and good people 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.479
 I hope that we 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:00.220
 or bother this channel change and I think 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.750
 that is going to be beneficial since the people 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.460
 will be able to access what really 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.289
 want to see at the moment you want to see

 comments that you send both accounts 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:18.669

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:19.990

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:43.900
 humorous and can not exploit what 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.370

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.020
