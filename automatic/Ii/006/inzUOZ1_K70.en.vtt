00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.990
 today we come back you introduce 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.919
 a high chair 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.309
 the zaz highchair from us so has 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.280
 this chair and evolutive so she goes 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.619
 from about six months to 12 years 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.150
 but even after twelve years you can still 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.230
 use it because it goes up to 100 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.850
 kg is still a pretty good weight 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.279
 top 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:31.619
 so this chair she has several a 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.309
 rather positive point 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:40.440
 good already it's a really stop thing 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:43.770
 malo has already wanted to tap on for 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.760
 try to ride and never moved us 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.440
 is expensive she is really practical 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.440
 before long positive 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.870
 what are they saying so not already 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.600
 the tablet is a group address these 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.000
 practices because sometimes we 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.489
 also that they eat with us directly 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.680
 on the table what is hidden we 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.580
 is just the tablet when to barge on 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.299
 the small coffee table 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.490
 but otherwise when we cough seated with 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.439
 we at the table like in a chain 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.920
 that she go out they are but really 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.920
 easily 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:33.479
 he joined then he presides 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:38.130
 expectations show leaders so a 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.909
 underneath there is a small key that you 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.450
 of eclyps is actually it serves to remove 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.880
 different things of the ach is so there 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.210
 in fact there is a safety harness of 5 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.600
 points 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.869
 on the other hand for a jester like malouk 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.020
 18 months it's really just a game I 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:03.000
 barely pass my hands around his 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:06.090
 shoulders so that's right there for the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.829
 video my pool take them off it's very 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.070
 simple you do we use the little 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.070
 key and we pass it in my little hole 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:28.470
 and that's so we can use it 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.060
 in fact you only conducted in three 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.430
 points so that's what we're going 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.640
 so voice and it's the same to remove 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:52.000
 totally the harness is enough 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:52.000
 small put their same side 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.810
 and we also think the one below but 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.910
 there I would not cross the place for 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.319
 to pass pretty much as for him it takes 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.920
 that I show you the free ones so you 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:08.180
 will show haven 12 there is a hoop with 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.640
 a pain of between legs 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.290
 a wise that his practice because 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.030
 some hunts actually do not have any 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.910
 kick me it has already happened that badly 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.400
 wants tigris montbray is no problem they 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.820
 do not read a too long and very 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:28.250
 simple also there is a little button and 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:31.760
 So here are auctions while they still 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.870
 some of the tasks 1 now we 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.300
 must play with clermont this is the 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.950
 corner I sleep you saw the thing 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.610
 next door because finally also has 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:49.730
 take height 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:52.160
 here is the footrest also so there 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.700
 blow like the hunt is mounted I can 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.700
 remove the middle one 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:11.890
 all retired and milk can not in 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.130
 serve as classic things and we 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.980
 can even remove the chick and it will be 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.470
 also on it in my very evolutionary island 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.260
 and suddenly it's super convenient to wash 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.980
 because everything is detached from everything 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.960
 we therefore to settle it so that's 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:34.000
 simple it must be there is a small 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:40.300
 a little more tonight activated for 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:44.110
 go back up there only after that 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.500
 pressing and painting 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.540
 on the other hand they say never with the 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.990
 baby on it's always without the baby 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.240
 have not stopped suddenly super settings 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.120
 what it is that can enter 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.620
 my little cat for grandmasters 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.260
 in chair so we can adjust by 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.710
 relation to really a satin and that's 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:12.669
 really the positioning we want or 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.770
 to be no stranger it's a real big if 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:20.400
 I think but she really has a lot 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:23.560
 nicolas position at all tables 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:28.060
 So I think I said everything about 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.400
 this chair and a good point so it's 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.250
 at level 2 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.620
 cleanliness able to wash give to these 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.650
 sequestrations the impasse then by 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.330
 against me I have a box this debate was 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.830
 always enough even traces of karate 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:49.040
 all that I always managed to do 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:53.780
 at hobart here's the om a lot his 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:56.690
 chair I wanted with heart had it 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.980
 always trying to clip late so 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:03.560
 that's all I had to say about 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:05.960
 this yuna kim base chair practices 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.490
 and tools and that's okay it's 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.790
 quite happy to use it by 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.530
 example as an office chair for 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:20.060
 the child when he grows up or even the 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:22.580
 keep for his sprouted salma chair 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.920
 remain the missteps reach him dati 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.300
 telalian to two if I ever think we 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:34.880
 it's almost the sea ​​because it's 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:35.440
 still a little key so bad and you 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.730
 put the key 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.730
 so here I mean the next
