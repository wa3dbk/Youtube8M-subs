00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.510
 There is a lot of fun now 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.560
 Hello and welcome to new video on 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.260
 his new xxl rumors 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.789
 summary today to ipad 5 resp 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.680
 ipad mini 2 had asked on facebook 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.060
 what an apple gm device next 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.009
 video wanted to see the next rumors 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.170
 summary and he became the biggest 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.300
 part ipad 5 and ipad mini two 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.070
 tuned that's why there is this 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.379
 video as last time crashes 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.840
 again this whole post on the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.730
 article on apple live.com on our 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.950
 apple news blog the link to it is the same 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.329
 the first in the description on board 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.010
 lead all images again to all 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.780
 information textform and even if it 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.590
 I will give the new information 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.699
 this article 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.280
 Update is now equal to the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.410
 iphone 5 dishes based on design 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.750
 we see a prototype of 9 to 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.420
 5 mac just shows a bigger one 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.430
 ipad mini in the same design in the same 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.710
 layout with the slightly rough and edged 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.970
 I like it quite well 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.920
 then I have the possibility also the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.110
 back of the color to choose the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.490
 I mean like in ipad 4 ipad 3 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.070
 that the backside is always the same 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.420
 gray has but like the ipad mini up 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.970
 the back in black or white 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.979
 Many can now come to the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.320
 iPad five rumored on the hardware 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.250
 Basically you can say that 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.900
 Apple probably return a 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.610
 better processor better chips 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.590
 we install better graphics cards for 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.189
 all faster, everything works better 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.900
 to run 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.220
 but what we care about is apple 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.970
 would like a new screen technology 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.220
 a tree the gf2 touchscreens what the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.520
 could be that the ipad 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.579
 gets thinner and lighter 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.869
 then just like in the ipad 5 can really 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.549
 amazed how easy it is apple 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.310
 has become a stop 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.170
 huge advantage always ipads quite heavy 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.689
 the ipad 2 at mainz is after that 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.210
 easiest ipad at ipad 3 and 4 were 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.799
 heavier again when apple returns 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.210
 Another ipad would have brought out that 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.830
 many benefits because if you are longer 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.530
 Offer hand holding 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.760
 a hand will be exhausting 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.530
 what I would personally wish for 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.300
 if apple won the place six 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.400
 gained weight easily in the user 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.260
 Larger battery installation everything to install 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.670
 we'll see if that apple does or does 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.270
 if you just a thinner ipad 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.520
 release 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.640
 Let's come to the rumors for now 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.320
 Unfortunately, ipad mini 2 does not exist like this 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.420
 that's why I have to be that and hard 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.250
 as in a point summarized what 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.860
 there are two to ipad mini said 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.350
 Of course, once you want it as you do 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.120
 ipad five better processors better 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.770
 install chips as always everything becomes 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.170
 faster games will be more fun 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.610
 but that's interesting too 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.400
 here maybe apple wants something on 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.500
 display change as the install as 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.200
 wheel displays was previously the ipad 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.290
 mini once was so much with mini was a 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.560
 big point of criticism that apple easy 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.000
 a comparatively little 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.800
 high-resolution display has been installed there 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.980
 were just too spoiled by the 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.780
 ipad 3 from ipad 4 from iphone 5 and from 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.400
 macbook pro retina an extreme 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.920
 had high-resolution display 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.209
 and there was just that though the ipad mini 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.190
 already had a really big upset 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.450
 namely the ipad2 just smaller 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.840
 shrunken day already more points 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.250
 first the ipad 2 but still it was 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.930
 much of it is not enough they have 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.700
 simply a recipe if desired there 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.500
 can use the apps to follow suit and so would 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.360
 it also in the iPad Mini a tree 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.790
 Let's come to a final one 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.580
 conclusion to the rumors to the ipad 5 and 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.440
 say to the next ipad mini american 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.330
 that everything will get faster again 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.500
 like two times better thinks 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.540
 processors probably bring 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.489
 again more fun while playing better 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.930
 Games will be possible 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.489
 but what is she interesting? 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.610
 probably a display will do a lot 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.140
 that some may make it easier 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.110
 the other maybe with more battery 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.480
 better better display will be seen 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.550
 which is interesting when could such 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.160
 Devices are published when we do so 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.530
 a realist emin for many blogs 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.290
 next it will then be in march it 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.390
 get a lot earlier than the ipads 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.340
 before that be four and the first ipad 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.060
 mini were yes in october 2012 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.459
 presented 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.790
 that would be a shortening of the cycle the 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.590
 product cycle we will see how 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.109
 iphone 5 gives me less well on it 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.720
 will be surprised when that 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.040
 next 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.900
 ipad 5 or ipad mini combines that 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.490
 From this video I would be extreme 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.200
 all on tee off point come over 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.000
 look the link to our form one 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.250
 description or you can like me 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.660
 on facebook twitter or google plus 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.350
 However, they follow in the 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.180
 description 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.080
 what of this video and we see 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.080
 us next time
