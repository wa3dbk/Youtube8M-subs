another machine but with the 80 gold you

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.810 
another machine but with the 80 gold you
can<00:07:43.650> overcome<00:07:43.980> that<00:07:44.040> with<00:07:44.310> the<00:07:44.370> frequency

can overcome that with the frequency
adjust<00:07:47.780> this<00:07:48.780> case<00:07:49.050> we're<00:07:49.290> getting<00:07:49.470> a<00:07:49.500> lot<00:07:49.590> of

feedback from each other I simply hit

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.620 
feedback from each other I simply hit
the<00:07:52.170> frequency<00:07:52.770> button<00:07:53.070> and<00:07:53.670> find<00:07:54.510> a

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:54.630 
the frequency button and find a

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.720 
the frequency button and find a
frequency<00:07:55.140> where<00:07:55.260> it<00:07:55.410> calms<00:07:55.650> down<00:07:55.800> there's<00:07:56.430> 4

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:56.730 
frequency where it calms down there's 4
