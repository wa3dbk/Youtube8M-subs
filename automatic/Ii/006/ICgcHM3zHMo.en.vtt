00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.420
 the electronic fan assembly seen 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.420
 tronic tronic person saw the vice 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.170
 Chronic is used by scania by volvo 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.140
 in the morning is the system is very similar to the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.770
 Sef agatha is the idea is exactly the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.260
 Same sure as this works. 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.270
 looking here we have five wires in the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.420
 fan too, please just there 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.090
 we have five movies on the fan all 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.399
 well, okay, we always have everybody. 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.170
 analyzed what these five wires are 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.350
 people in there 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.390
 we have a speed sensor of the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.449
 fan and we have an olé trovo 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.989
 decoupling electro valve 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.299
 decoupling in the electropaulo of these 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.990
 five children how many movies are from 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.979
 Eletropaulo looks at the diagram and speaks two 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.909
 wires 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.400
 This eletropaulo she has two movies is 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.369
 earth or even a positive certain beauty 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:26.610
 quiet staff is then the following 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:30.000
 when the module sent a positive 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.400
 epe this is likely everything is open 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.500
 well it's on 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.840
 so it's the following folks just understanding 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.869
 here reminds me of the example I gave in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.540
 up to the motor shaft and has the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:47.470
 mechanisms of the fan lines 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.960
 right when the silicone oil is there 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.980
 when the motor shaft is turned off 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.950
 Venter will turn into a certain 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.760
 when it is connected eletropaulo 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.420
 opens and silicone oil comes out from inside 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.180
 If you come from this chamber here then what 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.149
 happens with it is likely linked 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.880
 the engine is spinning false in relation to 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:17.110
 to the wind and 94 rotates has silicone oil 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.240
 It's big but it's less sure so it will not 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.550
 be the speed of the axis that will be 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.520
 transmitted moment when there is no end 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.080
 generating more slowly and torment is just 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:32.830
 So when it comes to positive when it comes 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.720
 positive there on terminal 1 of the set a 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:41.110
 fan speed faster or faster 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:43.690
 slower but slow by your eye was 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.070
 target opens and silicone oil exits 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.720
 camera sale reads 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:52.450
 there it turns into false then it will cut 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.760
 this wire to the electropaulo will disconnect not 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.600
 and it will be filled with 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.430
 the vacuum will become full and the 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.920
 adventure will spin faster 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.630
 the principle is that if we analyze 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.070
 how we had talked at the beginning 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.800
 it's smart, right? 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.070
 fidel on a stick that stop seeing positive 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.380
 the wind is not fast then 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:19.959
 now people there you think the sale 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:22.989
 trying to spin fast or slow is slow 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:28.230
 So what do you expect to come in this? 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:30.600
 terminal 6 there is positive or nothing 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.900
 I hope it comes 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.050
 is positive because when it comes to 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.260
 positive the fan will stay slow is 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:44.550
 only the personnel or connector 38 of the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.770
 module or pr is in the 38th control 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.310
 I agree with you that the 38th 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.490
 control of eletropaulo certain personnel 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.400
 attention and please or you are in the terminal 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:00.540
 38 connector there when it is coming 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.570
 personal battery intention because 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.780
 because electropaulo is linked to the UN 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.310
 connected to the oil drain plug. 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.150
 silicone food to spin false 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.520
 same 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.610
 they will all work without cold is 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.430
 for a connected life and knows the 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.810
 What happens when warm starts 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.300
 I wrist league in search of the league and 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.950
 Turn it off for her, do not talk in open 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.030
 closed for more silicone oil 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:33.210
 between itself and how cold it gets is connected 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.850
 not to escape the csa signs the following 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.100
 turn off quick turn to freeze item 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.190
 which would connect understand is forecasting 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.650
 confuses right then this control is 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.310
 likely to uncouple to the name already 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.310
 says j 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.800
 kisses him, that is to say, if he 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.610
 connected to the uncoupled fan 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:58.260
 It's spinning false, right then. Look. 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:02.130
 except that the engine running on time and 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:05.280
 temperature above 88 degrees should be 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:08.520
 I pulsed the terminal 38 I said it just goes 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.800
 get the momentum after 88 degrees 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.320
 so if I stay there measuring until I get there 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.630
 in 88 degrees you will see only with positive in 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:20.400
 88 starts to hear the right pw signal 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.060
 can be the analyzer 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.940
 Now you write only one thing. 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.690
 down here before the eighties and 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:34.530
 eight degrees comes direct positive 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:37.500
 before the 88 direct and positive is 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.240
 after eighty-eight degrees is going 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.580
 get a boost he will not too 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.650
 the manual spirit exalts how the 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.780
 people do to simulate the temperature goes 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.930
 off the temperature sensor in the 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.580
 place of sensors will connect a decade 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.070
 resistive, everyone knows what I 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.350
 I'm talking about for decades resisting 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.990
 resistance simulator , how does he 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.060
 makes to simulate 90 degree feed 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:07.140
 As for men, he has to 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:09.870
 decade looks at the table on page 72 247 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.700
 it will turn off the sensor and instead of 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.770
 sensor and will connect decade 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.480
 simulating the temperature for example 90 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.030
 degrees will have to start to happen in the 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.530
 final pulses is what we'll see if 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.780
 It's all right. 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.810
 here he is in the control movie of 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.190
 there was positive that there was no 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.610
 let's go from once will have 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.610
 consolidated 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:37.839
 vc naum tava in chopped're giving so 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:38.830
 the smallest boot scale in maceió is a pwn 

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:41.830
 son 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.830
 op then I do not know that the event graph in 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.409
 the control 98 38 degrees 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:50.379
 so she gets positive before 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:52.449
 88 when the engine warms up cool it 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:55.979
 starts will begin to take courses 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:55.979
 beauty control
