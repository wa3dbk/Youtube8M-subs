a projection on the floor and it's kind

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.360 
a projection on the floor and it's kind
of<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:52.110> working<00:00:52.559> with<00:00:52.590> with<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.129> code<00:00:53.340> of

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
of like working with with the code of

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.049 
of like working with with the code of
the<00:00:54.090> crystal<00:00:54.809> itself<00:00:55.219> but<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.460> its<00:00:56.610> inherent

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the crystal itself but for its inherent

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.389 
the crystal itself but for its inherent
properties<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.719> chose<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:57.989> not<00:00:58.890> use<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
properties we chose to not use like the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.580 
properties we chose to not use like the
traditional<00:00:59.760> crystal<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:01.079> use<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
traditional crystal but use like the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.369 
traditional crystal but use like the
matter<00:01:01.800> crystal<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.480> create<00:01:03.660> an<00:01:03.840> optical

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
matter crystal and to create an optical

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.520 
matter crystal and to create an optical
lens<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.799> fact<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:06.110> in<00:01:07.110> front<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.409> this

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
lens in fact and this in front of this

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.710 
lens in fact and this in front of this
lens<00:01:07.770> there<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> little<00:01:08.280> lever<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.390> goes

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
lens there is a little lever that goes

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.039 
lens there is a little lever that goes
with<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> little<00:01:10.229> smaller<00:01:10.650> lately<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.220> that

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
with a little smaller lately and that

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.760 
with a little smaller lately and that
because<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.140> goes<00:01:13.350> closer<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> lens

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
because it goes closer to the lens

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.779 
because it goes closer to the lens
create<00:01:15.460> a<00:01:15.689> very<00:01:16.689> beautiful<00:01:17.549> projected<00:01:18.549> dot

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
create a very beautiful projected dot

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.899 
create a very beautiful projected dot
but<00:01:19.090> you<00:01:19.210> can<00:01:19.390> make<00:01:19.570> larger<00:01:20.140> or<00:01:20.259> smaller<00:01:20.909> by

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
but you can make larger or smaller by

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.560 
but you can make larger or smaller by
adjusting<00:01:22.060> this<00:01:22.450> distance<00:01:22.899> and<00:01:24.570> essentially

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
adjusting this distance and essentially

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.319 
adjusting this distance and essentially
creates<00:01:26.020> like<00:01:26.229> a<00:01:26.460> whole<00:01:27.460> field<00:01:28.329> of<00:01:28.539> rain<00:01:29.530> drop

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
creates like a whole field of rain drop

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.539 
creates like a whole field of rain drop
of<00:01:31.329> light<00:01:31.659> rain<00:01:31.929> drop<00:01:32.140> which<00:01:33.009> is<00:01:33.159> essentially

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
of light rain drop which is essentially

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.760 
of light rain drop which is essentially
very<00:01:33.729> very<00:01:33.909> calm<00:01:34.149> very<00:01:34.390> contemplative<00:01:34.840> the

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
very very calm very contemplative the

room has if you are staying inside has a

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.240 
room has if you are staying inside has a
very<00:01:39.149> poetic<00:01:40.149> feeling<00:01:41.110> for<00:01:41.530> me<00:01:41.560> when<00:01:41.979> I<00:01:42.009> was

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
very poetic feeling for me when I was

exactly with the crystal lenses because

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.029 
exactly with the crystal lenses because
we<00:01:58.030> really<00:01:58.450> wanted<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.899> work<00:01:59.170> with<00:01:59.229> swarovski

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
we really wanted to work with swarovski

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.660 
we really wanted to work with swarovski
and<00:02:00.220> use<00:02:01.500> Swarovski<00:02:02.500> crystal<00:02:02.920> lenses<00:02:03.340> for

for<00:02:27.970> them<00:02:28.209> during<00:02:28.540> design<00:02:28.900> miami<00:02:29.319> we<00:02:30.780> yeah

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
for them during design miami we yeah

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.229 
for them during design miami we yeah
worked<00:02:32.230> on<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.500> very<00:02:32.859> unique<00:02:33.190> specific<00:02:33.850> design

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
worked on a very unique specific design

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.470 
worked on a very unique specific design
for

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
for

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.050 
for
which<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.660> can<00:02:36.870> see<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:38.160> great<00:02:38.430> opportunity

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
which you can see the great opportunity

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.810 
which you can see the great opportunity
for<00:02:39.090> us<00:02:39.300> because<00:02:39.510> Anders<00:02:40.310> what<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.460> were<00:02:41.610> very

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
for us because Anders what we were very

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.580 
for us because Anders what we were very
interested<00:02:42.120> by<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.600> like<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.050> kind<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.380> like

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
interested by is like this kind of like

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.650 
interested by is like this kind of like
a<00:02:43.650> discrepancy<00:02:44.550> between<00:02:44.940> technology<00:02:45.420> and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
a discrepancy between technology and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.030 
a discrepancy between technology and
nature<00:02:45.870> which<00:02:46.230> has<00:02:46.350> always<00:02:46.620> been<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.800> very

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
nature which has always been a very

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.860 
nature which has always been a very
fertile<00:02:47.460> ground<00:02:47.730> if<00:02:47.910> investigation<00:02:48.690> for

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
fertile ground if investigation for

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.490 
fertile ground if investigation for
artists<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.890> in<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.430> sense<00:02:50.670> I'm<00:02:51.350> showing<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
artists and in a sense I'm showing the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.680 
artists and in a sense I'm showing the
mechanism<00:02:53.130> like<00:02:53.580> with<00:02:54.240> with<00:02:54.510> that

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
mechanism like with with that

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.170 
mechanism like with with that
installation<00:02:55.140> we<00:02:55.710> were<00:02:55.860> able<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.310> show<00:02:56.370> how

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
installation we were able to show how

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.440 
installation we were able to show how
how<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.290> pc<00:02:58.710> is<00:02:58.860> working<00:02:59.250> how<00:02:59.430> simple<00:02:59.970> the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
how the pc is working how simple the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.810 
how the pc is working how simple the
motions<00:03:00.900> are<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.590> how<00:03:01.950> do<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.490> create<00:03:02.670> a

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
motions are and how do you create a

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.410 
motions are and how do you create a
essentially<00:03:03.600> divided<00:03:04.050> creating<00:03:04.440> rain<00:03:05.420> which

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
essentially divided creating rain which

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.990 
essentially divided creating rain which
is<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.600> strange<00:03:07.320> strange<00:03:08.010> thing<00:03:08.550> because<00:03:08.580> for

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
is a strange strange thing because for

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
certain purity that we managed to

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.340 
certain purity that we managed to

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
would you embody like a very very

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.110 
would you embody like a very very
strange<00:04:48.419> bioengineering<00:04:49.820> researchers<00:04:50.820> that

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
strange bioengineering researchers that

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.790 
strange bioengineering researchers that
are<00:04:51.180> ongoing<00:04:51.600> at<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.020> moment<00:04:52.350> so<00:04:52.470> this<00:04:52.650> is

while we're showing another little like

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.469 
while we're showing another little like
a<00:05:04.100> device<00:05:05.100> that<00:05:05.400> is<00:05:05.639> like<00:05:05.789> motor<00:05:06.060> technology

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
a device that is like motor technology

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.310 
a device that is like motor technology
related<00:05:07.020> so<00:05:07.350> we<00:05:07.470> created<00:05:07.740> like<00:05:07.949> kind<00:05:08.220> of<00:05:08.310> a

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
related so we created like kind of a

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.750 
related so we created like kind of a
reinterpretation<00:05:10.320> of<00:05:10.889> a<00:05:11.039> still<00:05:11.280> life<00:05:11.460> what<00:05:11.729> is

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
reinterpretation of a still life what is

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.580 
reinterpretation of a still life what is
this<00:05:11.940> content<00:05:12.330> or<00:05:12.479> a<00:05:12.510> still<00:05:12.810> life<00:05:13.020> it's<00:05:13.440> called

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
this content or a still life it's called

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.150 
this content or a still life it's called
still<00:05:13.830> life<00:05:13.979> with<00:05:14.010> timer<00:05:14.370> and<00:05:15.410> yeah<00:05:16.410> we<00:05:16.590> can

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
still life with timer and yeah we can

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.060 
still life with timer and yeah we can
show<00:05:17.280> you<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.550> as<00:05:17.729> well<00:05:18.260> so<00:05:19.260> after<00:05:19.530> falling

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
show you that as well so after falling

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.490 
show you that as well so after falling
light<00:05:20.490> switch<00:05:21.000> is<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.570> title<00:05:22.020> of<00:05:22.169> the

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
light switch is the title of the

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.310 
light switch is the title of the
exhibition<00:05:23.010> or<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.210> room<00:05:24.479> you<00:05:25.139> have

exhibition or the the room you have
created<00:05:25.919> here<00:05:25.949> it's<00:05:26.520> always<00:05:27.360> something<00:05:27.750> with

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
created here it's always something with

that<00:05:31.320> particular<00:05:31.680> theory<00:05:32.099> yes<00:05:32.370> but<00:05:32.400> if<00:05:32.760> you

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
that particular theory yes but if you

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.460 
that particular theory yes but if you
look<00:05:33.030> like<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.599> other<00:05:33.630> kind<00:05:34.050> of<00:05:34.110> work<00:05:34.169> we

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
look like the other kind of work we

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.710 
look like the other kind of work we
doing<00:05:34.889> a<00:05:35.070> lot<00:05:35.460> of<00:05:35.520> like<00:05:35.820> permanent<00:05:36.270> large

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
doing a lot of like permanent large

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.950 
doing a lot of like permanent large
installations<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:38.430> that's<00:05:38.639> our<00:05:39.479> main<00:05:39.720> body

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
installations and that's our main body

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.290 
installations and that's our main body
of<00:05:40.050> work<00:05:40.260> and<00:05:40.500> if<00:05:41.010> you<00:05:41.130> look<00:05:41.160> at<00:05:41.400> it<00:05:41.520> like<00:05:41.669> there

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
of work and if you look at it like there

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.760 
of work and if you look at it like there
is<00:05:42.389> always<00:05:42.660> a<00:05:42.690> technology<00:05:43.260> called<00:05:43.380> element

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
is always a technology called element

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.230 
is always a technology called element
into<00:05:43.949> it<00:05:44.190> for<00:05:44.490> example<00:05:44.820> we<00:05:44.910> made<00:05:45.030> like<00:05:45.150> a

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
into it for example we made like a

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.740 
into it for example we made like a
sculpture<00:05:45.479> called<00:05:45.720> cloud<00:05:45.990> which<00:05:46.620> is<00:05:46.770> a
