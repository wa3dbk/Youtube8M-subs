guys this one is called bling ball and
well<00:00:07.319> it<00:00:07.529> makes<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.799> ball<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.610> ball<00:00:08.820> responds

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.360 
well it makes a ball the ball responds
to<00:00:09.480> physics<00:00:09.929> so<00:00:10.349> as<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.679> can<00:00:10.769> see<00:00:10.830> here<00:00:11.250> it's

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
to physics so as you can see here it's

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.009 
to physics so as you can see here it's
bouncing<00:00:11.790> off<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:11.940> walls<00:00:12.269> which<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.750> not

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
bouncing off of walls which is not

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.200 
bouncing off of walls which is not
something<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.790> anything<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.120> the

something that the anything in the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.330 
something that the anything in the
vanilla<00:00:15.660> game<00:00:15.900> really<00:00:16.139> does<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:17.070> my<00:00:17.160> inventory

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
I've got a knock back to knock back five

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.580 
I've got a knock back to knock back five
and<00:00:20.160> knock<00:00:20.520> back<00:00:20.550> ten<00:00:21.029> stick<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:22.410> will

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
and knock back ten stick and you will

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.800 
and knock back ten stick and you will
see<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.980> does<00:00:23.250> actually<00:00:23.730> respond<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
see it does actually respond to the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.849 
see it does actually respond to the
knock<00:00:24.930> back<00:00:25.140> enchantments

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859

back five obviously knock back ten is
gonna<00:00:31.740> really<00:00:32.130> make<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.579> rip<00:00:33.710> kind<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.800> flies

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
gonna really make it rip kind of flies

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.090 
gonna really make it rip kind of flies
off<00:00:35.640> really<00:00:35.969> far<00:00:36.180> there<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.050> go<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.010> does

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
off really far there you go so it does

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.290 
off really far there you go so it does
respond<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.430> those<00:00:38.610> which<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.879> pretty<00:00:39.030> cool

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
respond to those which is pretty cool

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.170 
respond to those which is pretty cool
now<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.559> right-click<00:00:40.860> on<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.460> ball<00:00:41.670> it's

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
now if you right-click on the ball it's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.610 
now if you right-click on the ball it's
going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.390> knock<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.629> way<00:00:42.960> up<00:00:42.989> into<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> air

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
going to knock it way up into the air

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.290 
going to knock it way up into the air
like<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:45.020> which<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.140> pretty<00:00:46.289> cool<00:00:47.149> going<00:00:48.149> and

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
like that which is pretty cool going and

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.850 
like that which is pretty cool going and
so<00:00:51.300> if<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.570> knock<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.500> hit<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:52.770> a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
so if you knock if you hit it with a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.939 
so if you knock if you hit it with a
knock<00:00:53.039> back<00:00:53.250> stick<00:00:53.579> right<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.300> you're

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
knock back stick right as you're

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.310 
knock back stick right as you're
right-clicking<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.899> get<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.140> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
right-clicking you can get that to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.680 
right-clicking you can get that to
happen<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.370> you'll<00:00:59.670> really<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.420> give

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
happen and you'll really just like give

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.930 
happen and you'll really just like give
it<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.840> good<00:01:00.930> kick<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.280> that's<00:01:02.399> kind<00:01:02.879> of

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
it a good kick so that's kind of

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.759 
it a good kick so that's kind of
represents<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.780> kicking<00:01:04.260> or<00:01:04.409> something<00:01:04.710> I

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
represents like kicking or something I

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.350 
represents like kicking or something I
think<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.979> could<00:01:05.100> make<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.339> cool<00:01:05.489> soccer<00:01:06.090> game

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
think you could make it cool soccer game

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.969 
think you could make it cool soccer game
out<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.380> can<00:01:07.500> make<00:01:07.590> more<00:01:07.770> than<00:01:07.830> one

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
out of this you can make more than one

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.890 
out of this you can make more than one
ball<00:01:08.220> at<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.430> time<00:01:08.610> if<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:08.939> use<00:01:09.240> slash<00:01:09.570> ball

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
ball at a time if I just use slash ball

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.620 
ball at a time if I just use slash ball
summon<00:01:10.530> some<00:01:10.710> more<00:01:10.920> some<00:01:11.880> more<00:01:11.909> balls<00:01:12.210> now

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
summon some more some more balls now

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.880 
summon some more some more balls now
they<00:01:12.750> don't<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.380> interact<00:01:13.740> with

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
they don't really like interact with

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.070 
they don't really like interact with
each<00:01:13.979> other<00:01:14.270> they<00:01:15.270> don't<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.600> bounce<00:01:15.840> off<00:01:16.049> of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
each other they don't like bounce off of

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.219 
each other they don't like bounce off of
each<00:01:16.259> other<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:18.030> that's<00:01:18.930> just

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.330 
something to keep in mind now I can use
this<00:01:21.060> slash<00:01:21.689> clear<00:01:22.020> balls<00:01:22.259> command<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.009> it'll

from<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.360> previous<00:01:48.720> video<00:01:49.610> basically<00:01:50.610> if

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
from the previous video basically if

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.069 
from the previous video basically if
you're<00:01:50.850> trying<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.210> shoot<00:01:51.450> two<00:01:51.630> arrows<00:01:51.899> at<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
you're trying to shoot two arrows at the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.590 
you're trying to shoot two arrows at the
same<00:01:52.229> target<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.860> one<00:01:53.040> has<00:01:53.250> flame<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.360> punch

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
same target this one has flame and punch

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.749 
same target this one has flame and punch
if<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.500> try<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.799> shoot<00:01:55.979> two<00:01:56.159> errors<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.610> same

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
if you try and shoot two errors the same

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.480 
if you try and shoot two errors the same
target<00:01:57.409> it<00:01:58.409> looks<00:01:58.560> really<00:01:58.770> cool<00:01:58.920> because<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
target it looks really cool because the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.270 
target it looks really cool because the
first<00:01:59.729> one<00:01:59.909> knocks<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:01.049> ball<00:02:01.079> way<00:02:01.500> off<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.189> you

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
first one knocks the ball way off so you

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.770 
first one knocks the ball way off so you
can<00:02:02.369> see<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.759> first<00:02:02.909> one<00:02:03.090> knocked<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.509> way<00:02:03.630> off

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
can see the first one knocked it way off

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.240 
can see the first one knocked it way off
and<00:02:03.960> then<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> second<00:02:04.469> one<00:02:04.590> was<00:02:04.710> chasing<00:02:05.100> it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
and then the second one was chasing it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.280 
and then the second one was chasing it
and<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:06.090> actually<00:02:06.240> did<00:02:06.600> hit<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.049> gave<00:02:07.259> it

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
and it actually did hit it and gave it

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.669 
and it actually did hit it and gave it
another<00:02:08.330> imparted<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.420> bit<00:02:09.539> more<00:02:09.690> momentum<00:02:10.140> you

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
another imparted a bit more momentum you

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.860 
another imparted a bit more momentum you
can<00:02:10.800> see<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.430> arrows<00:02:12.300> are<00:02:12.450> trying<00:02:12.690> really

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
can see the arrows are trying really

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.850 
can see the arrows are trying really
hard<00:02:12.959> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
hard to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.700 
hard to
chase<00:02:14.130> down<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.610> balls<00:02:14.790> when<00:02:15.150> they<00:02:15.650> yeah<00:02:16.650> you

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
chase down the balls when they yeah you

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.580 
chase down the balls when they yeah you
see<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.010> they're<00:02:17.640> kind<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.030> whoop<00:02:18.480> went<00:02:18.990> went

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
see that they're kind of whoop went went

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.990 
see that they're kind of whoop went went
for<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.830> other<00:02:19.950> ball<00:02:20.160> as<00:02:20.430> best<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.240> could<00:02:23.000> yeah

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
for the other ball as best it could yeah

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.150 
for the other ball as best it could yeah
so<00:02:24.960> it's<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.200> good<00:02:25.380> demonstration<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:26.070> the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
so it's a good demonstration of the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
so it's a good demonstration of the
homing<00:02:26.430> arrows<00:02:26.700> actually<00:02:27.510> as<00:02:28.050> well<00:02:29.120> yeah<00:02:30.120> you

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
homing arrows actually as well yeah you

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.580 
homing arrows actually as well yeah you
don't<00:02:30.510> need<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.720> homing<00:02:30.990> arrows<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.440> does

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
don't need a homing arrows but it does

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.140 
don't need a homing arrows but it does
interact<00:02:31.950> with<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.310> lot<00:02:32.460> of<00:02:32.490> different<00:02:32.790> parts

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
interact with a lot of different parts

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.670 
interact with a lot of different parts
of<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.270> game<00:02:33.360> which<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.570> kind<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.810> cool<00:02:33.960> I<00:02:34.230> just

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
of the game which is kind of cool I just

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.320 
of the game which is kind of cool I just
discovered<00:02:35.400> as<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.700> was<00:02:35.820> playing<00:02:36.030> around<00:02:36.180> with

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
discovered as I was playing around with

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.750 
discovered as I was playing around with
the<00:02:36.480> balls<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.530> homing<00:02:38.400> arrows<00:02:38.640> that

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
the balls and the homing arrows that

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.949 
the balls and the homing arrows that
they<00:02:38.880> worked<00:02:39.060> well<00:02:39.240> together<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:39.570> that's<00:02:39.720> kind

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
they worked well together so that's kind

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.230 
they worked well together so that's kind
of<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.080> beauty<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.410> bucket<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.280> the

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
of the beauty of bucket is that the

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.870 
of the beauty of bucket is that the
plugins<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.990> have<00:02:43.230> unintended<00:02:44.220> consequences

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
plugins can have unintended consequences

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.880 
plugins can have unintended consequences
when<00:02:45.060> put<00:02:45.209> together<00:02:45.380> that's<00:02:46.380> pretty<00:02:46.530> cool

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
when put together that's pretty cool

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.100 
when put together that's pretty cool
anyway<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.850> guess<00:02:48.390> that's<00:02:48.630> about<00:02:48.720> all<00:02:48.840> there<00:02:49.080> is

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
anyway I guess that's about all there is

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.620 
anyway I guess that's about all there is
just<00:02:50.070> download<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.520> plug-in<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.209> put<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.540> in

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
just download the plug-in and put it in

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.610
