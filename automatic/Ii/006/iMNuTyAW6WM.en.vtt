the<00:01:05.740> view<00:01:05.979> I<00:01:06.009> think<00:01:06.340> if<00:01:06.430> I<00:01:06.550> was<00:01:06.729> just<00:01:06.910> one<00:01:07.060> floor

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
the view I think if I was just one floor

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.270 
the view I think if I was just one floor
down<00:01:07.360> maybe<00:01:08.020> not<00:01:08.320> I<00:01:08.590> wouldn't<00:01:08.830> have<00:01:08.950> purchased

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280

it<00:01:09.430> but<00:01:09.640> this<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:10.119> just<00:01:10.360> perfect<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:11.020> didn't

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
it but this is just perfect you didn't

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.510 
it but this is just perfect you didn't
have<00:01:11.350> any<00:01:11.500> walls<00:01:11.710> and<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:12.190> didn't<00:01:12.340> have<00:01:12.430> any

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
have any walls and you didn't have any

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.580 
have any walls and you didn't have any
closets<00:01:13.119> that's<00:01:13.479> gonna<00:01:13.720> be<00:01:13.810> kind<00:01:14.050> of<00:01:14.080> scary

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
closets that's gonna be kind of scary

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.650 
closets that's gonna be kind of scary
well<00:01:14.830> it's<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.430> little<00:01:15.580> risky<00:01:16.090> but<00:01:16.360> being<00:01:16.570> a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
well it's a little risky but being a

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.080 
well it's a little risky but being a
designer<00:01:17.080> I<00:01:17.530> knew<00:01:17.830> I<00:01:17.860> could<00:01:18.190> maybe<00:01:18.430> handle<00:01:18.940> it

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
designer I knew I could maybe handle it

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.780 
designer I knew I could maybe handle it
maybe<00:01:19.979> Michelle<00:01:20.979> put<00:01:21.160> the<00:01:21.250> living<00:01:21.550> room<00:01:21.700> in

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
maybe Michelle put the living room in

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.760 
maybe Michelle put the living room in
the<00:01:21.820> middle<00:01:22.060> so<00:01:22.570> there's<00:01:22.930> no<00:01:23.080> bad<00:01:23.229> seat<00:01:23.560> for

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
the middle so there's no bad seat for

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.889 
the middle so there's no bad seat for
looking<00:01:24.040> at<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.250> view<00:01:24.690> knowing<00:01:25.690> on<00:01:25.780> your

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
looking at the view knowing on your

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.600 
looking at the view knowing on your
checklist<00:01:26.170> that<00:01:26.290> you<00:01:26.380> wanted<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:26.860> nice<00:01:27.310> space

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
checklist that you wanted a nice space

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.980 
checklist that you wanted a nice space
to<00:01:27.640> kind<00:01:27.970> of<00:01:28.060> hang<00:01:28.180> out<00:01:28.270> how<00:01:28.450> do<00:01:28.509> you<00:01:28.600> separate

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
to kind of hang out how do you separate

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.490 
to kind of hang out how do you separate
that<00:01:29.110> from<00:01:29.170> rest<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.649> house<00:01:29.830> I<00:01:30.160> think<00:01:31.119> that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that from rest of the house I think that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.719 
that from rest of the house I think that
during<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.619> whole<00:01:32.830> process<00:01:33.100> when<00:01:33.520> I<00:01:33.550> was

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
during the whole process when I was

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.340 
during the whole process when I was
laying<00:01:33.940> it<00:01:34.090> out<00:01:34.180> in<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.420> computer<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:34.900> I<00:01:35.200> was

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
laying it out in the computer and I was

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.890 
laying it out in the computer and I was
thinking<00:01:35.680> about<00:01:35.920> well<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:37.000> way<00:01:37.540> that<00:01:37.780> the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
thinking about well the way that the

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.450 
thinking about well the way that the
walls<00:01:38.409> were<00:01:38.590> already<00:01:38.860> set<00:01:39.100> up<00:01:39.220> with<00:01:39.340> the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
walls were already set up with the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.490 
walls were already set up with the
bathrooms<00:01:39.940> that<00:01:40.150> are<00:01:40.210> existing<00:01:40.600> they<00:01:41.260> already

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
bathrooms that are existing they already

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.440 
bathrooms that are existing they already
created<00:01:41.950> these<00:01:42.100> little<00:01:42.220> niche<00:01:42.610> areas<00:01:43.150> and<00:01:43.360> it

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
created these little niche areas and it

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.480 
created these little niche areas and it
just<00:01:43.659> seemed<00:01:43.900> to<00:01:44.049> work<00:01:44.229> where<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.860> fit<00:01:45.340> the

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
just seemed to work where to fit the

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.060 
just seemed to work where to fit the
bedrooms<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:46.380> then<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.409> was<00:01:47.650> thinking<00:01:47.979> about

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
bedrooms and then I was thinking about

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.130 
bedrooms and then I was thinking about
how<00:01:48.970> you're<00:01:49.150> gonna<00:01:49.240> feel<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.630> space<00:01:49.840> when<00:01:50.049> you

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
how you're gonna feel the space when you

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.190 
how you're gonna feel the space when you
first<00:01:50.320> walk<00:01:50.530> in<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.420> all<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.689> sudden<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:52.990> knew

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
first walk in and all of a sudden I knew

from<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.419> living<00:05:09.720> room<00:05:09.870> into<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.590> guest<00:05:10.800> room

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
and so what I wanted to do was utilize

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.260 
and so what I wanted to do was utilize
some<00:05:13.620> sort<00:05:13.650> of<00:05:13.979> privacy<00:05:14.580> screen<00:05:14.910> that<00:05:15.120> would

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
some sort of privacy screen that would

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.420 
some sort of privacy screen that would
still<00:05:15.479> allow<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.870> light<00:05:16.380> to<00:05:16.410> come<00:05:16.889> through

still allow the light to come through

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.700 
still allow the light to come through

but would not block the view I love the

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.589

another alternatives that as well would
have<00:05:24.150> been<00:05:24.300> maybe<00:05:24.510> doing<00:05:24.720> a<00:05:24.870> bookcase<00:05:25.289> that

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740

best<00:06:01.450> part<00:06:01.930> about<00:06:02.140> living<00:06:02.320> in<00:06:02.740> a<00:06:02.830> small<00:06:02.950> space

best part about living in a small space

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.750 
best part about living in a small space
is<00:06:03.610> that<00:06:03.760> nothing<00:06:04.240> is<00:06:04.330> ever<00:06:04.390> too<00:06:04.900> far<00:06:05.200> I<00:06:05.760> think

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
is that nothing is ever too far I think

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.060 
is that nothing is ever too far I think
that<00:06:07.350> waking<00:06:08.350> up<00:06:08.470> in<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:08.620> morning<00:06:08.980> and

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
that waking up in the morning and

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.010 
that waking up in the morning and
knowing<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:09.430> kitchens<00:06:09.790> right<00:06:09.970> here<00:06:10.330> or<00:06:10.600> if

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
knowing the kitchens right here or if

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.710 
knowing the kitchens right here or if
you<00:06:11.290> ever<00:06:11.440> have<00:06:11.710> to<00:06:11.920> do<00:06:12.460> laundry<00:06:12.970> it's<00:06:13.150> not<00:06:13.330> far

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
you ever have to do laundry it's not far

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.290 
you ever have to do laundry it's not far
I<00:06:14.140> think<00:06:14.230> that's<00:06:14.620> the<00:06:14.830> best<00:06:15.010> part<00:06:15.340> the<00:06:15.850> second

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
I think that's the best part the second

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.020 
I think that's the best part the second
part<00:06:16.330> is<00:06:16.690> just<00:06:16.930> that<00:06:17.080> it's<00:06:17.230> mine<00:06:17.670> coming<00:06:18.670> up<00:06:18.880> a

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
part is just that it's mine coming up a

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.210 
part is just that it's mine coming up a
Philadelphia<00:06:19.900> space<00:06:20.140> that's<00:06:20.470> taller<00:06:20.860> than<00:06:21.190> it

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
Philadelphia space that's taller than it

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.250 
Philadelphia space that's taller than it
is<00:06:21.430> why

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
is why

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.290 
is why
