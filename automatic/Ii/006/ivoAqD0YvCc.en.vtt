00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.610
 There are several types of locks 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:15.400
 laminate adhesive bond without adhesive 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.920
 glue forehead connection 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.009
 click laminate with glue joint all 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.800
 less common on sale compound 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.839
 forehead without adhesive joints dock 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.419
 with each other using the castle 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.640
 The panel mechanism is represented by a friend 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:35.130
 friend butts butt and hide behind 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.930
 Hammer compound scream such locks 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.440
 collapsible often call them 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.740
 double locks 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.340
 mounting scheme such a panel is supplied 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:48.460
 to the panel lying on the floor at an angle of 40 45 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.710
 degrees the spike is inserted into the groove when 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.700
 easy swinging smelting lock and 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.290
 snaps panel tightly fixed 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.390
 the main advantage of click laminate 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.700
 is that in practice 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.659
 probability of damage reduced to zero 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.299
 the pump when assembling both types of locks 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.909
 will support reassembly disassembly but 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.540
 as practice shows locking the forehead sometimes 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.970
 can not withstand disassembly and breaks 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.450
 another advantage of click laminates 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.420
 is the bond strength 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.909
 and the lifespan of laminate floor writers with 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.979
 click lock can lie on the surface with 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.880
 differential up to three millimeters one 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.759
 linear meter 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.250
 can be mounted on an uneven base 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.670
 laminate syllable lock more demanding 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.039
 evenness of base log locks is simple 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.590
 economical option such laminate and 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.380
 are not expensive but should be assembled 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.979
 to entrust the professionals laminate from click 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.110
 locks 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.600
 it is more technological and reliable 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.759
 floor coverings with attentive 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.630
 read the installation instructions 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.250
 their assembly is possible and not professionals 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.890
 aluminum aluminum locking system 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.909
 okay firm a lot on traditional 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.459
 thorn-groove connection 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.679
 aluminum profile is also fixed 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:07.319
 a short vision of a piece of each board 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.690
 to maintain such a connection 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.310
 1200 kilogram 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.709
 Karamat ex used plastic 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.660
 castle express system which 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.610
 allows you not to raise the bar for 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.590
 snap on the short side 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.590
 she just snaps light 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.480
 uniclic locking system built like this 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.730
 the way that the coupling is so strong and 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.910
 charge that allows you to disassemble and assemble 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.070
 your floor up to four times and with 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.080
 zirconium like 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.530
 to break such a lock you will need 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.250
 weight is equal to 900 50 kilograms of laminate with 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.620
 such a lock 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.110
 mounted and at an angle and in one 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.930
 horizontal plane we recommend 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.300
 regardless of lock type and class 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.500
 your chosen laminate additionally 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.740
 use sealants 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.880
 you have the ability to protect the connection from 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.130
 moisture ingress 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.230
 this will further fasten 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.270
 lock connection significantly 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.970
 extend from the traditional service life 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.070
 these and many other recommendations you 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.820
 can find out by contacting the mall 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.030
 center 38 meters or by phone 38 5
