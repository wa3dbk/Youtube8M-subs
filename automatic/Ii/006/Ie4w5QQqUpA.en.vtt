make it 200 this way so that this is how
it's<00:03:11.430> coming<00:03:11.700> if<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.510> render<00:03:12.780> data<00:03:12.959> just<00:03:13.260> to

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
it's coming if you render data just to

it's coming if you render data just to
see<00:03:13.590> how<00:03:13.829> it<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.430> looking<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.690> won't<00:03:15.930> see

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
see how it is looking you won't see

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.560 
see how it is looking you won't see
anything<00:03:16.320> because<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:17.670> need<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:17.970> change<00:03:18.209> them

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
they are looking and if is see it from

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.510 
they are looking and if is see it from
side<00:04:20.130> view<00:04:21.800> actually<00:04:22.800> they're<00:04:22.949> coming<00:04:23.250> this

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
side view actually they're coming this

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.180 
side view actually they're coming this
way

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.750 

see<00:04:29.190> something<00:04:29.699> like<00:04:29.789> this<00:04:31.070> you<00:04:32.070> can<00:04:32.580> change

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
see something like this you can change

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.379 
see something like this you can change

the properties control a streak to multi

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.480 
the properties control a streak to multi
streak<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:38.970> that<00:04:39.150> he<00:04:39.300> will<00:04:40.370> current<00:04:41.370> on

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
streak and so that he will current on

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:51.960 
streak and so that he will current on
the<00:04:41.610> type

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:05:04.590 

like<00:04:52.970> that<00:04:54.640> so<00:04:55.640> this<00:04:55.790> is<00:04:55.940> how<00:04:56.120> it<00:04:56.270> is<00:04:56.300> coming

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
I'll show the final movie in the end so

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.560 
I'll show the final movie in the end so
that<00:06:12.430> you<00:06:12.520> can<00:06:12.670> understand<00:06:13.060> what<00:06:13.180> are<00:06:13.450> the

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
that you can understand what are the

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.870 
that you can understand what are the
dynamics<00:06:13.690> and<00:06:14.230> all<00:06:14.380> those<00:06:14.560> things<00:06:14.830> when<00:06:15.790> you

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
dynamics and all those things when you

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.160 
dynamics and all those things when you
can<00:06:16.030> create<00:06:16.530> this<00:06:17.530> way<00:06:18.630> you<00:06:19.630> can<00:06:19.810> change<00:06:20.050> the

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
can create this way you can change the

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.640 
can create this way you can change the
properties<00:06:20.730> not<00:06:21.730> that<00:06:21.910> stuff<00:06:22.560> whereas<00:06:23.560> you

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
properties not that stuff whereas you

something like this beautiful things you
can<00:06:39.820> create<00:06:40.500> I'll<00:06:41.500> show<00:06:41.800> you<00:06:41.860> the<00:06:42.640> final

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
can create I'll show you the final

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.170 
can create I'll show you the final
tundra<00:06:43.240> version<00:06:43.660> and<00:06:44.200> other<00:06:44.410> stuff<00:06:44.910> this<00:06:45.910> time
