nothing to any of these now okay so this
one<00:00:15.389> here<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.809> connecting<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.260> white<00:00:16.440> wires

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
one here is connecting the white wires

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.769 
one here is connecting the white wires
together<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.250> don't<00:00:17.460> necessarily<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:18.180> to

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
together I don't necessarily have to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.189 
together I don't necessarily have to
remove<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:20.100> right<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:21.000> can<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:21.599> put<00:00:21.990> that

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
back in here like that I've got a ground

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.400 
back in here like that I've got a ground
wire<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.369> deal<00:00:26.519> with<00:00:26.789> I've<00:00:27.449> got<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> black<00:00:28.079> hot

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
wire to deal with I've got the black hot

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.230 
wire to deal with I've got the black hot
wire<00:00:28.650> coming<00:00:29.070> into<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.460> box<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.939> got<00:00:30.089> the

and it may look to you that this could
be<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> white<00:00:35.070> wire<00:00:35.340> that's<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:36.090> paint<00:00:36.450> I've

careful inspection I told you incorrect
just<00:00:58.650> a<00:00:58.770> second<00:00:59.100> ago<00:00:59.340> that<00:01:00.080> both<00:01:01.080> of<00:01:01.110> these

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
just a second ago that both of these

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.530 
just a second ago that both of these
wires<00:01:01.620> were<00:01:01.890> black<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.270> fact

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
wires were black this one is in fact

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.560 
wires were black this one is in fact
white<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:05.009> in<00:01:05.220> fact<00:01:05.489> black<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.299> had<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
white this one is in fact black I had to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.160 
white this one is in fact black I had to
look<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.020> really<00:01:07.380> super<00:01:07.740> close<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
look at that really super close and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.450 
look at that really super close and
normally<00:01:10.170> when<00:01:10.469> you<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> light<00:01:11.189> fixture

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
normally when you get to a light fixture

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.219 
normally when you get to a light fixture
that's<00:01:11.850> what<00:01:12.090> you're<00:01:12.240> gonna<00:01:12.329> have<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.899> black

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
that's what you're gonna have a black

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.349 
that's what you're gonna have a black
wire<00:01:13.469> coming<00:01:13.770> out<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.219> white<00:01:14.549> wire<00:01:14.820> coming<00:01:15.210> out

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359 
wire coming out a white wire coming out

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:20.749 
wire coming out a white wire coming out
and<00:01:15.539> a<00:01:15.899> ground<00:01:16.320> wire<00:01:16.770> coming<00:01:17.219> out<00:01:18.229> okay<00:01:19.759> so

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
and a ground wire coming out okay so

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.969 
and a ground wire coming out okay so
here's<00:01:21.030> my<00:01:21.090> new<00:01:21.359> bracket<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.469> see<00:01:22.679> it's<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.950> a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
here's my new bracket and see it's on a

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.830 
here's my new bracket and see it's on a
swivel<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.700> sure<00:01:23.969> enough<00:01:24.240> there's<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.539> ground

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
swivel and sure enough there's a ground

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.190 
swivel and sure enough there's a ground
screw<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.439> there<00:01:25.710> too<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.450> can<00:01:27.450> fish<00:01:27.719> that<00:01:27.990> up

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
screw on there too I can fish that up

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.190 
screw on there too I can fish that up
there<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.679> that<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:32.630> I'm<00:01:33.630> gonna<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:34.020> to

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
decide what to do with that ground screw

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.950 
decide what to do with that ground screw
because<00:01:37.859> there's<00:01:38.340> another<00:01:38.729> one<00:01:39.060> attached<00:01:39.749> to

sometimes this brackets longer and you

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.260 
sometimes this brackets longer and you
have<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.410> decide<00:02:15.800> what<00:02:16.070> screw<00:02:16.550> holes<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.240> use

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
have to decide what screw holes to use

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.850 
screws you know from the old box and it
looks<00:02:46.400> like<00:02:48.190> they<00:02:49.190> look<00:02:49.400> about<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.850> same<00:02:50.860> I'm

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
looks like they look about the same I'm

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.600 
looks like they look about the same I'm
gonna<00:02:52.040> try<00:02:52.370> I'm<00:02:53.269> gonna<00:02:53.420> try<00:02:53.510> one<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:53.930> those

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
gonna try I'm gonna try one of those

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.710 
gonna try I'm gonna try one of those
just<00:02:55.610> for<00:02:55.730> kicks<00:02:56.950> into<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.070> box<00:02:58.400> this<00:02:59.180> box<00:02:59.450> is

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
just for kicks into this box this box is

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.250 
just for kicks into this box this box is
so<00:02:59.750> old<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.500> screw<00:03:01.570> area<00:03:02.570> might<00:03:02.810> have<00:03:03.049> been

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
so old the screw area might have been

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.650 
so old the screw area might have been
stripped<00:03:03.680> out<00:03:05.410> let's<00:03:06.410> just<00:03:06.530> see<00:03:07.330> what<00:03:08.330> I<00:03:08.360> can

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
stripped out let's just see what I can

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:18.470 
stripped out let's just see what I can
do<00:03:08.840> with<00:03:09.049> this<00:03:09.230> one

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:26.670 

Oh<00:03:18.510> your<00:03:19.230> mouth<00:03:19.440> just<00:03:19.860> right

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.380 

that's<00:03:27.280> why<00:03:27.459> I<00:03:27.489> don't<00:03:27.640> like<00:03:27.849> the<00:03:28.030> throw<00:03:28.269> away

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
that's why I don't like the throw away

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.569 
that's why I don't like the throw away
the<00:03:28.720> screws<00:03:29.079> and<00:03:29.409> everything<00:03:29.530> if<00:03:30.099> I<00:03:30.310> have

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
the screws and everything if I have

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.720 
the screws and everything if I have
anything<00:03:30.879> from<00:03:31.239> an<00:03:31.390> old<00:03:31.569> box<00:03:31.900> let's<00:03:32.349> say<00:03:32.730> an

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
anything from an old box let's say an

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.330 
anything from an old box let's say an
old<00:03:34.000> light<00:03:34.269> fixture<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:37.510> one<00:03:37.689> went<00:03:37.870> in<00:03:38.340> that

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
old light fixture that one went in that

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.830 
old light fixture that one went in that
went<00:03:39.579> in<00:03:39.670> pretty<00:03:39.849> good

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
went in pretty good

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:50.650 
went in pretty good
okay<00:03:44.230> now<00:03:45.230> what<00:03:45.530> are<00:03:45.680> we<00:03:45.860> gonna<00:03:46.010> do<00:03:46.280> next<00:03:49.660> now

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
okay now what are we gonna do next now

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.190 
okay now what are we gonna do next now
see<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.050> reason<00:03:51.470> for<00:03:51.769> this<00:03:52.730> here<00:03:53.180> is<00:03:53.390> the

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
see the reason for this here is the

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.589 
see the reason for this here is the
screws<00:03:54.620> on<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.099> other<00:03:55.250> one<00:03:55.489> are<00:03:55.700> sideways<00:03:56.360> so

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
screws on the other one are sideways so

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.270 
screws on the other one are sideways so
after<00:03:56.900> we<00:03:57.019> figure<00:03:57.349> out<00:03:57.379> what<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.680> do<00:03:57.920> with<00:03:58.040> that

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
after we figure out what to do with that

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.630 
after we figure out what to do with that
we<00:03:59.269> can<00:03:59.450> loosen<00:03:59.780> up<00:03:59.900> these<00:04:00.140> screws<00:04:00.560> here<00:04:01.190> in

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
we can loosen up these screws here in

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.320 
we can loosen up these screws here in
the<00:04:02.090> middle<00:04:02.450> and<00:04:03.849> then<00:04:04.849> we're<00:04:04.970> gonna<00:04:05.060> have<00:04:05.299> to

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
the middle and then we're gonna have to

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.199 
the middle and then we're gonna have to
flip<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:05.900> around<00:04:05.959> that<00:04:06.590> way<00:04:06.830> and<00:04:07.209> then

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
flip this around that way and then

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.030 
flip this around that way and then
tighten<00:04:08.690> up<00:04:08.780> these<00:04:08.989> screws<00:04:09.910> okay<00:04:11.530> so<00:04:12.530> in<00:04:12.650> fact

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
tighten up these screws okay so in fact

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.500 
tighten up these screws okay so in fact
I<00:04:13.280> might<00:04:13.430> want<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.790> line<00:04:14.030> that<00:04:14.060> up<00:04:14.390> and<00:04:14.840> see

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
I might want to line that up and see

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.960 
I might want to line that up and see
which<00:04:17.590> you<00:04:18.590> know<00:04:18.709> how<00:04:18.979> much<00:04:19.160> slop<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:19.700> have

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
which you know how much slop I have

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.060 
which you know how much slop I have
where<00:04:20.900> I'm<00:04:20.989> going<00:04:21.169> to<00:04:21.229> push<00:04:21.410> this<00:04:21.590> down<00:04:21.799> this

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
where I'm going to push this down this

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.340 
where I'm going to push this down this
hole<00:04:22.280> seems<00:04:22.580> bigger<00:04:22.910> up<00:04:23.150> there<00:04:23.360> so<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:24.290> I'm

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
hole seems bigger up there so so I'm

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.879 
hole seems bigger up there so so I'm
gonna<00:04:24.440> have<00:04:24.830> that<00:04:25.070> wire<00:04:25.430> coming<00:04:25.790> out<00:04:25.970> there

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
gonna have that wire coming out there

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.710 
gonna have that wire coming out there
look<00:04:27.889> at<00:04:28.040> that<00:04:28.250> line<00:04:28.610> this<00:04:28.880> up<00:04:29.120> from<00:04:29.360> left<00:04:29.630> to

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
look at that line this up from left to

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.570 
look at that line this up from left to
right<00:04:31.300> tighten<00:04:32.300> this<00:04:32.450> up<00:04:32.660> I<00:04:33.250> don't<00:04:34.250> know<00:04:34.370> why

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
right tighten this up I don't know why

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:42.150 
right tighten this up I don't know why
there's<00:04:34.850> two<00:04:34.910> screws<00:04:35.360> here

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.900 

line<00:04:42.790> that<00:04:43.060> up<00:04:43.120> okay<00:04:44.700> so<00:04:45.700> far<00:04:46.060> so<00:04:46.090> good<00:04:47.910> let's

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
line that up okay so far so good let's

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.680 
line that up okay so far so good let's
figure<00:04:49.210> out<00:04:49.450> what<00:04:49.690> to<00:04:49.810> do<00:04:49.960> with<00:04:50.170> this<00:04:50.550> ground

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
figure out what to do with this ground

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.970 
figure out what to do with this ground
wire<00:04:52.690> what<00:04:53.320> should<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.650> do

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
wire what should I do

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.680 
wire what should I do
I'm<00:04:54.460> thinking<00:04:54.880> I<00:04:55.000> should<00:04:55.180> just<00:04:55.360> put<00:04:55.540> it

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
I'm thinking I should just put it

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.430 
I'm thinking I should just put it
underneath<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.320> screw<00:04:56.770> be<00:04:57.010> done<00:04:57.220> with<00:04:57.430> it

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
underneath that screw be done with it

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.630 
underneath that screw be done with it
this<00:04:59.440> is<00:04:59.500> a<00:05:01.230> looks<00:05:02.230> like<00:05:02.350> a<00:05:02.410> plastic<00:05:03.100> box<00:05:03.370> it

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
this is a looks like a plastic box it

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.580 
this is a looks like a plastic box it
might<00:05:03.820> be<00:05:04.000> a<00:05:04.030> metal<00:05:04.390> box<00:05:04.630> but<00:05:04.990> see<00:05:05.200> this<00:05:05.380> is

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
might be a metal box but see this is

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.060 
might be a metal box but see this is
metal<00:05:05.950> here<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.310> it<00:05:07.120> will<00:05:07.240> ground<00:05:07.480> itself

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
metal here and it will ground itself

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.830 
metal here and it will ground itself
once<00:05:09.070> I<00:05:09.220> have<00:05:09.430> it<00:05:09.460> attached<00:05:09.970> underneath<00:05:10.420> that

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
once I have it attached underneath that

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.440 
once I have it attached underneath that
I<00:05:11.610> think<00:05:12.610> that's<00:05:12.790> what<00:05:13.000> I'm<00:05:13.090> going<00:05:13.210> to<00:05:13.300> do

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
I think that's what I'm going to do

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.690 
I think that's what I'm going to do
that's<00:05:13.750> what<00:05:13.930> they<00:05:14.050> did<00:05:14.260> before<00:05:14.500> and<00:05:15.160> the

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
that's what they did before and the

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.970 
that's what they did before and the
light<00:05:15.910> fixture<00:05:16.360> has<00:05:16.510> a<00:05:16.540> ground<00:05:16.930> wire<00:05:17.500> on<00:05:17.770> it

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
light fixture has a ground wire on it

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.090 
light fixture has a ground wire on it
and<00:05:18.160> here's<00:05:18.760> a<00:05:18.820> set<00:05:19.180> screw<00:05:19.450> there<00:05:19.870> so<00:05:20.560> if<00:05:20.740> I<00:05:20.860> put

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
and here's a set screw there so if I put

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.890 
and here's a set screw there so if I put
this<00:05:21.280> ground<00:05:21.610> wire<00:05:21.790> under<00:05:22.210> that<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:22.630> then<00:05:22.780> the

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
this ground wire under that and then the

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.710 
this ground wire under that and then the
other<00:05:23.190> ground<00:05:24.190> wire<00:05:24.430> it's<00:05:24.820> gonna<00:05:25.030> do<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.300> same

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
other ground wire it's gonna do the same

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.970 
other ground wire it's gonna do the same
thing<00:05:26.170> that's<00:05:26.350> right<00:05:26.650> here<00:05:27.360> you<00:05:28.360> know<00:05:28.920> so<00:05:29.920> I

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
thing that's right here you know so I
