00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.910
 hello and welcome to the matrix tv i 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.980
 am here actually to introduce you to the 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.130
 new seat box from matrix la 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.630
 seedbox of 36 so you'll see we have 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.000
 actually does things that you 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.160
 will improve your comfort and 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.710
 your stability at the water's edge thanks to 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.540
 this station so to start you 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.510
 will actually see us our new 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.150
 knobs gifts that are easy 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.760
 grip will allow greenhouse and 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.560
 effectively actually your feet all the way 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.860
 frame structure was welded 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.420
 directly and so one to the absence 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.830
 total feast of the boat that you 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.330
 find usually on all 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.340
 stations that will allow you to have a 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.380
 very aggressive situation with your feet 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.990
 on the crate and especially preserve from 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.580
 all back pain we will see 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.050
 also the position of the buttons that 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.400
 is totally different from what you 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.650
 can usually find in fact on 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.750
 the box sites so all the buttons have 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.850
 been positioned in fact in the same axis 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.410
 like that you do not have any buttons anymore 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.180
 exceed have admitted but no longer your 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.190
 car you can go in very 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.860
 easily makes your station in 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.140
 your side safe also on 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.450
 the buttons is that you never have 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.160
 of contacts with the screw and the son so 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.750
 so you do not damage and never again 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.670
 actually your line for fishing at 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.360
 feeder where the catch fishing of course 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.360
 it's really handy 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.229
 so here are the feet of the station you 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.929
 you will be able to mark several things 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.000
 so diameter 36 for the top so that's 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.610
 really very solid and very stable so 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.690
 always the same we have the ease 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.459
 opening so to squeeze very 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.800
 convenient 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.319
 here you have a made a foot of 25 mm 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.150
 with a dish that will actually allow you 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.530
 greenhouse and I would say feet a lot 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.750
 more easily and to have really 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.420
 something very solid we have 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.950
 also made kneecaps which are very 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.990
 wide so that gives a lot of 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.250
 stability at the station and especially who 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.260
 will allow you to marry 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.470
 all terrain contours so 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.700
 really did something 4.4 so 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.080
 now we will actually put 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.230
 feet on the station to be able to 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.670
 to fish as you see it is very 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.690
 easy to actually go in and feet 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.760
 in the resort 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.290
 so there actually you shift to 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.420
 outside like that you'll always 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.920
 access actually to the feet and pimples 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.430
 in fact to adjust to 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:00.860
 the right height 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:03.020
 it's really very important so in 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.150
 the construction of the station 36 he 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.590
 is something very important so 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.300
 you will see in fact and you will see 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.910
 the thickness in fact of the frame that was 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.500
 positioned so well in fact you have 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.570
 really something very solid 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.490
 but despite everything we do this station 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.800
 stay very light that's very 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.420
 important point of detail also who 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.060
 has been added to the station 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.380
 this is the presence of the level so that 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.140
 will really allow you to have some 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.390
 perfectly flat thing and to have in 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.500
 makes an optimum installation now 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:39.500
 you also have on this station 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:40.850
 so all the part that is here you 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.820
 actually have a platform that is everything 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.680
 at the same height as the frame 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.500
 with clamping buttons of each 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.090
 side that will allow you to 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.690
 able to perfectly stabilize the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.530
 station is to be completely flat 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.530
 now place to the installation 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.530
 the level is perfect thanks to the bubble 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.800
 and that's a very important thing 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.780
 also we have a very very big 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.490
 quality of cushions you actually see 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.560
 it's really very tender will adapt in 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.570
 made to all the morphologies the side 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.610
 also very interesting from this station 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.870
 that's basically so the frame is 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.670
 completely naked and you have the 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.760
 possibility in fact to modulate the box 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.660
 with some sizes so be it so 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.280
 that is, if you want 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.410
 start with a very deep one locker 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.940
 could if you actually started 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.070
 by a less deep locker can 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:02.440
 also you can really modulate 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:02.440
 the resort your way simply 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:24.560
 added a line locker but hey 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:26.240
 almost without forgetting the cushion and 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.190
 it's gone the station is ready to 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.050
 fish little point of detail very 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.180
 important is that at the top of each 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.620
 foot we actually added a step 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.340
 of screws that will allow you to actually 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.480
 can put more accessories like 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.830
 I wanted to demonstrate in fact everything to 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.240
 the hour so the absence of the bar you 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.430
 allows to have a positioning of your 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.900
 very comfortable feet so you're not 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.710
 more in position like that so suddenly 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.550
 relieve you really made your back 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.270
 station in fact of a very very big 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.010
 stability 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.600
 that's very important so fishermen 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.840
 who were actually looking for a cashier 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.669
 solid stable light with a price 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.080
 really very accessible especially 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.610
 do not hesitate it's really the resort 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.720
 that you need and in any case very 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.720
 soon on the matrix tv
