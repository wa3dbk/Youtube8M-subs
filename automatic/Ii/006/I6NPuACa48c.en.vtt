00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.529
 if the j cover me 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.820
 squid Andalusian versus calamari 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.050
 to the roman recipes apparently 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.390
 identical but for a small 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.630
 difference that also scandalously 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.669
 simple let's see what we clean the 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.130
 squid under the tap we remove the 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:31.700
 stone and fins clean well 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.410
 fins clean the tentacles 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.890
 and we cut the part of the eyes and 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.890
 we discard 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.820
 we turn the squid around like a 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.590
 sock to clean inside 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.850
 normally they already come without ink but in 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.149
 if I had the right to do with 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.149
 watch out 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.510
 we turn it around 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.960
 we let them drain once cut and 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.960
 salty 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.890
 we throw enough sand in a bag of 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.250
 freezing aroused we incorporated the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.250
 calamari 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.759
 close and remove so that they can not 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.759
 in good 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.570
 we put a pan with enough oil 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.630
 fry the squid do at once 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.219
 I particularly like soft-hearted 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.240
 but if you want us more golden, 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.240
 you can do a little more 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.870
 we leave them on kitchen paper to 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.760
 that release the oil 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.640
 we present you on a plate with half 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.890
 lemon that we can then squeeze 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.890
 marching one of calama de sal andaluza 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.640
 we just cut the squid and salt 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.640
 masters 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.109
 We stir prepare the batter threw 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.939
 beer we incorporate the flour and 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.959
 stir until obtaining a dough 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.959
 slightly thick 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.400
 we beat until we get rid of all the lumps 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.190
 we toss the squid and stir for 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.190
 that are undertaken well 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.280
 we thought the squids 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.140
 This batter is more efficient than 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.140
 previous and remains with more volume 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.660
 they are made quickly the time will depend 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.020
 of the more or less golden point that we 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.020
 like 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.530
 and another squid is already marching 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.530
 but to the Roman
