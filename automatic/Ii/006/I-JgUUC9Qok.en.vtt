 the current presenter 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.440
 but for the fans 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.260
 as a reminder the module the small lines 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.400
 I am 23 years old 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.770
 on attacking but I can play 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.770
 everywhere in the task that I had in attacking I can play on the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.950
 left or right flank is pointed 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.360
 my qualities are of a good technique at lamballe station I'm going fast enough 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.490
 and my faults not a very good game of head mgr bernard bonneau system 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.010

 but stands ready to act 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.190
 - I grew up if it falls well that four sleeves I spent all my 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.220
 I did not attend belgium 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.990
 so that's the big canvas c 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.310
 the big difference with the line 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.800
 for me it's a big difference to a bigger club than 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.730
 the safe co-chair 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.320
 maintenance repair enough lands that choice against the Ghent I'm trying to 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.740
 do the same thing that I did there then to precede standing to give 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.990
 the maximum here for the public and 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.110
 I think it would be easier since it's a club with a lot more 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.630
 leave other side of 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.800
 of self so I think there is opportunity to do things well 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.240
 peter collins tg at a few days of Ghent personally 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.220

 handball on vacation in the ranks five missions in marrakech 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.040
 it's a bother I know all except the point since hooked could join 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.529
 the act 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:13.519
 we call you little TV 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.679
 that was why 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.670
 because my people love me the football player peeled 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.679
