comfortable<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.239> think<00:00:39.930> you're

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
comfortable with that I think you're

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.380 
comfortable with that I think you're
ready<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.379> start<00:00:40.680> doing<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.460> bit<00:00:41.610> nosedive<00:00:42.149> and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
ready to start doing a bit nosedive and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
stuffing your foot in so the next step

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.840 
stuffing your foot in so the next step
is<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.719> nosedive<00:00:46.260> which<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:47.129> get<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> bit

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
is going nosedive which can get a bit

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.940 
is going nosedive which can get a bit
scary<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:49.020> your<00:00:49.170> bars<00:00:49.350> are<00:00:49.500> comfortable

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
close to the coconut so usually legs

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.969 
close to the coconut so usually legs
pump<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> transition<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.650> want<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.860> sort

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
pump the transition and you want to sort

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.700 
pump the transition and you want to sort
of<00:01:05.070> bar<00:01:05.309> spin<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.850> at<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> same<00:01:06.659> time<00:01:06.930> change

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
of bar spin and at the same time change

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.800 
of bar spin and at the same time change
your<00:01:07.890> direction<00:01:08.010> from<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.760> up<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.540> going

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
your direction from going up to going

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.620 
your direction from going up to going

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
down so I'll show you example of that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.440 
down so I'll show you example of that
and<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.830> won't<00:01:14.369> put<00:01:14.580> my<00:01:14.610> foot<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.360> you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
can see what it's like to do it without

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:26.570 
can see what it's like to do it without
put<00:01:17.850> your<00:01:17.970> foot<00:01:18.119> in

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.700

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
can't get learning that because it's a

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.890 
can't get learning that because it's a
huge<00:01:33.570> help<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:35.240> when<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.330> actually<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.690> put
