if you still don't know what it says by
the<00:02:24.940> way<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.420> don't<00:02:26.110> remember<00:02:26.260> but<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.709> think

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
the way I don't remember but I think

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.250 
the way I don't remember but I think
these<00:02:27.100> were<00:02:27.310> four<00:02:27.760> dollars<00:02:28.060> each<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.600> then

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
these were four dollars each and then

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.620 
these were four dollars each and then
this<00:02:29.590> one<00:02:30.450> was<00:02:31.450> 75<00:02:32.200> person<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:33.010> was<00:02:33.190> like

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
this one was 75 person of so it was like

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.830 
this one was 75 person of so it was like
350<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:34.660> guess<00:02:35.050> so<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:35.920> shake<00:02:36.310> this<00:02:36.489> up<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.910> you

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
350 I guess so you shake this up and you

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.050 
350 I guess so you shake this up and you
put<00:02:38.110> some<00:02:38.380> on<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:40.120> has<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.840> really<00:02:41.709> really<00:02:41.920> cool

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
bubbles and then when you touch them

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.320 
bubbles and then when you touch them
they<00:02:50.700> need<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.820> sound<00:02:52.030> like<00:02:52.300> this<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:54.330> then

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
they need to sound like this and then
