because<00:02:08.429> what<00:02:08.670> I've<00:02:08.760> done<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.149> I've<00:02:09.300> changed

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
because what I've done is I've changed

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.480 
because what I've done is I've changed
my<00:02:09.780> whole<00:02:09.929> system<00:02:10.350> around<00:02:10.590> it's<00:02:11.160> my<00:02:11.370> own

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
my whole system around it's my own

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.690 
my whole system around it's my own
design<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.110> guys<00:02:13.260> try<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.770> copy<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.340> you

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
design and you guys try to copy it you

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.910 
design and you guys try to copy it you
want<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.090> do<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> big<00:02:15.450> deal<00:02:15.690> it's<00:02:16.680> just

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
want to do a big deal it's just

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.070 
want to do a big deal it's just
something<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.250> I've<00:02:17.459> come<00:02:17.670> up<00:02:17.820> with<00:02:18.060> what<00:02:19.050> I

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
something that I've come up with what I

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.720 
something that I've come up with what I
figure<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:20.570> if<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.870> system<00:02:22.320> becomes<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.830> scummy

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
figure is if the system becomes a scummy

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.610 
figure is if the system becomes a scummy
and<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.060> needs<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.360> be<00:02:24.450> cleaned<00:02:24.750> out<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.350> any

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
and it needs to be cleaned out in any

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.490 
and it needs to be cleaned out in any
way<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:26.160> can<00:02:26.940> take<00:02:27.150> off<00:02:27.330> any<00:02:27.540> one<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.350> these

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
way I can take off any one of these

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.500 
way I can take off any one of these
fittings<00:02:28.860> because<00:02:29.400> they<00:02:29.550> have<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> just

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
fittings because they have a just

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.050 
fittings because they have a just
abandon<00:02:31.140> their<00:02:31.380> stainless<00:02:32.370> steel<00:02:32.580> fan<00:02:32.820> you

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
abandon their stainless steel fan you

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.630 
abandon their stainless steel fan you
just<00:02:33.300> unscrew<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.810> pop<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.410> apart<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.190> clean

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
just unscrew it pop it apart and clean

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.180 
just unscrew it pop it apart and clean
out<00:02:35.820> every<00:02:36.330> bit<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:37.709> right<00:02:37.950> here<00:02:38.160> is

90<00:03:29.720> here<00:03:29.960> like<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:30.980> said<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.190> made<00:03:31.400> this<00:03:31.520> all

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
90 here like I said I made this all

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.540 
90 here like I said I made this all
pretty<00:03:33.080> easy<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.380> take<00:03:33.530> apart<00:03:33.650> in<00:03:34.100> case<00:03:34.310> it

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
pretty easy to take apart in case it

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.810 
pretty easy to take apart in case it
needs<00:03:34.580> to<00:03:34.970> be<00:03:35.090> serviced<00:03:35.570> and<00:03:36.260> this<00:03:37.220> here<00:03:37.700> is

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
needs to be serviced and this here is

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.090 
needs to be serviced and this here is
designed<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:38.690> I've<00:03:38.810> come<00:03:38.960> up<00:03:39.110> with<00:03:39.380> for<00:03:39.830> my

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
where the bacteria will live that will

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.040 
where the bacteria will live that will
actually<00:03:45.440> convert<00:03:46.070> the<00:03:46.720> ammonia<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:48.260> the

another piece down here and what I have

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.990 
another piece down here and what I have
here<00:04:33.919> is<00:04:33.980> this<00:04:34.220> would<00:04:34.430> be<00:04:34.520> for<00:04:34.700> the<00:04:34.850> big

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
here is this would be for the big

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.270 
here is this would be for the big
d'bries<00:04:35.360> in<00:04:35.660> case<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:36.050> comes<00:04:36.080> down<00:04:36.470> large<00:04:37.040> and

d'bries in case it comes down large and
it's<00:04:37.370> not<00:04:37.490> broken<00:04:38.120> down<00:04:38.450> enough<00:04:39.250> take<00:04:40.250> it

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
it's not broken down enough take it

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.550 
it's not broken down enough take it

thing<00:04:42.770> down<00:04:42.919> here<00:04:42.980> will<00:04:43.460> be<00:04:43.550> another<00:04:43.820> pieces

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
thing down here will be another pieces

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.840 
thing down here will be another pieces
of<00:04:44.600> polyfill<00:04:45.230> at<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.560> bottom<00:04:46.040> of<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.700> all

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
of polyfill at the bottom of the all

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.300 
of polyfill at the bottom of the all
this<00:04:47.150> chamber<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:48.140> all<00:04:48.650> that<00:04:48.830> is<00:04:49.010> the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
this chamber and all that is the

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.190 
this chamber and all that is the
polishes<00:04:49.880> that<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:50.270> water<00:04:50.480> comes<00:04:50.720> back<00:04:50.960> as

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
polishes that the water comes back as

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.090 
polishes that the water comes back as
clean<00:04:51.440> as<00:04:51.560> possible<00:04:51.590> for<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.370> fish

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.710 

might<00:04:56.100> have<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.310> valve<00:04:57.090> here<00:04:57.240> that<00:04:57.570> I<00:04:57.660> can

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
might have a valve here that I can

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.310 
might have a valve here that I can
prolly<00:04:58.140> the<00:04:58.680> flow<00:04:59.250> down<00:04:59.580> or<00:05:00.030> up<00:05:00.540> if<00:05:00.900> I<00:05:01.020> want<00:05:01.260> to

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
prolly the flow down or up if I want to

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.070 
prolly the flow down or up if I want to
just<00:05:01.860> go<00:05:02.700> put<00:05:02.880> it<00:05:02.910> back<00:05:03.000> up<00:05:03.390> here<00:05:03.750> and<00:05:03.930> that

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
just go put it back up here and that

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.020 
just go put it back up here and that
would<00:05:04.260> actually<00:05:04.440> drain<00:05:04.890> down<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.640> water

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
would actually drain down the water

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.870 
would actually drain down the water
reservoir<00:05:07.190> look<00:05:08.190> like<00:05:08.370> it<00:05:08.490> was<00:05:08.550> a<00:05:08.610> little<00:05:08.730> bit

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
reservoir look like it was a little bit

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.460 
reservoir look like it was a little bit
higher<00:05:09.060> there<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.450> begin<00:05:09.600> with<00:05:09.750> we'll<00:05:10.320> just

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
higher there to begin with we'll just

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.190 
higher there to begin with we'll just
take<00:05:10.590> that<00:05:10.740> right<00:05:10.920> back<00:05:11.100> down<00:05:12.020> this<00:05:13.020> will

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
take that right back down this will

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.840 
take that right back down this will
probably<00:05:13.410> go<00:05:13.530> down<00:05:13.680> as<00:05:14.250> you<00:05:14.400> can<00:05:14.520> see<00:05:14.760> it

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
probably go down as you can see it

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.560 
probably go down as you can see it
flowing<00:05:15.360> here<00:05:16.730> probably<00:05:17.730> come<00:05:17.850> down<00:05:17.880> to<00:05:18.360> about

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
flowing here probably come down to about

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.860 
flowing here probably come down to about
maybe<00:05:18.780> half<00:05:19.230> inch<00:05:19.560> on<00:05:20.280> this<00:05:20.580> side<00:05:20.910> and<00:05:21.630> once

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
maybe half inch on this side and once

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.270 
maybe half inch on this side and once
that<00:05:21.930> drains<00:05:22.260> down<00:05:22.530> a<00:05:22.590> little<00:05:22.860> bit<00:05:23.010> it'll<00:05:23.160> be

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
that drains down a little bit it'll be

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.090 
that drains down a little bit it'll be
down<00:05:23.460> to<00:05:23.580> 38<00:05:23.960> but<00:05:24.960> you<00:05:25.110> can<00:05:25.290> adjust<00:05:25.500> whatever

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
down to 38 but you can adjust whatever

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.620 
down to 38 but you can adjust whatever
you<00:05:26.250> want<00:05:26.460> there<00:05:26.750> which<00:05:27.750> is<00:05:27.780> nice<00:05:29.390> and<00:05:30.390> we're

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
you want there which is nice and we're

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.360 
you want there which is nice and we're
providing<00:05:30.930> plenty<00:05:31.380> of<00:05:32.840> oxygens<00:05:33.840> being

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
providing plenty of oxygens being

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.020 
providing plenty of oxygens being
oxygenated<00:05:35.370> for<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.700> fish<00:05:36.270> which<00:05:36.870> is<00:05:37.020> great

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
oxygenated for the fish which is great

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.909 
oxygenated for the fish which is great
and<00:05:39.030> I<00:05:39.900> think<00:05:40.169> it's<00:05:40.290> going<00:05:40.350> to<00:05:40.470> work<00:05:40.590> out<00:05:40.710> good

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919
