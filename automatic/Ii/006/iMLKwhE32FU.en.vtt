00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
for a little bit now and it's just

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.200 
for a little bit now and it's just
normal<00:00:13.500> operation<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.340> fairly<00:00:14.580> smoothly<00:00:15.030> a

much evidence of any lag or slow down so

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.400 
much evidence of any lag or slow down so
far<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.239> I've<00:00:36.420> been<00:00:36.570> checking<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.020> out<00:00:37.110> so

far that I've been checking it out so

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.680 
far that I've been checking it out so
let's<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.800> run<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> first<00:00:38.520> test<00:00:38.820> here<00:00:39.120> let's

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
let's just run the first test here let's

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.510 
let's just run the first test here let's
run<00:00:39.870> quadrant<00:00:40.559> see<00:00:40.770> what<00:00:40.950> kind<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.190> numbers

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
run quadrant see what kind of numbers

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.090 
run quadrant see what kind of numbers
the<00:00:41.790> numbers<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.540> put<00:00:42.719> up<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.100> we're

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the numbers going to put up and we're

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.470 
the numbers going to put up and we're
going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.340> wait<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.820> after<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.270> we'll

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
going to wait for that after this we'll

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
going to wait for that after this we'll
run<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> second<00:00:46.230> test<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.770> just<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.100> make

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
run the second test of it just to make

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.549 
run the second test of it just to make
sure<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.520> gets<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> st.<00:00:48.420> alley<00:00:48.690> again<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
sure it gets to the st. alley again and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.889 
sure it gets to the st. alley again and
we'll<00:00:49.680> run<00:00:49.890> an<00:00:50.039> alternative<00:00:50.789> benchmark<00:00:51.570> test

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
we'll run an alternative benchmark test

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.100 
we'll run an alternative benchmark test
with<00:00:52.469> ambient<00:00:53.039> T<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.430> benchmark<00:00:53.969> app<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.989> as

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
one here's running a roughly around 40

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.689 
one here's running a roughly around 40
frames<00:01:01.020> per<00:01:01.289> second<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> average<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.640> you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
frames per second on the average and you

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.429 
frames per second on the average and you
can<00:01:02.850> tell<00:01:03.000> when<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.210> turns<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.600> corners<00:01:03.989> it's

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
can tell when it turns the corners it's

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.109 
can tell when it turns the corners it's
not<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.040> much<00:01:05.309> lag<00:01:05.580> or<00:01:05.790> slow<00:01:06.090> down

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
not that not that much lag or slow down

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.600 
not that not that much lag or slow down
with<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.860> it's<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> wait<00:01:08.220> for<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.490> one

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
with it it's going to wait for this one

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.840 
with it it's going to wait for this one
to<00:01:08.670> complete<00:01:09.119> an<00:01:09.689> X<00:01:09.990> graphical<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.830> test<00:01:11.549> here

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
to complete an X graphical the test here

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.149 
to complete an X graphical the test here
it's<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> show<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.590> putting

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
it's going to show up and it's putting

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.249 
it's going to show up and it's putting
in<00:01:14.340> roughly<00:01:14.640> around<00:01:14.760> 60<00:01:15.330> frames<00:01:15.600> per<00:01:15.689> second

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
in roughly around 60 frames per second

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.320 
in roughly around 60 frames per second
so<00:01:16.710> definitely<00:01:17.009> nice<00:01:17.220> smooth<00:01:17.610> movements<00:01:18.180> and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
so definitely nice smooth movements and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.580 
so definitely nice smooth movements and
of<00:01:18.390> course<00:01:18.600> your<00:01:18.780> game<00:01:18.930> shouldn't<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.380> too

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
of course your game shouldn't be too

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.260 
of course your game shouldn't be too
much<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.920> problem<00:01:20.159> with<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.610> device<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
much of a problem with this device and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.020 
much of a problem with this device and
the<00:01:21.750> last<00:01:21.930> graphical<00:01:22.439> tests<00:01:22.860> here<00:01:23.100> running

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the last graphical tests here running

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.950 
the last graphical tests here running
roughly<00:01:24.479> around<00:01:25.009> 26<00:01:26.009> 25<00:01:27.000> frames<00:01:27.270> per<00:01:27.420> second

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
roughly around 26 25 frames per second

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.160 
roughly around 26 25 frames per second
so<00:01:28.110> here's<00:01:28.380> here's<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.009> result<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:30.960> looks

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
so here's here's the result and it looks

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.679 
so here's here's the result and it looks
like<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.409> put<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.829> score<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.270> 2043<00:01:33.270> and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
like it put in a score of 2043 and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
of course still might not hit the more

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.870 
of course still might not hit the more
except<00:01:52.200> by<00:01:52.380> some<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.799> top<00:01:53.399> tiered

so<00:02:22.780> that's<00:02:22.959> pretty<00:02:23.260> nice<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.980> fluid<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.550> last

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
so that's pretty nice and fluid and last

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.110 
so that's pretty nice and fluid and last
one<00:02:25.480> roughly<00:02:26.260> around<00:02:26.380> like<00:02:27.010> 25<00:02:27.670> on<00:02:28.060> the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
one roughly around like 25 on the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.930 
one roughly around like 25 on the
average<00:02:28.650> it's<00:02:29.650> going<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.830> finish<00:02:30.130> up<00:02:30.459> here<00:02:30.700> so

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
average it's going to finish up here so

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.760 
average it's going to finish up here so
let's<00:02:31.120> take<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.330> look<00:02:31.569> at<00:02:31.630> this<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:35.560> looks<00:02:35.739> like

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
let's take a look at this so looks like

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.559 
let's take a look at this so looks like
this<00:02:36.040> time<00:02:36.220> around<00:02:36.370> they<00:02:36.730> put<00:02:36.940> in<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.300> lot

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569
