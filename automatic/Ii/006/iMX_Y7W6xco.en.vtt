00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
did a few rocks here and then

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.140 
did a few rocks here and then
specifically<00:00:13.320> where<00:00:14.010> these<00:00:14.309> snake<00:00:14.820> plant

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.109 
in place as a benefit right here I made
a<00:00:20.760> bit<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.240> structure<00:00:21.960> kind<00:00:22.679> of<00:00:22.859> easy<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:24.060> I

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
a bit of a structure kind of easy but I

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.579 
a bit of a structure kind of easy but I
wanted<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.419> show<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.599> before<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.050> put<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.380> top

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:25.589 
wanted to show you before I put the top

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.009 
wanted to show you before I put the top

good it breaks down really easily and
just<00:00:38.190> puts<00:00:38.490> crap<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> soil<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.200> yeah

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
just puts crap in the soil so yeah

I take this piece here and place it on

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:23.930 
I take this piece here and place it on
top<00:01:21.920> just<00:01:22.920> till<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> right

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
top just till we can get the right

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.370 
top just till we can get the right
consistency<00:01:25.760> it's<00:01:26.760> firm<00:01:28.010> there<00:01:29.010> we<00:01:29.130> go<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:31.229> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
consistency it's firm there we go so you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
consistency it's firm there we go so you
got<00:01:31.650> kind<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.190> a<00:01:32.220> little<00:01:32.430> hideout<00:01:32.760> cave

and<00:03:07.810> still<00:03:08.080> growing<00:03:08.610> readily<00:03:09.610> will<00:03:10.180> need<00:03:10.420> food

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
and still growing readily will need food

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.650 
and still growing readily will need food
more<00:03:11.080> often<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.800> we'll<00:03:12.520> take<00:03:13.120> that<00:03:13.330> and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
more often and we'll take that and

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.390 
more often and we'll take that and
taking<00:03:14.200> those<00:03:14.260> nutrients<00:03:14.740> much<00:03:14.920> better<00:03:15.220> than

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
taking those nutrients much better than

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.730 
taking those nutrients much better than
an<00:03:15.520> adult<00:03:15.820> so<00:03:16.600> you<00:03:16.630> can<00:03:16.900> be<00:03:17.020> feeding<00:03:17.290> your

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
twice weekly and that's more than enough

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.450

adult so that you can see space between

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.190 
adult so that you can see space between
like<00:03:45.970> it<00:03:46.090> looks<00:03:46.270> like<00:03:46.390> your<00:03:46.570> school<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.020> very

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
like it looks like your school is very

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.740 
like it looks like your school is very
fat<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.770> you<00:03:48.520> know<00:03:48.910> your<00:03:49.060> scorpion<00:03:49.450> isn't<00:03:49.660> an

fat and you know your scorpion isn't an
adult<00:03:50.080> then<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:50.530> might<00:03:50.710> want<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:50.980> slow<00:03:51.220> down

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
adult then you might want to slow down

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.040 
adult then you might want to slow down
on<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.760> feeding<00:03:52.120> because<00:03:52.210> that<00:03:52.600> means<00:03:52.750> that

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
on the feeding because that means that

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.740 
on the feeding because that means that
your<00:03:53.260> scorpions<00:03:53.800> eating<00:03:54.070> of<00:03:54.190> it<00:03:54.370> too<00:03:54.580> much<00:03:54.790> all
