00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
got to come to a complete stop that is

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.050 
got to come to a complete stop that is
slow

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
stops and then puts it in gear and goes

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.540 
stops and then puts it in gear and goes
he's<00:02:06.020> right<00:02:06.170> but<00:02:06.320> he<00:02:06.410> did<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.770> came<00:02:06.890> almost

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
to a stop just slowed down like he came

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.860 
to a stop just slowed down like he came
to<00:02:10.550> first<00:02:10.729> gear<00:02:10.970> but<00:02:11.150> he<00:02:11.180> did<00:02:11.330> not<00:02:11.450> come<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.810> a
