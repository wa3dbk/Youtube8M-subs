00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
it to jump to clay because i want it

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.270 
it to jump to clay because i want it
just<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.579> zoom<00:03:16.970> in<00:03:17.180> slowly<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:18.379> to<00:03:18.620> do<00:03:18.769> this<00:03:18.949> if

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
just to zoom in slowly and to do this if

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.759 
just to zoom in slowly and to do this if
i<00:03:19.639> highlight<00:03:19.819> all<00:03:20.209> of<00:03:20.239> these<00:03:20.510> here<00:03:20.840> by

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
i highlight all of these here by

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.849 
i highlight all of these here by
left-clicking<00:03:22.069> and<00:03:22.430> dragging<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:24.410> set<00:03:24.739> all

those<00:03:25.129> where<00:03:25.609> it<00:03:25.669> says<00:03:25.819> step<00:03:26.560> step<00:03:27.560> means<00:03:27.829> it<00:03:27.980> a

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
those where it says step step means it a

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.069 
those where it says step step means it a
jump<00:03:28.280> from<00:03:28.639> one<00:03:28.730> between<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.120> other<00:03:29.239> we<00:03:29.900> want

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
jump from one between the other we want

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.890 
jump from one between the other we want
linear<00:03:30.790> okay<00:03:31.790> if<00:03:31.940> we<00:03:32.060> watch<00:03:32.209> this<00:03:32.389> again<00:03:34.900> it's

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
linear okay if we watch this again it's

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.860 
linear okay if we watch this again it's
slowly<00:03:36.319> pans<00:03:37.030> before<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.090> switches<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.449> camera

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
slowly pans before it switches to camera

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.740 
slowly pans before it switches to camera
two<00:03:39.069> okay<00:03:40.069> the<00:03:40.940> reason<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.299> can't<00:03:41.510> see<00:03:41.659> the

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
two okay the reason you can't see the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.420 
two okay the reason you can't see the
switch<00:03:41.989> is<00:03:42.409> because<00:03:42.799> it's<00:03:42.919> not<00:03:43.040> an<00:03:43.159> active

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
switch is because it's not an active

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.280 
switch is because it's not an active
camera<00:03:43.669> photo<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.269> active<00:03:44.629> camera<00:03:44.870> you'll<00:03:45.109> see

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
camera photo I active camera you'll see

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.099 
camera photo I active camera you'll see
the<00:03:45.409> switch<00:03:45.620> to<00:03:45.769> come<00:03:45.919> up<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.629> so<00:03:47.629> I<00:03:47.690> suppose<00:03:47.930> go

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
the switch to come up to so I suppose go

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.770 
the switch to come up to so I suppose go
look<00:03:48.260> like<00:03:48.409> in<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.620> cutscene<00:03:49.030> okay<00:03:50.030> it's

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
look like in the cutscene okay it's

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.979 
look like in the cutscene okay it's
camera<00:03:51.379> to<00:03:51.530> there<00:03:52.090> so<00:03:53.090> this<00:03:53.209> video<00:03:53.569> we<00:03:53.720> covered

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
camera to there so this video we covered

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.949 
camera to there so this video we covered
how<00:03:54.019> to<00:03:54.139> pan<00:03:54.440> cameras<00:03:54.909> actually<00:03:55.909> before<00:03:56.569> I<00:03:56.750> go

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
how to pan cameras actually before I go

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.920 
how to pan cameras actually before I go
I'll<00:03:57.229> see<00:03:57.680> another<00:03:57.889> thing<00:03:58.629> just<00:03:59.629> so<00:03:59.750> you<00:03:59.810> why

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
I'll see another thing just so you why

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:03.409 
pan there you wanted to go across to

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.890 
pan there you wanted to go across to
this<00:04:03.530> angle<00:04:04.000> right<00:04:05.000> for<00:04:05.389> some<00:04:05.540> strange<00:04:05.720> reason

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
this angle right for some strange reason

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.830 
this angle right for some strange reason
who<00:04:06.680> knows<00:04:06.859> so<00:04:07.549> I<00:04:07.579> click<00:04:07.790> on<00:04:07.909> 50<00:04:08.299> right<00:04:08.690> in<00:04:08.780> the

key selection again and I'll click
linear<00:04:16.039> and<00:04:16.449> we<00:04:17.449> watch<00:04:17.630> again<00:04:17.930> see<00:04:18.169> what

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
linear and we watch again see what

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.420
