00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
this I found this it is an authentic

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.950 
this I found this it is an authentic
Disney<00:00:28.740> vintage<00:00:29.429> shirt<00:00:29.939> it's<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> crawl

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
Disney vintage shirt it's like a crawl

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.090 
Disney vintage shirt it's like a crawl
as<00:00:31.250> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.399> see<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.669> check<00:00:33.149> out<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:34.590> neckline

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
as you can see I check out the neckline

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.220 
as you can see I check out the neckline
because<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.610> was<00:00:35.730> kind<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.090> choking<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.079> it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
because it was kind of choking and it

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.160 
because it was kind of choking and it
said<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:37.649> size<00:00:37.920> fits<00:00:38.340> all<00:00:38.840> not<00:00:39.840> around<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
said one size fits all not around the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.889 
said one size fits all not around the
neck<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.770> doesn't<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.780> made

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
neck it doesn't so I have to do I made

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.470 
neck it doesn't so I have to do I made
it<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.260> cut<00:00:43.440> off<00:00:43.620> I'm<00:00:44.370> probably<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:45.000> why<00:00:45.180> where

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
it a cut off I'm probably like why where

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.150 
it a cut off I'm probably like why where
it's<00:00:45.870> gonna<00:00:45.960> probably<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.500> off<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.800> shoulder

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
it's gonna probably be off the shoulder

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160 
it's gonna probably be off the shoulder
and<00:00:47.910> i'll<00:00:48.090> probably<00:00:48.360> roll<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.020> sleeves

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and i'll probably roll the sleeves

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.639 
and i'll probably roll the sleeves
because<00:00:49.559> they're<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> little<00:00:50.309> long<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
because they're a little long for the

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.099 
because they're a little long for the
low<00:00:52.649> neckline<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.800> yesterday<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:57.360> went<00:00:57.570> over
