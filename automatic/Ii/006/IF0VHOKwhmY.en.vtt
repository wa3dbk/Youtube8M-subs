00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 welcome to a new video a machine 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.470
 of stuffed animals or also called machine 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.840
 the claw is a type of arcade game 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.080
 which consists of guiding a small claw 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.660
 metal or plastic to get 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.510
 a stuffed animal or some other gift that 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.460
 find the majority of 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.189
 those who watch this video have played at 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.140
 less once in your life there are 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.390
 fortunate people who have achieved 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.260
 get the stuffed animal they want but the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.829
 another 99% and I include us has beaten that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.030
 gift machine 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.430
 in this video I will mention 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.140
 the hidden secret of the machine 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.040
 teddies 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.040
 let's start 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.490
 after taking a look at the 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.800
 instruction manuals of some 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.340
 machines a writer found a 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.620
 terrible discovery the machine takes 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.620
 things only when it's profitable 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.820
 the success rate to win a prize 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.950
 It depends on several factors including 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.110
 the operator settings the skill 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.320
 of the player the type of machine and 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.820
 prizes available a prize can 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.159
 get lost due to the lack of 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.869
 Player experience manipulation 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.140
 and weakness of the claw or the 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.700
 Specific crane configuration 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.770
 all modern war machines 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.350
 incorporate some means for the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.149
 owner can adjust at least the 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.310
 grip strength of the claw so 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.119
 General with mechanism screws or 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.119
 potentiometers 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.320
 in this video I will explain why 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.430
 many of us fail in the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.130
 machine 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.080
 in an experiment conducted they opened to 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.450
 the machine to see the content there 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.450
 in it and be able to discover why 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.490
 we lose repeatedly to 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.590
 remove the metal part of the machine 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.200
 the one in charge of controlling the crane 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.620
 the presenter could notice the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.280
 terrible secret they hide found what 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.780
 that he called a pressure pump 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.970
 basically what makes this pump is 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.950
 reduce the grip strength that the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.890
 claw when you the guides to take a 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.780
 gift to prove that the bomb was 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.540
 the cause of the loss of so many 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.510
 prizes from players 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.610
 decided to increase the pump pressure 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.680
 as expected after changing 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.590
 the pressure for the claw to have more 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.560
 strength this claw could lift up a 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.390
 kilogram of weight the conclusion to which 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.670
 arrived was that if the pressure is high 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.820
 will lift up to almost a kilogram and 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.709
 medium weight but if the pressure is low 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.709
 it's almost impossible to win something 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.960
 now I will mention some data 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:03.100
 curious about this machine 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.710
 in the year 1955 they were banned as 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.740
 game machines 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.230
 in china the machines store in addition 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.530
 of gifts national cigarettes and 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.410
 foreign 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.990
 also in some supermarkets you can 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.550
 win in the machine rabbits or lobsters 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:26.000
 that can be eaten by the winner 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.160
 in April 2014 a child under 3 years 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.190
 was reported by his mother as 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.800
 disappeared after she left 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.250
 of taking a shower he realized that his 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.870
 son was not in the apartment 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.450
 called the police to report the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.160
 event and in a short time they found it 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.320
 inside a machine to be eyes 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.320
 playing thanks to an employee 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.320
 reported what they could not explain is 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.630
 how it got there inside although a 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.540
 probability is that it has entered by the 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.480
 prize grid 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.000
 something similar happened in Russia when 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.010
 some young people take a video trying 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.239
 take a cat out of a machine 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.239
 stuffed animals it is possible to win a prize 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.090
 up twice in a row though then 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.729
 you have to wait 80 games for 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.919
 win again someone because some 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.380
 Other machines are programmed to 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.650
 win when they already have enough money 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.680
 won 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.900
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.800
 so understand a little more why 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.780
 we lose so often in those machines 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.820
 although for us it seems a bit bad 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.800
 I like the people who have a 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.039
 machine these get good 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.620
 gains from them if they are currently 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:47.680
 disappearing in some places you know 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.990
 the reason you can leave me a comment 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.040
 with your experience in the machine 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.340
 teddies 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:58.400
 I thank Darwin for the idea for 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.860
 make this video if you want to visit your 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.930
 I'll leave you the channel in the description upload 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.330
 very interesting videos 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.940
 I like it and share what it is 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.009
 It helps me improve I leave my networks 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.009
 social in the description to be 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.900
 attentive when upload a new video here 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.910
 I leave the previous videos for you 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.009
 see them just click or click 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.490
 look for them in the description if you're 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.810
 watching the video from your cell phone 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.810
 subscribe to the button above or in 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.169
 the one below we'll see you next friday 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:34.160
 and on Sunday with a new video goodbye 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.160
 take care
