 hello everyone I'm 9 mm from oquendo and in my first videos jare 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:09.020
 the review of several weapons today I'll start with the 36 kg h we begin 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:13.669
 by the way I hired diego and juan to help me in the videos 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:18.400
 the eclectic chauffeur 36 is a 5-caliber assault rifle 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.110
 56 x 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.120
 45 mm NATO designed by the German cleric Chen over the years 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.470
 90 as a substitute for g3 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.610
 is the regulatory rifle of the second is since 1995 and forces 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.610
 armed of Spain since 1999 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.580
 It is also used by the Lithuanian Army since 2007 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.130
 It is also used by a large number of special operations units of 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.650
 different countries 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.500
 my turn 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.940
 well let's go with the history of this weapon 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.490
 the assault rifle hk g36 was born in the 1990s when the bundeswehr 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.050
 commissioned the arms manufacturer heckler &amp; koch to develop a new system 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.920
 of weapon to replace the service rifle of the armed forces of 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.400
 germany since the 1950s and he clerre car 3 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.530
 this fact occurred after the previous designs of rich klee the 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.560
 revolutionary that the herriko etxea 11 and the more conventional clericó clash 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.470
 41 were both rejected in the 1980s 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.920
 instead of starting from scratch with a totally new design the engineers 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.490
 of rich chili led by the young to the magicians and of arrogance early 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.780
 the 1990s what inside the company was known as hk 50 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.460
 the one that subsequently 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.430
 once it was accepted into the military market the bundeswehr named it as 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.050
 g36 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.650
 for his new 50 htc 50 projects the company borrowed 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.230
 characteristics of a variety of older designs and added some 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.420
 innovations led by experience with previous designs hk 36 h 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.290
 cadet 70 and hkg 11 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.010
 The firing system is more similar to that of Mali Tear 18 using a system 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.110
 Automatic recharge with recoil gas-cut gun 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.469
 but rotary johnson / stoner 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:13.349
 while the 18 arq that made him a conventional piston and iron bars 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.639
 valencia and is that 36 used a piston with rings similar to the m16 rifle and 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.439
 only a guide bar 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.999
 soul design 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:26.880
 the rifle fires the standard cartridge otan 5 56 x 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.290
 45 millimeters with a maximum rate of 750 rounds per minute 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.140
 can also fire in semi-automatic mode in rafáh for which 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.609
 has a selector lever on the trigger 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:45.229
 the firing mechanism is operated by the gas with a rotary bolt in 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:49.739
 Once the retard roller system makes used semirigid red 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.619
 previously by hkm the Czech g3 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:56.039
 This rifle uses a short-stroke gas piston system 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.560
 that keep the cash drawer very clean and free of jamming 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.950
 2 making the rifle capable of firing tens of thousands of cartridges without 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.079
 clean it 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.680
 this is a contrast with the complicated m16 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.519
 that caused many failures in its early years and still today requires 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.650
 meticulous cleaning to work reliably 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:18.859
 variants 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:24.049
 the cep 36 has four different main versions that share the 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.049
 same body and differ only in the weight and length of the barrel and 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.139
 saves hand 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:29.889
 also 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.189
 For every three of the versions there is an export variant before 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.669
 called b now v 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.629

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.279
 main version 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:44.339
 can shoot NATO standard rifle grenades and take a vita mentto 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:48.099
 next to the pay more to attach a bayonet knife 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.719
 you can also use the 100 beta projectiles cemag the bipod 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.489
 originally designed for mg 36 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.319
 there is also a modified handguard for coupling grenade launchers 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.859

 carbine version 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:20.780
 it differs from jet 36 in that they have the shorter gun and handguard 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:25.880
 the length of the barrel is 318 millimeters with the stock folded its 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:29.069
 Total length is 615 millimeters 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:33.180
 what makes it appropriate to act in both closed spaces and 

00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:35.169
 inside vehicles 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.919

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.250

 56 millimeters of shorter serial production to date 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:14.669
 Its size makes it especially suitable for operations in spaces 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.089
 reduced or any other application where a powerful weapon is required and 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:20.529
