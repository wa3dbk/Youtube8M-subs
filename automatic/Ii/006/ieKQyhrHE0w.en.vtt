from<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.289> App<00:00:22.410> Store<00:00:22.439> we're<00:00:22.980> going<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.160> go

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
from the App Store we're going to go

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.620 
from the App Store we're going to go
ahead<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.490> launch<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.880> was<00:00:24.180> one<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.480> looks

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
ahead and launch it was one that looks

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.540 
ahead and launch it was one that looks
like<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.869> podium<00:00:25.260> over<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:25.800> first

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
like the podium over here first

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.220 
like the podium over here first
important<00:00:26.970> tip<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.390> turn<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.960> sideways

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
important tip is to turn it sideways

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.169 
important tip is to turn it sideways
because<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.949> doesn't<00:00:29.279> work<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> other<00:00:29.970> way

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
because it doesn't work in the other way

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.209 
because it doesn't work in the other way
so<00:00:30.900> here<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.140> turn<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.410> upside<00:00:31.679> down<00:00:31.710> doesn't

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
so here we turn it upside down doesn't

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.430 
so here we turn it upside down doesn't
matter<00:00:32.340> machine<00:00:33.090> knows<00:00:33.270> which<00:00:33.420> way<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.630> go<00:00:33.719> all

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
matter machine knows which way to go all

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.490 
matter machine knows which way to go all
right<00:00:34.590> another<00:00:35.460> tip<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.510> do<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.050> go<00:00:37.200> from<00:00:37.380> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
right another tip is to do it go from a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.610 
right another tip is to do it go from a
new<00:00:37.680> presentation<00:00:38.930> important<00:00:39.930> unless<00:00:40.079> you're

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
new presentation important unless you're

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.290 
new presentation important unless you're
really<00:00:40.829> good<00:00:41.219> with<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.550> choosing<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.210> of

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
really good with it choosing one of

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.830 
really good with it choosing one of
these<00:00:42.390> pre-done<00:00:43.379> templates<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.370> awesome<00:00:45.300> so

photo<00:01:04.589> libraries<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.610> what<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.210> is

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
photo libraries so what I like to do is

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.789 
photo libraries so what I like to do is
that<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.570> I'm<00:01:06.659> working<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.049> project<00:01:07.350> I'll

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799

using<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.380> project<00:01:10.680> into<00:01:11.310> its<00:01:11.460> own

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
using for that project into its own

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.310 
using for that project into its own
library<00:01:12.210> all<00:01:12.750> right<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:12.990> let's<00:01:13.080> say<00:01:13.229> we're

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
library all right so let's say we're

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.539 
library all right so let's say we're
going<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.500> use<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> saved<00:01:13.950> photos<00:01:14.220> because

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
going to use the saved photos because

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.950 
going to use the saved photos because
we've<00:01:14.700> been<00:01:14.729> working<00:01:14.909> with<00:01:15.060> those<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.689> we're

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
we've been working with those and we're

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.690 
we've been working with those and we're
going<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.110> use<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> map<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.799> our<00:01:16.890> location<00:01:17.070> there

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
going to use a map of our location there

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.330 
going to use a map of our location there
it<00:01:17.939> simply<00:01:18.630> replaces<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.380> now<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.890> notice<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it simply replaces it now you notice the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.249 
it simply replaces it now you notice the
dragon<00:01:20.700> drops<00:01:20.939> here<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.420> little<00:01:21.540> dots<00:01:21.869> I'm

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
dragon drops here the little dots I'm

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.230 
dragon drops here the little dots I'm
going<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.770> make<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.070> little<00:01:23.159> bit<00:01:23.310> bigger<00:01:23.520> I'm

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
going to make it a little bit bigger I'm

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.850 
going to make it a little bit bigger I'm
going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> take<00:01:24.780> my<00:01:24.960> two<00:01:25.020> fingers<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.530> I'm

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
going to take my two fingers and I'm

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.920 
going to take my two fingers and I'm
going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.490> squeeze<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.030> whole<00:01:27.360> thing<00:01:27.390> down

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
going to squeeze it the whole thing down

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.109 
going to squeeze it the whole thing down
just<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.439> bit<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.950> I'm<00:01:29.640> going<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> trim

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
just a little bit and I'm going to trim

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.060 
just a little bit and I'm going to trim
it<00:01:30.270> right<00:01:30.479> over<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.290> notice<00:01:31.650> it's

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
it right over here and you notice it's

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.410 
it right over here and you notice it's
going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> want<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.520> come<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.329> to
