that<00:00:34.950> there<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> 3d<00:00:35.820> option<00:00:36.480> available<00:00:36.600> in

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
that there is a 3d option available in

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.290 
that there is a 3d option available in
fact<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.040> model<00:00:38.250> I've<00:00:38.460> got<00:00:38.700> with<00:00:38.910> me<00:00:38.940> right

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
fact the model I've got with me right

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.979 
fact the model I've got with me right
here<00:00:39.660> includes<00:00:40.290> 3d<00:00:40.800> capability<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.149> am

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
here includes 3d capability so I am

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.240 
here includes 3d capability so I am
definitely<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.710> show<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.950> more<00:00:44.129> about

that in just a little bit alright when
it<00:00:48.300> comes<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.690> measuring<00:00:48.899> system<00:00:49.469> performance

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
it comes to measuring system performance

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.670 
it comes to measuring system performance
it<00:00:50.309> all<00:00:50.489> starts<00:00:50.910> with<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> processor<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
it all starts with the processor and the
