 the outer packaging consists of one 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.130
 solid plastic box the way we like it 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.800
 city ​​council want to be shatterproof stable 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.910
 and valued within, we find the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 headphones on a device 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.090
 so they are placed from the outside 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.040
 are very well recognizable 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.870
 continues to be on the opposite 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.219
 side a black box present in the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.829

 among other things, tatra dws delivers essays

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.539
 Help with the first establishment 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.879
 We also have an individual

 the wearing comfort of the headphones again 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.270
 increase 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.239
 but I will go the same one again 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.700
 The jobs are at first and second 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.229
 look very taller than comparable ones 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.760
 competitive products but what 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.680
 surprisingly do not wear 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.439
 Striking the actual housing is to 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.670
 large part made of aluminum 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.680
 accordingly very valuable and with 910 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.090
 gramm also very easy in the left 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.280
 housing we find among other things one 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.229
 LED display the information about us 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.119

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.250
 possibilities to load headphones 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.070
 Just run back the lid and 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.570
 via micro USB cable and the pc mac 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.430
 or notebook 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.320

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.240
 headphones loaded at 100 percent 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.680
 In addition, the headphones are small 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.030
 magnets are installed so that they are together 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.590
 can be plugged 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.390
 This turns the headphones into the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.939
 standby added what by the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.740
 flashing the led is shown chakra 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.399
 gives a standby time of up to 18 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.049
 days 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.579
 if you disconnect the headphones so the flashing

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.759
 ready for use 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.619
 The audio cable is flat web based 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.540
 made by knotted 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.979
 and, moreover, kessler reinforced on the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.200
 on the right side of the band we find the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.760
 Remote control, on the one hand the nfc chip 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.310
 has overseen to another 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.140
 There are three buttons for each button 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.670
 provided with several features over the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.990
 not only the quieter key can do it 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.700
 be regulated volume 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.350
 once the user has two seconds up 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.840
 the corresponding key is pressed 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.790
 title forward or back there are with the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.110
 middle button so the multifunction 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.970
 button can the user calls 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.980
 receive or invite 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.870
 happen or continue 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.700
 here if it were now only a 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.560
 Overall, the small listing can be 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.250
 User 11 function with all buttons 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.410
 To run 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.180
 but before you get the box because it is in full 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.040
 You can use the headset 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.110
 first with your smartphone or tablet 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.880
 be coupled if the device over 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.560
 nfc you have only the 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.450
 remote control to the back of your 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.240
 keep smartphones and after a few 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.320
 in seconds both devices are paired 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.360
 Alternatively you can use the headset 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.460
 bluetooth connect to that and the 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.320
 Press the function key five seconds and 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.630
 looking for the headphones through the smartphone 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.440
 finished the most important thing with headphones 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.209
 are the sound and the 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.680
 wearing properties allow the rox 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.810
 should wireless sit properly the 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.250
 Try some essays with them 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.170
 sit well in the auditory canal and not 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.840
 slip out best you catch it 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.950
 with the middle on 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.170
 In addition, offers about the possibility 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.420
 to equip the rox wireless with ios 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.370
 By the way, small rubber wings are the 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.770
 related to the actual stud earrings 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.600
 will sit by the curved wing 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.769
 the celebration of the perfect in the ear and 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.140
 slip even with strong 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.150
 Do not shake the sound of the head 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.190
 box was is very good both 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.320
 in the middle as well as in the heights come clear and 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.670
 strong over the pass must the user 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.230
 However, accept cuts 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.480
 Here I would be due to the big ones 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.980
 design is expected a bit more but it is 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.700
 OK 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.459
 Alternatively, the use is recommended 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.980
 an equalizer sum in the middle or 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.019
 has better offers to vote 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.700
 also a own sound app to the music 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.160
 can go out of local folders again 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.019
 local does not mean of spotify too 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.400
 not offline but really only music 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.350
 the one on the smartphone is the one 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.200
 Operation is very easy music at over 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.459
 the title of the one in Brittany or also 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.170
 the old ones are visited 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.820
 Furthermore, there is the possibility dolby 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.980
 turn on and the music playback 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.230
 to adjust via an equalizer 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.209
 altogether opera mini rocks offers 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.100
 It's a great overall package, too 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.140
 the headphones with around 130 euros 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.970
 slammed by the sound are the 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.160
 things really great and especially for 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.810
 the sport suitable 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.610
 reason of the bluetooth characteristics tree 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.010
 and no annoying cable on the body round 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.480
 and the service can be so 100 on the 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.880
 remote control be made 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.530
 Personally, I'm missing something different 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.670
 however, by an equalizer something 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.710
 can be compensated 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.690
 Currently the checkbox is mine 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.770
 first choice when jogging respectively 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.840
 doing sport 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.220
 that's it with the test of chip socs 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.360
 Thank you so much for your wireless 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.130
 I was natural 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.080
 happy if they subscribe to our channel 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.430
 or a comment too 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.430
 Leaving the video makes it good
