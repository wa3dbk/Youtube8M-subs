00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
is amazing guys and basically the only

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.850 
is amazing guys and basically the only
difference<00:04:57.970> is<00:04:58.060> that<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.720> red<00:04:59.169> color<00:04:59.410> is<00:04:59.620> blue

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.249 
difference is that the red color is blue
and<00:04:59.889> then<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.490> yellow<00:05:01.210> color<00:05:01.479> is<00:05:01.960> kind<00:05:02.199> of

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 
and then the yellow color is kind of

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.680 
and then the yellow color is kind of
like<00:05:02.349> a<00:05:02.410> gray<00:05:02.740> color<00:05:03.009> so<00:05:03.340> set<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.150> visualize

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
like a gray color so set to visualize
