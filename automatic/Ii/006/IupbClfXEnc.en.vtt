00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.080
 Imagine jumping jumper performances mid-forties can jump 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.680
 loose up to 3 5 tons on this foreleg get in the landing ever 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.169
 after a long time only an example 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.300
 and that is then for me the question if again and again scenes damage 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.689
 For example, back problems occur 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.980
 the cause was negotiated if no 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.650
 then you really have to look for the cause you have to know you blow 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.759
 heat up heads for particles and look together 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.570
 Dec of the main hall and then you can do all the whole symptom chains for yourself 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.360
 list pretty well 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.230
 if you do not have direct 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.630
 she aims to make you feel very young you can already find Salma Hayek there 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.350
 do 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.760
 can you there already 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.270
 Create problems or become causes gg belated if 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.830
 I personally believe that quite a lot of the foundations of these problems 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.050
 in the units are placed on the one hand 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.100
 Safety is the problem we have 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.530
 Lack of time Höchstädt Earth trains fast and is faster on the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.650
 To get market 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.860
 the horses are always high certainly the still fine in the sensitive 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.770
 Topic be ready to perform 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.310
 there are few cases that can not jump insight 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.520
 from the jump simply the landing then limits it 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.540
 that of course starts that you make the training faster and faster 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.479
 APA the problem as the horses we need people to learn Hofmann sport 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.130
 Time for the poorest 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.560
 that means you have one here 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.369
 In the sixties of the seventies, above all, a horse was bought there 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.390
 It has two years of training tilt to a profile 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.450
 the pro had the two years to do this 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.540
 feat by Remo among young more creative Monte 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.010
 the scenes especially for according to JAL students everything again with dementia 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.479
 compares post worlds 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.390
 and to take along the rider and today it is just so that often PD 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.100
 holds 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.049
 Oppenheim must be approached that I can do my sport 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.440
 Heidis meet yes 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.240
 and in my opinion that is way too short to even say the muscles 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.360
 and to develop the muscles for that performance as they need to sound 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.119
 namely 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.009
 a horseman stepped on different then to get a contract on the smallest 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.449
 one should not forget the guys are with 5 6 seven sometimes 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.549
 First edition axes 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.969
 and we ride them mostly with Raich purity sometimes with 4 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.299
 this is still the stroke of luck that they are the events in Volksen's growth 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.789
 it's one again 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:25.450
 a young person of full growth in it is 7 8 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.640
 No, maybe until 13 with the boys 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.539
 bring in the competitive sport 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.649
 the muscles do that, but the bones and ligaments make the com 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:34.119
 Do not lag behind in everything 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.529
 shifted balance of growth 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:40.269
 What was later decided then just to overload my damage 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.639
 According to a lot of foundation stone of pouring the additional costs 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:48.590
 against that means when you have a targeted muscle 8 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.349
 the post office make mistakes 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.509
 what they are missing seventh day could be particularly tough 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.509
 yes I think that you can do something there is the first 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.959
 that the first most important factor for me is he old 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.819
 the fourth need time 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.319
 to feel it my body the problem 1 when they do not carry anyone 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.539
 must be able to put her feet down somewhere that's no problem 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.589
 then the teachers of Thailand have on their feet there can only offer 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:13.139
 occasion 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.419
 Account in front of them scare you but not just someone on top of that 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:17.930
 maybe you can support them 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.949
 in the fright of the action 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.849
 No it's not that we always we are not perfect we can 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.179
 not be in every situation in Thailand 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:28.659
 and the horses have to learn that they need to build Muscle's system 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.349
 That may take time to get to Long Street for example without big ones 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.339
 To learn aids 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:37.849
 I have the step for this tent city trotting four feet I have gallop 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.480
 Four feet of different TAKKT shapes 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.129
 and four bars scares the time in the trot drove the gallop 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.040
 the fourth one has to feel and learn and Bernd the muscles 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.020
 must train 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.510
 on the left hand as on the right hand the so-called bends 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.989
 that means today before the hindquarters of Prof further he ever spoke 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.980
 There is a lot that needs to be done on the hind legs 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.959
 learning foothold plays a foothold game and then out of it 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.690
 it's not muscle training for me between Neuental 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.639
 most crucial 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:10.869
 and there applies 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:13.629
 as with humans, less is more 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.120
 he has to puke intensively already the war of the lawyer rain the 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.180
 Kicker from the rider on top 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.309
 and then he needs to be able to rest around the series 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:27.450
 Reitz Vormann adapt to really come back to the table with the charm 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.230
 to activate the fans and those in the muscle are the splendor of it 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.800
 can provide the performance and only then does muscle growth come in 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.520
 the real meaning behind and their subject we make the mistake 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.990
 are we here too are people the most stressed we all have a lack of time 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.500
 "We all want to reach the best quickly because it's just on time 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.210
 Rent 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.520
 and that's what we know about the plans 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.220
 but the fourth can not get any muscle from her either it will be prompt 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.700
 come tens of times to relax 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.700
 and in the relaxation of the go 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.780
 actually herd animal herd party 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.000
 The white exhausting for this muscle suit too, this one may need 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:07.429
 Time and patience and really picky sits on the balance 8 the money 

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:10.020
 you can do it very well it can also banner every 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.020
 So a little work facts are detected that is not an issue 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.220
 That is why the main big topic is traffic 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.270
 absolutely equal weighted cynical lettering concrete plans 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.990
 that's an interesting mare the zoo made on the last few years of 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.870
 psychologists 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.400
 in peer the psychologists 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.090
 or animal psychologists that used to be thought to be until three 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.740
 years 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.670
 that the biggest problem at risk is the biggest fear being eaten 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.770
 that the predator would come into it it's a classic escape 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.349
 but still in there the herd behavior escape here 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.529
 Family cards nice example 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:46.119
 we have one on the left alone on the further we have a horse alone 

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:49.549
 on the side and nothing else around us and the horses I think 

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:52.759
 pretty relaxed and eat in peace 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.689
 while those who will be eaten after the main engine escape the 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.689
 push here panic because their herd protection is gone they are whole 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:02.879
 alone and eat peacefully and are absolutely top final 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:04.520
 he delivered to the head 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.560
 So one has to think that can not be the biggest fear and 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.240
 biggest fear he really has that for me personally too 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.580
 detected 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.249
 is the fear of losing your balance, that is, falling 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:18.249
 the fear of losing balance on uneven ground 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.400
 not only there 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.910
 as a single animal without the rider on top of it but also club him with the 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.689
 Reiter Open realized that ten years old man loses his traction fear 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:31.759
 can and the best thing is to balance an immediate 1 you have to train 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.369
 In addition, attested the largest you can see then on the track 

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:39.389
 can be extremely oblique of design and anxious the tense they are and 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:41.669
 the less they balance 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:45.499
 the more comes this cooking behavior to reappear a natural one 

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:46.279
 that so 

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:47.430
 Men's Health 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.599
 Amiri MetLife 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:53.110
 under tension runs Basel Performance limit means for the horses 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.469
 then it does not need much anymore »is that it says so beautiful the glass 

00:06:56.469 --> 00:07:00.010
 to overflowing man can exist in the given conditions 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.350
 it is tense but it has eyes everywhere because it usually 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.170
 if I have to be even more incentive then I can not do it anymore 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.300
 I have to somehow see that I'm out of the question and still fruits 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.610
 That's why it really has crystallized on it 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.000
 for safety, health, serenity and efficiency 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.990
 of the horse 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.960
 is the glitches that is taken for me
