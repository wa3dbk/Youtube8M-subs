00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.110
 I'm going to be 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:10.800
 Hello friends 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.090
 in this video we will see how in a few minutes they install themselves to vindicate 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.200
 and for that we invited a friend who kindly offered for whom 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.080
 public road and with few tools does not show how he managed to protect his car 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.039
 with this new alarm 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.399
 since in its basic mode it does not require unarmed now they are brutally none 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.060
 part of your vehicle 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.470
 first of all we should conveniently choose the place that in which 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.260
 let's place the mimic alarm 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.960
 for this we must fix the in a style site far enough from the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.810
 Multiple exhaust to prevent the excessive heat daniel plastic cabinet 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.519
 with the help of a drill 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.500
 we proceed to fix the counterpart by rivets 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.060
 We can also use some screws that are already in the 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.810
 engine compartment I will say goodbye as in this case 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.190
 Another point to keep in mind is that the siren will mitigate as much as possible 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.230
 oriented downwards if here the built-in shock sensor has higher 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.320
 sensitivity to impacts when installed in this position and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.110
 mental foam and the same civil or firmer possible 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.030
 in this way if it manages to capture with greater certainty the blows that occur in the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.810
 back of the vehicle 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.570
 although the Mexican central cocoa 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.500
 as we did previously in the basic mode we will only use two cables 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.680
 for the start-up of the minicar alarm 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.100
 the red wire that I made in positive and it's black and it's 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.190
 negative 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.570
 optionally and if necessary military provides alternatives for 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.060
 achieve greater protection for example the brown cable 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.520
 can be used to place a button on the Paul hood or any 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.600
 another device that works for noÃ© enter co 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.130
 the blue cable and taking advantage of the short distance you can connect to the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.920
 position lights with which 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.000
 you access other functions 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.269
 that later 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.339
 let's detail 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:18.309
 The orange and green wires are for motor cutting and if you want to connect 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:23.189
 will access a powerful anti-warning with warning that will stop the march of the 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.759
 vehicle in 60 seconds 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:29.279
 and most importantly without the addition of additional reals 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:34.269
 I will go to more and calm can be installed on the car grill 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.079
 also in an optics or where you bilic is more comfortable 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.189
 The truth is that even if you want to connect all the cables, the connection 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.379
 it is done in a few centimeters and without entering the driver's compartment 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.969
 terminals must be placed according to the torments of your battery in the 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:56.930
 red cables and neredo kelly reiterated are the only ones that we will use in this 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.650
 case they should be firm, I will go to the committee of the good 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.469
 operation is precisely the connection to the battery 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.510
 We also recommend that you clean lovorne if these are your 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.120
 tied 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.610
 remember this indication 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.540
 and later you will understand why we insist on this point 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:21.889
 Once the cables were connected to the battery, the military alarm issued a 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.159
 vip indicating that you are ready to protect your vehicle 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.179
 afp 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:33.289
 was the charge 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:34.120
 now 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.989
 let's see how to program the pochos different levels of the impact sensor 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:44.919
 with any of the two controls that accompany the military center 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.910
 both buttons are pressed here the siren 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.910
 issue three short life 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:56.769
 then the center will give you in the same way a certain amount of vips that 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.139
 indicate that at what level they are at that moment 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.439
 The charge 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.569
 it should be noted 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.720
 what factory this device 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.009
 an intermediate level has been recorded 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.089
 review 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:10.679
 with four victories 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:14.010
 of you should keep in mind that the vehicle 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.010
 is the maximum sensitivity 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.189
 The charge 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:40.050
 Now it's time to test the operation of the basic module 

00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:44.300
 which will detect the impact on the vehicle and the intrusion by the 

00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:46.979
 opening of the doors 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.400
 to screen the minicarrera press the big button of the remote cospel the 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.879
 Central will issue an opinion 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:58.989
 any stroke that is greater than the selector triggering the alarm 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:01.830
 I go the charge 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.939
 to deactivate and after listening to them 2000 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.559
 the central will inform you what caused the shot 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.330
 if it was by blow as in this case it will be 3 Dec 

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:17.540
 now 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.349
 let's see how to detect the opening of the doors 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.419
 re-activate the system with the large button on the remote control will be 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.279
 that the small vote is used to activate it in silent mode 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:30.000
 in this case 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.469
 that she does not 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:35.959
 and if you commit the blue wire to the position lights so that when you activate and 

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:39.580
 turn off the lights this set once or twice 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.580
 according to the operation that you went into exile 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:50.919
 let's see what happens in opening the doors but before remember pepe central military 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.919
 it was connected with only the cables 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.679
 mackay just learned
