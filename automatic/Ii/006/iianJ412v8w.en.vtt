00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.240 

getting<00:02:57.690> on<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:58.260> feels<00:02:58.500> like<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.710> just<00:02:58.830> dragged

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
off right we just need to have the

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:14.090 
off right we just need to have the
spring<00:03:01.800> preload<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.250> little<00:03:02.520> bit

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:25.480 

I<00:03:14.210> keep<00:03:15.210> going<00:03:15.450> too<00:03:15.660> far

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:43.790 

there<00:03:25.970> we<00:03:26.060> go

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:04:33.159 

it's<00:03:44.310> wrong

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:42.670 

better

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:55.050 

but<00:04:43.040> everything<00:04:43.460> else

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:07.370 

we<00:04:59.720> don't<00:04:59.960> rely<00:05:00.440> on<00:05:00.470> that<00:05:00.650> time

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:19.320 

it's<00:05:07.890> going<00:05:08.250> up

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.180

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.780 
well ended up I think Tim's overall out
of<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.110> qualifier<00:05:27.290> and<00:05:27.610> definitely<00:05:28.610> made<00:05:28.730> a

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
of the qualifier and definitely made a

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.430 
of the qualifier and definitely made a
few<00:05:29.000> bike<00:05:29.150> changes<00:05:29.600> and<00:05:29.780> got<00:05:29.900> it<00:05:30.020> better<00:05:30.200> and

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
few bike changes and got it better and
