this<00:00:01.790> chief<00:00:02.679> um<00:00:04.750> I'm<00:00:05.750> changing<00:00:06.470> oxygen

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.310 
this chief um I'm changing oxygen

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.869 
this chief um I'm changing oxygen
sensors<00:00:07.790> on<00:00:08.089> an<00:00:08.210> old<00:00:08.360> two-sided<00:00:09.110> view<00:00:09.849> and

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:12.879 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.660 

here<00:00:13.879> we<00:00:13.999> go

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
here we go

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.519 
here we go
Clark<00:00:16.670> you<00:00:16.789> don't<00:00:16.939> need<00:00:17.089> all<00:00:17.269> those<00:00:17.449> souls<00:00:17.839> but

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
Clark you don't need all those souls but

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.650 
Clark you don't need all those souls but
you<00:00:18.679> do<00:00:18.859> need<00:00:21.519> oxygen<00:00:22.519> sensor<00:00:22.939> to<00:00:23.150> pick<00:00:23.539> this

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
you do need oxygen sensor to pick this

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.599 
you do need oxygen sensor to pick this
up<00:00:23.900> for<00:00:24.050> $8.00<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:25.089> I<00:00:26.089> have<00:00:26.329> one<00:00:27.609> actually

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
up for $8.00 and I have one actually

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:37.689 
up for $8.00 and I have one actually
over<00:00:28.880> here<00:00:28.910> ready<00:00:32.680> and<00:00:35.289> it<00:00:36.289> goes<00:00:36.590> around<00:00:37.340> the

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
over here ready and it goes around the

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.080 
over here ready and it goes around the
wire<00:00:37.910> I<00:00:38.300> have<00:00:39.050> for<00:00:39.500> this<00:00:39.859> Saturn<00:00:40.340> Vue<00:00:40.550> this<00:00:40.850> old

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
wire I have for this Saturn Vue this old

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.090 
wire I have for this Saturn Vue this old
-<00:00:41.300> Saturn<00:00:41.690> Vue<00:00:41.930> has<00:00:42.170> four<00:00:42.850> so<00:00:43.850> um<00:00:45.100> it's

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
- Saturn Vue has four so um it's

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.470 
- Saturn Vue has four so um it's
actually<00:00:49.390> one<00:00:50.390> here<00:00:51.879> there's<00:00:52.879> another<00:00:53.030> one

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
actually one here there's another one

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.259 
actually one here there's another one
just<00:00:53.780> above<00:00:54.289> where<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.829> jack<00:00:55.190> is<00:00:55.460> over<00:00:56.090> there

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
just above where the jack is over there

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:03.610 
just above where the jack is over there
take<00:00:56.660> it<00:00:56.809> under<00:00:57.019> there<00:00:57.170> right<00:00:57.199> now<00:00:59.649> and<00:01:02.620> we

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
take it under there right now and we

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:11.830 
take it under there right now and we
have<00:01:03.769> one<00:01:06.160> behind<00:01:07.160> here<00:01:08.560> and<00:01:09.560> one<00:01:09.920> down<00:01:10.750> in<00:01:11.750> the

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
have one behind here and one down in the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.510 
have one behind here and one down in the
front<00:01:12.110> here<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:13.660> what<00:01:14.660> I've<00:01:14.780> done<00:01:15.050> is<00:01:16.660> because

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
front here and what I've done is because

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.790 
front here and what I've done is because
there's<00:01:19.520> no<00:01:19.760> expensive<00:01:20.450> they<00:01:20.600> want<00:01:20.780> 125<00:01:21.470> each

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
there's no expensive they want 125 each

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.700 
there's no expensive they want 125 each
of<00:01:22.070> them<00:01:22.220> um<00:01:23.090> I<00:01:23.420> had<00:01:23.540> a<00:01:23.570> problem<00:01:24.080> before<00:01:24.230> when<00:01:24.620> I

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
of them um I had a problem before when I

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.680 
of them um I had a problem before when I
was<00:01:24.860> out<00:01:25.010> of<00:01:25.040> state<00:01:25.400> where<00:01:25.730> one<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.180> oxygen

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
was out of state where one of the oxygen

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.590 
was out of state where one of the oxygen
sensors<00:01:27.200> were<00:01:27.380> bad<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:27.830> I<00:01:27.920> cleaned<00:01:28.220> it<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.600> it

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
sensors were bad and I cleaned it and it

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.800 
sensors were bad and I cleaned it and it
worked<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.020> car<00:01:30.260> ran<00:01:30.470> fine<00:01:30.740> so<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:31.570> cleaned

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.220 

cleaned<00:01:38.810> all<00:01:39.080> four<00:01:39.440> these<00:01:39.710> oxygen<00:01:40.340> sensors

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
cleaned all four these oxygen sensors

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.620 
cleaned all four these oxygen sensors
and<00:01:42.230> what<00:01:42.470> I<00:01:42.500> used<00:01:42.860> was

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.230 

sandpaper<00:01:48.890> this<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> thick<00:01:50.400> gray<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.180> is

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
sandpaper this is a thick gray this is

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.180 
sandpaper this is a thick gray this is
another<00:01:51.630> gray<00:01:52.190> items<00:01:53.190> in<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.910> cloth<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.690> use<00:01:55.680> on

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
another gray items in the cloth I use on

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
another gray items in the cloth I use on
gas<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.510> few<00:01:58.020> other<00:01:58.850> carburetor<00:01:59.850> cleaning

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
gas and a few other carburetor cleaning

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.780 
gas and a few other carburetor cleaning
chemicals<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.590> wire<00:02:01.800> brush<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.160> clean<00:02:02.610> it

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
chemicals and a wire brush to clean it

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.910 
chemicals and a wire brush to clean it
and<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:04.050> file<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:06.240> don't<00:02:06.450> let<00:02:06.720> stuff<00:02:07.350> off<00:02:07.620> of<00:02:07.650> it

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
and a file you don't let stuff off of it

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.200 
and a file you don't let stuff off of it
so<00:02:07.980> that<00:02:08.220> it'll<00:02:09.030> start<00:02:09.510> sensing<00:02:10.080> again<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
so that it'll start sensing again on the

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.120 
so that it'll start sensing again on the
tailpipe<00:02:13.160> alright<00:02:14.160> let's<00:02:14.610> see<00:02:14.730> if<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.970> next
