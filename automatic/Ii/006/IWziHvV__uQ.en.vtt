00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.190
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.470
 circle tv and today we are a little bit again 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.110
 talk about the middle this time I don't 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.830
 I will talk about some of his 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.800
 characteristics and we are more 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.990
 dwell on its use in combat and on 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.770
 what are the shells on it 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.810
 use 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.820
 he has, as you know, bombs 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.400
 cumulative and there are tours 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.680
 so what do we need to use and what 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.360
 it’s convenient for us to use at all I would 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.160
 Of course, I recommended to take everything and 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.199
 little but more of course 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.300
 cumulatives a little bit and a little 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.520
 of land mines in some situations 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.680
 it will be very convenient to finish off some 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.899
 goals whose little hp they are here 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.070
 quite powerful as the caliber is big 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.559
 one-time damage too 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.269
 and of course we need tours in order 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.309
 so that in some situations they 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.990
 throw an opponent who came up 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.600
 pretty close since the ptores 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.740
 somewhat still more damage 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.990
 the only thing to remember 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.540
 tours last longer recharge and longer 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.910
 fly to the enemy and in many situations 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.370
 it will be more profitable to use cumulatives 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.710
 which as you see throws over 600 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.960
 units of damage what do i do on 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.090
 This map I got as far as possible from 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.040
 opponent with stealth at Sheridan and 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.409
 Of course not everything is very good but since 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.780
 no bbm here i'm not glowing 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.549
 and I throw over the enemy or me 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.950
 there is an opportunity to stand for a stone and then 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.689
 I won’t get the only problem 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.570
 This is of course the accuracy of the instrument on 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.430
 distance over 300 400 meters throw 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.140
 already getting very problematic there 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.450
 would not get into the silhouette of a tank 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.579
 something to heal but how do you understand 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.409
 Level 3 and 4 tanks 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.630
 cumulative sheridan 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.060
 pretty confident just because 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.530
 breaking through them is quite high if you 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.090
 will not shoot at some 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.490
 attachment type I do not know 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.469
 also in the same caterpillars you will 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.329
 cause good damage because 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.219
 let's take the same chiften 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.960
 he certainly doesn’t say that without 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.960
 armor but makes its way into the frontal projection 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.730
 everywhere except the forehead of the tower and even 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.350
 the fact that the top bronelist would seem 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.180
 must be pretty strong with him 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.160
 wild slope is permissible with this 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.320
 heights we can pretty well 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.270
 punch him than I actually now 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.340
 I do, of course, I try to aim 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.470
 lower armor for there will be a break through 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.100
 guaranteed but it is not too important 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.230
 you need to get a chapter 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.790
 just in the body this features and well and all 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.570
 he will soon be gone 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.790
 nothing 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.920
 for one-time damage just 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.660
 Wonderfully we can make out 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.190
 same opponents at our expense 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.260
 alpha strike and if we need 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.720
 exchanged then in a pinch we have this 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.850
 we can certainly do with us, though not 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.950
 too much 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.200
 1154 units and not exchanging yourself 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.060
 the best idea since 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.610
 us and recharge about 11 or more 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.020
 seconds and in urban setting of course 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.240
 sheridan will feel not 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.560
 too confident but acting from the second 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.200
 lines we will feel 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.210
 wonderful like a quiet ninja which 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.970
 Of course hachiko standing but if that gets 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.190
 specifically in regards to wallpaper 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.650
 urban conditions try to keep 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.960
 for your own b b because you have armor 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.910
 no, of course, but you have 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.070
 speed in narrow alleys you can 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.380
 just go around the enemy and throw 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.450
 him from behind because behind you are cumulative 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.460
 unlikely to miss if you miss 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.950
 but I don't know in an urban setting this 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.570
 making is difficult and can even zap 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.520
 turit because leaving behind 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.130
 the enemy is likely to wait no longer 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.410
 will and you can smoke it right in 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.160
 his fillet pieces 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.860
 engine compartment and 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.650
 thereby causing him a culture shock 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.840
 and maybe even make him popobol 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.810
 Big smear can be even assured and 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.490
 remove it just from the face of the earth therefore 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.830
 actually help the team too 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.080
 regarding fights on open maps too 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.690
 do not climb forward because the review is not the most 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.090
 good but still not bbm we see a little 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.160
 further than the main battle tanks that are not 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.200
 there is good so I shoot 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.180
 carefully and and try to hold on 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.310
 allies here let's say here 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.780
 patton just stood in front he took 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.030
 all the attention of the enemy 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.160
 I stood behind the stone and since they 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.710
 there was no bbm quietly shot 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.350
 both of you have never received in return and this 

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.520
 great if the opponent has bbm 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.980
 then you are afraid 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.120
 for radius of the review at them is higher 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.580
 our invisibility is still not so 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.290
 good like the same bpm and we 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.150
 we can suffer from them very much 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.130
 especially any machine gunners who 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.690
 can drop in and just shoot us 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.630
 considering the fact that we have armor again 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.640
 act a little carefully but I'm in it 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.370
 the battle actually stood in one position 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.790
 if you find this position for yourself 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.250
 from 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.140
 On successful and you will not shine on it 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.880
 you can successfully from where to throw on 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.890
 opponents are actually good 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.640
 results by the end of the fight you 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.860
 provided 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.900
 sometimes you can play more aggressively 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.120
 let's say i understand what remains here 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.190
 most likely only art I can leave 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.560
 and kill her but unfortunately right now 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.480
 missed it was very unpleasant for 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.920
 but I want her anyway 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.630
 pick up and now most likely it 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.520
 will turn out 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.290
 going back to aggressive tactics if 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.540
 you understand that the enemy is one and he 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.340
 aspiring or few of them but you 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.840
 can just take and fly past 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.400
 they are actually taken to someone 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.040
 cuff or subscript 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.690
 then do it and on calmly leave and 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.380
 with a clear conscience of his damazhkoy 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.330
 in the pocket 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.950
 well and you had a circle tv hope by 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.930
 Sheridan we have dismantled everything and 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.370
 back to him not soon everyone yet 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.370
 I'll see you on the battlefield
