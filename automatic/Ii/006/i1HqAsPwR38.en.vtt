00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 Today I'm going to teach you how to make a bomb. 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.440
 pallets 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.510
 You can tell that there was already a bomb 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.190
 of manual countries of the world but this I 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.730
 I'll show you that it's a lot easier to 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.580
 do 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.109
 the effect is much better for countries that 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.800
 I will not use ice cream countries 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.539
 common 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.939
 this is a spatula that normally 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.810
 It is used to make hair removal or 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.180
 serves for you to take in the throat and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.980
 is slightly larger and wider than the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.929
 common craft stick of making the country 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.830
 Ice cream but for the ice cream is a little 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.989
 more brittle 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.280
 The statue is more flexible if it is in 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.829
 pharmacies 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.930
 besides the spatulas and the toothpicks you 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.590
 you will need a soft surface and 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.170
 went 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.910
 You can use your bed, but I'll use it. 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.950
 here is a blanket wrapped in a blanket 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.149
 and I'll put a black cloth and if it is 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.050
 a comb is only for you to achieve 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.660
 see better 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.969
 I'm making the first toothpick goes here. 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.050
 horizontally and the second 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.960
 over him 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.449
 turning left to the top 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.980
 left more or less than 30 degrees 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.989
 means 30 degrees 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.240
 when we were a cross we have 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.950
 an angle here of 90 degrees 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.380
 half of that angle a little more 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.150
 closed would be 45graus a bit more 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.159
 closed 30 degrees 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.990
 so here we have another 30 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.210
 rising degrees by turning left 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.659
 bit left down here 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.909
 the next toothpick will come underneath 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.830
 and that over that country notes 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.380
 soft surface that makes it easy to 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.810
 this can be more or less 30 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.090
 degrees of the first sea wall was placed 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.509
 also going right 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.850
 the fourth toothpick and there it will be like that 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.909
 now it will always be placed 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.829
 the first from below and then from above 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.990
 then the next will be placed the first 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.810
 underneath and above always 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.780
 parallel to the other there worse later 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.369
 first down and then I go 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.540
 holding here otherwise you will drop a 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.520
 wall pump 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.560
 look only giving sequence 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.960
 fits underneath first after 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:07.170
 passes over the other side the first 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.119
 under the bass 5 is good you can 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.129
 continue this here for miles 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.930
 As long as you want with how much it costs 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.319
 if you want but it 's very important 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.269
 know how to make a finish a 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.890
 stop the bomb and do not let it explode. 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.019
 any moment is a kind of 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.400
 trigger take a look 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.360
 the normal way of putting the appliance 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.849
 would be underneath the bass by 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.209
 and the father of the 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.670
 secret is beneath and above it 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.519
 goes underneath again at the tip of the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:43.079
 talent from below and above. 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.450
 down and then if you want to blow your 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.700
 pump it is only to release this last device 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.250
 was placed that she will munch on 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.950
 carry as much as I will not do 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.599
 Now let's make a giant bomb. 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.599
 out there and see what happens 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:20.250
 the last 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.250
 Now let's drop this deal. 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.910
 look 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:47.200
 one more two here by you find the 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:49.599
 I'll leave the manual below 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.250
 management of two videos, the first is 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.870
 first video we made the ball of 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.720
 toothpicks and do a little more 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.849
 complicated but it has more options 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.560
 drawing you write things 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.360
 manufacturing problems on the other side 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.590
 ended up leaving a magic that magic 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.590
 of the toothpick that changes color
