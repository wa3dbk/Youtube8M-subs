 on the other hand 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.770
 flower 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.210
 the world 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.499
 a 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:36.080
 it would be better if we stay here for a while 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.080
 a goal of collantes with many names of federal supports 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.000
 a are already published 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.580
 min we will start to review those strangers and the imported ones that this initiative 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.580
 they are empty 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.170
 probably can not stand police came that's impossible 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.980
 i 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.110
 called then to present if there are not all fit in your portfolio 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.220
 I had to hide them somewhere in this room and we have to 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.970
 find them 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.230
 let's set aside the corpse and look for the books first 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.650
 m 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.390
 this country 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.500
 there are people like that 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.900
 there are several ponds there and the Tibetans in all want and c + the 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.900
 books on both sides 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.200
 my own profile 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 andalucía tells that we are here 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.080
 what will happen if the director of the light 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.950
 do not worry 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.400
 probably they face the dollar 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.400
 I have to do it in 2012 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.440
 it seems that he left 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.799
 it makes sing something direct sr nothing 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.409
 not until now 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.719
 there seems to be nothing in those booksellers 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:18.139
 percent 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.649
 what it looks like and that had not touched the books on the other side 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.429
 have been 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:25.199
 ccoo 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.519
 but the one that has been being the tournament 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.519
 we detect all the dogs on this side to 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.689
 how weird 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.099
 also the others we removed all 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.779
 despite this 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:40.779
 this image in 1 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:43.779
 the lack of control 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:46.439
 all the books that are here are common 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:47.840
 I understand the girl 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.280
 the books were not placed upside down what happens is that none of 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.469
 They have 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.769
 in other words that books on spine were placed among children 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.100
 normal on each side of the shelf 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.439
 forming three rows 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.700
 even if someone takes some book from the outside 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.260
 of the open part of it and thinks it's the book on the other side of the pond 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:15.699
 according to account that what they do very well 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.939
 from the children's section if the children are taking out the books 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:21.960
 it's easier than anyone to realize 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.850
 That's why books are not well fed when they're put back in 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.100
 the shelf push them on average and consequently those on the other side 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.169
 when we make such strange books and import them significant 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.169
 matías oyola of weapons a day 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.899
 basic 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.899
 the agreement has the same 

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:51.289
 like who says the director of this place is practicing true ball 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.679
 well the program really what happened with the asteroid belt 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:57.349
 with the same ones last night 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.249
 and when the director had Argentina turn to keep him quiet and that 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.939
 nobody discovered it 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.939
 did not hide anam environment 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.519
 how weird you do not hear anything 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.809
 is broken 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:20.339
 we're going to have to go to the police immediately golem while we go you 

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.090
 we want a lot in which he 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.090
 I hope that the body these 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.080
 I would not admit 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.139
 better or worse 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.139
 it would be an event in which we find the body 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.059
 world 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:43.979
 cooper in greenhouse effect but on the other hand the archer 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.170
 state panista militant doing 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.250
 pacta 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.250
 all sparta is paws we encourage everyone 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.210
 during the homily 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.550
 well what a fool to hide and the corpse on a delhi shelf 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.250
 but you said that the police carried out all the places this afternoon 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.169
 he even denied that she 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.520
 there is no place where you like 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.520
 minutes 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.069
 That's so 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.069
 the fed mobile temple 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:35.559
 Teheran counts 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.699
 because they are from a corpse in a place like this that anyone can move 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.699
 shelves 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:53.629
 the one that is happening can not move much the shock 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:56.629
 this year 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:00.779
 no project go ethics yesterday the currency 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.740
 nor do I think there is anything different than a flip 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.050
 which means that he 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.069
 not only in Spanish 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:28.550
 perfect 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.360
 it seems that it is very heavy 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.360
 explained that in this area there are 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.790
 60 kilograms 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.729
 the priest that 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:42.059
 I'm punishing this 

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:46.469
 so start today will be the last time you go out with these children when you return the 

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:49.469
 colin again be an adult everything will change 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.479
 efe 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.199
 is 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:56.229
 already before art 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:59.229
 it's true there's nothing hours before a 

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:05.029
 I'm sorry the last time he tells me that 5 kilograms is wrong 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:07.069
 the apple varela 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:09.330
 one 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.330
 they also said that the details of the agreement 

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:18.369
 Conversely 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.669
 jordaan 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:27.669
 Where is 

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:39.909
 pillar the engine room 

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:44.240
 contract numbers and the body I not only went for the door of the 

00:07:44.239 --> 00:07:47.699
 elevator will work manually 

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:50.699
 probably the body 

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:55.649
 from the club 

00:07:55.649 --> 00:07:59.619
 the infallible test is that the overweight alarm was not activated when 

00:07:59.619 --> 00:08:02.619
 we joined the elevator this afternoon 

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:08.919
 besides that I paid for throwing in the towel on the rise is not about 2000
