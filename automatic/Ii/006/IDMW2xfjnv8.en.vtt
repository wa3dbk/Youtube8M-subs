00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 you know people often tells you 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.920
 kind of yeah that's a little finger are 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.970
 all too well and all that at all you 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.519
 know what would be even better people 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.309
 it is clearly 2nd jassam of his 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.120
 weapons for the price of a bel and here it is 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.990
 it's not fantastic hi it's okay 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:25.230
 it's fantastic 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:27.599
 the subway is well hi everyone 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.070
 everyone knows it's me good today 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.990
 I do not say that at the beginning normally I 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.410
 know but there you see what 's wrong with the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.270
 head 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.770
 so we go to freestyle mode I have not 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.239
 a lot of fps because I'm on 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.739
 my laptop was not even at home 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.870
 and all the rest is the big galley 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.579
 for you this episode is the headache 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.129
 does not help the thing so I'm going 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.390
 try to do the best you can because 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.829
 that today you present a mode 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.809
 which really is really really 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.800
 cool it does not mean anything but 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.020
 it does not matter because it's really 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.969
 cool this let me explain to you 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.890
 how does it work basically it's a 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.329
 mode that will allow you to capture 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.550
 your movements and replay them after 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.019
 being a separate character it's a 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.189
 uncomplicated to explain but when 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.240
 you will see how it works I 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.659
 immediately understand and you go 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.390
 understand 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.560
 to such a point this mode it is practiced such 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.689
 point he can do a lot of things 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.210
 so we start already by typing a 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:21.810
 command which is the next cm to cap 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.360
 taken from the 6 breaks space the names of the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.220
 files that you want because in 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.630
 basically what's up is like I 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.590
 tell it to capture your movements in 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.180
 a certain files 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.119
 we must give a name to this file we will 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.369
 call it for example prout prout voilÃ  

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.720
 so you type this command there you 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.220
 press enter and there you start 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.810
 to move in every way you do 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.650
 what you want you do everything 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.470
 that you want them to be 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.479
 registered wholesale so you go 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.369
 move you will tap you stir 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.869
 the head you have drop and an item by 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.369
 example could really do everything 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.930
 that you want you can fly in 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.600
 the tunes you can sprint and that's 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.759
 everything will be captured in this file 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.030
 hop we get the same order for 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.680
 then stopped the rice strings tac and 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.170
 then what we will do is replay 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.860
 this scene so for only and see you 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.390
 as a block 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.890
 you type the following command in 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.130
 missing all the juice to erase again 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.520
 at the same time you type m to capcir and 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.050
 also parec mepledes space the name of the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.710
 file so our file was called 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.970
 Prout Prout 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.680
 gold you can see more cards and 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.630
 obviously and then after the toys 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.730
 as you want is it necessary 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.220
 then these two nicks so finally or 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.840
 two names the first one will determine the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.250
 skin that you want to give to the little ones 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.450
 fellows who will appear he will do 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.160
 the movements of the moment we are 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.810
 for example, we go to a moment ago 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.330
 had my skin made them the second 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.580
 month it was just a month that 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.710
 was played by this mode 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.360
 so I typed ayem jassam by 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.890
 example of the middle of fantasy does not yield 4 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.340
 it's the first name that comes to me 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.530
 the mind 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.840
 so this character is going to see the skin of 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.240
 fanta and then we give him a name 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.520
 so for example someone who moves his 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.140
 nickname is going to be embittered who moves up and on 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.520
 press the little button and hop the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.830
 fanta appears here it starts to 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.660
 move like exactly just now 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.520
 so he does everything I've done here 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.130
 then on the other hand I want to clarify 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.230
 it's a ghost so that it can 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.000
 not pick up objects for example 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.770
 that's where I picked it up the item but 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.310
 he did not pick up talk to him but by 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.710
 against he launched it and he can not 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.660
 break two blocks and can not interact 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.370
 with the objects so for example if I 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.960
 register me opening the door 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.670
 like that and close it 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.530
 him what he's going to do is just pass 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.850
 through the door as if nothing 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.620
 was actually because it's still a 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.240
 ghost but hey it was preventing that the 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.830
 fashion is still really damn 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.000
 cool 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.710
 after you can tell you what it 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.120
 serves but it serves a lot of things 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.500
 in any case what comes to mind - 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.300
 jesse will concern two people help 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.060
 the map maker what they will do with 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.730
 maps for example imagine let's go 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.830
 in the house that's it and by opening the 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.090
 door I activate a block command and we 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.680
 sees someone inside the genre 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.330
 brahim hero who wants to us 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.830
 scary and basically it could 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.420
 really have a story built 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.370
 deeper I find in the east in 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.170
 is in the maps of constructs is 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.700
 in any case the mad maker to use 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.160
 these techniques there really to do 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.260
 rather cool things after that 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.550
 can help youtuber to make 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.050
 scenes like I did just now to 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.480
 instead of having three million minecraft 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.920
 you just have to register your 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.680
 movements 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.090
 and go play and then turn on this 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.010
 point there it can really help you 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.150
 so that's a goodie story a bit 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.250
 short because I present to you that a 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.829
 fashion today a mode that offers no 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.270
 3000 feature but only one but that is 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.800
 a feature that really is really 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.290
 very very cool and that really helps 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.250
 plenty of super mega cool things so in 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.510
 Anyway I hope you liked 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.700
