readjust the FreePlay again after the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.100 
readjust the FreePlay again after the

engine has been shut off for a time even
if<00:01:40.200> only<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.560> 30<00:01:40.770> minutes<00:01:41.070> or<00:01:41.190> so

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
if only for 30 minutes or so

insufficient clutch lever free play will

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.200 
insufficient clutch lever free play will
not<00:01:44.100> allow<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.370> clutch<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.820> fully<00:01:45.030> engage

when you release the lever meaning the

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.470 
when you release the lever meaning the
