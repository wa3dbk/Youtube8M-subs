and turn this eat to understand here it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:08.630 
and turn this eat to understand here it
was<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.520> leaned<00:02:04.580> leave<00:02:05.580> that<00:02:06.740> runs<00:02:07.740> parallel<00:02:08.280> to

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
was a leaned leave that runs parallel to

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.530 
was a leaned leave that runs parallel to
that<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.700> then<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:11.970> need<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> look<00:02:12.269> at<00:02:12.420> your

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
that and then you need to look at your

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.910 
that and then you need to look at your
distributor<00:02:13.580> there<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.989> has<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.380> go<00:02:16.800> like

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
distributor there and it has to go like

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:27.410 
distributor there and it has to go like
something<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.070> like<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.950> okay<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:26.420> that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
something like like that okay and that

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.790 
something like like that okay and that
should<00:02:27.930> be<00:02:27.989> pointing<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.750> number<00:02:30.870> one<00:02:31.170> let

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
should be pointing to the number one let

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:56.900 
should be pointing to the number one let
me<00:02:31.830> see<00:02:54.980> well<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.070> can<00:02:56.220> see<00:02:56.340> suppose<00:02:56.670> that's

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
me see well you can see suppose that's

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.810 
me see well you can see suppose that's
about<00:02:57.000> Philly<00:02:57.480> that's<00:02:59.120> what<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:01.670> really<00:03:02.670> do

this near Stoney hard hey plus the quick
take<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.209> guess<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.660> because<00:03:06.870> as<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.230> push<00:03:07.410> it

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
take a guess and because as you push it

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.240 
take a guess and because as you push it
down<00:03:07.850> it<00:03:08.850> has<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.060> chance<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.690> spin<00:03:10.260> round<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.620> it

very<00:04:56.020> very<00:04:56.320> meditate<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:58.360> want<00:04:58.539> that<00:04:59.970> you

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
very very meditate you want that you

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.870 
very very meditate you want that you
want<00:05:01.630> to<00:05:02.280> obviously<00:05:03.280> tell<00:05:03.460> you<00:05:03.520> that<00:05:03.610> doesn't

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880

rattle<00:05:04.030> all<00:05:04.210> over<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.510> cliff<00:05:04.720> but<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:07.090> you

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
rattle all over the cliff but and you

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.960 
rattle all over the cliff but and you
think<00:05:08.380> that<00:05:08.620> when<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:09.039> engine<00:05:09.280> starts<00:05:09.760> is

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
think that when the engine starts is

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.610 
think that when the engine starts is
going<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.450> delay<00:05:10.840> all<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.110> metals<00:05:11.410> going<00:05:11.560> to

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
going to delay all the metals going to

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.550 
going to delay all the metals going to
Delhi<00:05:11.979> and<00:05:12.460> so<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.270> this<00:05:13.780> practice<00:05:14.350> will

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
Delhi and so the this practice will

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.500 
Delhi and so the this practice will
actually<00:05:15.010> finish<00:05:15.370> up<00:05:15.669> being<00:05:16.000> followed<00:05:16.240> away

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
actually finish up being followed away

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.760 
actually finish up being followed away
from<00:05:16.720> each<00:05:16.810> other<00:05:17.020> just<00:05:17.080> start<00:05:17.350> off<00:05:17.410> so<00:05:17.530> slowly

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
from each other just start off so slowly

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.300 
from each other just start off so slowly
and<00:05:18.460> if<00:05:18.820> you<00:05:19.000> go<00:05:19.539> too<00:05:19.600> tight<00:05:19.930> when<00:05:20.740> it's<00:05:20.860> called

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
and if you go too tight when it's called

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.710 
and if you go too tight when it's called
when<00:05:22.060> it's<00:05:22.210> warm<00:05:22.450> it'll<00:05:22.780> be<00:05:22.930> even<00:05:23.110> tighter<00:05:23.560> so

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
when it's warm it'll be even tighter so

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.300 
when it's warm it'll be even tighter so
it's<00:05:25.720> a<00:05:25.780> good<00:05:25.900> idea<00:05:25.990> to<00:05:26.169> build<00:05:26.380> that<00:05:26.560> in<00:05:26.680> mind<00:05:27.300> I

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
it's a good idea to build that in mind I

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.350 
it's a good idea to build that in mind I
mean<00:05:30.310> that's<00:05:30.700> all<00:05:30.820> hold<00:05:31.000> it<00:05:31.150> in<00:05:31.210> this<00:05:31.300> position

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
mean that's all hold it in this position

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.520 
mean that's all hold it in this position
quite<00:05:31.870> well<00:05:32.050> I<00:05:32.260> I<00:05:32.979> don't<00:05:33.250> have<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:35.520> tool<00:05:36.520> to
