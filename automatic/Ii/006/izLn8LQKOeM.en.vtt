00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
it came with two three games Crysis 3

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.929 
it came with two three games Crysis 3
and<00:00:20.900> BioShock<00:00:21.900> Infinite<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.410> believe<00:00:22.619> was<00:00:22.939> I

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and BioShock Infinite I believe was I

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.509 
and BioShock Infinite I believe was I
probably<00:00:24.689> won't<00:00:24.869> even<00:00:25.080> use<00:00:25.350> those<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:26.010> for

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
probably won't even use those but for

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.070 
probably won't even use those but for
those<00:00:26.910> are<00:00:27.060> wondering<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.510> don't<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> card

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
those are wondering I don't have a card

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.519 
those are wondering I don't have a card
here<00:00:28.349> but<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.570> scratch<00:00:30.570> off<00:00:30.689> code<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.260> for

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
here but the scratch off code is for

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.799 
here but the scratch off code is for
both<00:00:31.710> games<00:00:32.009> at<00:00:32.189> once<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.520> looks<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.660> if

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
both games at once it looks like so if

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.299 
both games at once it looks like so if
you<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:34.050> wanted<00:00:34.260> one<00:00:34.469> game<00:00:34.680> one<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.010> sell<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you just wanted one game one to sell the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.580 
you just wanted one game one to sell the
other<00:00:35.480> it<00:00:36.480> doesn't<00:00:36.690> work<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.809> way<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.410> looks

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
other it doesn't work that way it looks

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.360 
other it doesn't work that way it looks
like<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.540> scratch<00:00:39.540> code<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.200> then

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
like you have to scratch code and then

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.880 
like you have to scratch code and then
use<00:00:41.370> them<00:00:41.520> both<00:00:42.230> doesn't<00:00:43.230> matter<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.590> me<00:00:43.620> I'll

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
use them both doesn't matter to me I'll

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.400 
use them both doesn't matter to me I'll
probably<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.219> rid<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.399> both<00:00:45.140> okay<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.289> got
