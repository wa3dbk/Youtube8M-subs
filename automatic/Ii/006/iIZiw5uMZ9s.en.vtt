00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 in my model the digital 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.650
 no difference between an analog and digital model 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.289
 because they are many of the others 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.009
 another other world totally 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.339
 since good we have a control 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.589
 for each locomotive we can 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.029
 put the digital encores 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.029
 per cent the locomotive on Thursday 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.119
 with the sound 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.640
 lights 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.900
 to that is another totally true world out there many foot functions 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.900
 that the systems bring for them to be chinú 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.600
 end the speed 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.200
 nor the proposed light to pose with lights on facing is another thing 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.200
 totally 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.310
 jorge klee locomotive ana place 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.760
 seles then adapts a chip that is allowed to sell mercadona of different types there 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.110
 grief and sound consumers 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.430
 maybe I can for each of them conventional islands that we have from 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.320
 many years ago they become 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.270
 visitors making all the changes 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.140
 in this way it was indicated of a locomotive salazar digital decoder 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.090
 good that chip really the digital system p 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.310
 yes what do you have a 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.990
 we expect a command true at that time the locomotives that those 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.200
 we have shown 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.160
 all have their headquarters 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.930
 and they are waiting for a command the agent is already all is the day 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.840
 really what are you waiting for one of the pa and I'm the function that 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.610
 wants and makes you walk forward backwards 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.750
 if you have a new process in which you cited the bell 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.000
 so 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.230
 said Saez so it is the brain of the German command article by means 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.910
 of the 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.130
 of the system that one has there 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.450
 villela different functions and that to them then the locomotive war 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.890
 or which pits 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.820
 we have sites also control 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.039
 the discover 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.039
 working with the function 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.469
 in this one, by the way, is that I used to be directed 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.219
 that was the end of this 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.749
 the little brain 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:32.079
 not in 1999 locomotives 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.379
 these are the ones that can be put in it 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.539
 in the model and friends the control 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.539
 that ability 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:48.029
 this area machine a house 4 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.029
 - Pennsylvania company 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.749
 - digital abc 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:58.569
 with this choice in the sense of humor mexico - for the same jiménez 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:02.989
 2 she good who has doubt according to 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.159
 son of the singer then he has 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.429
 just the machine 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:18.949
 and then the murdered all looked for from this fixed point those directed by 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.949
 gustavo bou 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:29.139
 she the 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:34.370
 the latter technology that does throw the smoke synchronized with a sound 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.359
 this is one thing that is 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.639
 the new contract 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.559
 however dated the smoke 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:41.619
 but without having to choose 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:43.819
 movement of 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.819
 santiago afp and songs totally 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.709
 the shares also commented 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.299
 us a press release 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.749
 It is similar to the one we have already elaborated 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:17.760
 same has sofía 27 different functions between those titles do not use 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.759
 never front light cab will not be 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.229
 star this being the boiler 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.229
 we believe 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.909
 that area they say 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.599
 lima efe seven the unit and the sale data and my engine and sound 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.199
 4 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.050
 It's very important 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.830
 the digital is that we can program 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.009
 this one or two 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.360
 Enough 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.530
 good the system allows ones that want up to 100 and 200 machines 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.389
 then take out all work 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.199
 the same command 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.379
 and one of the programs that a certain partner go another forward 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:29.870
 talking the same train 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.470
 all of that is a great advantage that can be done with this because one can 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.059
 program a train all with the same speed in the machines 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:39.099
 and be able to hug a train 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.219
 as spectators among the 60 wagons 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:45.309
 all 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:47.259
 the power the engine 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.559
 and they have all worked the smallest looked synchronized so that it can be 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:54.309
 drag a pretty long train 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:57.740
 that's one of the great advantages that local digital system 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.180
 this is the table of mine what do I have to stop work 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.319
 here where 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:05.050
 good, we repair 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.919
 the locomotive century we make changes for example this is a 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.130
 analogous what we are doing digital 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.009
 Let's remove that they make all the change in euros 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:20.460
 the wiring after two first to those who come conventional juana lópez 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.520
 and all this this device that you have to do to put on these new ones 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.950
 chips that I can install there are several simple consumption of the clubhouse 

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:34.060
 Impotence directs after the world 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.219
 controversial as a sound exception 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:40.089
 while for sound and this spot also then here also and 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:45.549
 let's change the wagons and the locomotive the hooks we put 

00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:50.009
 metallic hook we also installed smokers or not only two 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.689
 goals that are these are metallic 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:58.279
 most of the malvones come with plastic pipes we inform you the 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:01.379
 that are all mental 1 in the marbles 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:06.249
 why do I have more turned to him the coal embargo the team post 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:09.289
 in equal if we paint weapons very positive 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:12.460
 we have boston small workshop man 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.960
 we expose the details of the locomotives worthy in French 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.689
 let's see 

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:21.830
 2 this data was not coupled as all cables 

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:25.529
 this complete detail and you have to have to be able 

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:26.359
 Tuesday of Tuesday
