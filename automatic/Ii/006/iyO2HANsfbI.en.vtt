 recognize which objects especially 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.489
 are dangerous for under three year olds 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.289
 and which she with calm conscience in 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.019
 to give the hands of their children

 small parts tester this is a 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.630
 Standardized test equipment used in test laboratories 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.150
 and institutes is used to small 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.119
 or small items to examine 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.200
 because it corresponds in size and form to the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.330
 Maw of a toddler for the test 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.930
 should the small parts tester on one 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.000
 are flat pad to place the to 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 examining object simply in one 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 he fits in any position 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.920
 complete in the small parts tester and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.659
 does not stand out from this 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.259
 product a swallow and 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.420
 choking hazard of sticking a part of 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.369
 the small parts tester is 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.649
 according to the norm not a swallowable 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.479
 small parts 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.270
 pose a particularly high risk 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.040
 especially peanuts 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.990
 without the small parts tester is 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.390
 obviously that the peanut one 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.280
 swallowable small parts is still 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.229
 it comes terrifyingly very much 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.299
 often due to choking attacks 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.459
 peanuts because they are smooth 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.800
 the surface is particularly deep through the mouth 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.740
 but also through the nose into the respiratory tract 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.030
 reach 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.010
 Protect your child from this danger 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.660
 and keep them all swallowable 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.380
 small parts outside its reach 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.380
