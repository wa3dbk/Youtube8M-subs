00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
you know in some way shape shape or form

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.350 
you know in some way shape shape or form
I<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.110> live<00:02:17.530> vicariously<00:02:18.310> through<00:02:18.760> these<00:02:19.120> guys

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
I I live vicariously through these guys

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.550 
I I live vicariously through these guys
and<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:22.000> know<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.240> have<00:02:22.330> played<00:02:22.570> a<00:02:22.600> small<00:02:23.410> part

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
and you know to have played a small part

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.480 
and you know to have played a small part
in<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.040> really<00:02:24.880> means<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.150> lot<00:02:26.310> well<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.340> think

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
in it really means a lot well I think

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.810 
in it really means a lot well I think
it's<00:02:27.820> uh<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:29.290> was<00:02:29.470> our<00:02:29.620> goal<00:02:29.890> five<00:02:30.400> years<00:02:30.640> ago

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
it's uh it was our goal five years ago

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.790 
it's uh it was our goal five years ago
to<00:02:31.000> build<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.570> program<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:32.230> could<00:02:32.380> compete

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
to build a program that could compete

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.590 
to build a program that could compete
for<00:02:32.980> national<00:02:33.310> championship<00:02:33.850> but<00:02:34.180> but<00:02:34.480> we

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
for national championship but but we

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.050 
for national championship but but we
also<00:02:34.750> wanted<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.230> create<00:02:35.740> a<00:02:35.770> brand<00:02:36.100> unique

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
also wanted to create a brand unique

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.590 
also wanted to create a brand unique
brand<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:38.650> akron<00:02:38.980> soccer<00:02:39.300> where<00:02:40.300> people

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
brand for akron soccer where people

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.840 
brand for akron soccer where people
would<00:02:40.720> understand<00:02:41.320> that<00:02:42.220> we<00:02:42.430> were<00:02:42.550> trying<00:02:42.700> to

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
would understand that we were trying to

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.850 
would understand that we were trying to
also<00:02:43.000> play<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.870> game<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.140> right<00:02:44.170> way<00:02:44.320> track

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
also play the game the right way track

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.670 
also play the game the right way track
this<00:02:45.040> attack<00:02:45.550> oriented<00:02:46.090> football<00:02:46.680> and

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
this attack oriented football and

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.830 
this attack oriented football and
develop<00:02:48.280> players<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.300> think<00:02:49.330> we've<00:02:49.600> proven

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
develop players and I think we've proven

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.930 
develop players and I think we've proven
that<00:02:49.960> over<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.320> last<00:02:50.440> four<00:02:50.740> years<00:02:50.770> having<00:02:51.670> 12

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
that over the last four years having 12

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.410 
that over the last four years having 12
players<00:02:52.600> move<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:53.910> eight<00:02:54.910> in<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.150> first<00:02:55.270> round

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
players move on eight in the first round

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.280 
players move on eight in the first round
and<00:02:56.070> eight<00:02:57.240> underclassmen<00:02:58.240> leaving<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:58.780> think

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
and eight underclassmen leaving I think

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.560 
and eight underclassmen leaving I think
it<00:02:59.410> shows<00:02:59.620> that<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.670> know<00:03:00.790> our<00:03:01.090> culture<00:03:01.540> is

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
it shows that you know our culture is

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.690 
it shows that you know our culture is
there<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.650> our<00:03:02.710> players<00:03:03.010> are<00:03:03.220> coming<00:03:03.550> into

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
there that our players are coming into

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.190 
there that our players are coming into
the<00:03:03.880> program<00:03:04.030> obviously<00:03:04.540> its<00:03:04.900> talented

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
the program obviously its talented

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.510 
the program obviously its talented
players<00:03:05.440> but<00:03:05.680> they're<00:03:05.770> also<00:03:05.950> getting<00:03:06.190> better

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
players but they're also getting better

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.150 
players but they're also getting better
while<00:03:07.240> they're<00:03:07.390> in<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.570> program<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.440> think

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
while they're in the program and I think

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.860 
while they're in the program and I think
it's<00:03:09.250> because<00:03:09.400> they're<00:03:09.760> encouraged<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.209> get

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
it's because they're encouraged to get

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.199 
it's because they're encouraged to get
on<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.110> ball<00:03:11.580> so<00:03:12.580> technically<00:03:13.000> they're

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
on the ball so technically they're

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.190 
on the ball so technically they're
developing<00:03:13.750> they're<00:03:14.530> gaining<00:03:14.830> composure<00:03:15.250> and

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
developing they're gaining composure and

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.020 
developing they're gaining composure and
you<00:03:17.200> know<00:03:17.320> because<00:03:17.709> tactically<00:03:18.400> we<00:03:18.610> require

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
you know because tactically we require

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.729 
you know because tactically we require
them<00:03:19.300> to<00:03:19.330> work<00:03:19.690> on<00:03:19.900> their<00:03:20.020> movement<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.650> their

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
them to work on their movement and their

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.199 
them to work on their movement and their
spacing<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.430> their<00:03:21.550> awareness<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:22.120> each

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
spacing and their awareness of each

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.930 
spacing and their awareness of each
other<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:23.080> combination<00:03:23.440> play<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:24.280> think<00:03:24.850> they

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
other the combination play I think they

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.170 
other the combination play I think they
develop<00:03:25.530> tactically<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:27.640> in<00:03:27.790> addition<00:03:27.910> to

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
develop tactically and in addition to

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.930 
develop tactically and in addition to
that<00:03:28.420> we<00:03:29.260> want<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.500> press<00:03:29.739> when<00:03:30.010> we<00:03:30.160> lose<00:03:30.760> the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
that we want to press when we lose the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.940 
that we want to press when we lose the
ball<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.390> solar<00:03:31.900> they<00:03:32.260> have<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:32.530> be<00:03:32.650> honest

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
ball and solar they have to be honest

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.120 
ball and solar they have to be honest
defensively<00:03:33.459> and<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.720> with<00:03:34.930> us<00:03:35.080> winning<00:03:35.320> so

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
defensively and and with us winning so

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.740 
defensively and and with us winning so
many<00:03:36.310> games<00:03:36.520> over<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.880> last<00:03:36.940> few<00:03:37.270> years<00:03:37.330> I

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
many games over the last few years I

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.780 
many games over the last few years I
think<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:38.500> doesn't<00:03:38.890> hurt<00:03:39.010> as<00:03:39.190> well<00:03:39.220> because

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
think that doesn't hurt as well because

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.850 
think that doesn't hurt as well because
they<00:03:39.940> they<00:03:40.390> have<00:03:40.570> a<00:03:40.600> confidence<00:03:41.050> to<00:03:41.350> their<00:03:41.530> to

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
they they have a confidence to their to

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.729 
they they have a confidence to their to
them<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:42.850> think<00:03:42.910> they<00:03:43.900> have<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.440> winning

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
them and I think they have a winning

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.590 
them and I think they have a winning
mentality<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.120> these<00:03:46.270> are<00:03:46.450> the

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
mentality and so these are the

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.199 
mentality and so these are the
ingredients<00:03:46.959> that<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.739> think<00:03:48.070> any<00:03:48.700> coach<00:03:49.000> is

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
ingredients that I think any coach is

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.520 
ingredients that I think any coach is
looking<00:03:49.360> for<00:03:49.720> at<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:49.900> next<00:03:50.110> level<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.410> I

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
looking for at the next level and I

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.860 
looking for at the next level and I
think<00:03:50.709> it's<00:03:50.830> a<00:03:50.890> big<00:03:51.040> reason<00:03:51.190> why<00:03:51.480> mls<00:03:52.480> coaches

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
think it's a big reason why mls coaches

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:02.620 
think it's a big reason why mls coaches
have<00:03:53.020> wanted<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.380> draft<00:03:53.650> Akron<00:03:54.130> players

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.690 

you
