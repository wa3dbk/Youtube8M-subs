00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.380
 Emeraude I would pick it up, it's not that strong either. 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.060

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.020

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.070
 the first mega sharp than me 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.740

 water and dark and omega sharp du it's that 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.780
 suffers more of the time still the old and 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.400
 rated with a brutal pokémon but 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.770
 I do not know what that means but it is very 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.870
 crazy and matched the magma team's mega 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.300

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.830
 ground 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.150
 but this is not the coolest part of it to 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.610
 part of him is that he has a 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.690
 A huge volcano on the back is coming out 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.280

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.780

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.930
 fighter 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.330
 This Pokémon is going to have my team. 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.460
 being sure because the law 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.039

 in that bush is connected and the handle 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.960
 little thief very strong with him terrier 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.120

 Punishes him nothing is too cool, too. 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.780
 he is normal the fighter is a little well 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.409
 but it is very interesting to have 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.259
 no time 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:54.120
 mega audi no I always found aldino 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.860
 a good pokemon for you to kill, right? 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.469
 You killed the money to pick up the coin. 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.000
 the metal dino makes you have and he 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:01.500

 he's good he's normal he's a 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:08.430
 pokémon but with the ability to heal 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.289
 This is really cool, but I guess 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.389
 that the pokémon that they most strive 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.639
 to make an even time design is a 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.639
 Mega ahead if the Pokemon that 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.919
 was given in the event of the Pokémon x and y 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.930
 Omega rubial with his daughter is he was 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.060

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.729

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:38.190

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.729
