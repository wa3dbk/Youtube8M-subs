00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
bad since I took I planned it perfectly

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.179 
bad since I took I planned it perfectly

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:37.999 
sensation in your stomach after the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:41.169 
sensation in your stomach after the
surgery<00:01:39.219> but<00:01:40.219> there's<00:01:40.459> some<00:01:40.700> parts<00:01:40.999> of<00:01:41.119> my

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
surgery but there's some parts of my

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.529 
surgery but there's some parts of my
stomach<00:01:41.780> that<00:01:42.229> I<00:01:42.530> can<00:01:43.490> touch<00:01:43.700> over<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.209> with<00:01:44.359> my

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
stomach that I can touch over it with my

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.809 
stomach that I can touch over it with my
finger<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.049> I<00:01:45.259> can<00:01:45.469> kind<00:01:45.740> of<00:01:45.829> feel<00:01:45.889> it<00:01:46.159> so<00:01:46.579> I

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
finger and I can kind of feel it so I

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.120 
finger and I can kind of feel it so I
guess<00:01:47.420> that's<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.719> good<00:01:47.749> thing<00:01:47.929> so<00:01:48.469> I'm<00:01:48.740> kind<00:01:49.039> of

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
guess that's a good thing so I'm kind of

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.629 
guess that's a good thing so I'm kind of
happy<00:01:49.310> about<00:01:49.459> that<00:01:50.109> um<00:01:51.109> and<00:01:51.499> that's<00:01:52.219> it<00:01:52.429> for

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:52.639 
happy about that um and that's it for

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:56.739 
happy about that um and that's it for
now<00:01:52.789> so<00:01:53.179> I<00:01:53.509> guess<00:01:54.469> it's<00:01:54.679> day<00:01:55.009> 2<00:01:55.909> or<00:01:55.939> 3<00:01:56.299> I<00:01:56.600> don't
