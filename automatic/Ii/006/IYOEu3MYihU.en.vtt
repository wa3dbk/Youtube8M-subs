the multi-talented Peavy Viper amps we
looked<00:00:19.170> at<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:20.539> effects<00:00:21.539> sections<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
looked at the effects sections and the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.279 
looked at the effects sections and the
amp<00:00:23.130> modeling<00:00:23.699> options<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.630> our<00:00:24.720> first<00:00:25.050> video

amp modeling options in our first video
and<00:00:25.529> now<00:00:26.130> we're<00:00:26.250> going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> take<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> look<00:00:26.849> at

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
and now we're going to take a look at

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.880 
and now we're going to take a look at
the<00:00:27.300> other<00:00:27.539> half<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.320> front<00:00:28.590> control

section the EQ settings and also access
to<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.110> individual<00:00:34.649> effects<00:00:35.160> parameters

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
to the individual effects parameters

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.959 
to the individual effects parameters
editing<00:00:36.680> so<00:00:37.680> by<00:00:37.890> default<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.489> section<00:00:38.820> over

editing so by default this section over

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.910 
editing so by default this section over
here<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.210> basically<00:00:39.420> our<00:00:39.629> amp<00:00:39.809> controls<00:00:40.410> we've

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
here is basically our amp controls we've

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.250 
here is basically our amp controls we've
got<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> pre<00:00:41.340> gain<00:00:41.550> our<00:00:41.969> 3<00:00:42.270> band<00:00:42.480> EQ<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:43.050> low

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
got a pre gain our 3 band EQ here low

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.389 
got a pre gain our 3 band EQ here low
mid<00:00:43.410> high<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.219> post-game<00:00:45.649> let's<00:00:46.649> just

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
mid high and a post-game let's just

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.819 
mid high and a post-game let's just
listen<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.989> let's<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.110> let's<00:00:49.320> listen<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
listen to let's see let's listen to the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.209 
listen to let's see let's listen to the
plexi<00:00:50.870> well<00:00:51.870> put<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.199> into<00:00:52.469> high<00:00:52.739> gain<00:00:52.980> mode

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
plexi well put it into high gain mode

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.400 
plexi well put it into high gain mode
and<00:00:53.460> we'll<00:00:54.300> turn<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.629> gain<00:00:54.809> down<00:00:54.840> here<00:00:55.289> you

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and we'll turn the gain down here you

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.410 
and we'll turn the gain down here you
can<00:00:55.530> kind<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.800> get<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> sense<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> variety

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
can kind of get a sense of the variety

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:11.620 
can kind of get a sense of the variety
of<00:00:57.840> game<00:00:58.410> tow

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.080 

now<00:01:12.630> you'll<00:01:12.780> notice<00:01:12.960> when<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.200> switch<00:01:13.440> between

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
now you'll notice when I switch between

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.380 
now you'll notice when I switch between
channels<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.320> amp<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:17.400> EQ<00:01:17.850> settings<00:01:18.180> are

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
channels on the amp the EQ settings are

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.870 
channels on the amp the EQ settings are
different<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.260> you<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.010> a<00:01:20.370> different

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
different so you really have a different

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.840 
different so you really have a different
EQ<00:01:21.120> descending<00:01:21.510> for<00:01:21.780> each<00:01:21.930> channel<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.729> you've

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
EQ descending for each channel so you've

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.750 
EQ descending for each channel so you've
got<00:01:23.970> 24<00:01:24.330> different<00:01:24.479> EQ<00:01:25.020> settings<00:01:25.729> quite<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
got 24 different EQ settings quite a

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.640 
got 24 different EQ settings quite a
it's<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:27.780> nice<00:01:27.960> what<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.350> want<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
it's it's nice what if you want to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.190 
it's it's nice what if you want to
switch<00:01:28.860> between<00:01:29.010> amps<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.020> well<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.170> just

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
switch between amps and well it's just

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.830 
switch between amps and well it's just
nice<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.650> those<00:01:31.860> eq's<00:01:32.600> preset<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.750> each

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
nice to have those eq's preset for each

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.560 
nice to have those eq's preset for each
channel<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.350> each<00:01:34.470> amp<00:01:34.740> now<00:01:35.550> if<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.150> click<00:01:36.420> on

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
channel on each amp now if we click on

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.330 
channel on each amp now if we click on
let's<00:01:37.560> say<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> effect<00:01:38.280> button<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:39.210> editing

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
let's say the effect button for editing

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.219 
let's say the effect button for editing
now<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:42.149> function<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.630> these<00:01:42.780> buttons

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
now the function of these buttons

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.350 
now the function of these buttons
corresponds<00:01:44.160> to<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.369> labels<00:01:44.640> below<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.210> we've

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
corresponds to the labels below so we've

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.139 
corresponds to the labels below so we've
got<00:01:45.570> parameters<00:01:46.410> 1<00:01:46.710> &amp;<00:01:46.920> 2<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.670> effects

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
got parameters 1 &amp; 2 for the effects

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.840 
got parameters 1 &amp; 2 for the effects
let's<00:01:49.110> actually<00:01:49.500> let's<00:01:49.830> select<00:01:50.310> an<00:01:50.490> effect

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
let's actually let's select an effect

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.130 
let's actually let's select an effect
here<00:01:50.940> so<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.330> hear<00:01:51.450> let's<00:01:51.630> there's<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
here so we can hear let's there's the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:03.320 
here so we can hear let's there's the
phaser<00:01:52.410> on<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.800> effects<00:01:53.790> side<00:02:02.330> modulation

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
phaser on the effects side modulation

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.120 
phaser on the effects side modulation
effects<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:04.020> basically<00:02:04.350> parameter<00:02:04.860> 1<00:02:05.009> is

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
effects it's basically parameter 1 is

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.830 
effects it's basically parameter 1 is
usually<00:02:05.399> speed<00:02:05.670> parameter<00:02:05.940> 2<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.539> usually

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
usually speed parameter 2 is usually

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.650 
usually speed parameter 2 is usually
depth<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:08.610> also<00:02:08.729> how<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.030> access<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
depth and it's also how you access the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.590 
depth and it's also how you access the
delay<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:11.190> reverb<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:12.180> let's<00:02:12.360> bring<00:02:12.510> up

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
delay and the reverb so let's bring up

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.980 
delay and the reverb so let's bring up
the<00:02:12.720> reverb<00:02:13.080> level<00:02:17.270> okay<00:02:18.270> bring<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.690> back

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
the reverb level okay bring that back

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:27.490 
the reverb level okay bring that back
down<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.980> let's<00:02:20.220> bring<00:02:20.370> up<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.700> delay<00:02:21.150> level

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:36.980 

you<00:02:28.500> can<00:02:28.620> adjust<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.069> feedback<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:35.990> we've

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
you can adjust the feedback and we've

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:53.509 
you can adjust the feedback and we've
got<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.170> tap<00:02:37.560> tempo<00:02:37.860> here

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.770 

so<00:02:54.519> that's<00:02:54.670> how<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.849> edit<00:02:55.030> all<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.359> effects

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
so that's how you edit all the effects

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.349 
so that's how you edit all the effects
and<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.959> different<00:02:56.650> amp<00:02:56.799> settings<00:02:57.159> there

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
and the different amp settings there

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.000 
and the different amp settings there
over<00:02:58.359> here<00:02:58.959> all<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.500> way<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.739> right<00:02:59.890> we've

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
over here all the way to the right we've

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.589 
over here all the way to the right we've
got<00:03:00.159> our<00:03:00.250> master<00:03:00.609> volume<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:01.209> then<00:03:01.480> right

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
got our master volume and then right

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.240 
got our master volume and then right
here<00:03:01.629> we've<00:03:01.930> got<00:03:02.049> our<00:03:02.109> auxiliary<00:03:02.739> section

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
here we've got our auxiliary section

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.860 
here we've got our auxiliary section
there's<00:03:03.430> an<00:03:03.519> auxiliary<00:03:03.819> input<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.510> there's

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
there's an auxiliary input and there's

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.960 
there's an auxiliary input and there's
also<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.200> recording<00:03:05.799> output<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.489> a<00:03:06.519> headphone

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
also a recording output and a headphone

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.349 
also a recording output and a headphone
output<00:03:07.319> there<00:03:08.319> so<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.340> can<00:03:09.549> use<00:03:09.760> this<00:03:09.939> amp<00:03:10.180> as

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
output there so you can use this amp as

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.809 
output there so you can use this amp as
a<00:03:10.420> recording<00:03:11.049> amp<00:03:11.349> so<00:03:12.069> now<00:03:12.189> we<00:03:12.250> were<00:03:12.459> looking

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
a recording amp so now we were looking

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.300 
a recording amp so now we were looking
at<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.150> front<00:03:13.389> panel<00:03:13.689> of<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.200> Viper<00:03:14.590> 30

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
at the front panel of the Viper 30

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.250 
at the front panel of the Viper 30
before<00:03:15.819> now<00:03:16.540> we're<00:03:16.689> looking<00:03:16.810> at<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.079> front

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
before now we're looking at the front

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.729 
before now we're looking at the front
panel<00:03:17.560> of<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.739> Viper<00:03:18.069> 75<00:03:19.019> which<00:03:20.019> adds<00:03:20.290> two

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
panel of the Viper 75 which adds two

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.220 
panel of the Viper 75 which adds two
things<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.430> adds<00:03:21.760> well<00:03:22.540> other<00:03:23.439> than<00:03:24.870> 45<00:03:25.870> watts

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
things it adds well other than 45 watts

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.699 
things it adds well other than 45 watts
of<00:03:26.409> power<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.889> adds<00:03:27.069> a<00:03:27.720> USB<00:03:28.720> recording<00:03:28.900> output

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
of power it adds a USB recording output

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.360 
of power it adds a USB recording output
here<00:03:29.919> so<00:03:30.129> now<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.489> ant<00:03:31.000> becomes<00:03:31.659> a<00:03:32.370> USB

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
here so now this ant becomes a USB

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.970 
here so now this ant becomes a USB
recording<00:03:33.549> interface<00:03:34.180> for<00:03:34.629> your<00:03:34.750> guitar<00:03:34.980> and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
recording interface for your guitar and

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.580 
recording interface for your guitar and
it<00:03:36.129> also<00:03:36.310> adds<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:37.180> thing<00:03:37.419> right<00:03:38.169> here<00:03:38.200> which

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
it also adds this thing right here which

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.679 
it also adds this thing right here which
is<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.799> power<00:03:39.099> sponge<00:03:39.579> and<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.180> power<00:03:40.359> sponge

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
is a power sponge and the power sponge

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:46.229 
is a power sponge and the power sponge
basically<00:03:41.250> simulates<00:03:43.169> lower<00:03:44.169> wattage<00:03:45.239> being

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
basically simulates lower wattage being

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.680 
basically simulates lower wattage being
delivered<00:03:46.629> to<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.019> power<00:03:47.290> session<00:03:47.939> so<00:03:48.939> it's

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
delivered to the power session so it's

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.500 
delivered to the power session so it's
it's<00:03:50.260> basically<00:03:50.560> not<00:03:51.489> sagging<00:03:51.819> tubes<00:03:52.239> but

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
it's basically not sagging tubes but

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.490 
it's basically not sagging tubes but
it's<00:03:52.629> you<00:03:52.810> can<00:03:52.930> kind<00:03:53.109> of<00:03:53.199> decrease<00:03:53.709> the

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
it's you can kind of decrease the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.869 
it's you can kind of decrease the
perceived<00:03:56.500> power<00:03:56.889> being<00:03:57.310> supplied<00:03:57.639> to<00:03:57.790> the

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
perceived power being supplied to the

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.990 
perceived power being supplied to the
power<00:03:58.060> section<00:03:58.419> let's<00:03:59.109> listen<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.280> what<00:04:00.819> that

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
power section let's listen to what that

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.719 
power section let's listen to what that
sounds<00:04:01.150> like<00:04:01.569> so<00:04:02.260> now<00:04:02.769> first<00:04:03.190> we've<00:04:03.370> got<00:04:03.549> the

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:03.729 
sounds like so now first we've got the

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:26.090 
sounds like so now first we've got the
power<00:04:03.940> sponge<00:04:04.359> at<00:04:04.780> 100%

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:34.450 

now<00:04:27.100> let's<00:04:27.310> decrease<00:04:27.729> it<00:04:27.910> here

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:54.159 

very<00:04:35.210> subtle<00:04:35.930> difference

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.379 

it<00:04:54.800> almost<00:04:54.949> just<00:04:55.249> affects<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.819> perceived

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
it almost just affects the perceived

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.010 
it almost just affects the perceived
loudness<00:04:57.189> but<00:04:58.189> it's<00:04:58.419> simulating<00:04:59.419> a<00:04:59.539> lower

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
loudness but it's simulating a lower

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.760 
loudness but it's simulating a lower
power<00:05:00.349> supply<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:01.129> same<00:05:01.370> power<00:05:01.639> session

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
power supply to the same power session

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.230 
power supply to the same power session
so<00:05:03.770> that's<00:05:03.949> the<00:05:04.099> only<00:05:04.219> thing<00:05:04.340> those<00:05:05.060> are<00:05:05.180> the

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
so that's the only thing those are the

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.649 
so that's the only thing those are the
only<00:05:05.330> two<00:05:05.569> things<00:05:05.779> that<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.319> PB<00:05:07.009> 75<00:05:07.759> adds<00:05:08.180> over

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:08.659 
only two things that the PB 75 adds over

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:09.369 
only two things that the PB 75 adds over
the<00:05:08.930> 30

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:09.379 
the 30

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:11.529 
the 30
except<00:05:09.620> for<00:05:09.710> wattage<00:05:10.099> obviously<00:05:10.610> so<00:05:11.270> here's

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
except for wattage obviously so here's

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:12.700 
except for wattage obviously so here's
the<00:05:11.749> Viper

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
the Viper

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.730 
the Viper
75<00:05:13.340> in<00:05:13.669> all<00:05:13.969> its<00:05:14.150> glory<00:05:14.479> as<00:05:15.349> you<00:05:15.469> can<00:05:15.590> see

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
75 in all its glory as you can see

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.219 
75 in all its glory as you can see
compared<00:05:16.069> to<00:05:16.159> the<00:05:16.279> 30<00:05:16.610> here<00:05:16.999> slightly<00:05:17.840> bigger

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
compared to the 30 here slightly bigger

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.550 
compared to the 30 here slightly bigger
much<00:05:18.949> more<00:05:19.219> powerful<00:05:20.080> that<00:05:21.080> wasn't<00:05:21.349> just<00:05:21.499> a

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
much more powerful that wasn't just a

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.890 
much more powerful that wasn't just a
perspective<00:05:21.949> thing<00:05:22.419> we're<00:05:23.419> also<00:05:23.569> gonna<00:05:23.719> take

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
perspective thing we're also gonna take

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.399 
perspective thing we're also gonna take
a<00:05:23.960> look<00:05:24.110> at<00:05:24.349> the<00:05:24.529> tube<00:05:25.069> 60<00:05:25.849> the<00:05:26.419> tube<00:05:26.659> Viper<00:05:26.900> 60

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
para control pedals that we've been

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.510 
para control pedals that we've been
using<00:05:34.909> for<00:05:35.749> all<00:05:36.379> these<00:05:36.529> demos<00:05:37.039> to<00:05:37.339> switch
