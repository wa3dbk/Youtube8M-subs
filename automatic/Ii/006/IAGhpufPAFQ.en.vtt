night<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.370> spoke<00:00:50.819> a<00:00:50.940> little<00:00:51.059> bit<00:00:51.179> about<00:00:51.449> your

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
night you spoke a little bit about your

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.180 
night you spoke a little bit about your
animals<00:00:51.960> being<00:00:52.170> co-laborers

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
animals being co-laborers

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.860 
animals being co-laborers
it's<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:53.879> interesting<00:00:54.059> concept<00:00:54.510> talk<00:00:54.839> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
it's a really interesting concept talk a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.559 
it's a really interesting concept talk a
little<00:00:55.079> bit<00:00:55.199> about<00:00:55.229> that<00:00:55.589> sure

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:56.569 
little bit about that sure

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:58.700 
little bit about that sure
ok<00:00:57.569> so<00:00:57.629> part<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.229> building<00:00:58.620> these

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
ok so part of building these

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.239 
ok so part of building these
relationships<00:00:58.940> is<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.960> allow<00:01:01.409> the<00:01:01.859> different

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:02.249 
relationships is to allow the different

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.910 
relationships is to allow the different
plants<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.670> animals<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.710> express<00:01:04.710> their

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
plants and animals to express their

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.160 
plants and animals to express their

American farming we don't we simply are

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.520 
American farming we don't we simply are
trying<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.579> produce<00:01:17.729> more<00:01:18.539> pounds<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.049> bacon

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
no thought to the role that that animal

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.819 
no thought to the role that that animal
or<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.990> plant<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:29.070> fill<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.420> functional<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.710> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
or a plant can fill in a functional in a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.760 
or a plant can fill in a functional in a
functional<00:01:32.219> niche<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:34.409> example<00:01:34.680> we

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
functional niche and so for example we

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.770 
functional niche and so for example we
followed<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> cows<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.359> egg<00:01:36.479> mobile

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
followed the cows with the egg mobile

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.830 
followed the cows with the egg mobile
and<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.920> chickens<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> Egret<00:01:39.659> on

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
and the chickens then like the Egret on

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.620 
and the chickens then like the Egret on
the<00:01:39.960> Rhinos<00:01:40.380> nose<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.979> nature<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the Rhinos nose in nature the the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.910 
the Rhinos nose in nature the the
chickens<00:01:42.990> did<00:01:43.140> scratch<00:01:43.409> through<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> cow

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
chickens did scratch through the cow

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.090 
chickens did scratch through the cow
patties<00:01:44.219> eat<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> fly<00:01:45.090> larvae<00:01:45.829> push<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
patties eat out the fly larvae push the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.789 
patties eat out the fly larvae push the
scratch<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.670> dung<00:01:47.909> into<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> into<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.469> soil

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
scratch the dung into the into the soil

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.609 
scratch the dung into the into the soil
on<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:50.490> much<00:01:50.789> wider<00:01:51.030> area<00:01:51.149> obviously<00:01:52.049> than<00:01:52.259> than

on a much wider area obviously than than

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.010 
on a much wider area obviously than than

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
just the paddy to begin with and so

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.349 
just the paddy to begin with and so
there's<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.289> balanced<00:01:55.920> nutrition<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> soil

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
there's a balanced nutrition to the soil

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:01.880 
there's a balanced nutrition to the soil
there's<00:01:58.170> an<00:01:58.829> insecticide<00:02:00.530> principle<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.649> grub

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
there's an insecticide principle a grub

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.760

the grasshoppers and crickets which

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.969

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
nutrient-dense eggs than you can ever

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.920 
nutrient-dense eggs than you can ever
get<00:02:13.980> in<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> factory<00:02:14.849> caged

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
get in a factory caged

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.949 
get in a factory caged
arming<00:02:16.170> situation<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.579> the<00:02:18.359> the<00:02:18.569> chickens

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
arming situation and so the the chickens

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.099 
arming situation and so the the chickens
then<00:02:19.140> save<00:02:19.439> us<00:02:19.709> from<00:02:20.519> having<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:21.000> run<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.930> cows

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
then save us from having to run the cows

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:23.720 
then save us from having to run the cows
through<00:02:22.349> a<00:02:22.379> head<00:02:22.590> gate<00:02:22.859> and<00:02:23.129> give<00:02:23.340> them<00:02:23.489> grub<00:02:23.700> a
