thing<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.390> thing<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.690> waiter<00:00:54.930> was

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
thing the one thing this waiter was

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.319 
thing the one thing this waiter was
really<00:00:55.469> claim<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.730> reason<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
really claim to do and the reason that

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.060 
really claim to do and the reason that
that<00:00:57.690> they<00:00:57.840> really<00:00:58.109> designed<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.800> waiter

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that they really designed this waiter

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.610 
that they really designed this waiter
the<00:00:59.309> way<00:00:59.399> they<00:00:59.579> did<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.780> has<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> lining<00:01:01.350> they

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the way they did is it has a lining they

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.240 
the way they did is it has a lining they
call<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.210> 37.5<00:01:03.210> technology<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.650> lining

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
call it 37.5 technology so that lining

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.210 
call it 37.5 technology so that lining
right<00:01:05.280> there<00:01:05.700> has<00:01:06.830> apparently<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:08.010> made

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
right there has apparently it's made

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.070 
right there has apparently it's made
with<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.580> some<00:01:09.150> material<00:01:09.630> that's<00:01:09.659> found<00:01:09.960> in

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
with like some material that's found in

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.920 
with like some material that's found in
coconut<00:01:10.260> skins<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.979> guess<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:12.150> really<00:01:12.689> breaks

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
coconut skins I guess that really breaks

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.100 
coconut skins I guess that really breaks
water<00:01:13.260> up<00:01:13.590> into<00:01:14.310> tiny<00:01:14.490> molecules<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.509> allows

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
water up into tiny molecules and allows

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.410 
water up into tiny molecules and allows
the<00:01:16.380> waiter<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:17.310> transfer<00:01:17.790> moisture<00:01:18.210> from

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the waiter to transfer moisture from

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.600 
the waiter to transfer moisture from
inside<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.290> waiter<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.799> outside<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.430> waiter

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
inside the waiter to outside the waiter

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.060 
inside the waiter to outside the waiter

heat inside the cold water on the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.460 
heat inside the cold water on the
outside<00:01:26.520> there's<00:01:27.479> natural<00:01:27.869> condensation

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
outside there's natural condensation

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.899 
outside there's natural condensation
that<00:01:28.530> occurs<00:01:28.829> then<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.250> perspiration

or exertion the Reddington I think's a

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.810 
or exertion the Reddington I think's a
better<00:05:29.360> choice<00:05:29.600> for<00:05:30.110> doing<00:05:30.260> a<00:05:30.320> lot<00:05:30.350> of<00:05:30.530> walking

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
better choice for doing a lot of walking
