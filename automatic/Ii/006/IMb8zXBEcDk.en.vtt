in a straight line when you're when

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.470 
in a straight line when you're when
you're<00:00:54.899> riding<00:00:55.190> beyond<00:00:56.190> de<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.640> wave<00:00:56.850> breaks

those<00:00:57.690> vibrations<00:00:58.219> dampens<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> ride<00:00:59.730> and

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
those vibrations dampens the ride and

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.790 
those vibrations dampens the ride and
those<00:01:00.180> vibrations<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.170> come<00:01:01.350> up<00:01:01.379> towards

those vibrations as they come up towards
the<00:01:01.890> body<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> really<00:01:03.030> really

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the body so you have a really really

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.270 
the body so you have a really really
smooth<00:01:03.510> ride<00:01:03.750> while<00:01:04.019> having<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.379> rigid<00:01:04.559> carbon

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280

fiber<00:01:05.460> frame<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:07.170> also<00:01:07.320> had<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.560> same

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
fiber frame you also had that same

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.219 
fiber frame you also had that same
system<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.369> rear<00:01:08.630> you<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.750> an<00:01:09.840> oversized

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
system in the rear you have an oversized

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.750 
system in the rear you have an oversized
tubing<00:01:10.770> which<00:01:10.979> gives<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> bike<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> really

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
tubing which gives the bike a really

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.820 
tubing which gives the bike a really
aggressive<00:01:11.939> look<00:01:12.330> people<00:01:12.659> really<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.680> that

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
aggressive look people really like that

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.780 
aggressive look people really like that
look<00:01:13.890> now<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:15.240> carbon<00:01:15.479> fiber<00:01:15.630> frames<00:01:16.790> very
