00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
the violin whereas the other one just

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.869 
the violin whereas the other one just
had<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.650> looked<00:03:17.980> nice<00:03:18.129> as<00:03:18.370> well<00:03:18.489> but<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.760> just

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
had it looked nice as well but it just

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.490 
had it looked nice as well but it just
had<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.120> grain<00:03:19.359> on<00:03:19.599> the<00:03:19.810> front<00:03:20.079> you<00:03:20.290> didn't

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
had the grain on the front you didn't

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.410 
had the grain on the front you didn't
have<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.799> was<00:03:20.890> just<00:03:21.069> plain<00:03:21.189> on<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.519> sides<00:03:21.760> and

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
have it was just plain on the sides and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.880 
have it was just plain on the sides and
it<00:03:22.569> was<00:03:22.659> just<00:03:22.780> plain<00:03:22.989> on<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.200> back<00:03:23.349> as<00:03:23.530> well<00:03:23.560> so

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
it was just plain on the back as well so

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.990 
it was just plain on the back as well so
this<00:03:24.010> is<00:03:24.069> how<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.400> one<00:03:24.579> has<00:03:24.730> grain

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
this is how this one has grain

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.030 
this is how this one has grain
everywhere<00:03:25.540> this<00:03:26.140> is<00:03:26.319> slightly<00:03:26.470> lighter<00:03:26.709> in

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
everywhere this is slightly lighter in

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.559 
everywhere this is slightly lighter in
color<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.609> doesn't<00:03:27.819> particularly<00:03:28.120> make<00:03:28.359> any

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
color it doesn't particularly make any

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.660 
color it doesn't particularly make any
difference<00:03:28.959> just<00:03:29.349> a<00:03:29.530> different<00:03:29.859> type<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.370> wood

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
difference just a different type of wood

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.330 
difference just a different type of wood
so<00:03:31.359> overall<00:03:31.959> it<00:03:32.200> looks<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.620> feels<00:03:32.829> really

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
so overall it looks and feels really

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.839 
so overall it looks and feels really
nice<00:03:33.930> it's<00:03:34.930> it's<00:03:35.560> it's<00:03:36.250> weighted<00:03:36.670> quite

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
nice it's it's it's weighted quite

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.520 
nice it's it's it's weighted quite
nicely<00:03:37.060> as<00:03:37.359> well<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.840> bow<00:03:37.989> that<00:03:38.200> you've<00:03:38.319> got

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
nicely as well the bow that you've got

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.379 
nicely as well the bow that you've got
isn't<00:03:38.859> too<00:03:39.010> bad<00:03:39.190> either<00:03:39.430> it's<00:03:39.730> just<00:03:40.000> standard

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
isn't too bad either it's just standard

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.890 
isn't too bad either it's just standard
of<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.659> kind<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.170> more<00:03:41.349> of<00:03:41.379> an<00:03:41.500> upgrade<00:03:41.620> bow

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
of a kind of a more of an upgrade bow

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.349 
of a kind of a more of an upgrade bow
and<00:03:43.900> it's<00:03:44.379> it's<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.799> good<00:03:45.010> price<00:03:45.370> for<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:46.150> money

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
and it's it's a good price for the money

everything<00:03:54.340> is<00:03:54.430> just<00:03:54.609> a<00:03:54.760> little<00:03:54.970> bit<00:03:55.120> sort<00:03:55.389> of

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
everything is just a little bit sort of

kind of thing there's that the finish is
a<00:04:01.569> little<00:04:01.810> bit<00:04:01.930> better<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:03.370> everything<00:04:03.849> is

the first one so going on to the cons
about<00:04:14.109> it<00:04:15.299> I'd<00:04:16.299> say<00:04:16.630> as<00:04:17.019> exactly<00:04:17.680> as<00:04:17.799> I<00:04:17.919> said<00:04:18.190> in

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
about it I'd say as exactly as I said in

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.640 
about it I'd say as exactly as I said in
the<00:04:18.639> other<00:04:18.760> violin<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:20.079> names<00:04:20.289> of<00:04:20.560> the

the other violin the names of the

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.279 
the other violin the names of the
violins<00:04:21.039> the<00:04:21.310> Forenza<00:04:21.940> ii<00:04:22.419> Oh<00:04:22.659> could<00:04:23.199> have

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
violins the Forenza ii Oh could have

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.480 
violins the Forenza ii Oh could have
been<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.470> little<00:04:23.590> bit<00:04:23.770> more<00:04:23.800> could<00:04:24.310> have<00:04:24.460> a

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
been a little bit more could have a

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.860 
been a little bit more could have a
little<00:04:24.639> bit<00:04:24.729> more<00:04:24.820> imagination<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.599> them<00:04:25.750> but

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
little bit more imagination to them but

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.540 
little bit more imagination to them but
it's<00:04:25.990> only<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.260> name<00:04:26.500> of<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.710> violin<00:04:27.130> that's

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
it's only the name of the violin that's

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.399 
it's only the name of the violin that's
you<00:04:27.880> know<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.090> isn't<00:04:28.419> really<00:04:28.599> a<00:04:28.720> big<00:04:28.870> deal<00:04:29.020> and

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
you know it isn't really a big deal and

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:30.600 
you know it isn't really a big deal and
it<00:04:29.500> certainly<00:04:29.710> doesn't<00:04:29.889> take<00:04:30.130> away<00:04:30.250> from<00:04:30.340> the

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
it certainly doesn't take away from the

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.750 
it certainly doesn't take away from the
sound<00:04:30.849> or<00:04:31.000> anything<00:04:31.180> like<00:04:31.419> art<00:04:31.630> of<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.840> violin

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
sound or anything like art of the violin

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.939 
sound or anything like art of the violin
and<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:33.849> only<00:04:34.840> other<00:04:34.960> thing<00:04:35.229> or<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.770> only

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
and the only other thing or the only

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.439 
and the only other thing or the only
other<00:04:36.099> comment<00:04:36.280> I<00:04:36.460> could<00:04:36.669> really<00:04:36.970> find<00:04:37.270> was

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
other comment I could really find was

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.330 
other comment I could really find was
that<00:04:37.479> for<00:04:38.229> an<00:04:38.320> upgraded<00:04:38.710> violent<00:04:39.220> this

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
that for an upgraded violent this

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.920 
that for an upgraded violent this
doesn't<00:04:39.639> actually<00:04:39.760> have<00:04:40.060> any<00:04:40.300> of<00:04:40.389> the<00:04:40.510> tuners

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
doesn't actually have any of the tuners

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.320 
doesn't actually have any of the tuners
here<00:04:41.380> which<00:04:42.280> is<00:04:42.400> possibly<00:04:42.729> a<00:04:42.820> little<00:04:42.909> bit<00:04:43.120> of<00:04:43.240> a

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
here which is possibly a little bit of a

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.219 
here which is possibly a little bit of a
shame<00:04:43.599> I<00:04:44.500> think<00:04:45.039> it's<00:04:46.030> is<00:04:46.330> intended<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.080> be

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
shame I think it's is intended to be

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.439 
shame I think it's is intended to be
grade<00:04:47.470> 5<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:47.770> above<00:04:48.220> and<00:04:48.550> if<00:04:48.699> you<00:04:48.729> are<00:04:48.970> grade<00:04:49.210> 5

and above in theory that shouldn't be a

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.649 
and above in theory that shouldn't be a
problem<00:04:51.430> for<00:04:52.000> you<00:04:52.120> because<00:04:52.360> you'll<00:04:52.510> be<00:04:52.570> able

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:52.659 
problem for you because you'll be able

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:53.920 
problem for you because you'll be able
to<00:04:52.810> tune<00:04:53.050> from<00:04:53.229> the

you<00:04:54.200> do<00:04:54.350> have<00:04:54.500> a<00:04:54.560> fine<00:04:54.830> tuna<00:04:55.130> for<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.790> e

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
you do have a fine tuna for the the e

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.630 
you do have a fine tuna for the the e
there's<00:04:56.660> always<00:04:56.950> nearly<00:04:57.950> always<00:04:58.070> fine<00:04:58.400> cheese

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
there's always nearly always fine cheese

there's always nearly always fine cheese
on<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:58.910> Easter<00:04:59.240> eggs<00:04:59.360> anyway<00:04:59.720> because<00:04:59.900> they

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
on the Easter eggs anyway because they

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.570 
on the Easter eggs anyway because they
tend<00:05:00.380> to<00:05:00.440> be<00:05:00.560> thinner<00:05:00.830> so<00:05:01.370> they're<00:05:01.490> much

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
tend to be thinner so they're much

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.640 
tend to be thinner so they're much
easier<00:05:01.640> to<00:05:02.120> potentially<00:05:03.080> break<00:05:03.320> if<00:05:03.500> you're

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
easier to potentially break if you're

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.800 
easier to potentially break if you're
not<00:05:03.770> careful<00:05:03.920> with<00:05:04.250> them<00:05:04.430> but<00:05:05.150> I<00:05:05.180> think<00:05:05.570> if<00:05:05.690> you

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
not careful with them but I think if you

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.350 
not careful with them but I think if you
wanted<00:05:06.260> this<00:05:06.410> as<00:05:06.590> a<00:05:06.620> first<00:05:07.240> violin<00:05:08.240> that

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
wanted this as a first violin that

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.880 
wanted this as a first violin that
you've<00:05:08.510> bought<00:05:08.720> and<00:05:08.960> you<00:05:09.020> just<00:05:09.350> wanted<00:05:09.770> an

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
you've bought and you just wanted an

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.140 
you've bought and you just wanted an
upgrade<00:05:10.280> or<00:05:10.430> you<00:05:10.490> wanted<00:05:10.760> something<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.120> little

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
upgrade or you wanted something a little

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.230 
upgrade or you wanted something a little
bit<00:05:11.420> better<00:05:11.570> immediately<00:05:12.640> then<00:05:13.640> not<00:05:14.000> having

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
bit better immediately then not having

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.090 
bit better immediately then not having
the<00:05:14.390> tuners<00:05:14.750> might<00:05:15.050> just<00:05:15.410> be<00:05:15.500> a<00:05:15.530> little<00:05:15.860> bit<00:05:16.010> of

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
the tuners might just be a little bit of

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.280 
the tuners might just be a little bit of
a<00:05:16.160> problem<00:05:16.580> so<00:05:17.060> it<00:05:17.210> would<00:05:17.420> possibly<00:05:17.930> put<00:05:18.170> me

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
a problem so it would possibly put me

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.570 
a problem so it would possibly put me
off<00:05:18.380> buying<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.830> violin<00:05:19.190> if<00:05:19.310> I<00:05:19.400> was<00:05:19.550> a

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
off buying the violin if I was a

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.000 
off buying the violin if I was a
complete<00:05:19.910> beginner<00:05:20.090> it<00:05:20.900> wouldn't<00:05:21.470> be<00:05:21.620> a<00:05:21.650> big

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
complete beginner it wouldn't be a big

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.090 
complete beginner it wouldn't be a big
deal<00:05:22.040> to<00:05:22.310> have<00:05:22.760> some<00:05:23.030> tuners<00:05:23.390> put<00:05:23.600> on<00:05:23.780> but<00:05:24.620> it

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
deal to have some tuners put on but it

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.590 
deal to have some tuners put on but it
wouldn't<00:05:25.400> necessarily<00:05:25.460> put<00:05:25.910> me<00:05:26.090> off<00:05:26.210> buying<00:05:26.450> a

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
wouldn't necessarily put me off buying a

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.730 
wouldn't necessarily put me off buying a
violin<00:05:26.990> but<00:05:27.200> it<00:05:27.290> might<00:05:27.440> just<00:05:27.590> be<00:05:27.650> something

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
violin but it might just be something

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.830 
violin but it might just be something
just<00:05:28.160> to<00:05:28.250> bear<00:05:28.400> in<00:05:28.490> mind<00:05:28.670> perhaps<00:05:29.600> with<00:05:29.780> the

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
just to bear in mind perhaps with the

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.300 
just to bear in mind perhaps with the
tuning<00:05:30.170> you<00:05:30.290> can<00:05:30.440> still<00:05:30.620> choose<00:05:30.830> perfectly

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
tuning you can still choose perfectly

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.220 
tuning you can still choose perfectly
fine<00:05:31.490> with<00:05:31.700> the<00:05:31.790> pegs<00:05:32.060> but<00:05:32.600> the<00:05:32.690> fine<00:05:32.870> tuners

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
fine with the pegs but the fine tuners

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.990 
fine with the pegs but the fine tuners
do<00:05:33.350> make<00:05:33.500> it<00:05:33.650> a<00:05:33.680> little<00:05:33.800> bit<00:05:33.950> easier<00:05:34.310> but<00:05:34.730> again

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
do make it a little bit easier but again

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.610 
do make it a little bit easier but again
it<00:05:35.210> doesn't<00:05:35.570> take<00:05:35.690> away<00:05:35.720> from<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.170> sound<00:05:36.410> of

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
it doesn't take away from the sound of

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.350 
it doesn't take away from the sound of
the<00:05:36.680> violin<00:05:36.980> I<00:05:37.160> still<00:05:37.430> really<00:05:37.760> like<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.150> sound

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
the violin I still really like the sound

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.330 
the violin I still really like the sound
of<00:05:38.450> the<00:05:38.540> violin<00:05:38.900> everything<00:05:39.830> I<00:05:39.920> said<00:05:40.190> about

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
of the violin everything I said about

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.610 
of the violin everything I said about
the<00:05:41.030> the<00:05:41.360> other<00:05:41.510> violin<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:42.050> the<00:05:42.290> prima

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
the the other violin the the prima

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.860 
the the other violin the the prima
violin<00:05:43.010> this<00:05:43.520> one<00:05:43.730> is<00:05:44.030> pretty<00:05:44.360> much<00:05:44.540> exactly

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
violin this one is pretty much exactly

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.870 
violin this one is pretty much exactly
the<00:05:45.110> same<00:05:45.200> more<00:05:45.830> or<00:05:45.920> less<00:05:46.040> the<00:05:46.190> same<00:05:46.370> in<00:05:46.430> tone

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
the same more or less the same in tone

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.120 
the same more or less the same in tone
but<00:05:47.420> everything<00:05:48.020> is<00:05:48.230> more<00:05:48.650> enhanced

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
but everything is more enhanced

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.230 
but everything is more enhanced
everything's<00:05:49.520> bigger<00:05:49.760> everything's

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
everything's bigger everything's

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.490 
everything's bigger everything's
brighter<00:05:50.480> everything's<00:05:51.290> better

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
brighter everything's better

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.600 
brighter everything's better
everything's<00:05:51.920> smoother<00:05:52.310> everything's

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
everything's smoother everything's

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.490 
everything's smoother everything's
clearer<00:05:52.970> so<00:05:53.630> it's<00:05:53.840> very<00:05:53.990> similar<00:05:54.350> but

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
clearer so it's very similar but

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.230 
clearer so it's very similar but
obviously<00:05:55.070> we're<00:05:55.310> talking<00:05:55.670> like<00:05:55.790> the<00:05:55.910> next

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
obviously we're talking like the next

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.650 
obviously we're talking like the next
the<00:05:56.480> next<00:05:56.510> notch<00:05:56.870> up<00:05:57.080> with<00:05:57.290> that<00:05:57.940> in<00:05:58.940> summary

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
the next notch up with that in summary

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.780 
the next notch up with that in summary
I'd<00:05:59.990> service<00:06:00.350> with<00:06:00.470> a<00:06:00.500> great<00:06:00.740> instrument<00:06:01.130> you

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
I'd service with a great instrument you

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.060 
I'd service with a great instrument you
can<00:06:01.820> definitely<00:06:02.450> tell<00:06:02.630> it<00:06:02.810> is<00:06:02.990> a<00:06:03.200> notch<00:06:03.440> up<00:06:03.680> so

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
can definitely tell it is a notch up so

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.680 
can definitely tell it is a notch up so
I<00:06:04.280> think<00:06:04.790> this<00:06:04.910> would<00:06:05.090> be<00:06:05.120> great<00:06:05.360> for<00:06:05.480> a

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
I think this would be great for a

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.140 
I think this would be great for a
first-time<00:06:06.290> violinist<00:06:06.920> who<00:06:07.340> who<00:06:07.940> is<00:06:08.120> a

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
first-time violinist who who is a

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.760 
first-time violinist who who is a
beginner<00:06:08.510> just<00:06:08.690> wants<00:06:09.080> to<00:06:09.169> spend<00:06:09.410> just<00:06:09.620> that

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
beginner just wants to spend just that

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.170 
beginner just wants to spend just that
little<00:06:10.010> bit<00:06:10.160> more<00:06:10.280> money<00:06:10.640> because<00:06:10.880> they<00:06:11.150> don't

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
little bit more money because they don't

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.330 
little bit more money because they don't
want<00:06:11.510> to<00:06:11.540> upgrade<00:06:11.780> later<00:06:12.590> on<00:06:12.919> they<00:06:13.070> want<00:06:13.250> to

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
want to upgrade later on they want to

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.909 
want to upgrade later on they want to
kind<00:06:13.490> of<00:06:13.520> do<00:06:13.669> the<00:06:13.790> upgrading<00:06:14.270> now<00:06:14.480> and<00:06:14.919> again

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
kind of do the upgrading now and again

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:16.930 
kind of do the upgrading now and again
you<00:06:16.070> might<00:06:16.190> just<00:06:16.340> want<00:06:16.520> to<00:06:16.580> think<00:06:16.760> about

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
you might just want to think about

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.340 
you might just want to think about
getting<00:06:17.150> some<00:06:17.180> tuners<00:06:17.690> on<00:06:17.810> there<00:06:18.020> but<00:06:18.200> it's

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
getting some tuners on there but it's

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.470 
getting some tuners on there but it's
not<00:06:18.650> a<00:06:18.680> problem<00:06:18.980> to<00:06:19.250> put<00:06:19.400> those<00:06:19.520> on<00:06:19.580> somebody

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
not a problem to put those on somebody

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.909 
not a problem to put those on somebody
at<00:06:20.570> a<00:06:20.600> music<00:06:20.930> shop<00:06:21.080> would<00:06:21.260> put<00:06:21.410> them<00:06:21.530> on<00:06:21.680> or

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
at a music shop would put them on or

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:23.590 
at a music shop would put them on or
possibly<00:06:22.430> the<00:06:22.640> people<00:06:23.060> at<00:06:23.150> Norman's<00:06:23.450> might

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
possibly the people at Norman's might

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.870 
possibly the people at Norman's might
even<00:06:23.810> put<00:06:24.080> them<00:06:24.230> on<00:06:24.350> for<00:06:24.650> you<00:06:24.680> but<00:06:25.370> it<00:06:25.490> isn't<00:06:25.820> a

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
even put them on for you but it isn't a

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.400 
even put them on for you but it isn't a
problem<00:06:26.060> there's<00:06:26.450> there<00:06:26.660> would<00:06:26.780> be<00:06:26.810> plenty<00:06:27.350> of

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
problem there's there would be plenty of

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.360 
problem there's there would be plenty of
ways<00:06:27.560> that<00:06:27.710> you'd<00:06:27.860> be<00:06:27.950> able<00:06:28.040> to<00:06:28.190> get<00:06:28.310> the

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
ways that you'd be able to get the

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.580 
ways that you'd be able to get the
tuners<00:06:28.700> part<00:06:28.910> on<00:06:29.030> so<00:06:29.630> definitely<00:06:30.140> for<00:06:30.320> a<00:06:30.350> first

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
tuners part on so definitely for a first

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.200 
tuners part on so definitely for a first
time<00:06:30.830> violinist<00:06:31.340> this<00:06:31.550> would<00:06:31.730> be<00:06:31.820> absolutely

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
time violinist this would be absolutely

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.610 
time violinist this would be absolutely
great<00:06:32.450> I<00:06:32.780> don't<00:06:33.200> think<00:06:33.410> you'd<00:06:33.530> be

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
great I don't think you'd be

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.659 
great I don't think you'd be
disappointed<00:06:33.830> whether<00:06:34.430> at<00:06:34.640> all

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 
disappointed whether at all

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.209 
disappointed whether at all
and<00:06:35.969> it<00:06:36.599> would<00:06:36.839> be<00:06:37.020> suitable<00:06:37.229> for<00:06:37.740> an<00:06:37.830> upgrade

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:38.219 
and it would be suitable for an upgrade

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:40.969 
and it would be suitable for an upgrade
from<00:06:38.490> the<00:06:38.969> next<00:06:39.300> or<00:06:40.080> from<00:06:40.319> damn<00:06:40.650> from<00:06:40.889> the

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
from the next or from damn from the

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:42.619 
from the next or from damn from the
forensic<00:06:41.430> prima<00:06:41.759> this<00:06:42.150> would<00:06:42.270> be<00:06:42.389> a<00:06:42.419> nice

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:42.629 
forensic prima this would be a nice

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:46.249 
forensic prima this would be a nice
upgrade<00:06:42.900> to<00:06:43.469> that<00:06:43.619> as<00:06:43.830> well<00:06:43.979> so<00:06:44.930> yeah<00:06:45.930> it's<00:06:46.139> a

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:47.389 
upgrade to that as well so yeah it's a
fantastic<00:06:46.710> value<00:06:46.889> of<00:06:46.979> the<00:06:47.099> money<00:06:47.219> and

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:47.399
