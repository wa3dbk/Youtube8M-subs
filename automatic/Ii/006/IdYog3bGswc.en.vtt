00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
don't know it's really fun um and it's

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.580 
don't know it's really fun um and it's
it's<00:00:34.220> pretty<00:00:34.520> simple<00:00:34.940> it<00:00:35.420> takes<00:00:36.050> a<00:00:36.380> little

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
it's pretty simple it takes a little

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.290 
it's pretty simple it takes a little
time<00:00:36.920> because<00:00:37.430> you<00:00:37.460> have<00:00:37.579> to<00:00:37.700> like<00:00:37.850> let<00:00:38.090> the

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
time because you have to like let the

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.509 
time because you have to like let the
coats<00:00:38.690> dry<00:00:39.020> but<00:00:39.769> I'm<00:00:39.890> going<00:00:40.039> to<00:00:40.100> explain<00:00:40.340> that

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
coats dry but I'm going to explain that

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:42.520 
coats dry but I'm going to explain that
all<00:00:40.699> in<00:00:40.879> detail<00:00:41.239> in<00:00:41.510> a<00:00:41.690> little<00:00:41.960> bit<00:00:42.140> but<00:00:42.289> first

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
all in detail in a little bit but first

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.590 
all in detail in a little bit but first
I<00:00:42.649> just<00:00:42.680> wanted<00:00:43.039> to<00:00:43.100> talk<00:00:43.309> about<00:00:43.480> some<00:00:44.480> of<00:00:44.510> the

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
I just wanted to talk about some of the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.000 
I just wanted to talk about some of the
nail<00:00:44.719> polishes<00:00:45.079> that<00:00:45.109> would<00:00:45.379> work<00:00:45.500> best<00:00:45.800> for

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
nail polishes that would work best for

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.470 
nail polishes that would work best for
this<00:00:46.100> look<00:00:46.309> you<00:00:46.460> can<00:00:46.640> literally<00:00:46.910> use<00:00:47.059> any

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
this look you can literally use any

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.290 
this look you can literally use any
combination<00:00:48.289> that<00:00:48.800> you<00:00:48.920> want<00:00:49.190> I<00:00:49.460> don't

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
combination that you want I don't

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.000 
combination that you want I don't
recommend<00:00:50.690> using<00:00:51.050> glitter<00:00:51.410> nail<00:00:51.649> polishes

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
recommend using glitter nail polishes

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.529 
recommend using glitter nail polishes
because<00:00:52.280> they're<00:00:52.429> just<00:00:52.670> not<00:00:52.850> opaque<00:00:53.239> enough

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
because they're just not opaque enough

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.139 
because they're just not opaque enough
unless<00:00:53.780> you<00:00:54.350> have<00:00:54.469> like<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.649> super<00:00:55.250> like<00:00:55.489> opaque

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
unless you have like a super like opaque

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.400 
unless you have like a super like opaque
um<00:00:57.339> yah<00:00:58.339> wash<00:00:58.579> but<00:00:58.910> I've<00:00:59.149> tried<00:00:59.629> some<00:00:59.929> and<00:01:00.230> out

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
um yah wash but I've tried some and out

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.200 
um yah wash but I've tried some and out
of<00:01:00.530> my<00:01:00.649> collection<00:01:00.890> I<00:01:01.249> didn't<00:01:01.670> find<00:01:01.820> any<00:01:02.030> that

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
of my collection I didn't find any that

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.360 
of my collection I didn't find any that
worked<00:01:02.359> really<00:01:02.480> good<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.289> I<00:01:03.620> don't<00:01:03.949> recommend

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
worked really good so I don't recommend

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.340 
worked really good so I don't recommend
using<00:01:04.640> them<00:01:04.879> I<00:01:05.000> recommend<00:01:05.480> using<00:01:05.690> really

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
using them I recommend using really

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.560 
using them I recommend using really
opaque<00:01:06.710> colors<00:01:07.159> in<00:01:07.340> one<00:01:07.370> stripe<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.210> has<00:01:08.360> to<00:01:08.540> be

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
opaque colors in one stripe it has to be

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.720 
opaque colors in one stripe it has to be
opaque<00:01:08.960> because<00:01:09.409> if<00:01:09.560> you<00:01:09.680> don't<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.220> you<00:01:10.430> need

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
opaque because if you don't and you need

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.610 
opaque because if you don't and you need
to<00:01:10.850> like<00:01:11.030> layer<00:01:11.270> it<00:01:11.480> it's<00:01:11.660> just<00:01:11.930> not<00:01:12.380> going<00:01:12.560> to

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
to like layer it it's just not going to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.740 
to like layer it it's just not going to
dry<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.190> it's<00:01:13.820> not<00:01:13.970> going<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.180> look<00:01:14.300> good<00:01:14.360> so

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
dry and it's not going to look good so

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.150 
dry and it's not going to look good so
you<00:01:14.810> definitely<00:01:15.080> need<00:01:15.440> a<00:01:15.470> really<00:01:15.800> opaque

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
you definitely need a really opaque

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.870 
you definitely need a really opaque
color<00:01:16.580> I<00:01:17.330> also<00:01:17.750> recommend<00:01:18.290> on<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:19.400> brushes

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
color I also recommend on the brushes

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.670 
color I also recommend on the brushes
that<00:01:19.910> are<00:01:20.060> just<00:01:20.390> thin<00:01:20.750> that<00:01:21.230> aren't<00:01:21.530> like

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
that are just thin that aren't like

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.990 
that are just thin that aren't like
scooped<00:01:22.070> or<00:01:22.280> anything<00:01:22.580> like<00:01:22.610> that<00:01:22.760> because

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
scooped or anything like that because

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.490 
scooped or anything like that because
that<00:01:23.120> can<00:01:23.420> be<00:01:23.510> a<00:01:23.540> little<00:01:23.720> bit<00:01:23.900> difficult<00:01:24.080> and

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
that can be a little bit difficult and

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.740 
that can be a little bit difficult and
aren't<00:01:24.770> like<00:01:24.890> flat<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:25.430> like<00:01:25.610> why<00:01:26.150> because<00:01:26.600> it

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
aren't like flat and like why because it

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.110 
aren't like flat and like why because it
just<00:01:26.840> won't<00:01:27.080> work<00:01:27.170> as<00:01:27.440> good<00:01:27.650> um<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.760> yeah<00:01:29.060> you

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
just won't work as good um so yeah you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.750 
just won't work as good um so yeah you
also<00:01:29.540> can<00:01:29.780> do<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.110> stripes<00:01:30.350> as<00:01:30.680> small<00:01:31.340> or<00:01:31.700> as

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
also can do the stripes as small or as

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.010 
also can do the stripes as small or as
big<00:01:32.210> as<00:01:32.660> you<00:01:32.810> want<00:01:32.990> I<00:01:33.110> did<00:01:33.260> pretty<00:01:33.530> big<00:01:33.860> on
