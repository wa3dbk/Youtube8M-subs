00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:19.880 
fall that back around on itself and then
follow<00:04:08.280> it<00:04:08.370> around<00:04:16.580> and<00:04:17.580> that's<00:04:17.640> it<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.890> bit

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
follow it around and that's it a bit

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.790 
follow it around and that's it a bit
tricky<00:04:20.720> but<00:04:21.720> once<00:04:21.930> it's<00:04:22.110> narrow<00:04:22.350> its<00:04:22.560> name

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
tricky but once it's narrow its name

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.000 
tricky but once it's narrow its name
it's<00:04:23.730> not<00:04:23.910> going<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.330> way<00:04:24.650> so<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:25.710> can<00:04:25.860> take

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
it's not going that way so you can take

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.920 
it's not going that way so you can take
the<00:04:26.100> paper<00:04:26.280> clips<00:04:26.640> off

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.089 

so<00:04:32.819> shuffle<00:04:33.819> it<00:04:33.879> around<00:04:34.499> what<00:04:35.499> I<00:04:35.530> like<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.919> do

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
so shuffle it around what I like to do

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.219 
so shuffle it around what I like to do
just<00:04:36.939> put<00:04:37.120> a<00:04:37.150> piece<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.360> sellotape<00:04:37.749> on<00:04:38.110> each

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
just put a piece of sellotape on each

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.179 
just put a piece of sellotape on each
one<00:04:38.409> of<00:04:38.499> these<00:04:39.719> like<00:04:40.719> that<00:04:40.990> it's<00:04:41.439> a<00:04:41.590> 5-liter

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:42.189 
one of these like that it's a 5-liter

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:46.499 
one of these like that it's a 5-liter
sellotape<00:04:42.840> that's<00:04:43.840> basically<00:04:44.259> it<00:04:44.499> and<00:04:45.509> then

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
sellotape that's basically it and then

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:52.320 
sellotape that's basically it and then
you<00:04:46.629> just<00:04:46.810> start<00:04:46.990> again<00:04:47.139> on<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.039> next<00:04:48.219> unit<00:04:51.330> so

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
you just start again on the next unit so

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:59.040 
you just start again on the next unit so
it<00:04:52.389> falls<00:04:52.629> over<00:04:52.840> like<00:04:53.110> this<00:04:54.840> okay

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.100 

little<00:05:00.050> bit<00:05:00.139> more<00:05:00.290> complicated

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.720 

okay<00:05:04.240> you<00:05:05.240> get<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.480> next<00:05:05.750> unit<00:05:06.430> and<00:05:07.430> that<00:05:07.460> can

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
okay you get the next unit and that can

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.130 
okay you get the next unit and that can
go<00:05:07.910> in<00:05:08.030> here<00:05:08.330> like<00:05:08.570> this

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
go in here like this

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.210 
go in here like this
okay<00:05:12.140> and<00:05:12.380> you<00:05:12.470> will<00:05:12.620> just<00:05:12.770> work<00:05:13.010> your<00:05:13.160> way

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
okay and you will just work your way

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.030 
okay and you will just work your way
around<00:05:14.440> and<00:05:15.440> that<00:05:15.470> one<00:05:16.120> goes<00:05:17.120> into<00:05:17.360> they<00:05:18.040> think

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
around and that one goes into they think

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.720 
around and that one goes into they think
so

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
so

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.190 
so
just<00:05:20.420> work<00:05:20.570> your<00:05:20.600> way<00:05:20.810> around<00:05:22.030> that's<00:05:23.030> it<00:05:23.210> see

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
just work your way around that's it see

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.860 
just work your way around that's it see
ya<00:05:24.320> good<00:05:24.650> luck
