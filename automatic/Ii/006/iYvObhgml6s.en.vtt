00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.350
 the ragù 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.689
 I remember my grandmother when she did it to me 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.540
 but it took a lot of time again 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.990
 what are we fast fast see how 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.490
 we do absolutely begin with 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.930
 what do you need first of all then 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.560
 let's put the shovel first 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.590
 mixed ok inside the breach then 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.750
 we put in oil you can sauté e 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.030
 the onion we make a beautiful ceiling 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.070
 worried so many functions one of 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.380
 those very interesting the fact that 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.320
 this chapter primacy we can that 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.000
 prepare and Dalmatians we will put the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.530
 freezer so when we have it 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.450
 need we use then we put 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.939
 inside onion and program use the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.060
 program b which is the specific program 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.520
 for the fantastic risotto rods because 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.260
 is just three programs to make i 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.670
 first of the Italian tradition then 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.920
 risotto pasta and velvety and the deed 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.650
 we reward scart 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.600
 and we start making the dough all over it 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.670
 he's all here in two minutes 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.670
 add the sausage ok very well 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.170
 so advised true because the program 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.570
 automatic and all preset speed 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.370
 We only need temperature timing 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.140
 put the ingredients when it is 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.720
 he asks following the recipes 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.720
 I'm in the recipe book now we insert 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:58.340
 fry we use the spatula for 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.820
 help us since we have supplied 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:07.750
 with qq then we add the water yes that the 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:13.070
 sauce is the real processes, but some water 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.020
 quick way to make pasta we are 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.170
 we can also alternatively salt 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.170
 also use the data made with the recipe 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.700
 final there are three types of data ed 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.920
 actually but what are a lot 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.230
 practical other things that is much better 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.690
 do it directly at home especially if 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.150
 has a problem with intolerances because you know 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.120
 exactly what is within certain unity 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.709
 this is very important because without it 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.630
 gluten dreaming be very careful 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.580
 also to the contaminations and now we 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.270
 we are still very quiet e 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.270
 let's wait 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:58.450
 and sound third vip we add the pasta 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:02.260
 yes then we put it directly on 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.700
 ragù and in the water and it is a technique that 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.520
 they also use lots of shopping 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.430
 real restaurants to have a pasta 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.760
 found to be more creamy and more flavorful 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:16.440
 nonpartisan and we exploit it for 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.440
 this perfect 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:31.920
 the true ready-made part we employ 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.880
 it came absolutely perfect 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.490
 I want to ask you some advice 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.500
 on how to prepare gluten-free pasta 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.320
 because I know he had a little delicate 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.840
 then it is a little delicate but everyone 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.880
 these programs set up and the ball 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.750
 disc the actress who is very delicate and 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.460
 ruin the pasta so it is also short 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.200
 a very important aid for people 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.890
 who must use these ingredients 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:59.510
 sure then they are good I also put in it 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:02.850
 a lot of parmesan flakes 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:06.990
 we ask for even more a touch 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.670
 final also the ragù is really from 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.040
 sonia just like the ragù of mine 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:16.790
