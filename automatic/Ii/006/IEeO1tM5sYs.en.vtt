00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
side up before I crush it and that just

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.670 
side up before I crush it and that just
makes<00:01:26.710> it<00:01:26.920> easier<00:01:27.190> later<00:01:28.180> on<00:01:28.570> when<00:01:29.440> we're

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
makes it easier later on when we're

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
cloudy so you know that the powder has

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.330 
cloudy so you know that the powder has
gotten<00:05:10.419> mixed<00:05:10.690> in<00:05:11.050> with<00:05:11.889> the<00:05:12.099> water

the coating didn't get crushed up
completely<00:05:21.220> that's<00:05:21.819> okay<00:05:23.009> we<00:05:24.009> try<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:24.550> do<00:05:24.669> the

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
completely that's okay we try and do the

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.689 
completely that's okay we try and do the

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
best we can with the coating but you you

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.730 
best we can with the coating but you you
never<00:05:27.909> can<00:05:28.270> get<00:05:28.479> all<00:05:28.720> of<00:05:28.900> it<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.169> crush

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
cloudy now this part this parts a little

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.080 
cloudy now this part this parts a little
tricky<00:05:41.500> and<00:05:41.710> you<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:42.580> learn<00:05:42.789> it<00:05:42.940> with

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
tricky and you you learn it with

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.170 
tricky and you you learn it with
experience<00:05:43.780> you<00:05:44.340> you<00:05:45.340> have<00:05:45.430> to<00:05:45.580> pull<00:05:45.789> it<00:05:45.819> out

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
experience you you have to pull it out

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.129 
experience you you have to pull it out
with<00:05:46.690> one<00:05:46.930> hand<00:05:46.960> I<00:05:47.680> use<00:05:48.639> my<00:05:48.909> thumb<00:05:49.270> to<00:05:49.719> pull<00:05:49.960> the

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
maybe kind of difficult to see but it's

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.710 
maybe kind of difficult to see but it's
