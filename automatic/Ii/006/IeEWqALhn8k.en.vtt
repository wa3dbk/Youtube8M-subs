00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.540
 from the point of view of what is the 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.790
 Greco's art of what technique is 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.050
 del greco the way of painting of the dedico 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.300
 that what differentiates it makes it a 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.040
 painter for some extravagant as he 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.540
 he said in the baroque but a painter 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.250
 whenever he wakes up to a certain 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.770
 passion when your painting is analyzed 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.080
 from that point of view I say there's 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.020
 example in this work very clear aspects 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.540
 of his in his way of painting for example 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.100
 the repetition of figures the figure of 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.660
 that appears down there to our 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.550
 left to the one of san josÃ© is a figure 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.460
 which is repeated in another of his works in 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.440
 other of his works the Greek retained 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.410
 many times apparently in small 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.360
 format the works he was doing and 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.390
 then re used many of the figures 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.550
 and it also made small 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.379
 sculptures and was then used in the 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.330
 that's why you can see repetition 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.250
 of motives repetition of figures sometimes 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.810
 views from different from different 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.420
 point of view but the same figure 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.850
 repeated in different works then by 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.500
 example the anatomical treatment in that 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.860
 There is a clear Michelangelo influence 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.360
 in origin but now in is the time 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.880
 in which we find the Greek 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.550
 in the Mannerist painting and the model no 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.650
 it's the model 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.110
 nature and the painters paint the 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.540
 way of other painters and the greco 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.990
 paints the way other painters is 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.090
 say they use the style and so on 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.860
 it's a copy in no way but yes 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.540
 is inspired by the work of others 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.760
 painters and for example what in the 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.530
 origin of the anatomical study by 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.180
 of painters was a very treatment 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.860
 realistic of the human body that took them 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.440
 to do even anatomical sections 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.300
 in the time of the high Renaissance 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.980
 etcetera now in this era has already 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.080
 become the work of the Greek almost in 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.510
 something that turns the characters into 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.310
 much more much more spiritual hoisted 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.320
 because they are a musculature almost 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.780
 impossible as we are like the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.850
 that can be seen in that vertical figure 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.520
 to the right that links with the glory 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.020
 with the angel from above in the arms of 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.300
 that figure even in the legs to 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.010
 backlight there is really a study 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.870
 anatomical base based on others 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.730
 painters but contributes almost to 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.740
 dematerialize more the figures of the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.730
 greco more than to give them the consistency 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.730
 that originally could have the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.500
 anatomical treatment on the other hand the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.870
 theme of artificial lights in the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.410
 Mannerist painting and then in this work 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.180
 as well 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.460
 we can see what evolution has been 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.410
 of the Greek from the point of view 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.420
 pictorial in that it is a much more work 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.550
 darker than his first-class works 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.560
 It darkens time painting 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.990
 Greco is also using sometimes more 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.170
 light bulbs has been said that can 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.670
 know in this last one of his time the 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.260
 influence of caravaggio in certain 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.660
 measure for this darkening of the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.100
 painting but in any case it is a 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.960
 work that demonstrates very well what is the 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.360
 end of the Greek stage to what 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.220
 comes to the art of greco in the city of 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.520
 toledo with this work done as I 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.490
 he said for his burial the greco is 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.350
 a painter fully imbued with the 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.410
 Principles of the Catholic Counter-Reformation 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.120
 and at the same time is an intellectual painter a 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.210
 humanist painter a painter in contact 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.220
 with those toledanas elites that allow 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.170
 also that he has another series of works 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.569
 other type of orders 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.519
 makes you a much more painter 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.980
 with a broader theme for example 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.189
 with portraits that other painters of 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.189
 The time
