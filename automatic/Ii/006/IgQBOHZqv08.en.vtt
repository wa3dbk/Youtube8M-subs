grab scissors and cut it and you just
take<00:03:50.360> it<00:03:50.540> up<00:03:50.629> I<00:03:50.950> recommend<00:03:51.950> not<00:03:52.580> brushing<00:03:52.970> it

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
take it up I recommend not brushing it

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.690 
take it up I recommend not brushing it
because<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:54.170> just<00:03:54.319> makes<00:03:54.709> it<00:03:55.420> like<00:03:57.159> on<00:03:58.159> my<00:03:58.430> hair

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
because it just makes it like on my hair

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.069 
because it just makes it like on my hair
it<00:03:58.909> just<00:03:58.940> makes<00:03:59.690> my<00:03:59.840> hair<00:04:00.019> straight<00:04:00.470> again

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
it just makes my hair straight again

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.740 
it just makes my hair straight again
because<00:04:03.079> I'm<00:04:03.230> naturally<00:04:03.409> straight<00:04:04.010> here<00:04:04.720> so<00:04:05.720> I

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
because I'm naturally straight here so I

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.420 
because I'm naturally straight here so I
don't<00:04:05.780> recommend<00:04:06.170> that<00:04:06.409> i<00:04:06.799> do<00:04:07.190> recommend
