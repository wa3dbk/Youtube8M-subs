because<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.909> their<00:01:24.060> sound<00:01:24.920> but<00:01:26.180> it's

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
because I like their sound but it's

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.410 
because I like their sound but it's
quite<00:01:27.509> powerful<00:01:27.720> amp<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.320> would<00:01:28.439> say<00:01:29.420> they

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
quite powerful amp I would say they

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.109 
quite powerful amp I would say they
could<00:01:30.600> do<00:01:30.720> up<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.930> 1.3<00:01:31.860> watts<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> 32<00:01:32.939> ohms

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
could do up to 1.3 watts in the 32 ohms

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.870 
could do up to 1.3 watts in the 32 ohms
which<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.630> pretty<00:01:34.189> pretty<00:01:35.189> high<00:01:35.400> power<00:01:35.700> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
which is pretty pretty high power a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.190 
which is pretty pretty high power a
suspect<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.869> 16<00:01:37.380> ohms<00:01:37.560> they<00:01:37.740> could<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:39.200> don't

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
suspect at 16 ohms they could do I don't

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200 
suspect at 16 ohms they could do I don't
know<00:01:40.290> about<00:01:40.380> double<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.549> bit<00:01:41.970> more

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
know about double that but a bit more

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.530 
know about double that but a bit more
power<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.369> also<00:01:44.490> do<00:01:44.759> else<00:01:45.240> power

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
power and you can also do else power

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.170 
power and you can also do else power
high<00:01:45.930> heat<00:01:46.229> attempt<00:01:46.590> one's<00:01:46.880> pretty<00:01:47.880> good

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
high heat attempt one's pretty good

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.499 
high heat attempt one's pretty good
I<00:01:48.360> know<00:01:49.110> my<00:01:49.680> band<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.579> t1<00:01:51.060> sounded<00:01:51.390> pretty

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
I know my band and I t1 sounded pretty

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.710 
I know my band and I t1 sounded pretty
good<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.259> could<00:01:52.409> drive<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.799> okay

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
good on this so I could drive it okay

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.850 
good on this so I could drive it okay
but<00:01:56.090> it's<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> HD<00:01:57.509> 600<00:01:57.990> minded<00:01:58.500> pretty<00:01:58.680> good

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
but it's the HD 600 minded pretty good

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.770 
but it's the HD 600 minded pretty good
but<00:01:59.700> some<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.909> the<00:01:59.969> other<00:02:00.119> bear<00:02:00.360> dynamic

t1<00:02:44.570> was<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:45.440> I<00:02:45.470> could<00:02:45.590> drive<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:46.040> K<00:02:46.670> famil<00:02:47.000> one

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
t1 was so I could drive the K famil one

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.440 
t1 was so I could drive the K famil one
pretty<00:02:47.330> good<00:02:50.470> but<00:02:51.470> yeah<00:02:51.970> it's<00:02:52.970> pretty<00:02:53.209> it's<00:02:53.420> a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
pretty good but yeah it's pretty it's a

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.020 
pretty good but yeah it's pretty it's a
pretty<00:02:53.480> good<00:02:53.780> amp<00:02:53.989> pretty<00:02:54.620> powerful<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.820> this

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
pretty good amp pretty powerful and this

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.180 
pretty good amp pretty powerful and this
time<00:02:56.239> Schultz<00:02:56.630> age<00:02:56.870> sonic<00:02:57.440> wise<00:02:57.680> though<00:02:58.040> you

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
time Schultz age sonic wise though you

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.490 
time Schultz age sonic wise though you
could<00:02:58.430> tell<00:02:58.610> it's<00:02:58.819> doesn't<00:02:59.750> have<00:02:59.840> much<00:03:00.080> detail

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
could tell it's doesn't have much detail

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.259 
could tell it's doesn't have much detail
as<00:03:00.709> a<00:03:01.010> lot<00:03:01.130> of<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.370> new<00:03:01.489> ramps<00:03:01.819> out<00:03:01.970> there

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
as a lot of the new ramps out there

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.080 
as a lot of the new ramps out there
which<00:03:02.600> is<00:03:03.230> okay<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:03.590> mean<00:03:03.860> it's<00:03:04.790> not<00:03:04.910> really

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
which is okay I mean it's not really

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.160 
which is okay I mean it's not really
high-end<00:03:05.630> Antonia<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.590> consider<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.280> mid<00:03:07.670> thigh

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
high-end Antonia I consider it mid thigh

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.509 
high-end Antonia I consider it mid thigh
and<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.260> does<00:03:09.410> sound<00:03:09.620> inside<00:03:10.069> of<00:03:10.130> me<00:03:10.310> it

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
and it does sound inside of me it

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.070 
and it does sound inside of me it
doesn't<00:03:11.230> bother<00:03:12.230> me<00:03:12.530> in<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.650> least

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
doesn't bother me in the least

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.060 
doesn't bother me in the least
now<00:03:15.080> back<00:03:15.530> you<00:03:16.280> can<00:03:16.400> see<00:03:16.579> we<00:03:16.700> have<00:03:17.890> preamp<00:03:18.890> out

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
now back you can see we have preamp out

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.400 
now back you can see we have preamp out
which<00:03:19.820> is<00:03:20.030> driven<00:03:20.450> by<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.750> volume<00:03:21.049> knob<00:03:21.230> on

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
which is driven by the volume knob on

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.039 
which is driven by the volume knob on
the<00:03:21.440> front<00:03:21.620> there<00:03:22.269> it's<00:03:23.269> kind<00:03:23.480> of<00:03:23.510> cool<00:03:23.690> but<00:03:23.989> I

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
the front there it's kind of cool but I

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.840 
the front there it's kind of cool but I
find<00:03:24.350> it<00:03:24.470> kind<00:03:24.650> of<00:03:24.709> hard<00:03:24.769> especially<00:03:25.250> if<00:03:25.549> using

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
find it kind of hard especially if using

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.370 
find it kind of hard especially if using
headphones<00:03:26.030> at<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.450> same<00:03:26.630> time<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:27.200> want

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
headphones at the same time and you want

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.690 
headphones at the same time and you want
to<00:03:27.500> use<00:03:27.799> the<00:03:28.010> preamp

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
to use the preamp

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.620 
to use the preamp
you<00:03:28.940> can't<00:03:29.150> do<00:03:29.299> it<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.600> way<00:03:29.780> cuz<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:32.239> signals

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
you can't do it that way cuz the signals

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.720 
you can't do it that way cuz the signals
pretty<00:03:32.810> quiet<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:33.500> you<00:03:34.040> have<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.220> turn<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.579> up

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
pretty quiet so you have to turn it up

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.930 
pretty quiet so you have to turn it up
almost<00:03:34.940> halfway<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:36.079> get<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.130> loud<00:03:37.340> but<00:03:37.790> by

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
almost halfway to get it loud but by

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.470 
almost halfway to get it loud but by
then<00:03:38.150> your<00:03:38.269> headphones<00:03:38.600> are<00:03:38.720> screaming<00:03:40.480> then

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
then your headphones are screaming then

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.330 
then your headphones are screaming then
we<00:03:41.690> have<00:03:41.900> of<00:03:41.989> course<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.470> line<00:03:42.680> in<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:43.250> know

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
we have of course the line in you know

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.930 
we have of course the line in you know
DAC<00:03:43.670> CD<00:03:44.090> player<00:03:44.950> you<00:03:45.950> can<00:03:46.100> do<00:03:46.220> any<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.519> that<00:03:46.609> you

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
DAC CD player you can do any of that you

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.729 
DAC CD player you can do any of that you
can<00:03:47.120> even<00:03:47.239> use<00:03:47.450> like<00:03:47.600> a<00:03:47.720> little<00:03:47.930> mp3<00:03:48.470> players

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
can even use like a little mp3 players

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.710 
can even use like a little mp3 players
but<00:03:49.310> those<00:03:49.459> are<00:03:49.579> really<00:03:49.760> quiet<00:03:50.120> so<00:03:50.299> you're

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
but those are really quiet so you're

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.840 
but those are really quiet so you're
gonna<00:03:50.840> have<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.019> crank<00:03:51.230> their<00:03:51.410> volume<00:03:51.799> then<00:03:52.760> we

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
gonna have to crank their volume then we

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.400 
gonna have to crank their volume then we
have<00:03:52.970> lighting<00:03:53.359> palette<00:03:53.600> which<00:03:53.930> is<00:03:53.959> just<00:03:54.260> a

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
have lighting palette which is just a

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.000 
have lighting palette which is just a
loop<00:03:54.590> output<00:03:55.359> that<00:03:56.859> unfortunately<00:03:57.859> doesn't

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
loop output that unfortunately doesn't

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.680 
loop output that unfortunately doesn't
work<00:03:58.280> even<00:03:58.459> if<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.760> amp<00:03:58.880> is<00:03:59.000> off<00:03:59.150> kind<00:03:59.480> of<00:03:59.510> how

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
work even if the amp is off kind of how

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.530 
work even if the amp is off kind of how
the<00:03:59.750> the<00:04:00.500> SPL<00:04:00.920> auditor<00:04:01.310> worked<00:04:01.549> when<00:04:01.820> done<00:04:02.030> no

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
the the SPL auditor worked when done no

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.300 
the the SPL auditor worked when done no
soft<00:04:02.750> xlrs<00:04:03.260> would<00:04:03.440> still<00:04:03.650> go<00:04:03.769> through<00:04:03.799> it

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
soft xlrs would still go through it

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.650 
soft xlrs would still go through it
doesn't<00:04:04.609> work<00:04:04.700> like<00:04:04.730> that<00:04:04.970> you<00:04:05.329> have<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.540> have

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
doesn't work like that you have to have

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
USB DAC the chip did actually fits in

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.319 
USB DAC the chip did actually fits in
there<00:04:12.049> I<00:04:12.079> don't<00:04:12.200> quite<00:04:12.500> remember<00:04:12.850> right<00:04:13.850> now<00:04:14.060> I

find the link to what it is and I'll

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:21.399 
find the link to what it is and I'll

if<00:04:21.859> you<00:04:21.979> guys<00:04:22.099> could<00:04:22.280> check<00:04:22.460> it<00:04:22.610> out

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
if you guys could check it out

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.330 
if you guys could check it out
but<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.900> DAC<00:04:24.110> itself<00:04:24.560> it's<00:04:24.740> kind<00:04:25.220> of

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
but the DAC itself it's kind of

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.790 
but the DAC itself it's kind of
laughing<00:04:25.790> it's<00:04:25.970> very<00:04:26.240> basic<00:04:26.810> I<00:04:27.199> guess<00:04:27.590> you'd

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
laughing it's very basic I guess you'd

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.100 
laughing it's very basic I guess you'd
saying<00:04:28.070> it's<00:04:28.669> no<00:04:28.880> better<00:04:29.060> than<00:04:29.210> going<00:04:29.570> to<00:04:29.690> eBay

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
saying it's no better than going to eBay

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.969 
saying it's no better than going to eBay
buying<00:04:30.470> one<00:04:30.620> of<00:04:30.680> those<00:04:30.800> like<00:04:31.180> like<00:04:32.180> little<00:04:32.979> $50

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
buying one of those like like little $50

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.939 
buying one of those like like little $50
like<00:04:34.370> little<00:04:34.699> USB<00:04:34.940> Dax<00:04:35.590> that's<00:04:36.590> probably

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
like little USB Dax that's probably

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.260 
like little USB Dax that's probably
about<00:04:37.040> the<00:04:37.190> same<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.520> would<00:04:37.760> say<00:04:37.910> maybe<00:04:38.120> a

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
about the same I would say maybe a

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.439 
about the same I would say maybe a
little<00:04:38.419> worse<00:04:38.630> than<00:04:38.870> that<00:04:40.000> but<00:04:41.000> I<00:04:41.060> mean<00:04:41.240> for

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
little worse than that but I mean for

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.930 
little worse than that but I mean for
what<00:04:41.570> it<00:04:41.690> is<00:04:41.720> I<00:04:41.900> mean<00:04:42.520> if<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:43.610> don't<00:04:43.820> have<00:04:43.910> a

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
what it is I mean if you don't have a

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.420 
what it is I mean if you don't have a
DAC<00:04:44.210> you<00:04:44.479> can<00:04:44.630> use<00:04:44.750> it<00:04:44.960> I've<00:04:45.590> just<00:04:45.650> used<00:04:46.190> on

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
DAC you can use it I've just used on

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.950 
DAC you can use it I've just used on
board<00:04:46.610> sound<00:04:46.940> personally<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:47.600> think<00:04:47.720> that

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
board sound personally I think that

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.800 
board sound personally I think that
sounds<00:04:48.199> better<00:04:48.350> than<00:04:49.300> just<00:04:50.300> a<00:04:50.389> power<00:04:50.630> input

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
sounds better than just a power input

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.990 
sounds better than just a power input
which<00:04:51.139> is<00:04:51.169> a<00:04:51.290> three<00:04:52.280> pronged<00:04:52.580> in<00:04:52.910> plug<00:04:55.000> and

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
sounds better than me I've tried them

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.620 
sounds better than me I've tried them
side<00:05:33.620> by<00:05:33.650> side<00:05:33.860> so<00:05:37.120> I'm<00:05:38.120> saying<00:05:38.360> with<00:05:38.539> the

side by side so I'm saying with the
power<00:05:38.810> supply<00:05:38.960> you<00:05:39.200> get<00:05:39.350> like<00:05:39.500> black<00:05:39.740> or

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
little better the base gets deeper

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.690 
little better the base gets deeper
tighter<00:05:44.740> it<00:05:45.740> just<00:05:45.889> cleans<00:05:46.070> up<00:05:46.280> the<00:05:46.370> sound<00:05:46.580> a
