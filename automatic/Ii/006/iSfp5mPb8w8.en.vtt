00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.840
 the action 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.559
 and now 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.309
 Well here is my first type what 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.210
 I did was line this old chair that 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.620
 I did not like it anymore with beige blanket fabric 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.500
 then simply paint with paint 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.320
 black acrylic 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.410
 with extensibles use two types of 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.970
 stencil one with lyrics that are nothing more 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.309
 of the stage and others with many 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.479
 words of love written from many 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:07.600
 ways I was accommodating him all over the 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.170
 armchair of not unanimous shape up 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.020
 fill everything everything everything and then this is 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.119
 the final result is not seen 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.160
 very nice and also you put some cushions 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.580
 milestones and ready 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.009
 This is a very vintage desk here 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.649
 decided to use the technique of cubagua 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.680
 or how do I say in French on the subject 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.690
 this technique is super easy to start 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.450
 to the sad ones is to cut pieces of 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.580
 paper of different sizes after 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.550
 a bowl or bowl adds water and 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.160
 white school glue measures 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.710
 are that you do not have too much liquid or 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.539
 very thick or good if you are more precise 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.970
 then with the three portions of 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.039
 glue crown and half water after 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.970
 you start to stir so you do not 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.980
 there are little balls like little groups 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.800
 Stir up stir scramble until already 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.220
 it looks like more liquid and it is 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.470
 ready to paste does not matter the order in 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.380
 that you hit them the only one that you do have 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.810
 that having a little more care is 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.140
 the one that goes on the shore so that then 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.970
 and you have all your being super paris 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.190
 If you are left very large they are very 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.450
 little things do not happen then to cut 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.250
 the uatre that is everything so it does not matter 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.650
 because you're going to be putting one on top of the 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.170
 another do not worry like this I had 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.940
 I pro had to cut out I made a video 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.650
 with this same technique with bottles 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.350
 decorative down in the box 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.690
 description I leave the link and so follows 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.170
 waiting until here to step all over 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.630
 full already ending I recommend you 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.880
 when you put an extra layer of 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.790
 same glue to use as 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.709
 varnish and then that is the result of 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.720
