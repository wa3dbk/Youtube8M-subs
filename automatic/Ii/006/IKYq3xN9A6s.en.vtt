00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello guys and girls here is the max 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.279
 I want to be quick and fast 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.950
 crisp a few words to the xbox version 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.719
 his has of bayfield say today so 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.460
 been as much as much as much going on 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.030
 spot occurs she barely had time to 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.740
 play 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.929
 the whole thing is typical xbox man too 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.039
 Ultra lame downloaded and who is 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.539
 ask how to play it now 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.880
 may have member in this 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.260
 weird access or whatever that is 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.720
 Exactly program means the whole 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.490
 costs three euros a month 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.680
 and there you can hotline for ten hours 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.240
 try ever in the run 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.279
 all appear quasi only 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.020
 next week tuesday officially but 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.340
 quite one is allowed to do that officially 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.110
 without somehow being afraid 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.640
 you would have with banned or something on 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.680
 the xbox has just been playing 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.840
 if you are a member of this program 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.250
 and there really much gameplay have 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.200
 very briefly a few things so that 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.010
 you jumped right in the eye 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.350
 the first one is more it looks very low 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.180
 resolved that his ex box was that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.469
 also that's why ps4 on the xbox one too 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.820
 beautiful 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.289
 otherwise one can say it is playing 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.750
 somehow faster than it 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.129
 For example , I do battlefield 4 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.780
 I can say that I am totally out of practice 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.840
 with the xbox controller I have forever 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.850
 played the right box 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.970
 Accordingly'm absolutely packed 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.340
 In between, I also mean to say 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.110
 really makes measurable and not 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.420
 played a lot of fun that would have 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.490
 I thought I thought he always means that 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.140
 according to the motto per game time it says 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.409
 can quickly give something must yes plays 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.670
 the maps are the pc. pc 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.100
 have played are clear 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.840
 more sprawling than back shop what you are in 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.090
 the beta could play at one 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.369
 workshop in the beta was never called maps 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.070
 just because that's just called 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.229
 small yes so there was the bank in the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.869
 middle with a roof and almost directly 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.670
 Before that in the police spawn were the suitcases 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.140
 then already picked up that was just 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.189
 a little stupid the maps are here 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.380
 a whole corner bigger 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.060
 you drive a bit at the beginning 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.979
 a bit of nature for use 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.079
 almost the police car I think so 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.119
 pretty cool made up the whole 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.310
 it really has to play well in the long term 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.200
 show up now and I will mine 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.590
 also use it completely for ten hours 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.950
 that I have here with mine with mine 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.020
 alexis however program 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.550
 I would be up to the official 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.410
 release where I go back to the pc 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.480
 game will probably be one 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.670
 or other battlefield has a video 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.900
 from the xbox then bring in synonymous 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.980
 bit longer gameplay and where I am 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.660
 a little bit more to say 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.700
 and now it was just over it 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.440
 already a 230 must go to bed 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.440
 will be fine until next time
