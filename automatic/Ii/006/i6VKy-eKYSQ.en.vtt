00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.330 
think everybody wants to play of course
but<00:01:11.090> everybody<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:13.110> team<00:01:13.410> so<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.980> all<00:01:14.160> win

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340

but everybody is one team so we all win
together

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.110 

yeah<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.270> think<00:01:21.480> so<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.020> think<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.380> we'll<00:01:22.620> have<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
yeah I think so I think so we'll have a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.360 
yeah I think so I think so we'll have a
team<00:01:24.120> with<00:01:24.360> world-class<00:01:24.720> players<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.650> last

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
team with world-class players and last

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.540 
team with world-class players and last
year<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:27.090> champion<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:28.409> year<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.010> a

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
year we can champion this year we have a

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.880 
year we can champion this year we have a
few<00:01:30.060> opponents<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.900> Monica<00:01:31.409> Watson<00:01:31.710> wrong

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
few opponents like Monica Watson wrong

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.219 
few opponents like Monica Watson wrong
but<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.550> think<00:01:32.790> our<00:01:33.270> team<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.600> better<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.050> not

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
but I think our team is better or not

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.950 
but I think our team is better or not
how<00:01:34.979> much<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.310> means<00:01:35.460> me

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
how much it means me

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.920 
how much it means me
James<00:01:36.960> Lee<00:01:37.170> care<00:01:37.409> that's<00:01:38.040> difficult<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.240> it's

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
James Lee care that's difficult but it's

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.560 
James Lee care that's difficult but it's
possible<00:01:40.470> why<00:01:40.710> not<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.060> said<00:01:42.360> our

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
possible why not and like I said our

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.719 
possible why not and like I said our
team<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.900> very<00:01:42.930> good<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.650> sometimes<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.640> need

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
team is very good and sometimes you need

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.330 
team is very good and sometimes you need
a<00:01:44.880> little<00:01:45.000> bit<00:01:45.270> lucky<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.470> good<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
a little bit lucky to be good on on the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.110 
a little bit lucky to be good on on the
specific<00:01:47.880> day<00:01:48.120> of<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> games<00:01:48.950> who's<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.370> team

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
specific day of the games who's the team

00:01:51.120 --> 00:02:04.240 
specific day of the games who's the team
players<00:01:56.900> I<00:01:59.299> think<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.510> one<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:01.170> especially

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.090 

particular<00:02:05.250> and

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
particular and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.220 
particular and
what<00:02:07.760> is<00:02:07.909> your<00:02:08.179> mind<00:02:08.590> because<00:02:09.590> they<00:02:10.580> are<00:02:10.729> very

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
what is your mind because they are very

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.860 
what is your mind because they are very
good<00:02:12.230> player<00:02:13.060> taking<00:02:14.060> periodic<00:02:14.630> fire

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
good player taking periodic fire

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.190 
good player taking periodic fire
behavior<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.440> quit<00:02:15.970> how<00:02:16.970> how's<00:02:17.360> your<00:02:17.630> man<00:02:17.870> but

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
behavior and quit how how's your man but

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.300 
behavior and quit how how's your man but
for<00:02:18.800> me<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.430> incredible<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.390> play<00:02:20.630> with<00:02:21.310> what

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
for me it's incredible to play with what

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.910 
for me it's incredible to play with what
these<00:02:22.520> players<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.300> much<00:02:23.810> quality<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.590> score

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
these players so much quality the score

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.660 
these players so much quality the score
Latin<00:02:25.900> very<00:02:26.900> but<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.320> for<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.590> team<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:28.070> for<00:02:28.490> me

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
Latin very but it for the team so for me

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.430 
Latin very but it for the team so for me
it's<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.180> good<00:02:29.330> experience<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.959> play<00:02:30.200> with<00:02:30.380> you

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
it's a good experience to play with you

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:41.949 
it's a good experience to play with you
know<00:02:31.450> I<00:02:36.670> get<00:02:37.670> something<00:02:38.300> good<00:02:38.600> in<00:02:40.480> yo<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:41.930> I

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
know I get something good in yo so I

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.110 
know I get something good in yo so I
think<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.620> team<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:42.860> young<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.430> lot<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:43.790> players

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
think the team is young a lot of players

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.440 
think the team is young a lot of players
are<00:02:44.480> new<00:02:44.900> in<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.200> team<00:02:45.410> but<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.760> think<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.330> way

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
are new in the team but I think the way

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.320 
are new in the team but I think the way
we<00:02:47.480> play<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.560> very<00:02:48.620> good<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.370> this<00:02:49.820> coach<00:02:50.120> was

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
we play is very good and this coach was

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.920 
we play is very good and this coach was
so<00:02:50.570> very<00:02:50.810> good<00:02:51.610> yeah<00:02:52.610> he<00:02:52.760> tried<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.239> build<00:02:53.780> a
