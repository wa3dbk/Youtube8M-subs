00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.970 
graveyard
all<00:02:21.400> right<00:02:21.549> that's<00:02:21.849> that's<00:02:22.299> pretty<00:02:22.599> cool<00:02:22.980> so

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
all right that's that's pretty cool so

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.989 
all right that's that's pretty cool so
basically<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.760> draw<00:02:25.450> card<00:02:25.749> and<00:02:26.099> he<00:02:27.099> takes<00:02:27.489> top

card of his deck graveyard and now I

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.559 
card of his deck graveyard and now I
can't<00:02:32.680> use<00:02:32.859> any<00:02:33.129> more<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.549> these<00:02:33.670> now<00:02:34.209> when<00:02:34.480> it

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
can't use any more of these now when it

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.110 
can't use any more of these now when it
means<00:02:34.689> by<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.900> +1<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.739> now<00:02:36.129> this<00:02:36.370> loyalty

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
means by the +1 is now this loyalty

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:45.559 
means by the +1 is now this loyalty
points<00:02:37.420> turn<00:02:38.260> from<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.590> 4<00:02:38.920> into<00:02:39.189> a<00:02:39.519> 5<00:02:40.469> all<00:02:41.469> right

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.319 

now<00:02:48.810> let's<00:02:49.810> see<00:02:50.019> what<00:02:50.200> does<00:02:50.349> that<00:02:50.409> say<00:02:50.889> oh<00:02:51.040> yeah

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
now let's see what does that say oh yeah

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.000 
now let's see what does that say oh yeah
eventually<00:02:52.329> you're<00:02:52.989> gonna<00:02:53.109> have<00:02:53.439> enough<00:02:53.769> to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
eventually you're gonna have enough to

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.429 
eventually you're gonna have enough to
get<00:02:54.159> this<00:02:54.280> negative<00:02:54.549> 7<00:02:55.180> this<00:02:55.359> is<00:02:55.659> this<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.230> like

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:56.439 
get this negative 7 this is this is like

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.039 
get this negative 7 this is this is like
this<00:02:56.980> cards<00:02:57.370> actually<00:02:57.819> pretty<00:02:58.120> ridiculous<00:02:58.629> in

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
this cards actually pretty ridiculous in

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.830 
this cards actually pretty ridiculous in
some<00:02:59.469> cases<00:02:59.680> if<00:03:00.099> your<00:03:00.280> control<00:03:00.790> deck<00:03:00.969> is<00:03:01.389> if

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
some cases if your control deck is if

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.470 
some cases if your control deck is if
you<00:03:02.019> pay<00:03:02.319> like<00:03:02.620> zero<00:03:03.250> basically<00:03:04.120> don't<00:03:04.299> lose

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
you pay like zero basically don't lose

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.899 
you pay like zero basically don't lose
any<00:03:04.689> young<00:03:04.989> gain<00:03:05.230> any<00:03:05.500> target<00:03:06.430> player<00:03:06.609> puts

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
any young gain any target player puts

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.459 
any young gain any target player puts
the<00:03:07.030> top<00:03:07.239> 10<00:03:07.510> cards<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.930> his<00:03:08.019> or<00:03:08.169> her<00:03:08.199> library

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:08.469 
the top 10 cards of his or her library

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:09.869 
the top 10 cards of his or her library
in<00:03:08.680> his<00:03:08.889> or<00:03:09.010> her<00:03:09.040> graveyard<00:03:09.489> that's<00:03:09.730> like

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
in his or her graveyard that's like

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.330 
in his or her graveyard that's like
that's<00:03:10.150> really<00:03:10.599> useful

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
that's really useful

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.729 
that's really useful
basically<00:03:12.340> when<00:03:12.849> eventually<00:03:13.269> you<00:03:13.780> get<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.260> 7

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
basically when eventually you get to 7

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.530 
basically when eventually you get to 7
for<00:03:14.889> doing<00:03:15.069> this<00:03:15.159> +1<00:03:15.639> what<00:03:15.819> you<00:03:15.939> want<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.150> do<00:03:16.299> is

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
for doing this +1 what you want to do is

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.039 
for doing this +1 what you want to do is
you<00:03:16.900> want<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.079> do<00:03:17.199> this<00:03:17.349> ability<00:03:17.729> and<00:03:18.900> then<00:03:19.900> the

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
you want to do this ability and then the

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.390 
you want to do this ability and then the
turn<00:03:20.259> after<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:21.009> want<00:03:21.189> to<00:03:21.250> do<00:03:21.310> the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
turn after that you want to do the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.460 
turn after that you want to do the
negative<00:03:21.579> 7<00:03:22.090> any<00:03:22.299> number<00:03:22.659> of<00:03:22.780> target<00:03:23.169> players

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
negative 7 any number of target players

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.530 
negative 7 any number of target players
each<00:03:23.769> draw<00:03:24.099> 20<00:03:24.400> cards<00:03:24.819> I<00:03:24.909> think<00:03:25.120> you're<00:03:25.239> able

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
each draw 20 cards I think you're able

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.499 
each draw 20 cards I think you're able
to<00:03:25.569> control<00:03:25.989> who<00:03:26.859> draws<00:03:27.159> the<00:03:27.189> 25<00:03:27.699> obviously<00:03:28.299> I

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:28.509 
to control who draws the 25 obviously I

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.719 
to control who draws the 25 obviously I
would<00:03:28.959> make<00:03:29.349> me<00:03:29.650> draw<00:03:29.919> the<00:03:29.979> 20<00:03:30.310> cards<00:03:30.549> I<00:03:30.609> mean

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729 
would make me draw the 20 cards I mean

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.149 
would make me draw the 20 cards I mean
that'd<00:03:30.819> be<00:03:30.939> so<00:03:31.120> useful<00:03:31.709> but<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:32.799> got<00:03:32.919> to<00:03:33.009> make

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
that'd be so useful but you got to make

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:34.949 
that'd be so useful but you got to make
sure<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.609> they<00:03:33.819> have<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.180> deck<00:03:34.479> that<00:03:34.659> doesn't

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
sure that they have a deck that doesn't

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.869 
sure that they have a deck that doesn't
have<00:03:35.139> like<00:03:35.379> the<00:03:35.680> player<00:03:36.009> discards<00:03:36.250> this<00:03:36.669> whole

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
have like the player discards this whole

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.580 
have like the player discards this whole
hand<00:03:37.150> or<00:03:37.329> something<00:03:37.509> like<00:03:37.659> that<00:03:37.720> that<00:03:38.229> might

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
hand or something like that that might

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.679 
hand or something like that that might
be<00:03:38.769> a<00:03:38.799> little<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:40.180> might<00:03:40.419> be<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.569> little

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
be a little that might be a little

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:47.879 
be a little that might be a little
tragic<00:03:41.169> for<00:03:41.439> you<00:03:41.759> but<00:03:42.759> yeah<00:03:43.319> um<00:03:46.079> that's<00:03:47.079> about

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
tragic for you but yeah um that's about

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.030 
tragic for you but yeah um that's about
it<00:03:48.220> it's<00:03:48.430> not<00:03:48.579> really<00:03:49.560> well<00:03:50.560> now<00:03:50.769> that<00:03:51.009> I

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
it it's not really well now that I

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.249 
it it's not really well now that I
realized<00:03:51.459> this<00:03:51.609> card<00:03:51.909> was<00:03:52.030> a<00:03:52.329> lot<00:03:52.689> easier<00:03:53.139> to

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:53.259 
realized this card was a lot easier to

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:54.599 
realized this card was a lot easier to
explain<00:03:53.379> that<00:03:53.829> I<00:03:53.919> thought<00:03:54.129> it<00:03:54.250> was<00:03:54.370> going<00:03:54.549> to

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
explain that I thought it was going to
