00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
together now this this paper is really

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.810 
together now this this paper is really
fun<00:03:55.830> because<00:03:56.010> there<00:03:56.250> are<00:03:56.310> so<00:03:56.340> many<00:03:56.580> different

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
fun because there are so many different

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.500 
fun because there are so many different
patterns<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:58.530> can<00:03:58.739> mix<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.160> match<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.700> have

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
patterns you can mix and match and have

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.900 
patterns you can mix and match and have
a<00:04:00.540> good<00:04:00.720> old<00:04:00.750> time<00:04:00.930> oh<00:04:04.310> I<00:04:05.310> think<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:05.700> did<00:04:05.850> the

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
a good old time oh I think I did the

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.620 
a good old time oh I think I did the
wrong<00:04:06.030> side<00:04:06.270> on<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:06.450> well<00:04:08.150> let's<00:04:09.150> see<00:04:09.390> how<00:04:09.540> it

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
wrong side on that well let's see how it

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.449 
wrong side on that well let's see how it
turns<00:04:09.780> out<00:04:09.989> I'm<00:04:10.650> going<00:04:10.800> to<00:04:10.860> do<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.100> one<00:04:11.160> off

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
turns out I'm going to do that one off

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:19.220 
turns out I'm going to do that one off
the<00:04:11.760> side<00:04:12.000> there<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:18.120> like<00:04:18.630> so<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.200> then

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
the side there and like so and then

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.130 
the side there and like so and then
these<00:04:20.220> are<00:04:20.280> going<00:04:20.669> off<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.270> want<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.690> trim

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
these are going off so I want to trim

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:30.070 
these are going off so I want to trim
those<00:04:22.290> down<00:04:24.980> this<00:04:25.980> with<00:04:26.220> my<00:04:26.400> paper<00:04:26.640> snips<00:04:27.090> okay
