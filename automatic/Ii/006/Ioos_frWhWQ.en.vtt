00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.800
 and invoke slender good first 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.270
 this mode is for 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.270

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:59.199

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:22.270
 two quartz blocks 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.250
 and a comfortable class above tells us is from 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.860
 beforehand so awakened today I recommend 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.500
 put it at night so it does not happen 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.250
 nothing because by day it was going to burn and 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.530
 well this mode today here is this 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.270
 translated by a youtuber that is 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.000
 quite famous maybe many what 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.000
 you know and it would be monsters droid 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.869
 he translated it then he left them without 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.770
 translated and all credits to him by 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.560

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.469
 a tnt looks up said 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.469
 and the point of dying says ok 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.270
 as you see earlier said that you have to 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.740
 collect a lapis lazuli and close tom 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.920
 like here we have the first skin 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.920

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.460

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.130
 find the first the blue pile 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.570
 Now what we are looking for is to find 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.230

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.890
 here that there is one we touch it and it says that 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.040
 found the second blogs ton 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:35.440

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.440

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.290

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.450
 and it's immortal because I tried it 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.450

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.920
 but he spoke as they see 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.280
 me if this mod is one of my favorites 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.000
 because the 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.000
 why 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.640
 It's pretty good 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.830
 everything is never as good a way 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.300

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.230

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.060
 let's keep looking for blues or light 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.650
 here it is 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.099
 I do not know why it is not removed from the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.099
 screen 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.310
 with what you run 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:46.180
 or not 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.820
 it did not kill me what bad good and 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.350
 when they manage to collect all the 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.960
 the ton balloons 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.670
 There are seven in total 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.740
 is going to tell you that it is lenderman has 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.740
 gone and then they have already won 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.670

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.400
 find all loes ton and he has killed me 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.680
 burnt 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.290
 and it may seem to us behind or in 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.560
 any part and well this has been 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.199
 All mod I highly recommend them there 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.680
 certainly have to put the 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.440
 difficulty to the maximum here because if not 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.169
 It will not work for them and well I hope that 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.529
