00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
thinking as well dug up stone I'm not

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.660 
thinking as well dug up stone I'm not
sure<00:03:19.470> if<00:03:19.560> it's<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.739> huge<00:03:19.920> edge<00:03:20.250> because<00:03:20.520> five

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
sure if it's a huge edge because five

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.010 
sure if it's a huge edge because five
and<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:20.880> half<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.180> lot<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.510> points<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.900> maybe

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
and a half is a lot of points and maybe

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.510 
and a half is a lot of points and maybe
I'm<00:03:22.170> thinking<00:03:22.380> maybe<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.860> money<00:03:23.070> line<00:03:23.280> or

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
I'm thinking maybe the money line or

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
bought down to three one of those ways

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.830 
bought down to three one of those ways
of<00:03:26.010> taking<00:03:26.970> advantage<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.630> but<00:03:27.750> i'm

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
of taking advantage of it but i'm

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.420 
of taking advantage of it but i'm
thinking<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.260> colts<00:03:28.590> are<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:29.070> play<00:03:29.220> here

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430
