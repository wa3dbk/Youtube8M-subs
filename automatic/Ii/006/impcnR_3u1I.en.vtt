00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.639
 I'm going to show you how to protect the wood 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.020
 and the iron of the inclemency of 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.630
 weather 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.760
 wooden houses balusters 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.800
 gates will be many more beautiful more 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.800
 protected and they will last us many more years 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.619
 the tools that we are going to use 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.840
 to treat our metal are going to be the 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.579
 following the bodywork or paper tape 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.320
 with tape that will serve to cover 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.829
 the fittings or the areas that we do not want 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.510
 paint after the brush to cut that 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.629
 will help us get to the places 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.339
 more inaccessible the sandpaper and the 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.860
 metal brush that will serve us for 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.820
 sand the oxide or possible remains of 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.879
 paint that we have left 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.890
 above and the mini roller for the 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.300
 face that will be used for the application 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.300
 of the primer and the paint 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.629
 the materials that we are going to use to 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.390
 our metal are going to be the following 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.070
 first simple grimm is a product of 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.780
 cleaning diluted with water 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.360
 we will use to remove the remains of 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.159
 fat or powder that remain after 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.990
 we will use an anti primer 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.420
 oxidant so that the paint that 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.950
 let's later put on better grip and 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.350
 It will also help us to prevent 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.000
 corrosion of the oxide and how last that 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.220
 we will use a glaze that enamel 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.229
 It makes us look nice metal 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.990
 it will be the final finish so that we have 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.630
 perfect for treating natural wood 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.700
 we will use a protective fund or 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.190
 preventive treatment this kind of 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.429
 funds or treatments are insecticides 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.210
 fungicides and also repel water 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.700
 subsequently after this fund 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.710
 let's apply a decorative protector 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.479
 or varnish will be absorbed by wood and we 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.429
 protect from the sun the advantage of using 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.259
 a decorative protector is that the 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.030
 next time we want to paint it not 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.030
 It will require neither sanding nor sanding 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.560
 let's start with the iron in this 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.049
 case we have bought a new chair with 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.450
 which we are going to treat normally these 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.490
 chairs come from the factory with grease to 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.800
 we will use a simple product 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.510
 green with it we will remove all the fat and 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.510
 the powder that brings our new metal 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.270
 in the event that we had an iron 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.190
 that was very old or that was 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.560
 painted but very bad condition 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.530
 let's use a metal brush 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.960
 like this one or a medium grade sandpaper like 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.590
 this one to eliminate the remains of paint 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.690
 or oxide that that nc in that metal once 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.070
 clean the surface what we are going to 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.690
 do is going to be apply our 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.310
 primer the primer is going to 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.650
 serve not only for that painting 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.530
 grip well but to avoid it coming out 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.580
 the rust for the most difficult areas 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.120
 let's use a brush to 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.120
 trim 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.950
 After drying time , we will 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.709
 Apply the final finish coat on top 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.870
 of the primer for a more finished 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.650
 perfect we will apply two hands of 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.959
 product and let it dry 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.209
 to protect our iron from the 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.040
 possible rust attacks we are going to give 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.200
 a third layer to the areas where 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.620
 the angles tend to be more conflictive 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.019
 and the corners in the maritime zones or 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.019
 of mountain we will apply a third 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.269
 hand to all our iron now let's 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.829
 treat our exterior wood this 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.709
 wood is untreated 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.209
 let's give it a protective background that the 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.069
 will protect from fungi and 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.260
 insects and then a protector 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.269
 decorative that will give a final finish 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.459
 beautiful and will protect us from 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.870
 inclement weather the first thing that 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.700
 let's do it's going to be sanding the 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.970
 surface of the wood with a sandpaper 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.970
 fine 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.220
 what we are going to do next is going to 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.220
 be cover the hardware not to paint 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.100
 let's use a rag to remove the 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.100
 sandpaper powder we will apply the 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:05.490
 treatment with the mini roller this 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.560
 treatment is fungicide and insecticide 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.390
 once dry we will apply our 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.070
 decorative protector first 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.590
 We will use the mini roller for the 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.110
 wider areas and the trim brush 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.510
 for the most difficult areas we leave 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.340
 dry to apply the second layer in 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.340
 extreme conditions and we can even 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.680
 give a third hand a tip for 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.480
 treat exotic or hard woods like 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.340
 the oak we are going to use a 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.620
 special primer for woods 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.620
 exterior to later paint 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.700
 up here our demonstration will 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.190
 We invite you to visit our stores 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.570
 leroy merlin and learn much more in 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.570
