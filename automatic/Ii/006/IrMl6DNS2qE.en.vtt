 presents para boys today denied by 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.440
 just and i feel this new video that 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.880
 precisely the first episode of another of 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.640
 a new series of one of the two new ones 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.710
 series that I will begin shortly but 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.900
 but I've already started one thing 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.820
 a little ambiguous and that is precisely the first 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.530
 episode of the earthy hypotesis series a 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.840
 shovel because mensi boys I saw that 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.390
 many of you in the series with asked 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.739
 precisely to advise me precisely nano 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.330
 asked to do the problem then 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.260
 here we are that the first episode of the 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.260
 pro club series 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.150
 I practically asked the usual 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.120
 however I do the double commentaries that 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.800
 they are marco sini 58 and carmi 9 to do 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.290
 tonight and then liked it a lot 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.300
 so we said but let's do it 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.510
 let's start is practically comment 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.900
 live sometimes and like this 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.030
 episode 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.400
 or not the games we play in the 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.260
 our procaccino to arrive maybe not 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.540
 I know in the first division 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.310
 I don't even know if it is there and therefore powerful 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.940
 a little thing I wanted to ask 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.830
 is that I don't remember it anyway anyway 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.210
 they are help while I was thinking about that 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.799
 if I haven't managed a couple of things 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.719
 practically the first is then 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.259
 advise me well the other place I have 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.119
 to start 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.320
 they came by reading the comments beyond 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.090
 that pro club was two more 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.950
 requests then the first was to 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.719
 starting with a powerful player e 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.700
 get to build them all his own 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.020
 team around or a team 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.969
 around but it seems to me all his 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.070
 team around ibrahimovic type yes 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.409
 he built psg is that one thing enough 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.909
 powerful but I also know the idea is 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.530
 that of trying to reach the front 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.640
 division without for and without having 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.920
 defeats 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.869
 but then I thought but let's take a chance 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.090
 which highlights the connection with pure 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.539
 I lost that game was already over 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.340
 so I do n't know you advise you and if you do 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.829
 you have others to recommend me do not hesitate 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.320
 to write them in the comments 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.149
 very last thing if you can write me 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.560
 if you would like it maybe not future 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.570
 open a proclamation open to all 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.039
 members so that maybe I can 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.840
 I can play with you and you can 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.220
