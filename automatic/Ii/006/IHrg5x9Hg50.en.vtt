 quantitative data of the ingredients and the recipe 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.560
 I write you how to use the infobox 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:29.640
 Let's go and we need it 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:34.500
 Of course many many strawberries lemon 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:38.280
 says concentrate water 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.960
 and sugar just actually and 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.580
 Let's go first, you put out of the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.130
 water and the sugar of a kind of syrup 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.920
 for heated water in a pot 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.010
 go first and then sugar on it 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.620
 cook it all up when it's on 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.360
 cooked then you switch the stove 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.360
 and that the whole filling 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.290
 then you take the strawberries cleaned 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.170
 and cut her a bit with it 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.630
 we can mash them afterwards 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.130
 You can do it all too if you have many 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.259
 have strawberries and did not know 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.119
 to prepare wonderfully and 1 4 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.100
 then you have in winter or when too 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.280
 always in my base for strawberry 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.479
 goes jam or strawberry one the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.780
 strawberries then just put in a pot 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.939
 or on a high vessel and puree that 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.560
 whole with the device died and this one 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.289
 theory is wonderful too 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.890
 do not concentrate to freeze 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.890

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.960

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.930
 then he gives the value of puree the 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.640
 Lemon juice appears pretty much 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.070
 two whole bottles per kilo 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.890
 strawberries but that really needs that 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.670
 then you give it to the cooled 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.670
 sugar syrup 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.209
