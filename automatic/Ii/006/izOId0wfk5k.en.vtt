biggest reason for me to start YouTube
and<00:05:32.540> actually<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:33.200> reason<00:05:33.380> that<00:05:33.590> I<00:05:33.710> started

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
and actually the reason that I started

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.440 
and actually the reason that I started
watching<00:05:34.340> youtubes<00:05:34.850> in<00:05:34.970> the<00:05:35.060> first<00:05:35.300> place

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
watching youtubes in the first place

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.390 
watching youtubes in the first place
like<00:05:36.110> all<00:05:36.350> those<00:05:36.500> years<00:05:36.680> ago<00:05:36.830> and<00:05:37.250> he

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
like all those years ago and he

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.310 
like all those years ago and he
definitely<00:05:37.700> is<00:05:37.910> a<00:05:38.000> big<00:05:38.150> part<00:05:38.390> of<00:05:38.510> why<00:05:38.810> my<00:05:39.020> humor

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
definitely is a big part of why my humor

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.400 
definitely is a big part of why my humor
is<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:39.710> way<00:05:39.860> it<00:05:39.950> is<00:05:40.040> now<00:05:40.930> that<00:05:41.930> supposed<00:05:42.290> to<00:05:42.380> be
