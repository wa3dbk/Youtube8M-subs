00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.390
 and good to all those commenting 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.310
 that I bring you a gameplay of the black ops 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.530
 but as you are going to see it is about 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.050
 Betting game but not the game 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.490
 of your normal but we played 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.540
 10,000 code points usually I play 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.490
 10 what is normal 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.780
 the Sunday betting game does not 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.180
 I know exactly what is called or good 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.400
 people who play simply to play 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.140
 no no no more and yet here 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.410
 we were playing betting games 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.300
 playing about 10,000 code points and 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.700
 You know, it's a shame to be the bet 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.220
 highest and I had never played but I was 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.120
 a year that he did not play since he's 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.770
 they appeared central models since not 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.600
 there were people to play you play games 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.400
 of mind with a better an American than 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.740
 has a jump connection and so on but 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.750
 well I got a game I had for 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.820
 at least five more Europeans and there 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.340
 we were playing and the truth is that it was 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.710
 quite pretty epic at the beginning is 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.630
 totally a disaster then I'm good 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.910
 I recovered a bit and in the end it ended 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.620
 ended up but good as you go 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.170
 to see just appreciate me put it on 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.120
 background because he first had engraved 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.280
 in live then it turns out that it was not recorded 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.620
 the game and I said mother while the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.930
 movie mode riding 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.070
 also fit because obviously before 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.630
 to enter the game that does not stay 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.370
 recorded in cinema mode so I was going to 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.480
 be a comment on live but there 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.110
 things that you have to go talk about 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.420
 example 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.980
 this guy or earlier start from 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.510
 all those things in a series in the 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.730
 departure so good I opted for 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.220
 even if they did not have likes, I was not 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.530
 Well, the principle can not aggravate it 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.320
 that nothing the truth is that simply 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.240
 I deserved to tell you what it is or what it is 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.220
 what do you think is so magical 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.010
 let's say this game mode that to me 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.510
 love and in fact because it is to play 2 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.610
 call of duty are specifically black 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.720
 ops and lots of people playing games 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.170
 of bets on any game of 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.180
 bets of 10 points or normal 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.950
 there are those of 10 out of 1000 and those of 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.480
 10,000 which are the ones that told you not to 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.550
 there was practically nobody when 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.660
 already finished crossbow 2 that starts at 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.160
 put from here on and there comes a 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.830
 moment in which by this area at the end 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.560
 with him put red did he or she with the 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.390
 ballistic cuchi and then tomahawk let's go 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.729
 and at a time when he is unstoppable already 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.300
 you will see it later but it is totally 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.350
 totally epic 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.240
 The fact is that good is what 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.360
 you think it makes everything so addictive 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.370
 this I think my opinion is that it is 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.750
 fun to start is a weapon 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.260
 is that everyone is on equal terms 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.480
 conditions and in addition to spectacular 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.730
 it's pure software here was where 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.549
 I got everything it's like pure show 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.810
 because here it comes out pure show 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:30.270
 this in this game of all 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.770
 it was created tomahawk valley this was the 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.530
 perfect combination to give 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.090
 show and the truth is that it was 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.830
 incredible was amazing when I started 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.470
 do those games and so on and when 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.150
 stop saying oysters is that you have seen 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.410
 how have I been humiliated to ehealth me with 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.360
 the work that I said my mother has already 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.670
 lost my ten thousand points I shit on 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.470
 everything that speaks but I came up to him 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.480
 clavate in the ballistic neck then 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.190
 I go up calm in a slogan 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.480
 well been already too much but good the 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.760
 case is what what I say is that 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.980
 this is where I started everything when he said 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.600
 oysters is that I had a great time or 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.580
 when you already have the game say that 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.489
 pretty trite you do not know 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.840
 practically a lot of game stuff 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.670
 the good games you enter sets of 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.290
 good games we are here that the 90 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.140
 one that has been my best game in 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.450
 any school you that 91 so 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.790
 Mythical that I have uploaded on the channel as 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.019
 well once I had not played a 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.640
 pile and already when the 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.160
 white was when I started playing the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.890
 Betting games was simply 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.870
 to have fun and also I also put 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.430
 play also with the tomahawk then to 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.599
 playing with the crossbow can play me with 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.340
 one thing with the other with weapons 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.870
 spectacular simply well 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.069
 for trying everything and let's say more 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.609
 oriented to see 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.709
 also when it started it had started in 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.689
 youtube and when obviously then you want 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.609
 give people content that is 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.980
 fun not many times for very good 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.139
 that is the good game for very good 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.549
 let it be the game let's say it's more 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.349
 fun maybe watch a live you can 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.700
 laugh at you and after all it's 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.109
 for what goes around everyone does not 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.579
 in fact then then why 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.159
 I always vary in the channel after 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.169
 things and others and I just usually go up 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.060
 the truth is that basically what more 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.499
 times and I feel like playing a game I upload 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.620
 more of that game if you do not feel like it 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:08.700
 he knew, that is, I do not do anything 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.409
 obligation I just guess that what 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.760
 What has pleased me in this case? 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.250
 well I was playing here white 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.449
 lately I'm playing pretty 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.859
 but I'm not playing 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.539
 spectacular or it is done that I do not get 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.609
 a normal weapon or normal gusts 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.460
 which means playing little flamethrower me 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.650
 I put a shotgun is that in the gun 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.530
 well you have suggested me even a 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.599
 bunch of series only for a robot 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.220
 the buzzer 20 in a game and eye 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.710
 you have seen that the streak of 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.090
 tomahawk not the people you already know that 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.020
 when you're number one for the first 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.550
 starting I think below on the left 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.930
 you leave with a point 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.370
 yellow on the map instead of a 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.770
 tomahawk to the one who came to humiliate me 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.090
 the back 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.080
 or the level I get here is is 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.360
 exaggerated 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.520
 the blade was low everywhere 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.720
 me looking for no bullets looking for tomahawks 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.340
 and looking for everything on the floor like 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.740
 You see, I collect the ones that they 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.660
 they send me another tomahawk I 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.100
 There came a time when it is incredible 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.110
 keep in mind that all these people are 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.580
 people who gambled to 10,000 is to say yes 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.780
 you're terrible you do not play 10,000 here 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.330
 I would turn esther's bush while 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.430
 that I turn to be as I tell you was a 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.020
 extremely epic end of fact in the 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.790
 life that I have recorded mother I begin 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.280
 to scream already at this moment it was like 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.970
 my mother and this one happens to me the tomahawk me 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.870
 cut the bangs there bone tomahawk 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.640
 let's say that there is also a knife 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.860
 ballistic or be an end the less 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.900
 epic and nothing to exhaust the video I like 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.520
 favorite you already know as always and 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.260
 tell me what you think is the secret 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.880
 that this mode of play had the mode of 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.290
 betting game on the white is which 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.800
 you think that is what makes it so 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.800
 funny 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.860
 God
