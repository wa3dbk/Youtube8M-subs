00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.900
 before called gold aysén you passed 6 now 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.059
 it is simply this 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.099
 this model keeps the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.139
 sobriety and elegance that always 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.449
 characterized but adds a plus 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.390
 sportsmanship and a lot more lines 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.850
 stylized in reality what it does is 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.300
 follow the trend that he inaugurated there 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.730
 for the year 2004 to mercedes benz cls that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.430
 was to create a coupe four 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.530
 doors with a coupe-style sedan 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.390
 what you like most in the news today 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.420
 on wheels I propose that we try 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.489
 well in detail this volkswagen cs that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.090
 It has a turbo diesel engine of 2 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.829
 liters and 170 horsepower associated 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.829
 with a manual box of 6 more 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.799
 The only one we are testing is the 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.950
 Equipped with the turbodiésel engine of 2 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.140
 liters and 170 horsepower associated 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.850
 to a 6-speed manual gearbox that 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.310
 They can also carry an automatic 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.960
 double clutch has no difference 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.970
 regarding the propellant that carries the 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.920
 passat but that does not stop 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.170
 surprise since it works in a way 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.030
 impeccable in both acceleration and 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.520
 at the time of going to the supplier for 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.590
 load fuel in the first aspect 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.470
 his recovery is remarkable at the moment 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.630
 of the overshoot that is something in 6a it does 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.399
 in an energetic way in any other 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.880
 march but what catches the attention 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.740
 is your consumption traveling 100 kilometers 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.119
 per hour with the engine spinning in just 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.280
 1600 laps the cc spends 44 liters each 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.140
 100 kilometers and in the city ​​it is 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.229
 under 6 liters per 100 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.060
 kilometers with a very relaxed handling the 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.560
 walking is impeccable since the diagram 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.600
 suspensions has the commitment of 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.210
 achieve a balance between comfort and 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.130
 sport behavior is therefore 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.200
 firm enough to 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.300
 travel with absolute stability to high 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.310
 speeds and bend 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.820
 with a reduced inclination of the 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.820
 bodywork 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.130
 then it is still part of the range 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.310
 of the passat but what I look for the brand 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.950
 with this update you can differentiate 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.800
 the good of the passat and more than anything 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.800
 accentuate your sporty appearance 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.480
 the formula is already known but not for 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.040
 it is no longer effective to take a 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.930
 existing vehicle and perform 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.480
 modifications to differentiate it from 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.670
 rest of the conventional range here the 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.500
 volkswagen passat received changes 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.140
 structural design scheme 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.640
 interior suspensions among others and 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.310
 the result is in sight and 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.680
 denominates cc the main changes are 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.020
 they appreciate fundamentally on the front 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.820
 with a rethinking of the optics the 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.740
 grill and the bumper that now what 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.050
 aligns with the most recent image of 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.300
 volkswagen is from behind also exhibits 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.160
 brand new optics with LED lighting 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.800
 just like the front one in this 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.410
 version that decidedly invade the 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.050
 lid of the trunk whose edge simulates in addition 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.730
 a small deflector inside is 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.130
 elegant and is made with 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.470
 materials and terminations according to 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.810
 the category of the model the position of 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.360
 handling is optimal thanks to the format 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.490
 anatomical of the seats and the multiple 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.100
 of electrical adjustment and even lumbar 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.260
 which is complemented by the wide adjustment 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.870
 in height and depth proposed by the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.370
 multifunction steering wheel the board is 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.830
 simple with quadrants 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.450
 easy-to- read logic and the console 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.670
 is dominated by a touch screen 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.140
 from which the system of command is commanded 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.780
 audio and you see the transmitted images 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.239
 for the parking chamber that 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.280
 connects when you put the reverse and appears 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.980
 under the logo that is in the gate 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.810
 of the leather trunk in the material seats 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.849
 off on the doors and front panel and 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.190
 several aluminum appliques acclimate 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.900
 this cabin very refined the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.419
 habitability is in tune with the 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.130
 size of the car the rear seats are 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.650
 ideal for two people of no more than 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.240
 about 75 meters high more than anything 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.729
 for the free height in the area of 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.860
 head due to the fall of the roof to 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.870
 get the coupe effect and because the 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.150
 central position will be uncomfortable in 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.139
 long stretches while there is space 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.850
 load of excess with 455 liters 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.380
 the version we are testing is the 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.169
 exclusive and if we talk about the equipment 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.380
 in security offers frontal boiled 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.600
 curtain and side brakes abs controls 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.820
 Traction stability isofix anchorages 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.490
 for children's chairs and bi-xenon headlights 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.320
 next to the corner light function this 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.460
 means that when you turn in a corner 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.560
 it turns on 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.479
 but corresponding fog for 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.090
 expand the field illuminated at night 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.370
 It also incorporates throughout its range the 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.259
 novel fatigue detector is about 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.509
 a system that identifies the signs 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.280
 of tiredness of the driver warning him 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.440
 by an acoustic signal and a 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.180
 visual recommendation that came the 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.539
 moment to take a break in the 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.539
 trip 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.980
 We reviewed the technical data sheet of the 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.360
 Volkswagen if you want an engine 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.340

 a power of 170 cb and a maximum torque or 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.490
 torque of 358 meters from the

 has an average fuel consumption 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:56.380
 of 5 liters per 100 kilometers comes

 17-inch alloy wheels very 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.880
 striking the weight of the car is 1557 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.250
 kilograms and fuel tank 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:12.270
