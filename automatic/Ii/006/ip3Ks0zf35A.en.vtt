00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
that it's just about 10 and 3/16 to 10

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.710 
that it's just about 10 and 3/16 to 10
and<00:01:52.020> 1/8<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.460> would<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.509> were<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
and 1/8 and that would if you were to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.569 
and 1/8 and that would if you were to
have<00:01:54.840> an<00:01:54.990> additional<00:01:55.350> 3/8<00:01:55.829> over<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.399> order

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
have an additional 3/8 over the order

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.240 
have an additional 3/8 over the order
size<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.149> would<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.329> proper<00:01:57.719> size<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.590> you
