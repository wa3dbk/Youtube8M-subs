on<00:02:27.320> your<00:02:27.400> on<00:02:28.400> your<00:02:28.459> right<00:02:28.910> hand<00:02:29.590> now<00:02:31.930> how<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:32.959> do

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
on your on your right hand now how I do

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.440 
on your on your right hand now how I do
it<00:02:33.530> is<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.770> use<00:02:33.950> my<00:02:33.980> second<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.790> third<00:02:34.820> finger

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
it is I use my second and third finger

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.140 
it is I use my second and third finger
because<00:02:35.980> just<00:02:36.980> from<00:02:37.160> classical<00:02:37.670> posture

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
because just from classical posture

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.730 
because just from classical posture
that's<00:02:38.510> just<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.900> fingers<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.350> I<00:02:39.410> would<00:02:39.560> use

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
that's just the fingers that I would use

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.310 
that's just the fingers that I would use
I<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.880> could<00:02:41.000> use<00:02:41.180> your<00:02:41.390> first<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:41.870> second

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
I you could use your first and second

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.170 
I you could use your first and second
fingers<00:02:42.650> but<00:02:42.920> I'm<00:02:43.160> just<00:02:43.400> used<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.760> doing<00:02:43.970> it

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
fingers but I'm just used to doing it

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.460 
fingers but I'm just used to doing it
this<00:02:44.330> way<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:44.570> may<00:02:44.810> be<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.930> good<00:02:45.080> idea<00:02:45.230> to

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
this way so may be a good idea to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.900 
this way so may be a good idea to
practice<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:46.010> both<00:02:46.160> ways<00:02:46.370> just<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.700> kind<00:02:46.880> of

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
practice it both ways just to kind of

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.509 
practice it both ways just to kind of
give<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.209> know<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:49.010> know<00:02:49.130> share<00:02:49.370> the
