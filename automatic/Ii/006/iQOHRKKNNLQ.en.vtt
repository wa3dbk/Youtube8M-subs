have<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.730> wondered<00:00:06.000> what<00:00:06.390> it<00:00:06.480> would<00:00:06.600> be<00:00:06.720> like

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
have you wondered what it would be like

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.110 
have you wondered what it would be like
to<00:00:07.290> be<00:00:07.319> an<00:00:07.500> astronaut<00:00:08.040> floating<00:00:08.580> around<00:00:08.670> in

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
to be an astronaut floating around in

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.459 
to be an astronaut floating around in

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
the space station why are the astronauts

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.000 
the space station why are the astronauts
floating<00:00:14.629> I'm<00:00:15.629> here<00:00:16.230> at<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.619> Powerhouse

why<00:00:20.580> are<00:00:20.760> they<00:00:20.910> floating<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.900> their<00:00:22.050> gravity

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
why are they floating in their gravity

gravity<00:00:30.509> holds<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> answer<00:00:31.169> in<00:00:31.349> space

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
gravity holds you the answer in space

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.110 
gravity holds you the answer in space
there's<00:00:31.890> nothing<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:32.369> they<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:32.940> float

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
there's nothing there they just float

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.720 
there's nothing there they just float
there's<00:00:33.480> no<00:00:33.660> gravity<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.020> space<00:00:34.489> no<00:00:35.489> greater

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
there's no gravity in space no greater

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.540 
there's no gravity in space no greater
that's<00:00:36.059> very<00:00:36.210> little<00:00:36.860> but<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.040> there<00:00:38.280> really

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
that's very little but is there really

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.869 
that's very little but is there really
no<00:00:38.879> gravity<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.390> space<00:00:39.920> after<00:00:40.920> all<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.670> moon

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
no gravity in space after all the moon

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.340 
no gravity in space after all the moon

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
station fit in this picture can you make

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.970 
station fit in this picture can you make
me<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> roughly<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.629> scale<00:00:51.659> model<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> earth

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
me a roughly to scale model of the earth

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.439 
me a roughly to scale model of the earth
and<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.309> moon<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.120> then<00:00:54.269> we're<00:00:54.360> gonna

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
and the moon and then we're gonna

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.509 
and the moon and then we're gonna
position<00:00:54.659> the<00:00:54.989> space<00:00:55.230> station<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.129> so

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
position the space station in there so

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.570 
position the space station in there so
try<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:58.430> maybe<00:00:59.839> then<00:01:01.309> you<00:01:02.309> ready<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
try like that maybe then you ready to

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.820 
try like that maybe then you ready to
see<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> real<00:01:02.879> distance<00:01:03.210> hmm<00:01:03.680> how<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:04.739> you

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
see the real distance hmm how do you

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.230 
see the real distance hmm how do you
reckon

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
reckon

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.820 
reckon
Oh

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.510 

it's<00:01:13.160> actually<00:01:13.730> about<00:01:14.710> here<00:01:15.710> maybe<00:01:16.250> a<00:01:16.370> little

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
it's actually about here maybe a little

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.010 
it's actually about here maybe a little
further<00:01:16.730> I<00:01:17.150> think<00:01:17.210> we<00:01:17.480> were<00:01:17.600> wrong

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
further I think we were wrong

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.050 
further I think we were wrong
now<00:01:18.560> if<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.860> moon<00:01:19.100> is<00:01:19.280> here<00:01:19.550> and<00:01:19.730> the<00:01:19.790> earth<00:01:19.880> is

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
now if the moon is here and the earth is

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.550 
now if the moon is here and the earth is
there<00:01:20.330> whereabouts<00:01:21.080> would<00:01:21.230> you<00:01:21.350> put<00:01:21.500> the

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
there whereabouts would you put the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.590 
there whereabouts would you put the
space<00:01:21.800> station<00:01:22.330> yeah

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
space station yeah

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.400 
space station yeah
pity<00:01:24.550> about<00:01:25.550> halfway<00:01:25.700> yeah<00:01:26.270> right<00:01:26.930> about<00:01:27.140> here

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
pity about halfway yeah right about here

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.230 
pity about halfway yeah right about here
so<00:01:27.590> that's<00:01:28.040> maybe<00:01:28.280> like<00:01:28.430> a<00:01:28.610> quarter<00:01:29.060> of<00:01:29.090> the

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
so that's maybe like a quarter of the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.880 
so that's maybe like a quarter of the
distance<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.900> moon<00:01:30.080> let<00:01:30.500> me<00:01:30.560> show<00:01:30.680> you<00:01:30.740> the

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
distance to the moon let me show you the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
distance to the moon let me show you the
real<00:01:31.010> distance<00:01:31.220> you<00:01:31.460> ready<00:01:31.610> for<00:01:31.730> the<00:01:31.790> real

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
real distance you ready for the real

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.810 
real distance you ready for the real
distance<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:33.740> space<00:01:34.010> station<00:01:34.430> is<00:01:34.580> right

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
distance the space station is right

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:42.870 
distance the space station is right
about<00:01:35.120> there

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.640 

the<00:01:43.880> space<00:01:44.150> station<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.720> actually<00:01:45.200> only<00:01:45.470> about

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
the space station is actually only about

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.370 
the space station is actually only about
four<00:01:46.220> hundred<00:01:46.370> kilometers<00:01:47.030> away<00:01:47.150> so<00:01:48.080> if

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
four hundred kilometers away so if

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.960 
four hundred kilometers away so if
you're<00:01:48.620> in<00:01:48.710> Sydney<00:01:48.950> it's<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.520> little<00:01:49.760> further

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
you're in Sydney it's a little further

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.180 
you're in Sydney it's a little further
than<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.330> drive<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.720> Canberra<00:01:51.230> but<00:01:51.890> does<00:01:52.070> it

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
than the drive to Canberra but does it

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.070 
than the drive to Canberra but does it
make<00:01:52.310> sense<00:01:52.550> that<00:01:52.910> the<00:01:53.060> earth<00:01:53.270> exerts<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.780> big

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
make sense that the earth exerts a big

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.620 
make sense that the earth exerts a big
gravitational<00:01:54.800> force<00:01:55.010> on<00:01:55.160> you<00:01:55.400> but<00:01:56.120> nothing

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
gravitational force on you but nothing

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.690 
gravitational force on you but nothing
on<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.840> astronauts<00:01:57.710> just<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.100> short<00:01:58.340> distance

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
on the astronauts just a short distance

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.990 
on the astronauts just a short distance
away

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
away

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.280 
away
you<00:01:59.600> reckon<00:01:59.840> there<00:01:59.960> be<00:02:00.050> no<00:02:00.140> gravity<00:02:00.560> there

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
you reckon there be no gravity there

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.690 
you reckon there be no gravity there
there's<00:02:03.290> not<00:02:03.500> much<00:02:03.680> they<00:02:03.950> flex<00:02:04.220> we've<00:02:04.490> seen

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
there's not much they flex we've seen

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.280 
there's not much they flex we've seen
them<00:02:04.880> well<00:02:05.240> clearly<00:02:05.540> there's<00:02:05.780> not<00:02:05.960> they're

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
them well clearly there's not they're

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.320 
them well clearly there's not they're
floating<00:02:06.500> around<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:07.250> know<00:02:07.550> they<00:02:07.790> float<00:02:08.090> and

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
floating around I know they float and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.509 
floating around I know they float and
the<00:02:08.630> question<00:02:08.929> is<00:02:09.050> why<00:02:09.260> no<00:02:09.830> idea

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
the question is why no idea

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.490 
the question is why no idea
well<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.120> truth<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.930> force<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:13.409> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
well in truth the force on the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.710 
well in truth the force on the
astronauts<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.129> almost<00:02:14.700> as<00:02:14.940> much<00:02:14.970> as<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
astronauts is almost as much as the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.860 
astronauts is almost as much as the
force<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:18.060> then<00:02:18.239> why<00:02:18.599> are<00:02:18.629> they

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
force on you so then why are they

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.410 
force on you so then why are they
floating<00:02:19.200> while<00:02:19.620> you're<00:02:19.890> stuck<00:02:20.220> here<00:02:20.420> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
floating while you're stuck here the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.690 
floating while you're stuck here the
answer<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.409> astronauts<00:02:22.980> aren't<00:02:23.220> floating

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
answer is the astronauts aren't floating

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.089 
answer is the astronauts aren't floating
they're<00:02:24.299> falling<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.780> not<00:02:28.019> only<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.500> but

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
they're falling and not only that but

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.979 
they're falling and not only that but
the<00:02:29.220> space<00:02:29.489> station<00:02:29.970> they're<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.269> is<00:02:30.450> falling

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
the space station they're in is falling

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.020 
the space station they're in is falling
as<00:02:31.110> well<00:02:31.379> ah

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.360 

so<00:02:34.630> why<00:02:34.900> doesn't<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.470> space<00:02:35.740> station<00:02:36.160> come

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
so why doesn't the space station come

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.090 
so why doesn't the space station come
crashing<00:02:37.000> into<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.360> earth<00:02:37.620> well<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.710> reason

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
crashing into the earth well the reason

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.950 
crashing into the earth well the reason
is<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.400> space<00:02:39.730> station<00:02:40.210> and<00:02:40.360> astronauts

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
is the space station and astronauts

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.830 
is the space station and astronauts
inside<00:02:41.170> have<00:02:41.770> this<00:02:41.950> huge<00:02:42.460> sideways<00:02:43.150> velocity

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
inside have this huge sideways velocity

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.580 
inside have this huge sideways velocity
of<00:02:43.990> about<00:02:44.580> 28,000<00:02:45.580> kilometers<00:02:46.180> per<00:02:46.390> hour<00:02:46.590> so

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
of about 28,000 kilometers per hour so

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.140 
of about 28,000 kilometers per hour so
even<00:02:47.920> though<00:02:48.010> they're<00:02:48.160> falling<00:02:48.640> towards<00:02:49.090> the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
even though they're falling towards the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.960 
even though they're falling towards the
earth<00:02:49.420> they're<00:02:50.200> going<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:50.740> fast<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.640> as<00:02:51.790> they

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
earth they're going so fast that as they

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.880 
earth they're going so fast that as they
fall<00:02:52.330> towards<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.810> Earth's<00:02:52.930> surface<00:02:53.320> it

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
fall towards the Earth's surface it

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.120 
fall towards the Earth's surface it
curves<00:02:54.400> away<00:02:54.610> from<00:02:55.030> them<00:02:55.830> if<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.010> earth

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
curves away from them if the earth

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.680 
curves away from them if the earth
didn't<00:02:57.580> put<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.730> gravitational<00:02:58.240> force<00:02:58.450> on<00:02:58.540> them

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
didn't put a gravitational force on them

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.260 
didn't put a gravitational force on them
they<00:02:59.260> would<00:02:59.500> fly<00:03:00.370> out<00:03:00.430> into<00:03:00.730> space

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
they would fly out into space

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.120 
they would fly out into space
sure<00:03:01.480> yeah<00:03:01.720> right<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.440> it's<00:03:02.560> due<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.040> that

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
sure yeah right so it's due to that

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.590 
sure yeah right so it's due to that
gravitational<00:03:03.790> pull<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.330> they<00:03:04.450> can

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
gravitational pull that they can

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.229 
gravitational pull that they can
actually<00:03:04.750> keep<00:03:05.410> orbiting<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.400> earth<00:03:06.580> if<00:03:07.090> it

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
actually keep orbiting the earth if it

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.960 
actually keep orbiting the earth if it
was<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.630> stop<00:03:07.900> moving<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.640> would<00:03:09.790> be

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
was to stop moving and it would be

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.110 
was to stop moving and it would be
plummeting<00:03:10.270> exactly<00:03:11.110> what<00:03:11.230> would<00:03:11.380> they<00:03:12.120> they

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
plummeting exactly what would they they

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.400 
plummeting exactly what would they they
would<00:03:13.270> still<00:03:13.480> feel<00:03:13.630> weightless<00:03:14.020> until<00:03:14.350> you

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
would still feel weightless until you

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.880 
would still feel weightless until you
smash<00:03:14.620> into<00:03:14.830> something<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.590> space

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
smash into something so the space

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.160 
smash into something so the space
station<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.910> astronauts<00:03:19.420> inside<00:03:19.630> are

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
station and the astronauts inside are

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.199 
station and the astronauts inside are
constantly<00:03:20.950> accelerating<00:03:21.310> towards<00:03:22.090> the

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
constantly accelerating towards the

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.030 
constantly accelerating towards the
Earth's<00:03:22.360> core<00:03:22.780> but<00:03:23.440> they<00:03:23.560> never<00:03:23.770> get<00:03:23.980> any

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
Earth's core but they never get any

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.490 
Earth's core but they never get any
closer<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:24.910> because<00:03:25.900> they're<00:03:26.170> accelerating

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
closer and because they're accelerating

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.250 
closer and because they're accelerating
at<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:26.980> same<00:03:27.250> rate<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:28.239> astronauts<00:03:28.870> feel

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
at the same rate the astronauts feel

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.820 
at the same rate the astronauts feel
weightless<00:03:30.010> they<00:03:30.700> have<00:03:30.910> this<00:03:31.060> amazing

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
weightless they have this amazing

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:39.010 
weightless they have this amazing
sensation<00:03:32.830> of<00:03:32.950> floating

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.080
