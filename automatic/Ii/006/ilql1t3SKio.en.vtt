00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.209
 so I think it's a race that 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.339
 has installed in the permanent calendar 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.930
 and that it's worth it from the point of 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.630
 sporty view but also as a 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.520
 tourist attraction that 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.329
 sports tourism in the region that each 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.329
 time circulates more 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.329
 we are a group of friends and we are doing 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.370
 all together some extra we run by 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.440
 separated after a year like we want 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.440
 goals together for the next board 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:56.260
 running is to be healthy health is that 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.780
 feel good if all these people 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.900
 that we talk about thousands you can see there what 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:06.250
 I can do I tell my friends and 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:09.250
 family members who work less than 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.840
 rest more than enjoy more than not 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.840
 have shame do not be afraid that 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.090
 will enjoy a lot and after understanding 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:25.720
 to gain health you have to leave 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.720
 this does not do crazy things but with care 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.150
 another one of the exercises is the exercise 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.740
 of kneeling up to one 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.410
 knee lift that reaches up to the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.110
 horizontal and this we call skiing 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.330
 ping high another factor 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.240
 fundamental and determining factors 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.100
 the career technique is effective is what 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.260
 that I spoke a moment ago that is the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.030
 impulse phase that 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:57.670
 we work it and with alternating jumps 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.670
 they are well known as long kangaroos 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.740
 but this road without production 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.770
 I the rial program 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.540
 in the distension of the ligaments that 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.129
 make up the joint capsule and everything to 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.319
 level of the ankle joint is 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.640
 a frequent injury in practice 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.470
