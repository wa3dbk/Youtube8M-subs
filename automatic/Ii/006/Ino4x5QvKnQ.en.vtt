00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.560 
repair we have a 1997 Toyota Camry 2.2
liter<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:08.130> felled<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.519> emissions<00:00:08.970> test<00:00:09.269> at

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
liter that felled the emissions test at

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.450 
liter that felled the emissions test at
25<00:00:10.170> miles<00:00:10.380> an<00:00:10.530> hour<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.950> I'll<00:00:11.040> show<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:11.250> some

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
25 miles an hour and I'll show you some

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.279 
25 miles an hour and I'll show you some
of<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.580> things<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.849> found<00:00:16.520> it<00:00:17.520> has<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> code<00:00:18.289> po1

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
of the things I found it has a code po1

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.359 
of the things I found it has a code po1
71<00:00:20.420> lean<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.869> then<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.439> has<00:00:22.560> another<00:00:22.710> code<00:00:23.100> for

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
71 lean and then it has another code for

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.429 
71 lean and then it has another code for
the<00:00:23.460> air<00:00:23.580> fuel<00:00:23.760> ratio<00:00:23.850> sensor<00:00:24.600> P<00:00:25.410> 11:35<00:00:26.960> and<00:00:27.960> we

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
the air fuel ratio sensor P 11:35 and we

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.960 
the air fuel ratio sensor P 11:35 and we
can't<00:00:28.680> really<00:00:28.859> read<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> smog<00:00:29.369> report<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:29.910> it

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
can't really read the smog report but it

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.150 
can't really read the smog report but it
showed<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> gross<00:00:31.140> polluter<00:00:31.560> at<00:00:31.710> 25

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
showed it to be a gross polluter at 25

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.630 
showed it to be a gross polluter at 25
miles<00:00:32.399> an<00:00:32.640> hour<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.410> at<00:00:34.410> 15<00:00:34.739> miles<00:00:34.950> an<00:00:35.130> hour<00:00:35.280> it

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
miles an hour and at 15 miles an hour it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.540 
miles an hour and at 15 miles an hour it
did<00:00:35.820> find<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.329> everything<00:00:36.719> did<00:00:36.870> pretty<00:00:37.079> good

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
did find it everything did pretty good

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.150 
did find it everything did pretty good
so<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> system<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.120> running<00:00:39.300> lean<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.040> one<00:00:41.040> of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
so the system is running lean and one of

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.590 
so the system is running lean and one of
the<00:00:41.219> things<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.579> can<00:00:41.700> do<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> air

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
the things that can do that is the air

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.779 
the things that can do that is the air
flow<00:00:42.780> ratio<00:00:42.989> sensor<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:44.489> looks<00:00:44.640> like

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
flow ratio sensor it looks like

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.630 
flow ratio sensor it looks like
someone's<00:00:45.120> put<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.270> new<00:00:45.450> sensor<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.640> but

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
someone's put a new sensor in here but

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.310 
someone's put a new sensor in here but
they<00:00:47.730> didn't<00:00:47.969> throw<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.270> code<00:00:48.450> out<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.899> so

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
they didn't throw the code out of it so

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.740 
they didn't throw the code out of it so
I<00:00:49.350> think<00:00:49.530> that's<00:00:49.829> what's<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.370> there

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
I think that's what's going on there

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.150 
I think that's what's going on there
then<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.899> look<00:00:52.050> at<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.260> air<00:00:52.410> filter<00:00:52.800> inside

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
then we look at the air filter inside

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.100 
then we look at the air filter inside
this<00:00:53.340> housing<00:00:53.610> inside<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.239> filter<00:00:54.480> I've

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
this housing inside the filter I've

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.689 
this housing inside the filter I've
cleaned<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.559> out<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.039> was<00:00:56.129> all<00:00:56.280> dirty<00:00:56.550> in

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
cleaned it out but it was all dirty in

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.770 
cleaned it out but it was all dirty in
there<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.120> was<00:00:57.239> inside<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.780> there<00:00:59.629> was<00:01:00.629> all

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
there what was inside of there was all

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.450 
there what was inside of there was all
this<00:01:00.930> material<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.890> bottom<00:01:02.190> here

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
this material you see in the bottom here

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.210 
this material you see in the bottom here
so<00:01:02.809> every<00:01:03.809> time<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.110> accelerate<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:05.070> all

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
so every time you accelerate that all

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.289 
so every time you accelerate that all
that<00:01:05.400> debris<00:01:05.700> starts<00:01:06.090> rolling<00:01:06.479> around<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:09.180> it

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that debris starts rolling around and it

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.690 
that debris starts rolling around and it
gets<00:01:09.479> caught<00:01:09.659> up<00:01:09.810> inside<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> air<00:01:10.439> filter<00:01:10.830> and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
gets caught up inside the air filter and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.370 
gets caught up inside the air filter and
it<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:12.030> makes<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.479> make<00:01:12.600> sure<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> big<00:01:12.990> mess<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
it just makes it make sure a big mess it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.130 
it just makes it make sure a big mess it
clogs<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> air<00:01:13.830> filter<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:14.310> right<00:01:14.490> away

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
clogs the air filter up right away

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.300 
clogs the air filter up right away
another<00:01:16.140> thing<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.409> swaddle<00:01:16.799> body<00:01:16.950> got<00:01:17.130> real

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
another thing that swaddle body got real

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.390 
another thing that swaddle body got real
dirty<00:01:17.549> when<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> took<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.299> air<00:01:18.420> boot<00:01:18.659> off<00:01:18.840> I

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
dirty when I took the air boot off I

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.920 
dirty when I took the air boot off I
notice<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.549> big<00:01:20.759> crack<00:01:21.060> inside<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:21.750> so

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
notice this big crack inside of here so

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.990 
notice this big crack inside of here so
that's<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.040> supposed<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.460> split<00:01:23.729> open

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
that's not supposed to be split open

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.690 
that's not supposed to be split open
like<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.590> this<00:01:25.590> rubber<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:26.040> gets<00:01:26.280> old<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
like that this rubber just gets old and

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.520 
like that this rubber just gets old and
cracks<00:01:26.970> overtime<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:28.860> sucking<00:01:29.220> dirt

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
cracks overtime so that's sucking dirt

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
cracks overtime so that's sucking dirt
the<00:01:31.530> filters<00:01:31.890> way<00:01:32.070> back<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.150> it's

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the filters way back here so it's

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.260 
the filters way back here so it's
sucking<00:01:33.540> dirt<00:01:33.840> into<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.320> engine<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.180> go

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
sucking dirt into the engine so if we go

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.410 
sucking dirt into the engine so if we go
to<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.509> engine<00:01:36.869> now<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:39.000> look<00:01:39.119> inside

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
to the engine now and we look inside

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.899 
to the engine now and we look inside
that<00:01:39.479> throttle<00:01:40.020> plate<00:01:40.579> you've<00:01:41.579> seen<00:01:41.820> these

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
that throttle plate you've seen these

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.240 
that throttle plate you've seen these
before<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.299> previous<00:01:42.720> videos<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.350> baby<00:01:44.040> is

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
before in previous videos that baby is

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.830 
before in previous videos that baby is
just<00:01:44.280> jet-black<00:01:44.790> that's<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.689> worst

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
just jet-black that's one of the worst

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.710 
just jet-black that's one of the worst
ones<00:01:45.990> I've<00:01:46.200> ever<00:01:46.350> seen<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.479> thing<00:01:48.689> is

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
ones I've ever seen so that thing is

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.359 
ones I've ever seen so that thing is
just<00:01:49.020> full<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.320> carbon<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> motors<00:01:50.250> just

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
just full of carbon so the motors just

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.270 
just full of carbon so the motors just
got<00:01:50.549> sucked<00:01:50.820> full<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.119> dirt<00:01:52.100> another<00:01:53.100> thing

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
got sucked full of dirt another thing

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.289 
got sucked full of dirt another thing
that<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.460> cause<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.149> it's

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
don't work very well they don't threaten

don't work very well they don't threaten
very<00:02:38.490> well<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.600> threads<00:02:39.840> are<00:02:39.959> just<00:02:40.110> a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
very well that the threads are just a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.570 
very well that the threads are just a
little<00:02:40.380> bit<00:02:40.500> different<00:02:40.860> on<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.040> inlet<00:02:41.370> and

little bit different on the inlet and

this one comes with the little seal
rings<00:02:44.240> this<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.390> need<00:02:45.570> for<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.900> banjo<00:02:46.290> bolt

rings this you need for the banjo bolt
comes<00:02:47.070> with<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.700> don't<00:02:47.760> have<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:48.000> reuse

comes with it so you don't have to reuse

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.640 
comes with it so you don't have to reuse
the<00:02:48.420> old<00:02:48.450> ones<00:02:48.750> or<00:02:48.900> try<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.080> find<00:02:49.350> another

I drive it and then I have a scan to

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.470 
I drive it and then I have a scan to
hook<00:03:23.010> up<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.580> make<00:03:24.030> sure<00:03:24.180> all<00:03:24.330> the
