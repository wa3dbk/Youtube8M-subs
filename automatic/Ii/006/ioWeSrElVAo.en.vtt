00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
okay first I went that down them a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.650 
okay first I went that down them a
little<00:02:52.400> bit<00:02:52.490> of<00:02:52.550> acetone<00:02:53.710> clean<00:02:54.710> it<00:02:54.890> out<00:02:55.010> and

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.150 

then<00:02:59.660> I've<00:02:59.810> got<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:02.320> little<00:03:03.320> B<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.680> tool<00:03:03.890> thing

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
then I've got a little B the tool thing

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.340 
then I've got a little B the tool thing
I<00:03:04.280> pulled<00:03:04.520> out<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.820> bucket<00:03:05.030> I've<00:03:05.360> got<00:03:05.600> my

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
I pulled out of a bucket I've got my

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.750 
I pulled out of a bucket I've got my
juice<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.710> let<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:06.980> sit<00:03:07.160> around<00:03:07.340> for<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.640> while

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
juice I let it sit around for a while

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.380 
juice I let it sit around for a while
and<00:03:10.720> most<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.930> styrene<00:03:13.150> evaporates<00:03:14.150> out

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
and most of the styrene evaporates out

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.830 
and most of the styrene evaporates out
of<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.600> leaves<00:03:14.960> it<00:03:15.110> down<00:03:15.290> there<00:03:16.630> it's<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:17.690> lot

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
of it leaves it down there it's a lot

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:32.100 
of it leaves it down there it's a lot
thicker<00:03:26.770> let's<00:03:27.770> put

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.490 

mixing<00:03:32.950> partner<00:03:33.310> into<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:34.260> it's<00:03:35.260> pretty

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
mixing partner into it it's pretty

00:03:35.500 --> 00:04:04.360 
mixing partner into it it's pretty
sloppy

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:33.860 

you<00:04:05.370> hear<00:04:05.820> with<00:04:06.030> no<00:04:06.330> partner

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.420 

nice<00:04:34.870> looks<00:04:35.410> good<00:04:35.680> like<00:04:35.890> a<00:04:35.950> little<00:04:36.220> bit<00:04:36.340> of

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
nice looks good like a little bit of

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:57.650 
nice looks good like a little bit of
putty<00:04:41.580> have<00:04:42.580> it

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.390
