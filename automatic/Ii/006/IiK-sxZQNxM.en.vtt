00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
the Turismo you want to grab your most

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.199 
the Turismo you want to grab your most
expensive<00:02:38.109> car<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.609> just<00:02:39.760> want<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.000> drive

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
expensive car and you just want to drive

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.420 
expensive car and you just want to drive
out<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.690> what<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.530> should<00:02:41.739> do<00:02:41.889> is<00:02:42.040> spawn<00:02:42.310> you

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
out and what it should do is spawn you

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.860 
out and what it should do is spawn you
down<00:02:42.609> the<00:02:42.730> street<00:02:42.970> instead<00:02:43.090> of<00:02:43.359> skipping<00:02:43.599> the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
down the street instead of skipping the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:52.120 
down the street instead of skipping the
animation

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.590 

so<00:02:53.130> if<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.430> looks<00:02:53.640> like<00:02:53.820> this<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.300> means<00:02:54.420> that

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
so if it looks like this that means that

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.570 
so if it looks like this that means that
the<00:02:54.720> glitch<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:54.930> now<00:02:55.200> working<00:02:55.470> what<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.430> want
