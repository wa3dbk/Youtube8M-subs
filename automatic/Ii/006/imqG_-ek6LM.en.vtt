Mount Ebal up in Tomah County in Oregon
and<00:00:15.250> I'm<00:00:16.250> making<00:00:16.580> this<00:00:16.730> bed<00:00:17.150> because<00:00:17.810> I<00:00:18.470> had<00:00:19.250> an

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
and I'm making this bed because I had an

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.900 
and I'm making this bed because I had an
opinion<00:00:19.760> about<00:00:20.090> open<00:00:20.690> carry<00:00:20.990> and<00:00:21.580> of<00:00:22.580> course

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
opinion about open carry and of course

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:30.420 
opinion about open carry and of course
that's<00:00:23.619> changed<00:00:24.820> often<00:00:25.820> carrying<00:00:26.269> right<00:00:26.480> now

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.430 

the<00:00:31.430> reason<00:00:31.849> why<00:00:32.000> I<00:00:32.029> said<00:00:32.389> my<00:00:32.599> opinion<00:00:32.929> change

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
the reason why I said my opinion change

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.700 
the reason why I said my opinion change
was<00:00:33.859> because<00:00:34.780> I've<00:00:35.780> been<00:00:35.929> walking<00:00:36.199> around<00:00:36.469> in
