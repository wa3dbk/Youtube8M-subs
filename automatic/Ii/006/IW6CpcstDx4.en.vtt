middle chamber but it's supposed to be

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.560 
middle chamber but it's supposed to be
good<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.530> coralline<00:00:46.950> algae<00:00:47.480> supporting<00:00:48.480> the

baby trooper kilos those are actually

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.980 
baby trooper kilos those are actually
baby<00:01:06.840> trooper<00:01:07.200> coulis<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.689> got<00:01:09.689> cleaner

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
baby trooper coulis and got cleaner

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.600 
baby trooper coulis and got cleaner
shrimp<00:01:10.260> today<00:01:12.229> and<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:13.920> about<00:01:14.130> it

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.640 

gonna<00:01:17.610> mod<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.810> middle<00:01:19.049> chamber<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.439> little

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
gonna mod the middle chamber a little

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.260 
gonna mod the middle chamber a little
bit<00:01:19.770> more<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.400> put<00:01:20.430> jado<00:01:21.619> algae<00:01:22.880> plants<00:01:23.880> in

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
bit more and put jado algae plants in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.620 
bit more and put jado algae plants in
the<00:01:24.390> middle<00:01:25.290> chamber<00:01:25.470> with<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.270> LED<00:01:27.270> light<00:01:27.479> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the middle chamber with a LED light to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
the middle chamber with a LED light to
support<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:29.540> pulling<00:01:30.540> mod<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.140> first

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
support it and pulling mod the first

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.050 
support it and pulling mod the first
chamber<00:01:31.860> probably<00:01:32.310> cut<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:35.060> plastic

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
chamber probably cut like that a plastic

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.020 
chamber probably cut like that a plastic
piece<00:01:36.560> in<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.009> middle<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.490> separates<00:01:39.390> them

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
piece in the middle that separates them

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.780 
piece in the middle that separates them
for<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.090> little<00:01:42.270> bit<00:01:42.390> more<00:01:43.189> for<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> little<00:01:44.670> bit

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
for a little bit more for a little bit

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.249 
for a little bit more for a little bit
more<00:01:44.939> water<00:01:45.149> flow<00:01:46.610> this<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.759> about<00:01:48.000> it

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
more water flow this is about it

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.450 
more water flow this is about it
probably<00:01:49.259> update<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.680> about<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> month<00:01:50.159> when<00:01:50.369> I

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
probably update in about a month when I

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.370 
probably update in about a month when I
get<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> corals<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.930> wanna<00:01:52.110> get<00:01:52.170> that

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
get the corals I just wanna get that

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.179 
get the corals I just wanna get that
beneficial<00:01:53.189> bacteria<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.820> there<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:55.189> I'm

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
beneficial bacteria in there so I'm

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.190 
beneficial bacteria in there so I'm
thinking<00:01:56.640> chances<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.899> corals

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
thinking chances on you know the corals

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.550 
thinking chances on you know the corals
dying

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
dying

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.580 
dying
so<00:01:59.600> how<00:02:00.600> update<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> month<00:02:01.200> thanks<00:02:01.469> for
