00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:26.130
 gave his blessing in the years of hundreds 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.050
 or 42 so long ago it was not 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.570
 forgot about us share the feedback 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.000
 shared and of course now 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.050
 3 fill shares continue to count on 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.650
 your support 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.290
 I talk friends of the car bombs was 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.470
 obvious comrades we like cars 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.059

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.670
 between 4 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.699
 I think we just have to put it together and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.070
 rock and roll I really need 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.350
 explain it the images speak for themselves 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.720
 alone this is one of the many things 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.730
 that make bates filtres a lot 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.670
 more amazing than the competition 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.620
 You want some good advice 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.290
 work very well what I have titled 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.920
 like the strategy of Jorge Javier 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.479
 vÃ¡zquez from behind that hurts more and the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.890
 goal can be perfectly 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.440
 anyone 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.480
 for example run over people calm down 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.820
 our murderous instincts 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.040
 after several hours of driving with 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.840
 many cyclists ahead and by 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.649
 course airplanes and helicopters 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.409
 He said that the higher he flies the more 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.039
 hard and painful will be the fall by 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.039
 supposed 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.570
 We're really going to be as imbecile as 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.079

 a little endy back or friend or friends already 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.420
 I think I know but if there's something that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.490
 I can guarantee that it will happen when 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.549
 try to get to the subject of the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.710
 pump cars are weird things are not going to

 abundant to the vehicles that eleven 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.020
 Four friends
