there's<00:01:02.409> been<00:01:02.439> many<00:01:02.710> near<00:01:02.920> in<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.159> season

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880 

when<00:01:06.880> Chelsea<00:01:07.240> lost<00:01:07.420> Frank<00:01:07.630> Lampard<00:01:08.080> even

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
when Chelsea lost Frank Lampard even

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.109 
when Chelsea lost Frank Lampard even
though<00:01:08.979> fàbregas<00:01:09.460> is<00:01:09.580> different<00:01:09.939> what<00:01:10.060> he

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
though fàbregas is different what he

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.550 
though fàbregas is different what he
lacks<00:01:10.330> in<00:01:10.479> goals<00:01:10.720> he<00:01:10.900> makes<00:01:11.080> up<00:01:11.229> for<00:01:11.470> in

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
lacks in goals he makes up for in

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.899 
lacks in goals he makes up for in
assists<00:01:12.009> and<00:01:12.189> I<00:01:12.220> think<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.460> introduction<00:01:12.850> of

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
assists and I think the introduction of

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.700 
assists and I think the introduction of
fàbregas<00:01:13.420> when<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:13.720> compare<00:01:14.049> the<00:01:14.170> teams<00:01:14.409> of

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
fàbregas when you compare the teams of

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.560 
fàbregas when you compare the teams of
before<00:01:15.369> the<00:01:15.580> Drogba<00:01:15.939> team<00:01:16.150> that<00:01:16.360> he<00:01:16.450> was

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
before the Drogba team that he was

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.060 
before the Drogba team that he was
successful<00:01:16.869> with<00:01:17.229> this<00:01:17.409> one<00:01:17.619> now<00:01:17.770> it's<00:01:17.920> got<00:01:18.040> a

successful with this one now it's got a

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.740 
successful with this one now it's got a
little<00:01:18.250> bit<00:01:18.340> more<00:01:18.460> finesse<00:01:18.640> but<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.390> still<00:01:19.630> has

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
little bit more finesse but it still has

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.969
