with a digital caramel color sheen on

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.730 
with a digital caramel color sheen on
that<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.600> don't<00:02:30.750> know<00:02:30.930> something<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.440> really

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
that I don't know something I really

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.860 
that I don't know something I really
haven't<00:02:31.860> seen<00:02:32.130> before<00:02:32.280> or<00:02:32.670> at<00:02:33.270> least<00:02:33.480> haven't

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
haven't seen before or at least haven't

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.120 
haven't seen before or at least haven't
seen<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.260> apply<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.300> mobile<00:02:36.750> suit<00:02:36.930> before<00:02:37.130> so

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
seen it apply to a mobile suit before so

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.500 
seen it apply to a mobile suit before so
I<00:02:38.190> figured<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.790> would<00:02:38.910> add<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> little<00:02:39.330> bit<00:02:39.480> of

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
I figured it would add a little bit of

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.060 
I figured it would add a little bit of
um<00:02:39.840> realism<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.860> kid<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:42.410> just<00:02:43.410> wanted<00:02:43.950> to

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
um realism to the kid I just wanted to

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.910 
um realism to the kid I just wanted to
do<00:02:44.160> something<00:02:44.400> original<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.860> hopefully<00:02:46.860> I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
do something original and hopefully I

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.670 
do something original and hopefully I
was<00:02:47.280> able<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.490> pull<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.820> off<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.470> took<00:02:49.470> up<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.880 
was able to pull it off I took up the
seam<00:02:49.920> lines<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.670> knobs<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.720> cache<00:02:52.020> lines<00:02:52.350> and

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
seam lines the knobs the cache lines and

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.260 
seam lines the knobs the cache lines and

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
original one and I figure it just it

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.479 
original one and I figure it just it
just<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.419> just<00:04:19.750> not<00:04:20.199> the<00:04:20.680> right<00:04:20.859> scale<00:04:21.280> or

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
just it just not the right scale or

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.909 
just it just not the right scale or
something<00:04:21.940> so<00:04:22.419> I<00:04:22.479> figured<00:04:22.810> adding<00:04:23.139> make<00:04:23.620> him<00:04:23.800> a

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
something so I figured adding make him a

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.610 
something so I figured adding make him a
bigger<00:04:24.250> more<00:04:24.669> badass<00:04:25.110> beefing<00:04:26.110> will<00:04:26.260> add<00:04:26.380> to

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
bigger more badass beefing will add to

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.650
