let's just get into it the first thing
that<00:00:34.980> usually<00:00:35.100> goes<00:00:35.370> wrong<00:00:35.610> when<00:00:35.790> you're

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
that usually goes wrong when you're

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.670 
that usually goes wrong when you're
looking<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> foundation<00:00:36.930> at<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> drugstore

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
looking for a foundation at a drugstore

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.100 
looking for a foundation at a drugstore
is<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.250> there's<00:00:38.520> not<00:00:39.120> always<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.629> tester

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
is that there's not always a tester

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.680 
is that there's not always a tester
available<00:00:40.820> then<00:00:41.820> you're<00:00:41.969> left<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.329> make<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
available then you're left to make the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.810 
available then you're left to make the
decision<00:00:43.140> based<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.890> name<00:00:44.129> that's<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
decision based on the name that's on the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.840 
decision based on the name that's on the
bottle<00:00:48.559> and<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.860> remember<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.190> foundation

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
bottle and just remember that foundation

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.610 
bottle and just remember that foundation
usually<00:00:51.329> looks<00:00:51.539> darker<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.989> bottle<00:00:52.289> then

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
usually looks darker in the bottle then

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:01.020 
usually looks darker in the bottle then
on<00:00:52.770> your<00:00:52.949> skin<00:00:53.840> looks<00:00:54.840> good<00:00:54.989> enough

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.790 

and<00:01:01.150> then<00:01:01.810> we're<00:01:01.960> all<00:01:02.050> happy<00:01:02.080> because<00:01:02.560> we<00:01:02.680> just

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
and then we're all happy because we just

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.650

but don't tell anyone you definitely
want<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.729> test<00:01:48.940> it<00:01:49.090> out<00:01:49.150> on<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.360> back<00:01:49.509> of<00:01:49.630> your

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
want to test it out on the back of your

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.480 
want to test it out on the back of your
hand<00:01:49.960> or<00:01:50.140> on<00:01:50.380> your<00:01:50.590> neck<00:01:50.830> because<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.369> is

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
hand or on your neck because that is

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.640 
hand or on your neck because that is
where<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.759> skin<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:52.330> less<00:01:52.810> exposed<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.530> the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
where the skin is less exposed to the

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.640 
where the skin is less exposed to the
Sun<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.369> it's<00:01:54.490> your<00:01:54.580> true<00:01:54.940> natural<00:01:55.840> skin<00:01:56.410> color

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
Sun so it's your true natural skin color

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.080 
Sun so it's your true natural skin color
and<00:01:56.860> then<00:01:56.979> you<00:01:57.040> want<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.250> pick<00:01:57.400> maybe<00:01:57.790> two

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
and then you want to pick maybe two

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.480 
and then you want to pick maybe two
foundations<00:01:58.690> if<00:01:58.960> you<00:01:59.350> can't<00:01:59.560> decide<00:01:59.830> because

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
foundations if you can't decide because

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.430 
foundations if you can't decide because
then<00:02:01.000> you're<00:02:01.360> bound<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.690> find<00:02:01.960> one<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.320> will

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
then you're bound to find one that will

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.020 
then you're bound to find one that will
work<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:02.890> then<00:02:03.310> when<00:02:03.460> you're<00:02:03.610> applying<00:02:03.790> your

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
work and then when you're applying your

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.460 
work and then when you're applying your
foundation<00:02:04.570> it's<00:02:04.750> really<00:02:04.990> good<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.290> mix

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
foundation it's really good to mix

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.560 
foundation it's really good to mix
colors<00:02:05.860> there<00:02:06.130> as<00:02:06.280> well<00:02:06.550> because<00:02:06.850> then<00:02:07.000> you're

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
colors there as well because then you're

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:28.119 
colors there as well because then you're
