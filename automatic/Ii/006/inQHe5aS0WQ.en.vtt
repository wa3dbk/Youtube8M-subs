00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.070 
hello guys so right now my sister used
to<00:00:05.730> collect<00:00:05.970> those<00:00:06.450> things<00:00:06.899> called<00:00:07.259> webkinz

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
to collect those things called webkinz

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.129 
to collect those things called webkinz
so<00:00:11.599> she<00:00:12.599> gave<00:00:12.750> me<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:13.110> weird<00:00:13.620> one<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:15.139> I

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
so she gave me this weird one and I

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.230 
so she gave me this weird one and I
don't<00:00:16.260> really<00:00:16.560> like<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.220> but<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.550> was<00:00:17.850> doing<00:00:18.119> it

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
don't really like it but I was doing it

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.120 
don't really like it but I was doing it
just<00:00:18.449> for<00:00:18.630> YouTube<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.500> code<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.740> she

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
just for YouTube and the code that she

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.490 
just for YouTube and the code that she
never<00:00:20.250> opened<00:00:20.779> so<00:00:21.779> today<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.260> would<00:00:22.350> be

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
never opened so today we would be

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.140 
never opened so today we would be
opening<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.400> code<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:25.490> she<00:00:26.490> never<00:00:26.699> goes<00:00:26.970> on

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
opening that code and she never goes on

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.609 
opening that code and she never goes on
I<00:00:27.300> think<00:00:27.510> she<00:00:27.660> did<00:00:27.810> want<00:00:27.960> something<00:00:28.050> cuz<00:00:28.470> of

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
I think she did want something cuz of

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.930 
I think she did want something cuz of
the<00:00:28.939> stuffed<00:00:29.939> animal<00:00:30.740> so<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.769> figured<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.759> could

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the stuffed animal so I figured I could

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.930 
the stuffed animal so I figured I could
give<00:00:33.090> away<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.719> free<00:00:34.200> code<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.430> come<00:00:35.700> with

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
give away the free code that come with

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.360 
give away the free code that come with
it<00:00:36.050> to<00:00:37.050> online<00:00:37.500> for<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.180> whatever<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:43.370> got

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
it to online for the whatever so I got

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.569 
it to online for the whatever so I got
scissors<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.710> now<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:46.770> will<00:00:47.309> be<00:00:47.719> cutting<00:00:48.719> it
