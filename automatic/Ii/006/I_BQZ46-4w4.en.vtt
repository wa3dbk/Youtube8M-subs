00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.000
I am Gabriel

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.000
Whats up everyone. Today on Gabigol Mondays we will see two different tricks.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.400
The first move is the sidestep, and after we will see the fake shot.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.940
So guys, warms up your fingers because today is going to be intense!

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.720
For starters, we are going to look at the two touch.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.480
This version of the two touch is faster. One, two and you are done!

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.820
You will only see your opponent in the rear-view mirror.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.040
In PES 2015 it is the same. Take a look.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.240
For Playstation, head towards your opponent and move R3 down and L3 forward.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.980
For Xbox, do the same thing with RS and LS.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.880
This move is a bit slower.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.920
It has one tricky move here, another there, but it leaves the defender hanging.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.000
Simple and effective! And in PES it is no different. Check it out!

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.960
For Playstation, press and hold R2 and move R3 up.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.980
Afterwards, pick which side to exit from using L3.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.620
For Xbox, press and hold RT and RS and the same time.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.020
Then move LS up to where you'd like.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.840
Now we are going to see the fake shot.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.720
A well done fake shot is where the player thinks

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.040
you are going to go one direction and then BAM!

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.040
you go the other direction.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.880
In PES you can do the same thing. Check it out...

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.120
For PlayStation, press square and right after press X

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.640
Then move L3 forward and gently move upwards

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.520
For Xbox, press X, then A and finally do the same movement with LS.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.960
Look at these beautiful moves!

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.320
It looks like art, football art!

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.160
Now its your turn Gotze. Show them how to do it in PES.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.600
For Playstation, press the square and then X

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.080
Right afterwards move L3 forward.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.600
For Xbox, press X first, then A.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.120
To finish off the move, move LS forward.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.840
Hey everyone, today was rough.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.200
Lets take a break and come back next week for Gabigol Mondays.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.440
