00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
glass but what else does he go well if

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.150 
glass but what else does he go well if
we<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.190> open<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:36.200> followed<00:00:37.200> by<00:00:37.230> his<00:00:37.469> name<00:00:37.680> we

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
we do open in followed by his name we

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.549 
we do open in followed by his name we
can<00:00:38.309> see<00:00:38.520> he's<00:00:39.030> got<00:00:39.300> all<00:00:39.420> these<00:00:39.600> diamonds<00:00:40.379> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
using x-ray or another hack so we could

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.720 
using x-ray or another hack so we could
ban<00:00:49.079> him<00:00:49.289> or<00:00:49.500> kick<00:00:49.710> him<00:00:49.739> or<00:00:50.010> something<00:00:50.399> after

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
look in its inventory wherever we are

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.190 
look in its inventory wherever we are
which<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.619> really<00:01:16.830> awesome<00:01:17.030> because<00:01:18.200> you

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
which is really awesome because you

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.780 
which is really awesome because you
could<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.530> mining<00:01:19.979> or<00:01:20.220> building<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> house<00:01:20.759> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
could be mining or building a house and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.490 
could be mining or building a house and
then<00:01:21.119> think<00:01:21.390> what's<00:01:21.630> Lincoln<00:01:21.960> Park<00:01:22.140> got<00:01:22.350> in

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
then think what's Lincoln Park got in

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.219 
then think what's Lincoln Park got in
his<00:01:22.799> inventory<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.210> same<00:01:24.479> bad<00:01:24.900> stuff

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
his inventory all the same bad stuff

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.310 
his inventory all the same bad stuff
again<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.770> that's<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.100> really<00:01:26.340> awesome<00:01:26.369> feature

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
again so that's a really awesome feature

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.789 
again so that's a really awesome feature
next<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.799> are<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:31.310> look<00:01:32.310> at<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.700> sign<00:01:32.939> so

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
next we are going to look at the sign so

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.060 
next we are going to look at the sign so
if<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.159> put<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> sign<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:35.909> square<00:01:36.150> brackets

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
if you put a sign with square brackets

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.880 
if you put a sign with square brackets
open<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> top<00:01:39.150> line<00:01:39.560> into<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.590> square

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
open in on the top line into the square

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.160 
open in on the top line into the square
bracket<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> second<00:01:41.759> line<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.210> player's

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
bracket and the second line the player's

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.249 
bracket and the second line the player's
name<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:44.399> potentially<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.479> could<00:01:45.810> build<00:01:46.079> a

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
name so potentially you could build a

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.649 
name so potentially you could build a
building<00:01:46.520> have<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> warp<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.119> only<00:01:48.240> admins

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
building have a warp that only admins

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.830 
building have a warp that only admins
could<00:01:48.960> go<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.700> set<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.180> list<00:01:51.659> of

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
could go to and set up a list of

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.020 
could go to and set up a list of
suspicious<00:01:52.320> players<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.310> give<00:01:53.729> them<00:01:53.880> each<00:01:53.970> of

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
suspicious players and give them each of

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.840 
suspicious players and give them each of
signs<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.750> they're<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.369> admins<00:01:56.369> could<00:01:56.579> check

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
signs so they're so admins could check

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.819 
signs so they're so admins could check
once<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> while<00:01:57.509> what<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.680> their

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
once in a while what they have in their

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.330 
once in a while what they have in their
inventory<00:01:59.630> but<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.409> want<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.860> sneak

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
inventory but if you want to sneak

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.850 
inventory but if you want to sneak
around<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.719> a

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
around and have a

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.730 
around and have a
