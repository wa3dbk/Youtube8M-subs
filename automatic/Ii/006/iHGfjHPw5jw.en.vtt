00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.630
 I do not think I can improve my disputes. 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:21.590
 At this time, 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.590
 I will begin to talk to you about stance stance. 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.750
 The server's fence 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.750
 Ah 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:40.379
 ps on the court 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.379
 Left Right 4 1st 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.450
 I do not know measures presented sideline sangdaeri 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.450
 It's spears . 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.940
 The right foot toward the right 4 poster 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:58.320
 Facing the early generations itguyo the general Spears Dance 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.549
 The following is a more extreme 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.240
 Use a lot of physical training to use 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:09.390
 In this case, 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.439
 Spears dancer Bauda a little more 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.950
 About half of the drugs are colored in small amounts 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.950
 Why horse 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.469
 Ah baseline and bang 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.939
 There is a cross like this 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.939
 It's not so proven that it's not 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.090
 Ah 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.520
 In the case of the flexibility of the body 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.679
 I like the flexibility of the body. 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.270
 The word that any body flexibility in the body can be rotated as opposed to non-rotating 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.460
 From the excellent people 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.900
 Walking from the capital 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.800
 Spencer No one ever in this French players use so much and 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.450
 I have. 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.880
 You can use any of your physical flexibility or body 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.630
 If that is not the case now 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.700
 Across Dresser It's best to wear extreme color stress 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.060
 Now , 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:13.250
 It is a good thing that you can get the amount of free exercise . Chorus 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:16.570
 Dance Now, if you like the coat of the head quota, 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.570
 If you naturally 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.180
 This young man long ago 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.780
 Done 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.030
 Ah 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:41.840
 Wide course escaping from cypress Now, in the Spanish summer, 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.760
 Too much casual dancing 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.850
 It's getting better. That stance of the deuce coat and the moon pea pit will wait. 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:55.330
 There's a difference. 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:59.980
 You can not send the ball to the course while the stance is in effect. 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:04.930
 Our lives are settled. I am a square stance or a cross stance son 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.690
 Then the stance that staged the middle stage with the three makers is yours 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:12.700
 What are the physical characteristics 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:17.920
 Flexibility and fixation with various elements of kita 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:22.840
 It is adjusted to the Course of hers that affect the toss toaster Su 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.070
 Because it is influenced , you turn your body into a course that you want to send 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.920
 Thing 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:33.240
 The players do not do that. 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.240
 Depending on your level, the fact that once you are a little bit awesome is fine, 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:41.459
 Conversely, according to the person named by the US priest lights a course you 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.170
 The stance is changing, but this time I will leave it as it is for two minutes. 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.400
 I will put it on this time . 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.319
 Then what notgetda centers give these things to show you the body posture 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.870
 You can not do this with you. 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:56.160
 So it is a stent selection and to change the buffer the source of change in Tosu 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.860
 It's not a big change. 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:04.560
 Your flags 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:06.780
 Depending on the direction of the summer are going to spin the racket in the transept these three kinds of courses 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.430
 Because it is decided 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.780
 Oh, you, Spencer, have a hard time. Depending on your body, 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.890
 Whether 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.890
 Arthur Chorus Dance 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:24.770
 There you have the body, so you can take full advantage of the normal 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:30.020
 Can not you all use your body in a spear dancer? 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:34.980
 Absolutely not going to Luther Square stance from normal Spencer 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:38.850
 When you catch the catcher 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.790
 Raising the return of sources have left the industry 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:47.790
 Once the body is facing the side, this makes me hyejin. 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:52.200
 Become a rotational sense, it is such a young missionary position ever now Forest Road 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.400
 The way we can use our body in degenerative conditions 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.100
 Everything else 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.700
 Because you are spinning your body down by narration 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:04.570
 Instead, you see people doing things that are less flexible 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:08.650
 Rather, return your body to the normal spear stand. 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:13.840
 Then the evidence of error cures can be rather rotated , 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:18.910
 I do not have the flexibility of the body and I do it in extreme color order 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:23.590
 It is rather that it is lower than the battle, 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:26.200
 Levels are based on whether I am now a beginner Vina intermediate or a third grade 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.920
 A little stance can change through 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:33.490
 You can create a course or spin that you have used in the East Sea 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:37.720
 That's why stance is so important. 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:42.070
 So in the common skier era 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:44.260
 Skiers Spence wo thing to be a little toad you so little physical contact Dancers 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.950
 To use more bodies 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:51.120
 A little coloring dancer to say 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:54.600
 Listen to the square spans in the capital for months , 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.170
 You can see a little more because you can 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.170
 That's right. 

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:03.120
 You can rotate your body and 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:06.930
 Hey chi so you guys 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:11.490
 It is important to decide what stance is 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:15.990
 Dancing or chorusing without skiing . Yoon-sik is always on your body. 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:20.430
 How did you get a sense of stamina on the server ? 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.599
 Do not be complicated, and you may change your posture 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.680
 There is 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:29.969
 And the important thing is to send the ball to your toss gang 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:33.900
 Data stinging because of the control and influence seemed to write 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:38.249
 In the situation where the shaft is not collapsed and the stance is fixed, 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.999
 When you look at the correct and you see that you are correct in direction 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:44.580
 Will 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:49.230
 So the most important one on the server is the speedy chemically opp 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:52.680
 When you talk backwards, do not get too attached to your speed, 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:56.880
 If you are going to study at a university, 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:07:01.410
 Depending on how we take the stance that first started in wet 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:05.940
 It affects your sub-divisions and direction. 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:09.960
 We will look to build hasigil the current stance born so always put paste 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.889
 I would like to note that through dns, I can live a healthy and happy life. 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.960
 I hope 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.960
 Please do not just do the next time Thank you
