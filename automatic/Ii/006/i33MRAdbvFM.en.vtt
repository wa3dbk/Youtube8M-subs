00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
right in this video I will explain how

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.789 
right in this video I will explain how
you<00:00:02.429> can<00:00:02.610> bring<00:00:03.030> them<00:00:03.319> AutoCAD<00:00:04.319> drawing<00:00:04.650> and

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
you can bring them AutoCAD drawing and

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.909 
you can bring them AutoCAD drawing and
show<00:00:04.950> in<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.160> 3d<00:00:05.460> view<00:00:05.839> so<00:00:06.839> here<00:00:07.140> you<00:00:07.379> can<00:00:07.589> see

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
show in the 3d view so here you can see

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.180 
show in the 3d view so here you can see
we<00:00:08.790> have<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.090> ground<00:00:09.360> floor<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.950> this<00:00:10.950> is

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
we have the ground floor and this is

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.030 
we have the ground floor and this is
AutoCAD<00:00:12.059> drawing<00:00:12.389> but<00:00:13.349> having<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.799> feature

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
AutoCAD drawing but having the feature

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.560 
AutoCAD drawing but having the feature
that<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.429> can<00:00:14.549> snap<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.910> each<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.330> every

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
that you can snap to each and every

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.650 
that you can snap to each and every
element<00:00:15.719> intersections<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:17.240> based<00:00:18.240> on<00:00:18.420> these

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
element intersections and based on these

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.689 
element intersections and based on these
feature<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:20.270> get<00:00:21.270> traced<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.960> model<00:00:22.350> over<00:00:22.560> here

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
feature I get traced the model over here

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.490 
feature I get traced the model over here
now<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:24.029> see<00:00:24.300> I'm<00:00:24.420> choosing<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.109> wall<00:00:25.289> and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
now I can see I'm choosing the wall and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.779 
now I can see I'm choosing the wall and
snap<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.189> wall<00:00:26.400> end<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:28.310> then<00:00:29.310> create<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
snap to the wall end and then create the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.240 
snap to the wall end and then create the
wall<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.560> with<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.710> trace<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.189> reference

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
wall and with this trace and reference

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:42.319 
wall and with this trace and reference
feature<00:00:39.230> we<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.410> easily<00:00:41.219> trace<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.120> place

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
feature we can easily trace and place

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.959 
feature we can easily trace and place
the<00:00:42.540> object<00:00:45.710> now<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:47.010> exactly<00:00:47.340> place<00:00:47.760> at

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
the object now I can exactly place at

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:58.050 
the object now I can exactly place at
the<00:00:48.090> door<00:00:48.239> location

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:06.600 

to<00:00:58.920> resize<00:00:59.920> it<00:00:59.980> exactly<00:01:04.770> so<00:01:05.770> this<00:01:05.920> is<00:01:06.100> now<00:01:06.340> when

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
to resize it exactly so this is now when

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.330 
to resize it exactly so this is now when
I<00:01:06.640> go<00:01:07.120> to<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.330> 3d<00:01:07.660> view<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.860> can<00:01:09.040> see<00:01:09.190> the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
I go to the 3d view you can see the

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.010 
I go to the 3d view you can see the
elements<00:01:09.730> which<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:09.970> optical<00:01:10.390> elements<00:01:10.750> in<00:01:10.870> 3d

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
elements which is optical elements in 3d

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.020 
elements which is optical elements in 3d
but<00:01:11.320> you<00:01:11.500> may<00:01:11.950> not<00:01:12.070> be<00:01:12.250> able<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.520> see<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.910> outer

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
but you may not be able to see the outer

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.480 
but you may not be able to see the outer
CAD<00:01:13.270> drawing<00:01:13.800> but<00:01:14.800> if<00:01:14.890> you<00:01:14.980> want<00:01:15.190> to<00:01:15.280> see<00:01:15.400> the

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
CAD drawing but if you want to see the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.250

whole<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.700> controlling<00:01:16.120> in<00:01:16.300> 3d<00:01:16.690> and<00:01:16.810> compare

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
whole to controlling in 3d and compare

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:25.140 
whole to controlling in 3d and compare
with<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.430> actual<00:01:18.520> model<00:01:19.980> then<00:01:23.820> we'll<00:01:24.820> go<00:01:25.090> to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
with the actual model then we'll go to

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.670 
with the actual model then we'll go to
file<00:01:25.600> final<00:01:26.590> special<00:01:27.010> merge<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.750> then<00:01:29.530> we'll

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
file final special merge and then we'll

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.420 
file final special merge and then we'll
choose<00:01:29.830> define<00:01:30.280> which<00:01:30.520> we<00:01:30.700> want<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:31.000> bring<00:01:31.240> in

I'm just picking the point and these are

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.999 
I'm just picking the point and these are
the<00:01:56.710> layers<00:01:56.890> I<00:01:57.130> want<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.430> merge<00:01:58.470> now<00:01:59.470> the

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
the layers I want to merge now the

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.600 
the layers I want to merge now the
drawing<00:02:00.340> has<00:02:00.460> come<00:02:01.950> now<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.009> one<00:02:03.310> which<00:02:03.460> you

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
drawing has come now the one which you

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.029 
drawing has come now the one which you
see<00:02:03.820> in<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.149> blue<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:05.350> your<00:02:05.590> reference

see in the blue is your reference
drawing

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.460 

and<00:02:11.740> this<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:14.410> one<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.710> 3d<00:02:15.100> object<00:02:16.200> if<00:02:17.200> I

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
and this this one is a 3d object if I

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.060 
and this this one is a 3d object if I
check<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.800> 3d<00:02:18.130> view<00:02:18.370> here<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.420> can<00:02:19.600> see<00:02:20.070> the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
check the 3d view here you can see the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.930 
check the 3d view here you can see the
AutoCAD<00:02:21.490> for

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.280 

so<00:02:27.940> same<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.360> can<00:02:28.570> bring<00:02:28.780> in<00:02:28.930> all<00:02:29.080> the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
so same you can bring in all the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.950 
so same you can bring in all the
drawings<00:02:29.590> for<00:02:29.740> coordination<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.810> if<00:02:31.810> you

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
drawings for coordination and if you

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.670 
drawings for coordination and if you
don't<00:02:32.170> want<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.440> see<00:02:32.620> in<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.890> floor<00:02:33.130> plan<00:02:33.160> you

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
don't want to see in the floor plan you

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.010 
don't want to see in the floor plan you
can<00:02:35.680> put<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.040> in<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.250> layer<00:02:36.510> which<00:02:37.510> is<00:02:37.540> different

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
can put it in a layer which is different

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.630 
can put it in a layer which is different
than<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.200> normal<00:02:38.320> layers<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.190> you<00:02:39.280> can<00:02:39.310> hide

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
than the normal layers and you can hide

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.460 
than the normal layers and you can hide
it

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.440 

so<00:02:47.470> now<00:02:47.650> check<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.160> treaty<00:02:48.460> go<00:02:48.610> it's<00:02:48.910> Heder

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
so now check the treaty go it's Heder
