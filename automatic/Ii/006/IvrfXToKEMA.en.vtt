00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 and before returning to the river as 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.810
 know more about the species that is 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.880
 commanding the program today and has a 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.679
 very peculiar behavior 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.320
 in an interview with a fishing guide 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.370
 Chilean search discovers curiosity is 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.940
 on salmon 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.940
 we will see 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.820
 originating from the ice cream the oceans 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.430
 north atlantic and south pacific 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.070
 Salmon live in both fresh water and 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.470
 saltwater its high economic value 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.899
 led the Chilean government in partnership with 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.000
 Japanese government to introduce this 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.430
 species in some of its rivers around 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.649
 1981 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.280
 the expectation was to capture 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.469
 34 years later what has not happened 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.059
 leading countries to abandon their 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.699
 commercial plans 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.949
 only this story has continued 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.289
 about ten years later salmon 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.770
 began to be seen in two large 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.350
 pedro the equine chile transit rivers 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.250
 and of course this fact ended up 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.479
 catch the attention of fishermen 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.670
 monica ivan finotti 3 on the river pedro is 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.670
 a lot of concert tickets on Thursday 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.670
 targeting the salmon life cycle is 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.060
 very interesting it is born in the river where 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.090
 remains from 2 to 3 years until reaching 500 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.490
 grams and then he leaves for the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.770
 search for food by living their 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.750
 adulthood when it reaches 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.210
 approximately 10 pounds 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.030
 It's time to return to the river at this time. 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.810
 most of them are ready to 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.479
 reproduce and fulfill their migration against 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.870
 the current the salmon travels more than a thousand 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.890
 and 500 kilometers to reach the heads 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.160
 usually it seeks a place where 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:00.000
 It was born to procreate, it 's as if it were done. 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:04.210
 a trip back to the past when you 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.800
 miss when the goose assumption 18 pounds 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.590
 90 kg 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:14.200
 Actually, this salmon is from the second round. 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.990
 who surely entered the age of 13 to 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:22.150
 a painful one that only decides to take 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.620
 following a good bath with five 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.900
 kilometers and person 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.050
 the migratory period occurs in two 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.970
 moments with the arrival of spring 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.850
 September, October and summer 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.800
 January until you complete your 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.800
 circle fish does not feed 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.630
 but it is precisely at this stage that the 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.380
 fishery is productive 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:51.510
 the botafogo reported that three weeks ago 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:56.110
 the use of the hand in the body to God 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:59.739
 just rolled plax to wash them because 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.380
 because only at Coritiba won and he 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.850
 because the guild has long dance on 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.010
 territory 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.590
 so you think he expects 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.470
 official school because it really 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.160
 there is an irritation to sit both 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.940
 trash and is also invading the case 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.940
 or another player
