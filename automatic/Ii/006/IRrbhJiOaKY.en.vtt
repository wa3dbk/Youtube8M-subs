00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
the look without making it too too

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.240 
the look without making it too too
dramatic<00:03:42.169> because<00:03:42.319> we're<00:03:42.590> going<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.859> blend<00:03:43.069> it

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
dramatic because we're going to blend it

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.620 
dramatic because we're going to blend it
out<00:03:43.340> in<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.579> second<00:03:43.970> with<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.180> blending<00:03:44.569> brush

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
out in a second with a blending brush

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.870 
out in a second with a blending brush
but<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.440> really<00:03:45.859> really<00:03:45.980> like<00:03:46.250> doing<00:03:46.459> this<00:03:46.700> I

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
but I really really like doing this I

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.670 
but I really really like doing this I
feel<00:03:47.090> like<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.299> just<00:03:47.329> adds<00:03:47.630> something<00:03:47.900> extra

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
feel like it just adds something extra

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.099 
feel like it just adds something extra
to<00:03:48.829> the<00:03:48.859> look<00:03:49.150> also<00:03:50.150> these<00:03:50.299> shades<00:03:50.540> are<00:03:50.720> super

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
to the look also these shades are super

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.659 
to the look also these shades are super
pigmented<00:03:51.470> so<00:03:51.829> you<00:03:51.889> don't<00:03:52.130> need<00:03:52.250> a<00:03:52.280> ton<00:03:52.609> of

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
pigmented so you don't need a ton of

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.729 
pigmented so you don't need a ton of
product<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.239> get<00:03:53.389> a<00:03:53.419> really<00:03:53.810> dramatic<00:03:53.959> look<00:03:54.530> I

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
product to get a really dramatic look I

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.949 
product to get a really dramatic look I
think<00:03:55.010> that<00:03:55.250> liquorice<00:03:55.849> or<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.540> dark<00:03:56.750> brown

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
think that liquorice or the dark brown

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.629 
think that liquorice or the dark brown
shade<00:03:57.230> would<00:03:57.380> work<00:03:57.590> perfectly<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.340> create<00:03:58.370> a

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
shade would work perfectly to create a

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.789 
shade would work perfectly to create a
smokey<00:03:59.150> eye<00:03:59.180> because<00:03:59.690> you<00:03:59.720> just<00:04:00.049> need<00:04:00.290> the

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
smokey eye because you just need the

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.319 
smokey eye because you just need the
smallest<00:04:01.160> amount<00:04:01.579> for<00:04:01.849> your<00:04:01.970> entire<00:04:02.269> eye

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
smallest amount for your entire eye

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.059 
smallest amount for your entire eye
after<00:04:02.810> I'm<00:04:03.169> done<00:04:03.290> blending<00:04:03.560> them<00:04:03.799> out<00:04:03.919> I'm

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
after I'm done blending them out I'm

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.740

but I love this I feel like it makes my
lashes<00:05:10.600> super<00:05:11.380> voluminous<00:05:11.860> so<00:05:12.160> I<00:05:12.190> might<00:05:12.400> have

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
lashes super voluminous so I might have

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.129 
lashes super voluminous so I might have
to<00:05:12.729> go<00:05:12.880> and<00:05:13.090> repurchase<00:05:13.450> it<00:05:13.720> when<00:05:13.870> I'm<00:05:13.990> done

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
to go and repurchase it when I'm done

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.900 
to go and repurchase it when I'm done
with<00:05:14.290> this<00:05:14.440> sample<00:05:14.919> and<00:05:15.160> then<00:05:15.550> I'm<00:05:15.639> just<00:05:15.729> going

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
with this sample and then I'm just going

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.300 
with this sample and then I'm just going
to<00:05:16.000> finish<00:05:16.180> off<00:05:16.479> by<00:05:16.720> using<00:05:16.960> coconut<00:05:17.800> cream<00:05:18.070> and

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
to finish off by using coconut cream and

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.310 
to finish off by using coconut cream and
butter<00:05:18.610> pecan<00:05:19.030> both<00:05:19.479> as<00:05:19.720> a<00:05:19.780> highlight

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
butter pecan both as a highlight

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.170 
butter pecan both as a highlight
underneath<00:05:20.919> the<00:05:21.190> brow<00:05:21.340> bone<00:05:21.580> and<00:05:21.880> in<00:05:22.150> the

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
underneath the brow bone and in the

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.820 
underneath the brow bone and in the
inner<00:05:22.330> corner<00:05:22.900> I<00:05:23.020> feel<00:05:23.200> like<00:05:23.320> mixing<00:05:23.680> them

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
inner corner I feel like mixing them

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.860 
inner corner I feel like mixing them
together<00:05:23.979> just<00:05:24.250> creates<00:05:24.789> the<00:05:25.030> perfect<00:05:25.570> mix

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
together just creates the perfect mix

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.140 
together just creates the perfect mix
because<00:05:26.200> one<00:05:26.470> is<00:05:26.590> warm<00:05:26.860> tone<00:05:27.130> one<00:05:27.669> school<00:05:27.970> tone

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
because one is warm tone one school tone

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.600 
because one is warm tone one school tone
one's<00:05:28.479> matte<00:05:28.750> and<00:05:28.960> one<00:05:29.139> shimmery<00:05:29.590> so<00:05:29.949> when<00:05:30.520> you

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
one's matte and one shimmery so when you

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.980 
one's matte and one shimmery so when you
mix<00:05:30.789> them<00:05:30.970> together<00:05:31.150> you<00:05:31.449> kind<00:05:31.690> of<00:05:31.750> get<00:05:31.900> the

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
mix them together you kind of get the

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.420 
mix them together you kind of get the
best<00:05:32.199> of<00:05:32.350> both<00:05:32.470> worlds<00:05:32.530> I'm<00:05:33.039> going<00:05:33.280> to<00:05:33.340> be

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
best of both worlds I'm going to be

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.090 
best of both worlds I'm going to be
using<00:05:33.789> my<00:05:34.000> city<00:05:34.360> color<00:05:34.660> cosmetics<00:05:35.020> V<00:05:35.830> matte

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
using my city color cosmetics V matte

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.490 
using my city color cosmetics V matte
bronzer<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:36.789> just<00:05:37.300> using<00:05:37.570> this<00:05:37.720> to<00:05:37.930> contour

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
bronzer and just using this to contour

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.320 
bronzer and just using this to contour
since<00:05:38.860> it<00:05:38.979> is<00:05:39.190> like<00:05:39.460> a<00:05:39.490> cool<00:05:39.820> toned<00:05:40.060> Brown

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
since it is like a cool toned Brown

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.390 
since it is like a cool toned Brown
rather<00:05:40.660> than<00:05:40.900> a<00:05:40.930> bronzy<00:05:41.410> color<00:05:41.710> I<00:05:41.860> feel<00:05:42.280> like

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
rather than a bronzy color I feel like

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.920 
rather than a bronzy color I feel like
this<00:05:42.550> works<00:05:42.760> really<00:05:42.940> well<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.330> contour<00:05:43.780> and

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
this works really well to contour and

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.080 
this works really well to contour and
it's<00:05:44.080> super<00:05:44.710> inexpensive<00:05:44.919> so<00:05:45.580> I<00:05:45.610> definitely

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
it's super inexpensive so I definitely

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.460 
it's super inexpensive so I definitely
recommend<00:05:46.330> checking<00:05:46.630> it<00:05:46.870> out<00:05:46.990> because<00:05:47.229> it

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
recommend checking it out because it

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.740 
recommend checking it out because it
just<00:05:47.620> blends<00:05:47.919> out<00:05:48.130> so<00:05:48.400> nicely<00:05:48.880> then<00:05:49.539> I'm<00:05:49.630> just

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
just blends out so nicely then I'm just

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.560 
just blends out so nicely then I'm just
going<00:05:49.990> to<00:05:50.050> go<00:05:50.200> in<00:05:50.410> with<00:05:50.919> my<00:05:51.310> Becca<00:05:51.789> blush<00:05:52.300> in

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
going to go in with my Becca blush in

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.690 
going to go in with my Becca blush in

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
the color wild honey this is a really
