it was it's a really good game it's a

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.010 
it was it's a really good game it's a
good<00:01:37.920> hack<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.369> slash<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.909> know<00:01:39.020> killed

good hack and slash you know killed
skeletons<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.130> creatures<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:41.909> um<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:43.110> very

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
skeletons and creatures but um it's very

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.620

and um I think he'll like it too but of

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.930 
and um I think he'll like it too but of
course<00:04:02.739> it's<00:04:02.920> rated<00:04:03.220> M<00:04:03.459> for<00:04:04.019> Mature<00:04:05.019> so
