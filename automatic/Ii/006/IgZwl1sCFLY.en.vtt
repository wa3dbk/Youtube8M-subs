 RAZOROLOGY (the eternal struggle between evil and the worst) 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:51.000
 Relaxed male tied under her White skin - few pretensions 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:01.400
 Untied woman sitting on him Senseless - meaningless 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:10.900
 I can have everything I have. Thief imprisoned in a vault 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:21.000
 Dazzle the lights of the spot with the razor with seven blades of the spot 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.900
 Scene of a crime that seems true but is image 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Impeccable image care 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.000
 I felt better when I had a razor much worse than someone who raises me in heaven and on earth 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 in his image 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 eternal praise to the ever-cutting fierce sentient lamina 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.900
 I won't shave anymore If you don't stay here with me 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.700
 praise you infinitely the scene of the crime mind 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.700
 if I don't get rid of you, you won't do anything for me 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.800
 I wanted to tell you that I think I'll be late 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.400
 I'm tied to the bed like the guy in the spot 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.300
 We are alive but likely to look for a place in a parking lot 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:24.900
 unfavorable competitors in the eternal struggle ... between evil and the worst 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:44.500
 between evil and the worst 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:04.500

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.500
 I felt better when I had a razor much worse than me 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.000
 he rises in heaven and on earth in his image 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.000
 eternal praise to the ever-cutting fierce sentient lamina 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.800
 I won't shave anymore If you don't stay here with me 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.900
 praise you infinitely the scene of the crime mind 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.900

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.200

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.500
 unfavorable competitors in the eternal struggle ... between evil and the worst 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:27.200
