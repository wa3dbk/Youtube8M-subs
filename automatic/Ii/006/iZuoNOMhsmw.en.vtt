hate to blame it on that but and still
not<00:01:20.749> too<00:01:20.899> bad<00:01:21.789> there's<00:01:22.789> the<00:01:23.030> back<00:01:23.329> lat<00:01:23.659> spread

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
not too bad there's the back lat spread

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.459 
not too bad there's the back lat spread
a<00:01:24.289> little<00:01:25.039> bit<00:01:25.189> wider<00:01:25.460> this<00:01:25.729> year<00:01:26.090> a<00:01:26.469> little
