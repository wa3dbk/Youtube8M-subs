00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:02.689 
in M 4 to get the cost take the total

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.170 
in M 4 to get the cost take the total
number<00:04:03.139> of<00:04:03.170> choices<00:04:03.530> made<00:04:03.980> in<00:04:04.159> each<00:04:04.549> match<00:04:04.849> and

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
number of choices made in each match and

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.309 
number of choices made in each match and
multiply<00:04:06.049> them<00:04:06.260> out<00:04:06.409> that's<00:04:07.400> 2<00:04:07.849> times<00:04:08.180> 1<00:04:08.599> times

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
multiply them out that's 2 times 1 times

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.819 
multiply them out that's 2 times 1 times
3<00:04:09.829> times<00:04:10.430> 2<00:04:10.670> which<00:04:11.540> equals<00:04:11.780> 12

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
3 times 2 which equals 12

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.120 
3 times 2 which equals 12
so<00:04:13.489> there<00:04:13.700> are<00:04:13.730> 12<00:04:14.030> combinations<00:04:14.989> at<00:04:15.200> 6<00:04:15.829> R<00:04:15.950> and

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
so there are 12 combinations at 6 R and

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.509 
so there are 12 combinations at 6 R and
each<00:04:16.509> 12<00:04:17.509> times<00:04:17.810> 6<00:04:18.109> is<00:04:18.320> 72

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
each 12 times 6 is 72

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.650 
each 12 times 6 is 72
so<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.060> bed<00:04:20.269> cost<00:04:20.690> 72<00:04:21.470> R<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:21.910> do<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.090> same<00:04:23.330> to

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
so the bed cost 72 R and do the same to

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.749 
so the bed cost 72 R and do the same to
calculate<00:04:24.139> the<00:04:24.349> cost<00:04:24.590> of<00:04:24.860> a<00:04:25.039> soccer<00:04:25.340> 6

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 
calculate the cost of a soccer 6

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.290 
calculate the cost of a soccer 6
permutation<00:04:26.509> entry<00:04:27.550> calculate<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.759> cost<00:04:29.060> of

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
permutation entry calculate the cost of

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.020 
permutation entry calculate the cost of
a<00:04:29.509> soccer<00:04:29.840> 10<00:04:30.259> permutation<00:04:31.130> in<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.550> same<00:04:31.789> way

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
a soccer 10 permutation in the same way

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.290 
a soccer 10 permutation in the same way
but<00:04:32.630> remember<00:04:33.169> that<00:04:33.349> each<00:04:33.800> combination<00:04:34.400> costs

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
but remember that each combination costs

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.499 
but remember that each combination costs
only<00:04:35.449> 2<00:04:35.960> rat<00:04:36.229> so<00:04:37.190> say<00:04:37.400> you<00:04:37.460> have<00:04:37.759> 24

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
only 2 rat so say you have 24

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.499 
only 2 rat so say you have 24
combinations<00:04:38.840> in<00:04:39.440> a<00:04:39.650> soccer<00:04:39.949> 10<00:04:40.280> bet<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:41.180> cost

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
combinations in a soccer 10 bet the cost

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.600 
combinations in a soccer 10 bet the cost
is<00:04:41.750> 24<00:04:42.680> times<00:04:43.130> 2<00:04:43.490> which<00:04:44.000> is<00:04:44.180> 48<00:04:44.660> R<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.610> the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
is 24 times 2 which is 48 R and the

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.820 
is 24 times 2 which is 48 R and the
