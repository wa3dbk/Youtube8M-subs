00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:11.960
 exercise and 8 unisinos rio grande do 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.370
 south 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.520
 observe the following right triangle 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.939
 designed in which the media of the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.750
 are four x squared plus four 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.619
 the value of x is and we have that there 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.120
 rectangle triangle and we have 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.940
 the measurement of the two catheters and the angle 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.430
 which is a 45 degree angle 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.280
 of possession of these data, we will have 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.379
 which compute basically to the tangent 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.289
 of this triangle né 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.120
 ie the measure of the cost Catetão 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.230
 divided by the chapter measure 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.539
 by applying the rule of the tangent 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.280
 in the right triangle we will have 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.719
 that up to 45 degrees is equal to 4 x on x 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.940
 squared plus four 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.119
 a follow-up we have to to r 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.220
 45 degrees if you are to analyze the table 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:15.720
 trigonometric triangle of rectangle né 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.090
 is a famous angle that equals one né 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.080
 is a man you always have to have 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.770
 in mind 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.700
 and then we will roll this value from 1 to 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.380
 4 x 1 on x squared plus four 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.049
 applying the product of the medium by the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.280
 extremes we will have to x to 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.799
 square plus four times one is the same 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.270
 thing I did in the square plus four 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:47.270
 this is going to be equal to 4 x times one is 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.350
 the same as 4x good to pass that 4 did 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.210
 for the first member 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.299
 we will have nothing less than 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.189
 the second degree equation then 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.259
 repeat I made four more squares 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.420
 and this picture said that it was positive 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.649
 passing it to the first member he 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.479
 will be negative 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.560
 so here in the first member it goes 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.849
 stay as - 4x and finally the same people 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.530
 to zero 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.720
 well I'll just reverse the order 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.670
 so you can see better right and 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.520
 nothing else did than change the order is 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.400
 I did not change the signal and nothing else 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.350
 change the order and therein of ownership 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.370
 second degree equation 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.380
 we will apply the good shell formula to 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.989
 people have to when the delta recalculation 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.770
 huh 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.300
 you will find the value of 0 and as value 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.850
 of delta is equal to zero 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.120
 in fact this equation has two 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.350
 roots only they are identical good of 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.600
 possession that making the necessary 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.540
 substitutions in the Basque formula 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.459
 we will have that x is equal to 4 more 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.400
 or less root of zero 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.590
 in case here would be the root of god / 2 a 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.580
 as a is equal to a disk with only 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.370
 two 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.040
 we're going to have to root this zero 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.230
 it will not influence our account 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.040
 so we can just say 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.010
 that x will be equal to 4 over two days 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.250
 so it will equal 2 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.420
 the correct answer will be equal to 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.100
 letter B 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.100
 the value of x is equal to 2
