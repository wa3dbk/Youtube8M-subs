it is a Kawasaki 440 bike that he's got
there<00:00:07.230> from<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.589> believe<00:00:07.620> it's<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.099> 1980<00:00:08.910> or<00:00:09.120> 1981

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
there from I believe it's a 1980 or 1981

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.540

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
we've been working on the sucker for a

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.310 
we've been working on the sucker for a
little<00:00:11.730> while<00:00:11.940> we've<00:00:12.599> been<00:00:12.630> doing<00:00:12.900> some<00:00:13.049> frame

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
little while we've been doing some frame

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.369 
little while we've been doing some frame
modifications<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.880> decided<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.900> once<00:00:16.230> I

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
modifications and I decided that once I

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.800 
modifications and I decided that once I
clipped<00:00:17.100> off<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.430> rear<00:00:17.609> end<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.480> was<00:00:18.600> going

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
clipped off the rear end that was going

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.050 
clipped off the rear end that was going
to<00:00:18.869> do<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> hardtail<00:00:19.439> conversion<00:00:20.100> but<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.730> wasn't

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
to do a hardtail conversion but I wasn't

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.790 
to do a hardtail conversion but I wasn't
quite<00:00:21.180> sure<00:00:21.240> how<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.689> want<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.050> do<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.289> yet<00:00:22.500> so

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
quite sure how I want to do it yet so

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.820 
quite sure how I want to do it yet so
after<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> little<00:00:23.460> bit<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.760> deliberating<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
after a little bit of deliberating and

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.960 
after a little bit of deliberating and
estimating<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> cost<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> materials<00:00:26.849> to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
estimating the cost for the materials to

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.070

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
do it the amount of time it was going to

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.130

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.570 
upper one here is the longer one because
that<00:02:23.480> won't<00:02:23.600> be<00:02:23.989> out<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.140> angle<00:02:24.560> going<00:02:25.160> upwards

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
that won't be out of angle going upwards

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.430 
that won't be out of angle going upwards
um<00:02:25.819> I<00:02:26.090> don't<00:02:26.630> know<00:02:26.780> what<00:02:26.900> kind<00:02:27.080> of<00:02:27.110> angle<00:02:27.350> we're

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
um I don't know what kind of angle we're

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.110 
um I don't know what kind of angle we're
going<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.620> look<00:02:27.709> at<00:02:27.890> yet<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.340> guess<00:02:28.819> we'll<00:02:29.000> see

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
going to look at yet I guess we'll see

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.729 
going to look at yet I guess we'll see
when<00:02:29.209> we<00:02:29.270> get<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.600> on<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.810> bike<00:02:29.989> that<00:02:30.230> there

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
when we get that on the bike that there

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.509 
when we get that on the bike that there
should<00:02:30.920> be<00:02:31.069> some<00:02:31.940> more<00:02:32.060> stuff<00:02:32.360> in<00:02:32.540> here<00:02:33.519> cross

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
should be some more stuff in here cross

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.600 
should be some more stuff in here cross
members<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.239> axle<00:02:36.050> plates<00:02:36.320> should<00:02:36.560> be<00:02:36.769> now<00:02:37.459> we

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
members and axle plates should be now we

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.220 
members and axle plates should be now we
got<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.760> catalog<00:02:39.160> TC<00:02:40.160> browse<00:02:40.430> shoppers<00:02:41.230> now

what<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:23.269> do<00:03:23.360> is<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.540> drill<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.780> hole<00:03:23.989> in<00:03:24.140> the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
what you do is you drill a hole in the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.080 
what you do is you drill a hole in the
frame<00:03:24.410> where<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:24.739> want<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.160> least<00:03:25.549> amount<00:03:25.820> to

and you push the slug in either way and
then<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.430> run<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.579> weld<00:03:28.820> around<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.329> that's

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
then you run a weld around it that's

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.120 
then you run a weld around it that's
what<00:03:30.079> holds<00:03:30.230> everything<00:03:30.500> together<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:30.950> keeps
