00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 99 and welcome here in about 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.610
 channel with a new video of one and 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.040
 a figure probably say the same 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.179
 It should be and this time I have one 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.260
 new figure from the series the dfb football 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.740
 stars and that is probably it would have 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.689
 actually be marco reus 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.529
 I hope that it is not who should 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.380
 it would be otherwise 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.599
 that's all there was of course 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.189
 this sticker full on it 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.280
 I will pack again with inside 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.930
 simply collectors together the purposes so 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.360
 then you know the whole mile white 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.010
 help leaflet the warnings 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.600
 and the most important of the leaflets 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.570
 in the beginning once the overview the dfb 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.340
 football stars then there are the fans in the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.180
 ixs once the rattle and once the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.250
 ball and here the team yes and im 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.590
 principle that here I have this 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.180
 figurine the smp gft 374 p would have 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.439
 being mappus I would not know who else 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.320
 unfortunately there is nowhere on it eleven players 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.970
 a team from the current strong point 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.280
 stands up to watertight defend 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.680
 every player on the lawn is his man 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.310
 and for great goals are the dfb football 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.229
 stars always good so much so so marco 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.180
 So it comes the player has this 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.580
 figurine comes in three parts therefore once there 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.820
 it's racing like that here 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.350
 I would say that's racing why 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.729
 Here is a small error mechanism 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.770
 I do not know 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.860
 then of course there is the figure itself 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.270
 they are also so thin holders and it 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.909
 are then virtually only stickers 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.759
 in the back and in the front one then on this 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.770
 figurine can or should put it on 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.020
 and I always think that the characters 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.329
 all the same except for the stickers 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.579
 So it is not quite the case this time 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.020
 lot of effort given and yes if it does not 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.280
 I like to write this on everyone 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.320
 times in the comments 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.610
 so that I have the text at least to this 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.490
 video can still change so the whole 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.730
 you put it on here and then he can 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.290
 stink on the lawn 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.530
 I will do it all again 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:16.570
 so you can zoom in on the stickers 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.570
 look a bit better again 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.640
 from the back she so unfortunately without 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.270
 names and no heading number 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.800
 At least I think they have then 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.270
 after the final day can do and 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.130
 The character really would have a name 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.130
 can actually give breuss is actually 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.630
 marco reus and also the jerseys me 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.180
 do not you think that with the at the 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.640
 wm play so I do not think so 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.520
 The series was so successful 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.590
 So far , there is still the ball of the 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.130
 It looks just like donald's ball 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.110
 at mickey mouse and friends oh well 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.420
 that was it from me to this video now 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.610
