 Spanish in which tourism 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.940
 Ornithological has developed more 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.610
 due mainly to the extensive and 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.780
 varied natural heritage that treasures and

 to its excellent state of preservation 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.480
 in Extremadura southwest of the

 environments that enable the

 avifauna we talk about the natural park of the 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.610
 international court that is also 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.470
 declared as zepa zone of special

 protection for birds and how to cech 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.119
 Special conservation area 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.700
 in its 25 thousand hectares we can 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.610
 locate Mediterranean forests lagoons 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.850
 rocky areas and the own steppe 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.850
 River 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.729
 such a confluence of habitats in a single 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.110
 park constitutes the ideal scenario 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.110
 for bird lover 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.060

 mallard or the cormorant in the cuttings 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.170
 would be one of the ornithological gems of 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.170
 europe the black stork 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.020
 raptors like the Egyptian vulture or the eagle 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.370
 Bonelli have their breeding territories 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.370
 on the steep slopes 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.310
 although you can walk the section of the

 river to enjoy the sighting of 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.420
 the planners the breeding areas are 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.630
 bounded during the time of 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.760
 however breeding these birds are 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.180
 very divisible in other enclaves of the 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.180
 Park 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.770
 next to different storks birds 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.550
 they also go to the ponds in search of 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.500
 food and shelter cattle egrets 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.750
 lapwings common snipes and others 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.050
 waders frequent these means 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.050
 aquatic 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.159
 very close to these oases extend 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:05.750
 great natural plains that are the 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.750
 home of many steppe birds 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.019
 if they are is and bustards are the most 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.260
 spectacular and delight 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.260
 fans 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.580

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.580
 wintering have their ideal habitat 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.600
 the traditional livestock that grazes in 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.580
 these places also provides the 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.250
 main source of food for 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.210
 abundant carrion birds like the 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.810
 griffon vulture or the black vulture all a 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.810
 show 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.720
 but certainly the big Slayers 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.090
 three predatory raptors larger than 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.610
 the peninsula are the ones that attract the most 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.550
 Attention 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.430
 the golden eagle roars with gallantry 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.569
 the Mediterranean mountain and the meadows 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.569
 Knowing her power 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.940
 the Bonelli's eagle perhaps the most beautiful and 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.220
 elusive of all has in the park of the 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.569
 international court an important 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.539
 population 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:01.599
 but the one that attracts the greatest expectation is 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:04.089
 the imperial eagle a bird in danger of 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:07.529
 extinction of which several couples live 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:07.529
 in this protected space 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.180
 all right 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.640
 with the help of professional guides and 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.610
 infrastructure of the park 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.160
 most demanding amateur can enjoy the 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.190
 extraordinary ornithological heritage 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.250
 of international tango 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:48.040
 so this place is a land where 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.610
 neither birds nor visitors understand 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.610
 borders 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.180
