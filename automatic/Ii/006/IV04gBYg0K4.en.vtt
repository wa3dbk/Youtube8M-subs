00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.959
 hello very good to all people I bring you 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.100
 a video plus a video in which good at 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:10.620
 a video that I had made 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.750
 previously a user had me 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.360
 commented that he did not even know 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.119
 normal shuffle is to shuffle by 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.189
 drag and then I have decided to upload 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.500
 this video by those people who 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.630
 they are starting from the beginning which 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.880
 is and explained things too fast 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.130
 in some video or anything I would 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.070
 you say okay I did not realize I do not know what 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.110
 better I take for granted many things that are not 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.270
 I should take them for granted then 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.329
 you do not say there is no problem 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.719
 I upload some video I answer and in 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.969
 that same comment and that's it 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.699
 then the mix by drag how do you 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.160
 perform well let's take the mallet in 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.380
 this position 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.840
 well I take it like that I do not know maybe not 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.570
 finger position is fine but I 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.449
 I have learned like this from small vale 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:04.070
 then the index will be here the thumb 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.950
 here and three or two fingers as you want 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.960
 three or two fingers here in this position 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.540
 so many people think that what 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.869
 you have to do is drop letters that is 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.860
 and so we do not what I will be 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.340
 take 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.380
 and with this thumb putting your hand like this 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.400
 so that the cards do not fall so 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.660
 you do is go thumb dragging 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.660
 well little by little 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.890
 in such a way that when we start 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.620
 master this movement and start 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.610
 do it faster and faster and more 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.010
 Quick 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.590
 what you're going to get is that you're going to 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.960
 power to be able to shuffle in ar in drag 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.270
 and you are going to be able to put this letter where 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.170
 you want to say you are going to be able to 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.490
 put down you will get to be able to follow 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.050
 keeping everything you want down and 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.700
 put it up without the public 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.850
 I noticed nothing 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.220
 then he just came to explain to sixth 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.260
 of this child 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.110
 in the next video I'll explain 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.360
 what's going to happen this year how many 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.630
