this was the time to get that sort of

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.889 
this was the time to get that sort of
program<00:02:07.710> maybe<00:02:08.399> not<00:02:08.640> make<00:02:09.000> them<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.420> program

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
program maybe not make them but program

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.440 
program maybe not make them but program
next<00:02:10.410> level<00:02:10.830> win

up<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.250> think<00:02:19.489> everybody<00:02:20.060> knew<00:02:20.180> we<00:02:20.390> were

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.070 
up I think everybody knew we were
playing<00:02:20.599> better<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:23.030> we<00:02:23.660> had<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.810> great

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
playing better and we had a great

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.410 
playing better and we had a great
opportunity<00:02:24.280> against<00:02:25.280> South<00:02:25.489> Carolina<00:02:26.030> and

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
opportunity against South Carolina and

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.010 
opportunity against South Carolina and
we<00:02:27.410> knew<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.650> was<00:02:27.680> not<00:02:27.920> going<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.190> be<00:02:28.280> easy<00:02:29.020> but

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
we knew it was not going to be easy but

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.140 
we knew it was not going to be easy but
but<00:02:30.319> it<00:02:30.440> does<00:02:30.620> mean<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.890> lot<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.610> important

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.510 
but it does mean a lot it is important
like<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.450> said<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.690> would<00:02:32.840> never<00:02:33.140> say<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.920> must-win

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520
