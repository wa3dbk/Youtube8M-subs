question it's very important for us we

00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:01.580 
question it's very important for us we
will<00:04:52.590> treat<00:04:52.800> you<00:04:52.920> again<00:04:53.160> as<00:04:53.310> we<00:04:53.460> are<00:05:00.440> how<00:05:01.440> was

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
will treat you again as we are how was

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.470 
will treat you again as we are how was
that<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:01.920> think<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.400> first<00:05:02.550> reactor<00:05:02.940> maybe<00:05:03.330> the

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
that I think the first reactor maybe the

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.010 
that I think the first reactor maybe the
second<00:05:03.840> one

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.910 

the<00:05:10.020> camp<00:05:10.350> is<00:05:11.960> something<00:05:12.960> so<00:05:13.350> different<00:05:13.650> and

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
the camp is something so different and

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.860 
the camp is something so different and
so<00:05:13.980> amazing<00:05:14.640> from<00:05:14.880> that<00:05:15.060> from<00:05:15.360> that<00:05:15.390> first<00:05:15.690> one

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
so amazing from that from that first one

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.060 
so amazing from that from that first one
obviously<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.290> first<00:05:16.470> one<00:05:16.590> was<00:05:16.710> really

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
obviously the first one was really

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.380 
obviously the first one was really
incredible<00:05:17.460> for<00:05:17.640> me<00:05:17.700> too<00:05:17.880> because<00:05:18.000> it<00:05:18.180> was<00:05:18.210> at

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
incredible for me too because it was at

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.170 
incredible for me too because it was at
the<00:05:18.450> beginning<00:05:18.600> of<00:05:18.840> my<00:05:18.990> career<00:05:19.050> but<00:05:19.970> to<00:05:20.970> see
