on the kind of team you play like for
example<00:01:10.880> I'd<00:01:11.880> said<00:01:12.210> Curtis<00:01:12.570> Kelly<00:01:12.840> he<00:01:13.020> only

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
example I'd said Curtis Kelly he only

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.080 
example I'd said Curtis Kelly he only
had<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.530> defensive<00:01:14.010> rebound<00:01:14.400> well<00:01:14.820> he<00:01:14.970> had

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
had one defensive rebound well he had

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.969 
had one defensive rebound well he had
six<00:01:15.330> blocks<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.930> mean<00:01:16.259> she<00:01:16.320> was<00:01:16.470> protecting<00:01:16.799> you

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
six blocks I mean she was protecting you

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.219 
six blocks I mean she was protecting you
and<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.369> played<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> team<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.210> shot<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> lot<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
and we played a team that shot a lot of

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.109 
and we played a team that shot a lot of
deep<00:01:19.409> three<00:01:19.770> sir<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> lot<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.400> longer<00:01:20.700> rebound

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
deep three sir a lot of longer rebound

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.789 
deep three sir a lot of longer rebound
so<00:01:21.270> his<00:01:21.450> defensive<00:01:21.960> rebound<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> wasn't

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
so his defensive rebound and wasn't

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.969 
so his defensive rebound and wasn't
going<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.070> what<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.369> expected<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.150> be

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
going to be what we expected it to be

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.660 
going to be what we expected it to be
but<00:01:25.979> then<00:01:26.189> dominate<00:01:26.670> turns<00:01:26.970> around

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
but then dominate turns around

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.899 
but then dominate turns around
he<00:01:28.659> comes<00:01:28.840> over<00:01:28.960> five<00:01:29.290> defensive<00:01:29.830> so<00:01:30.369> that's

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
he comes over five defensive so that's

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.219 
he comes over five defensive so that's
kind<00:01:31.150> of<00:01:31.210> some<00:01:31.450> of<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.600> things<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:31.840> did<00:01:32.140> I
