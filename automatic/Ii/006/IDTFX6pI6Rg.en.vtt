00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.070
 review of this makeup base that 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.320
 I mentioned them in my favorite life and 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.930
 some of you asked me to 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.110
 make the review of this product in 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.720
 special because they were looking for a 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.720
 new makeup base or wanted to know 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.310
 exactly what were their 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.920
 characteristics good because it's going to be a 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.340
 Quick review the product the truth 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.980
 I quite like I bought it in beautiful 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.079
 when I went to Cancun in December without 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.000
 But she had left him for some 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.590
 side because I had my base of 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.199
 makeup at that time I was 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.750
 using that was the cover of three in 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.839
 one when it was over I started to see 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.460
 what makeup did I wear and with the time 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.070
 of heat the truth is that sometimes it's a 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.750
 little complicated finding a base of 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.420
 makeup that you do not feel that you 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.510
 melts in the face or that you make a 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.700
 unbearable pasta with the passage of 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.450
 time all day at work 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.810
 at the school where you are 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.570
 and I was testing one or two of the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.000
 the foundation of makeup that I had and 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.760
 I found this one 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.600
 I decided to try it and the truth is that I 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:34.050
 loved it I decided to try it because I said that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.420
 It was a light make-up base 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.220
 done is called naked wireless perfect 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.770
 cover fundation is a base 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.830
 super light makeup but that you 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.140
 perfectly covers the skin 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:51.229
 the imperfections that can reach 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.570
 have have contained 35 grams and 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.780
 remains in good condition 12 months from 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.580
 you open it when I bought it in 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.550
 beautiful that is the only place where 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.890
 they sell this brand here in mexico 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.259
 I was in a purchase promotion 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.780
 take the other with 40% discount 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.180
 I do not remember how much it cost me to be 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.060
 honest but on the facebook page 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.040
 of um cosmetics are the last time 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.810
 I saw her announced that she has a little time 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:25.320
 they were at 79 pesos and what he promises is 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.660
 a perfect coverage without the feeling 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.360
 of heaviness in the face and the truth 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.390
 it does pretty well what it promises is 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.330
 a fairly accessible product 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.520
 to the portfolio of all of us the truth 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.480
 So it has enough product 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.740
 practically has the same as the 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.890
 rest of the makeup bases and 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.100
 even a little bit more and it's a 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.720
 product that can be expanded 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.350
 perfectly fine either with your fingers 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.360
 with a skewer or with a sponge and I 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.070
 the best way I've found to be able 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.460
 expand the product or to be able 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.610
 blur it over the face 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.800
 with the sponge of real techniques or 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.710
 with any other that I have in 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.330
 use at that time however if there 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.540
 to have a little bit of care because 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.000
 if you do not put it if you do not blur the 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.530
 product that may end up being like 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.900
 the 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.940
 Well droplets of the product that you do not 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.790
 Smile and get dry and stay dry 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.890
 pretty fixed on the face then yes 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.110
 you have to try to blur it 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.270
 perfectly well is a product that 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.550
 I can recommend you enough without 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.400
 However, it also has some cons 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.680
 for example only when I went to the 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.730
 beautiful store only had 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.530
 four tones and I bought this ene efe 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.410
 beige medium 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.170
 the truth is super well to my tone of 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.470
 skin looks pretty good on me 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.530
 I know if because it's so light you can go 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.660
 coupling to different skin tones 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.720
 but good for me the fact that I have 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.550
 only four tones to choose from 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.860
 Sometimes it can be a bit complicated 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.560
 for girls who have very skin 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.770
 clarita or a little bit dark because no 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:17.180
 can do more perfect with those four 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:19.459
 tones another thing that I always is that 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.019
 whenever they publish new things from the 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.330
 products of cosmetics and that 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.970
 I always ask them is when to have 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.790
 shipment to the interior of the republic to 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.190
 through mail because the fact that 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.870
 is sold only in beautiful makes 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.080
 sometimes it can be a bit complicated 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.700
 for the girls who do not live in one in 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.550
 a city where there is some 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.380
 branch of this beautiful store that 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.610
 it's a small problem because they do not have 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.849
 sale through shipping or mail 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.830
 nor for its website or its website 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.860
 facebook however if you are one of 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.800
 the lucky ones that has a branch 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.870
 of beautiful in your city I promise you that 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.030
 if you try this makeup base you're going 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.129
 to like a lot especially for this 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.650
 time of year when you really do not 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:09.319
 you want to feel the makeup plasta 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.599
 in the face is very very good very 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:14.689
 light and only you with them 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.969
 little bit of it can be compact powder or 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:20.060
 of loose powders I use either the 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:22.250
 Efe loose powder or you can use the 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.620
 compact powder mix or visu 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.020
 either of them serve me well 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.259
 well to be able to seal this base of 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.469
 makeup and the truth I have no greater 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:36.590
 complaint throughout the day lasts me and I 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:39.500
 holds up well over time 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.360
 during all the working day I hope 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.909
 girls who have liked this little girl 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.800
 review if you liked it or if it was useful you 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:48.259
 I ask you to give me some fingers up 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.000
 that you share with me on your social networks and 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.000
 See you for the next bye bye
