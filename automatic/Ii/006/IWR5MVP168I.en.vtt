00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.320
 moto x is definitely a good device 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.219
 He is so good that when choosing 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.980
 android smartphone i would first 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.779
 I looked at him and advise you 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.029
 do the same but it does not mean 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.090
 that the device is perfect like any other 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.730
 moto x is not without flaws and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.800
 just one today will be discussed with you 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.929
 Dmitry Lutsenko and the project feron com and 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.180
 Today I named five reasons for which 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.670
 you should not buy this smartphone 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.520
 the first reason to abandon the flagship 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.620
 motorola is priced at 700 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.960
 US dollars with such price tags 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.850
 the device cannot be called accessible seeing 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.309
 but only slightly cheaper products 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.680
 Apple companies and much more expensive than many 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.800
 competitors in the face of the same samsung or 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.500
 lg even sony xperia z3 arrived in 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.039
 sale more recently this one is cheaper moto 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.020
 x 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.210
 the only competitor who plays with 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.660
 our hero in one price segment 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.969
 this 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.400
 ash di si van price tag which by the way 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.590
 also borders on adequacy as we see 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.330
 for the money that is asked for x in 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.210
 Ukraine, you can buy absolutely any 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.130
 flagship smartphone from the brand, and, moreover, 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.619
 last unlike motorola 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.049
 sold here officially but about this we 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.330
 talk a little later a second reason 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.790
 think about buying another device 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.250
 is autonomy I do not argue to land 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.350
 our hero in half a day will not 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.140
 all but put it daily on 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.000
 Charging I'm afraid I will have many moto x from 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.340
 full battery lives about 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.229
 one and a half days which are reduced to 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.390
 working day with increased load 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.670
 such an indicator most people 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.920
 seems quite acceptable but against the background 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.079
 competitors who live for two days without 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.240
 recharge daily feeding from 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.939
 sockets do not look too bright 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.520
 Perspectives Kai reason number three frames in 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.170
 moto x is set to 13 megapixel 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.299
 sensor which unfortunately is not 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.060
 justifies the expectations placed on him 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.070
 when shooting landscapes or architecture 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.950
 Everything looks good but more complex 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.170
 genres camera loves portal shield when 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.149
 subject shooting for example automatics 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.300
 often focuses on the foundation while 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.460
 understandably 1 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.890
 new subject like slips 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.080
 happen and when shooting portraits in 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.120
 conditions of poor lighting photo module 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.820
 works well, but worse 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.100
 competitors are not saved by the way and flash 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.290
 which though has a ring reflector 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.540
 highlights objects in the frame is far from 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.730
 as much as I would like to cause 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.070
 number four is a memory with each 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.230
 in the afternoon, our storage needs 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.450
 grow relentlessly thanks to music 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.120
 photos and awesomely beautiful but 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.460
 bulky and grams if yesterday 32 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.040
 gigabytes of memory seemed immense then 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.230
 Today, this storage volume is much and in 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.870
 Particular seems to me a certain minimum 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.800
 which should be enough 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.510
 average user with 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.700
 the concept of the average 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.780
 implies that there are people who 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.730
 enough less 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.370
 but there are those who need more 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.440
 the number of the latter is constantly growing in 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.210
 As an example, I can cite 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.040
 my very own self 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.140
 music collection has long been 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.020
 exceeded 30 megabytes and not 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.870
 stops growing and only one music and 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.600
 there are still pictures of movies, games, and so on 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.680
 moto x is available in three versions on 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.370
 16 32 and 64 gigabytes but considering that 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.660
 the last in the states is 600 dollars 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.030
 expediency and and shopping from us under 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.459
 the question is because it will absolutely cost 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.890
 inadequate money expand storage 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.080
 there is no possibility and it puts an end to 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.180
 buying this device for everyone 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.670
 fans to breed on the smartphone file 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.100
 the trash can feel it especially 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.500
 who like us lives in Ukraine or 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.630
 another country thriving edge where 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.600
 the clouds can't fix the situation 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.130
 mean unstable network and low speed 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.590
 mobile internet 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.080
 motorola is one of the company standing 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.000
 the origins of mobile communications if it were not for her 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.980
 most likely the mobile phone is still 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 then would be the lot of defense 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.620
 industry 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.959
 despite the fact that the first years 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.269
 becoming market Americans all over the place 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.860
 sold their devices and even had 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.080
 representation in Ukraine 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.810
 later for unknown reasons the company 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.269
 lost its former hold and became relevant 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.430
 Only in the US domestic market now 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.430
 when her products became popular 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.410
 all over the world 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.600
 legs which Ukrainians are faced with 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.000
 lack of official service 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.770
 motorola unfortunately loses this parameter 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.410
 almost to all their competitors 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.509
 freely sold in Ukraine and in view of 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.550
 its low prevalence and 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:36.800
 limited supply situation 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.620
 aggravated by the lack of accessory and 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.479
 what is the most important completing case 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.509
 if you still intend to buy 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.000
 moto x edited by ferumm.com strongly 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:49.400
 recommends not to take this smartphone from your hands 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.780
 and buy it in the store which case 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.180
 breakdowns will be able to take on 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.430
 device maintenance after all 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.099
 situations of another adequate way out 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.289
 Essentially and no, you have learned 5 reasons why 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.210
 don't buy moto x 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.820
