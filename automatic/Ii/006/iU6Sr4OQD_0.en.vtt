00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.010
 god the people of youtube like salts but 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.959
 what good good I bring you a new video 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.750
 it's about a how-to tutorial 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:18.860
 playsstation on your cellphone leave 100% 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.170
 in the 7th minute and I have an android 2.3 and 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.619
 local to wonder my ram memory is 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.660
 Also my very small internal memory 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.279
 156 megabytes but I almost have them 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.519
 used and I pulled it as seen in the 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:35.030
 good screen I'll leave the links 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:37.610
 of description the emulator is called sxc 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.680
 there's another one that I think is something like that 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.090
 it's called the download but it does not work 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.930
 so I'm going to try so with this 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.840
 I get 100 good we put this to the 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.199
 first link since we downloaded the 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.500
 file will seem like a state of 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.660
 call emulator a whole yep that we do not go 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.030
 to be able to open like this with a single click 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.399
 we have to have another file you can 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.640
 download from Android Market that 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.710
 call b1 free file that is like a 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.290
 winrar type to open all this kind of 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.780
 records 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.030
 good ok ok since we have asia de 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.030
 store that file we're going to open it and 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.580
 we are going to extract since it is extracted 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.790
 to say the irish installer and aisha 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.980
 lips since we have that we get the 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.800
 installer and we installed the program already 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.680
 installed we get into the program was going 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.350
 to appear several things in the third 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.350
 says preferences we put it in there 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.500
 we give in this run of the albos and 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.140
 says what we put into preferences in the 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.300
 third run lips or preferences 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.040
 of videos something like that says what we put there 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.110
 since it's the bios it's going to be so that 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.460
 start the game once we have the 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.450
 bios we will select it from 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.070
 our cell phone we do not occupy 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.900
 root or anything like that because 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.000
 let's have all this let's go to the 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.700
 download of the games there is a page 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.990
 which is called free ground ocu rooms there 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.570
 let's download playstation games 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.250
 but this one since we have them 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.200
 downloaded we are going to have to extract them 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.729
 so it's going to be a bit difficult 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.380
 but with the computer you could 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.040
 generate 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.400
 fast to have games we are going to put you 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.430
 in rooms since we are cold 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.590
 let's look for playstation the games already 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.990
 that we find the games we are going to have 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.970
 one we download it we hope that it 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.730
 download as we do not have downloaded 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.260
 we put you in open file since it is 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.820
 open will not appear here always 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.250
 two files 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.020
 depending on what kind of game it is already 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.800
 that we have the files when we 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.510
 animate extract what is good point already 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.570
 that a dayz point is the case that I find 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.660
 the game serves no good that 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.120
