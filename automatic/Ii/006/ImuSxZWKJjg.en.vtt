00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.450
 good companions welcome to the plus 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.020
 Ultra adventure I'm Jim Bowie and today I 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.240
 I bring the revision of the titanium ruiz 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.460
 court as you know ruiz is the most 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.599
 wine tactic that we first go to 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.800
 add the total dimensions of 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.800
 knife with case 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.640
 about 31 centimeters 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.640
 let's get it out 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.570
 and you can see the case 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.469
 OK 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.570
 and the knife 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.500
 first let's see the cover as you can 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.900
 see the tour quite thick nylon with a 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.300
 soul drija this makes the knife not 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.680
 relax as being within the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.020
 system is very basic has a brooch and 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.810
 sevilla for the belt very simple this 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.280
 It is part of its charm and reason that 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.280
 be its economic price 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.970
 we go to the knife here you can see it 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.590
 let's take the dimensions of 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.590
 Now the knife is founded 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.780
 about 29 centimeters in total length 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.670
 about 15 sheet 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.420
 and say or something less about 14 and a half 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.420
 approximately 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:51.659
 as you can see here it has rompecocos and 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.899
 boring that drilling for the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.899
 coordinator 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.720
 the handle is quite comfortable its shape 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.310
 Many will remember it to the system 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.490
 rancid 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.060
 once here you have handguards here 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.290
 and zipper 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.360
 entering the sheet as you can see 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.640
 in the back works has 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.360
 Mountain range 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.220
 and although at least it tells us 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.920
 exactly the type of steel that is yes 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.340
 he tells us it's stainless steel 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.120
 first to see your good things before 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.120
 see your defects 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.900
 First 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.220
 and its low price that has to be said is 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.819
 quite economic 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.030
 after 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.099
 and other things that they have is the fact that 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.489
 have handguards both above and 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.079
 below what allows us to be like 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.510
 a spear in consistency situations of 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:57.379
 a very comfortable way 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.659
 handle this type of saw even though 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:03.170
 many knives that have no saw 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.879
 they have this kind of saw this this 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.470
 cell type that I think is 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.720
 the best option to put in a 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.879
 knife on the back is worth 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.319
 now let's see the bad things of 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.290
 Chinese state 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:20.180
 Well, the first and the only thing that 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:23.400
 Highlights is how you can see around here 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:28.210
 the mango be a little 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.020
 otherwise quite a knife and she 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.640
 it stands out is 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:38.120
 the black inking of the sheet that gives 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.280
 a tactical aspect and a lot with that to 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.890
 Although far I do not like I will 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.940
 I consider quite attractive especially 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.250
 with the fact that once it has been used 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.200
 a lot in the center starts to 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.990
 wear but in some marks to my 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.690
 look pretty pretty 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:04:00.340
 well this has been all the review 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:03.840
 of the titanic river atp for all of us 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.840
 using our next
