your putting this week they'll read a

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.870 
your putting this week they'll read a
question<00:00:15.450> from<00:00:15.629> Chris<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.350> Chris<00:00:17.250> wants<00:00:17.700> to

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
question from Chris and Chris wants to

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.210 
question from Chris and Chris wants to
know<00:00:18.030> Frank<00:00:18.420> how<00:00:18.660> did<00:00:18.870> it<00:00:18.960> cause<00:00:19.260> put<00:00:20.040> that

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
know Frank how did it cause put that

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.300 
know Frank how did it cause put that
spin<00:00:20.610> on<00:00:20.790> the<00:00:20.940> ball<00:00:21.090> we<00:00:21.300> see<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:21.750> how<00:00:21.900> do<00:00:21.960> they

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
spin on the ball we see so how do they

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:30.200 
spin on the ball we see so how do they
drop<00:00:23.310> hop<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.810> stop<00:00:27.230> Chris<00:00:28.790> it's<00:00:29.790> a<00:00:29.910> matter<00:00:30.120> of

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
drop hop and stop Chris it's a matter of

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.119 
drop hop and stop Chris it's a matter of
technique<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:31.080> then<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.350> technique<00:00:31.860> they

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
technique and then the technique they

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.550 
technique and then the technique they
use<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:33.000> make<00:00:33.240> sure<00:00:33.270> they<00:00:33.780> have<00:00:33.960> more<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.350> an

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
use is to make sure they have more of an

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.860 
use is to make sure they have more of an
oblique<00:00:34.800> impact<00:00:35.520> than<00:00:36.090> we've<00:00:36.270> normally<00:00:36.660> put

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
oblique impact than we've normally put

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.890 
oblique impact than we've normally put
on<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:37.110> ball<00:00:37.910> now<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:38.970> have<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.420> understand

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
on the ball now you have to understand

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.600 
on the ball now you have to understand
that<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> oblique<00:00:40.590> nosov<00:00:40.980> impact<00:00:41.340> will<00:00:41.490> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
that the oblique nosov impact will the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.000 
that the oblique nosov impact will the
loft<00:00:41.880> of<00:00:42.060> the<00:00:42.120> club<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.540> gonna<00:00:42.690> do<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.410> gonna<00:00:43.650> be

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
loft of the club is gonna do is gonna be

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.970 
loft of the club is gonna do is gonna be
what<00:00:44.220> generates<00:00:44.670> spin<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.620> have<00:00:46.739> no

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
what generates spin so if you have no

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.460 
what generates spin so if you have no
life<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.400> get<00:00:47.550> no<00:00:47.730> spin<00:00:48.120> as<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.960> increase<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
life you get no spin as you increase the

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.770 
life you get no spin as you increase the
loft<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.980> get<00:00:50.220> more<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.550> more<00:00:50.640> spin<00:00:51.150> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
loft you get more and more spin the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.110 
loft you get more and more spin the
board<00:00:52.020> has<00:00:52.290> to<00:00:52.470> stick<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.040> club<00:00:53.310> a<00:00:53.610> little

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
board has to stick to the club a little

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.700 
board has to stick to the club a little
bit<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:54.660> what<00:00:54.810> happens<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.170> slide<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
bit and that's what happens to slide the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.069 
bit and that's what happens to slide the
sticks<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.130> their<00:00:56.370> spins<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.970> it's<00:00:57.540> our<00:00:57.780> job

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
sticks and their spins and it's our job

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.410 
sticks and their spins and it's our job
to<00:00:58.470> make<00:00:59.040> sure<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.399> get<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> maximum<00:00:59.880> of

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
to make sure we get the maximum of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150 
to make sure we get the maximum of
bleakness<00:01:00.720> of<00:01:01.110> impact<00:01:01.470> you<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> maximum

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
bleakness of impact you get the maximum

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.670 
bleakness of impact you get the maximum
spin<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.390> either<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:03.870> come<00:01:04.259> through<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
spin so either you can come through the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.649 
spin so either you can come through the
shot<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.189> or<00:01:05.579> you<00:01:05.759> can<00:01:05.939> come<00:01:06.179> down<00:01:06.210> on

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
shot like that or you can come down on

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.690 
shot like that or you can come down on
it<00:01:06.810> now<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.259> pros<00:01:07.590> come<00:01:07.889> down<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.520> when

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
it now the pros come down on it when

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.190 
it now the pros come down on it when
they<00:01:08.819> really<00:01:09.149> want<00:01:09.359> to<00:01:09.450> get<00:01:09.569> a<00:01:09.600> lot<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.840> spin

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
they really want to get a lot of spin

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.419 
they really want to get a lot of spin
because<00:01:10.499> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.639> oblique<00:01:11.909> misses<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.509> greater

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
because of the oblique misses is greater

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:15.649 
because of the oblique misses is greater
but<00:01:14.429> unfortunately<00:01:15.119> that's<00:01:15.389> sort<00:01:15.630> of

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
but unfortunately that's sort of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.940 
but unfortunately that's sort of
technique<00:01:16.139> is<00:01:16.319> something<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
technique is something we have to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.879 
technique is something we have to
practice<00:01:17.609> because<00:01:18.179> most<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.869> us<00:01:19.020> don't<00:01:19.560> hit

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:19.889 
practice because most of us don't hit

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:22.370 
practice because most of us don't hit
the<00:01:20.100> ball<00:01:20.249> before<00:01:21.209> we<00:01:21.329> hit<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> ground<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.200> so

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the ball before we hit the ground and so

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.190 
the ball before we hit the ground and so
so<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.579> come<00:01:23.789> up<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.209> so<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.869> need<00:01:25.079> to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
so we we come up in it so we need to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.069 
so we we come up in it so we need to
improve<00:01:25.770> our<00:01:26.219> technique<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.329> let<00:01:27.990> me

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
improve our technique and and let me

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.349 
improve our technique and and let me
assure<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:29.249> there's<00:01:29.520> no<00:01:29.700> magic<00:01:30.179> to

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
assure you that it's there's no magic to

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.050 
assure you that it's there's no magic to
it<00:01:30.389> it's<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.779> speed<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.380> impact<00:01:31.859> the<00:01:32.459> bulk<00:01:32.759> of

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
it it's a speed of impact the bulk of

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.199 
it it's a speed of impact the bulk of
our<00:01:33.329> material<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.399> and<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.549> oblique<00:01:35.819> dis<00:01:36.060> of

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:36.209 
our material and and the oblique dis of

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:37.910 
our material and and the oblique dis of
impact<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.779> that<00:01:36.990> will<00:01:37.200> give<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.499> the<00:01:37.649> spin

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
impact and that will give you the spin

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.519 
impact and that will give you the spin
and<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.969> takes<00:01:39.149> a<00:01:39.270> lot<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> confidence<00:01:39.810> as<00:01:40.350> well

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:40.529 
and it takes a lot of confidence as well

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:42.559 
and it takes a lot of confidence as well
doesn't<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.159> oh<00:01:41.399> yes<00:01:41.819> you've<00:01:42.179> got<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.450> have

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
doesn't it oh yes you've got to have

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.449 
doesn't it oh yes you've got to have
confidence<00:01:42.749> in<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.380> shot<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.799> cannot<00:01:44.189> sort

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
confidence in your shot you cannot sort
