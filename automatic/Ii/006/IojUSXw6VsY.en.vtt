a normal pump will operator the speed of

a normal pump will operator the speed of

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
28 30 rpm and draws approximately 1200

28 30 rpm and draws approximately 1200
watts<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.230> power<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.670> reduce<00:00:51.030> that

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
watts of power if we to reduce that

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.420 
watts of power if we to reduce that
speed<00:00:51.510> down<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.899> half<00:00:52.140> such<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.040> case<00:00:53.250> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
speed down to half such as the case of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.270 
speed down to half such as the case of
the<00:00:53.519> ePub<00:00:54.019> we<00:00:55.019> could<00:00:55.260> draw<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.769> as<00:00:55.949> little<00:00:56.129> as

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the ePub we could draw in as little as

200<00:00:57.030> watts<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.329> power<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> power<00:00:59.100> saved<00:00:59.610> is

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
200 watts of power so the power saved is

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.600 
200 watts of power so the power saved is
