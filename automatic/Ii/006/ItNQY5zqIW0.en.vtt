00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
some reason both games I tried on were

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.339 
some reason both games I tried on were
lagging<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.550> not<00:00:29.550> just<00:00:29.760> some<00:00:30.000> kind<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.359> small

lagging and not just some kind of small

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.010 
lagging and not just some kind of small
lag<00:00:31.650> but<00:00:31.980> they<00:00:32.430> were<00:00:32.489> majorly<00:00:33.149> lagging<00:00:33.840> i

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
tried the batman the dark knight rises

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.479 
tried the batman the dark knight rises
and<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.840> try<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> need<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.500> speed<00:00:37.530> most<00:00:37.860> wanted<00:00:38.010> I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
and I try a need for speed most wanted I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.280 
and I try a need for speed most wanted I
was<00:00:39.030> told<00:00:39.239> by<00:00:39.360> many<00:00:39.510> people<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.079> should

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
was told by many people I should

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.639 
was told by many people I should
download<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.800> from<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.040> TegraZone<00:00:41.550> and

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
download it from the TegraZone and

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.560 
download it from the TegraZone and
because<00:00:43.649> for<00:00:44.460> some<00:00:44.640> reason<00:00:44.670> from<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> Play

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
because for some reason from the Play

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.330 
because for some reason from the Play
Store<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:46.079> doesn't<00:00:46.469> go<00:00:46.559> right<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.860> don't<00:00:47.070> know

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
Store it doesn't go right I don't know

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.250 
Store it doesn't go right I don't know
if<00:00:47.700> that's<00:00:48.300> true<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:48.750> not<00:00:48.989> because<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:50.489> you

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
if that's true or not because if you

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.860 
if that's true or not because if you
excuse<00:00:52.260> me<00:00:52.610> be<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.760> wherever<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.210> download<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
excuse me be it wherever you download it

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.350 
excuse me be it wherever you download it
from<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.410> should<00:00:55.770> probably<00:00:56.280> work<00:00:56.579> because

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
from it should probably work because

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.750 
from it should probably work because
they're<00:00:57.930> both<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.250> same<00:00:59.460> file

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
they're both going to be the same file

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.240 
they're both going to be the same file
but<00:01:00.480> yeah<00:01:00.629> some<00:01:00.870> people<00:01:00.899> told<00:01:01.410> me<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.739> Tegra

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
but yeah some people told me that Tegra

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
two games that I tried in the first

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.420 
two games that I tried in the first
video<00:05:22.569> we're<00:05:22.930> definitely<00:05:23.289> not<00:05:23.710> optimized

video we're definitely not optimized

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.580 
video we're definitely not optimized
these<00:05:25.000> two<00:05:25.180> games<00:05:25.419> are<00:05:25.629> more<00:05:25.750> optimized<00:05:26.319> and
