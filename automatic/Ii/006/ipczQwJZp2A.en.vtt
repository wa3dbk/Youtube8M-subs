that all players strive to feel it's

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.230 
that all players strive to feel it's
nirvana<00:01:10.990> for<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.380> tennis<00:01:11.680> player<00:01:11.950> but<00:01:12.430> there's

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
nirvana for a tennis player but there's

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.080 
nirvana for a tennis player but there's
something<00:01:13.690> about<00:01:13.870> that<00:01:13.930> player<00:01:14.440> that<00:01:15.190> wants

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
something about that player that wants
