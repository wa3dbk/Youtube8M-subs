00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
it would be like now that would be the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.119 
it would be like now that would be the
beginning<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.409> beats<00:03:23.650> you've<00:03:23.829> got<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.069> be

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
you're not comfortable doing this you

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.740
