00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
you've got to remember that your guitar

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.910 
you've got to remember that your guitar
leads<00:00:20.699> are<00:00:20.880> effectively<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.779> lifeline<00:00:22.710> that

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
leads are effectively the lifeline that

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.349 
leads are effectively the lifeline that
connect<00:00:23.220> what<00:00:23.550> you're<00:00:23.699> playing<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.210> what

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
connect what you're playing to what

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.910 
connect what you're playing to what
people<00:00:24.600> are<00:00:24.750> hearing<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:25.529> want<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.830> make

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
people are hearing so we want to make

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.830 
people are hearing so we want to make
sure<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.550> good<00:00:26.699> quality<00:00:26.760> cables<00:00:27.570> we

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
sure that we have good quality cables we

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.269 
sure that we have good quality cables we
want<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> make<00:00:28.199> sure<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.740> take<00:00:28.949> care<00:00:29.010> of

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
want to make sure that we take care of

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.490 
want to make sure that we take care of
them<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:30.179> obviously<00:00:30.420> want<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.050> spend<00:00:31.320> as

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
them and we obviously want to spend as

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.979 
them and we obviously want to spend as
little<00:00:31.740> amount<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.279> time<00:00:32.340> as<00:00:32.759> possible

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
little amount of time as possible

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.330 
little amount of time as possible
untangling<00:00:33.989> these<00:00:34.170> things<00:00:34.469> every<00:00:34.860> time<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.219> go

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
untangling these things every time we go

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.340 
untangling these things every time we go
to<00:00:35.370> use<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.059> one<00:00:36.210> really<00:00:36.450> popular<00:00:36.960> way<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.079> roll

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to use so one really popular way to roll

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.930 
to use so one really popular way to roll
up<00:00:37.469> our<00:00:37.649> guitar<00:00:38.010> cables<00:00:38.399> has<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.820> with

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
up our guitar cables has to do with

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.630 
up our guitar cables has to do with
holding<00:00:39.300> one<00:00:39.540> end<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:40.050> our<00:00:40.200> hand<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.710> creating

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
holding one end in our hand and creating

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.369 
holding one end in our hand and creating
little<00:00:41.910> loops<00:00:42.149> around<00:00:42.390> our<00:00:42.570> hand<00:00:42.809> as<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.170> go

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
little loops around our hand as we go

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.900 
little loops around our hand as we go
I'm<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:43.559> doing<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:43.950> really<00:00:44.250> small<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.670> to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
I'm just doing this really small just to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.850 
I'm just doing this really small just to
demonstrate<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:46.079> I'm<00:00:46.140> sort<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.379> adding<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> bit

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
demonstrate so I'm sort of adding a bit

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.729 
demonstrate so I'm sort of adding a bit
of<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> twist<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.879> go<00:00:48.120> which<00:00:48.660> effectively<00:00:49.590> is

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
of a twist as I go which effectively is

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.319 
of a twist as I go which effectively is
quite<00:00:49.980> counterproductive<00:00:50.309> as<00:00:50.850> you'll<00:00:51.030> see

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
quite counterproductive as you'll see

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.330 
quite counterproductive as you'll see
when<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.050> pull<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.260> apart<00:00:52.739> those<00:00:53.039> little

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
when I pull that apart those little

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490 
when I pull that apart those little
twists<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.910> become<00:00:54.270> knots<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.870> my<00:00:54.899> cable

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
twists have become knots in my cable

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.470 
twists have become knots in my cable
okay<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.489> technique<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.879> I'm<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.270> to

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
okay so the technique that I'm going to

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.660 
okay so the technique that I'm going to
show<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.690> today<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.440> similar<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.070> except

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
show you today is similar to that except

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.599 
show you today is similar to that except
on<00:01:00.000> every<00:01:00.719> second<00:01:01.230> loop<00:01:01.379> we're<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.160> roll

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
on every second loop we're going to roll

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.310 
on every second loop we're going to roll
the<00:01:02.730> cable<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> opposite<00:01:03.780> direction<00:01:04.110> so

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the cable in the opposite direction so

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.840 
the cable in the opposite direction so
we're<00:01:04.619> adding<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.920> bit<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.159> counterbalance

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
we're adding a bit of counterbalance

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.270 
we're adding a bit of counterbalance
into<00:01:06.180> our<00:01:06.299> cable<00:01:06.750> okay<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.040> see<00:01:08.070> I've

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
into our cable okay so you can see I've

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.130 
into our cable okay so you can see I've
still<00:01:08.460> got<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.670> nice<00:01:08.880> little<00:01:09.090> coil<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:09.689> but

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
still got this nice little coil here but

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.289 
still got this nice little coil here but
when<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> pull<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.950> apart<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.909> see<00:01:12.119> how

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
when I go to pull that apart you see how

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.780 
when I go to pull that apart you see how
nicely<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.110> easily<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.799> unravels<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.610> no

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
nicely and easily that unravels with no

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.630 
nicely and easily that unravels with no
knots<00:01:15.030> whatsoever<00:01:15.689> amazing<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> recap<00:01:17.220> for

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
knots whatsoever amazing so to recap for

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.219 
knots whatsoever amazing so to recap for
you<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.210> did<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.810> want<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> hold

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
you what I just did then we want to hold

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.810 
you what I just did then we want to hold
the<00:01:19.320> cable<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.770> one<00:01:19.979> hand<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> lead

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the cable in one hand with the lead

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.789 
the cable in one hand with the lead
facing<00:01:21.240> towards<00:01:21.630> us<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:22.229> want<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.470> take<00:01:22.650> our

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
facing towards us we want to take our

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.530 
facing towards us we want to take our
first<00:01:23.009> loop<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.549> twist<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.270> with<00:01:24.360> our<00:01:24.509> thumb

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
first loop and twist it with our thumb

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200 
first loop and twist it with our thumb
and<00:01:24.930> our<00:01:25.020> finger<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.729> motions<00:01:27.090> going

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
and our finger so the motions going

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.700 
and our finger so the motions going
outward<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.869> then<00:01:27.960> with<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> second<00:01:28.590> loop

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
outward and then with the second loop

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.170 
outward and then with the second loop
we'd<00:01:28.890> want<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> opposite<00:01:29.759> twist<00:01:30.060> it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
we'd want to do the opposite twist it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.539 
we'd want to do the opposite twist it
inward<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> cable<00:01:31.799> kind<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.340> loops

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
inward so that the cable kind of loops

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.789 
inward so that the cable kind of loops
onto<00:01:32.970> itself<00:01:33.329> okay<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.170> then<00:01:34.500> we<00:01:34.590> basically

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
onto itself okay and then we basically

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.830 
onto itself okay and then we basically
just<00:01:35.100> want<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> keep<00:01:35.610> repeating<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.210> roll

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
just want to keep repeating that roll

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.370 
just want to keep repeating that roll
out<00:01:38.119> like<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.479> then<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> opposite

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
out like so then do the opposite

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.639 
out like so then do the opposite
direction<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.310> keep<00:01:41.520> doing<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:42.649> until

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
direction and just keep doing that until

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.530 
direction and just keep doing that until
we<00:01:43.770> end<00:01:43.920> up<00:01:44.040> with<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> nice<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:45.000> core<00:01:45.329> like

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
we end up with a nice little core like

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.850 
we end up with a nice little core like
that<00:01:45.720> obviously<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.229> want<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.470> keep<00:01:46.649> that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
that obviously we want to keep that

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.399 
that obviously we want to keep that
compact<00:01:47.430> without<00:01:47.579> being<00:01:47.909> too<00:01:48.090> tight<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.600> then

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
compact without being too tight and then

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.749 
compact without being too tight and then
at<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.619> end<00:01:49.770> would<00:01:49.979> want<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.280> put<00:01:50.399> some<00:01:50.549> kind

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
at the end would want to put some kind

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.219 
at the end would want to put some kind
of<00:01:50.850> tie<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.210> velcro<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.930> keep<00:01:52.079> that

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
of tie or velcro on that to keep that

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.319 
of tie or velcro on that to keep that
from<00:01:52.470> unraveling<00:01:53.009> that's<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.030> try<00:01:54.299> that

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
from unraveling that's it so try that

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.060 
from unraveling that's it so try that
one<00:01:54.570> out<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:54.810> yourself<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.380> your<00:01:55.500> cables<00:01:55.860> are

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
one out for yourself if your cables are

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.010 
one out for yourself if your cables are
used<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.430> being<00:01:56.579> rolled<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.939> certain<00:01:57.299> way<00:01:57.540> then

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
used to being rolled a certain way then

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.600 
used to being rolled a certain way then
they<00:01:58.170> might<00:01:58.380> take<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.829> little<00:01:58.950> bit<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.280> time<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
they might take a little bit of time to

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.310 
they might take a little bit of time to
behave<00:01:59.939> properly<00:01:59.969> but<00:02:00.479> persist<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
behave properly but persist with it and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.260 
behave properly but persist with it and
see<00:02:01.920> how<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.130> go<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.520> doesn't<00:02:02.790> mean<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
see how you go it doesn't mean that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.370 
see how you go it doesn't mean that
you're<00:02:03.390> never<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.750> get<00:02:03.869> tangles<00:02:04.290> in

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you're never going to get tangles in

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.420 
you're never going to get tangles in
your<00:02:04.469> guitar<00:02:04.770> cables<00:02:05.159> again

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
your guitar cables again

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.530 
your guitar cables again
but<00:02:05.580> it's<00:02:05.700> certainly<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.000> better<00:02:06.150> place<00:02:06.390> to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
but it's certainly a better place to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.359 
but it's certainly a better place to
