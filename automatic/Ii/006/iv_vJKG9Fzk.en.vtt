00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.360 
can't let it stop there I have to really
show<00:04:28.020> everybody<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:28.710> did<00:04:28.950> not<00:04:29.160> make<00:04:29.340> a

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
show everybody that did not make a

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.850 
show everybody that did not make a
mistake<00:04:29.460> in<00:04:30.060> doing<00:04:30.600> this<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:31.500> is<00:04:31.560> putting

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
mistake in doing this this is putting

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.320 
mistake in doing this this is putting
the<00:04:31.950> card<00:04:32.100> a<00:04:32.160> little<00:04:32.250> bit<00:04:32.460> ahead<00:04:32.910> of<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.180> horse

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
the card a little bit ahead of the horse

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.510 
the card a little bit ahead of the horse
but<00:04:33.540> I<00:04:33.600> think<00:04:34.200> it's<00:04:34.290> a<00:04:34.350> no-brainer<00:04:34.500> that<00:04:35.010> with

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
but I think it's a no-brainer that with

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.550 
but I think it's a no-brainer that with
the<00:04:35.640> ESPN<00:04:36.000> honors<00:04:36.450> that<00:04:36.630> maybe<00:04:37.169> we<00:04:37.320> could<00:04:37.440> see

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
the ESPN honors that maybe we could see
