because it allowed me to be free you
know<00:03:36.190> grace<00:03:36.460> has<00:03:36.670> been<00:03:36.850> living<00:03:37.030> in<00:03:37.210> a<00:03:37.300> little

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
know grace has been living in a little

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.770 
know grace has been living in a little
box<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.490> the<00:03:39.490> fact<00:03:39.730> that<00:03:39.820> Robert<00:03:40.240> leaves<00:03:40.420> her

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
box and the fact that Robert leaves her

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.230 
box and the fact that Robert leaves her
now<00:03:41.440> she<00:03:41.560> breaks<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.100> box<00:03:42.400> open<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:42.940> she<00:03:43.090> can

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
now she breaks the box open and she can

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.360 
now she breaks the box open and she can
become<00:03:43.600> who<00:03:44.260> she<00:03:44.440> was<00:03:44.560> always<00:03:44.890> meant<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.190> be

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
become who she was always meant to be

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.710 
become who she was always meant to be
and<00:03:45.550> I<00:03:45.610> think<00:03:45.640> this<00:03:45.970> is<00:03:46.090> something<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.420> many

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
and I think this is something that many

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.240 
and I think this is something that many
women<00:03:47.040> older<00:03:48.040> women<00:03:48.070> can<00:03:48.490> identify<00:03:48.700> with
