00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.890
 so it's going to be the select gets so 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.379
 it's not it's not having the ipad da 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.120
 as I had in the union if you do not 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.780
 do not know how we do that and see 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.120
 would come to 9.2 so what about this tutorial 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.110
 you need this class as soon as I get you 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.979
 also leave the town hall with so here 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.500
 these bands rpd w 57 with his readers of 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:54.260
 shot not forget it's true 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.500
 and that's it and does it work with 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.290
 other weapons or not frankly I 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.820
 not tried I think and especially should not 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.640
 to put weighty hand because otherwise it did not 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.280
 not too hurt so much love yeah actually the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.610
 but that's it changes weapons rather 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.380
 quickly in fact and actually to make 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.420
 this tutorial finally this brawl is young 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.220
 we must begin to be fine 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.720
 select another shot times if we 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.140
 can call it like that 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.750
 and yeah but here you see score 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.720
 goals and his shooting readers next to you 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.540
 have scored full auto so there we are good 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.340
 I'm afraid I'm cradle flutto 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.360
 so we put on full auto with the 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.310
 dogs of the arrows would see well and one 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.080
 you jump we know that the arrows and 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.710
 hop right now we made double 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.740
 triangle in the air and that makes that done 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.180
 not like that the tear that comes back 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.640
 immediately the same armitiere who 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.000
 draws that you save between two and 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.000
 three weeks 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.780
 finally after you can test without 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.670
 do the trick you'll see that but 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.460
 a lot less two can of tangier 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.659
 read and besides me I found when 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.090
 I did not show it to you 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.920
 first time I had a small effect 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.890
 of zoom and that the me tremblay a little 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.270
 hungry years who mostly wants to down that 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.560
 it's the effect of 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.710
 to choose the shooting area for m 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.910
 asada was not at all guessing anything 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.090
 that's how it is I got a little 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.680
 does 10 meters anyway like 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.260
 usually as soon as he keeps up with the site 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.170
 as well in the end I'm sorry for 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:40.550
 my players viewer to me for the tutorial 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.620
 with the crossbow or crossboss it is not 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.650
 more but you I could not put because 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.540
 I had still guys that one 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.530
 choice of m 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.750
 and bah at worst who could go 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:59.600
 crescendo 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:01.340
 and then and then if there was 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.250
 two small to the wonderful weekly 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.860
 we have two falls to debate about our 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.240
 chains so you'll see them 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:13.810
 especially the ipad leak wen that you 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.240
 can calculate the disappointment will put 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:23.810
 but actually agreed I changed 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:25.250
 so good I think this video is going to be 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.260
 finish level like a tory we're going 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.650

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.840
 that bello full whip we really 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.300
 thought me I have a lot of imagination this 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.500
 game so I found a lot of the 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.350

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.860
