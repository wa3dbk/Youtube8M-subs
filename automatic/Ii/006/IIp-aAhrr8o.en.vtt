00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
see-through areas and when we lay the

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.630 
see-through areas and when we lay the
card<00:02:00.130> on<00:02:00.340> top<00:02:00.370> of<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:00.850> other<00:02:00.970> guard<00:02:02.100> okay<00:02:03.100> now

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
card on top of the other guard okay now

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.240 
card on top of the other guard okay now
we<00:02:03.700> see<00:02:04.210> through<00:02:04.390> that<00:02:04.630> this<00:02:04.890> power<00:02:05.890> levels

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
we see through that this power levels

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.180 
we see through that this power levels
are<00:02:06.340> back<00:02:06.490> up<00:02:06.760> with<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.150> character<00:02:08.190> we've

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
are back up with this character we've

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.440 
are back up with this character we've
got<00:02:09.459> 500<00:02:10.360> defense<00:02:10.810> in<00:02:11.140> red<00:02:11.319> 400<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.159> blue<00:02:12.639> 200

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
got 500 defense in red 400 and blue 200

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.289 
got 500 defense in red 400 and blue 200
in<00:02:13.540> red<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.409> you<00:02:14.499> get<00:02:14.739> all<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.489> additional

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
in red so you get all this additional

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.300 
in red so you get all this additional
defense<00:02:16.810> because<00:02:17.319> they<00:02:17.560> are<00:02:17.620> now

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
defense because they are now

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.390 
defense because they are now
monster<00:02:19.000> as<00:02:19.150> defense<00:02:19.900> against<00:02:20.380> attack<00:02:20.620> cards

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
monster as defense against attack cards

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.360 
monster as defense against attack cards
so<00:02:22.120> for<00:02:22.390> example<00:02:22.420> this<00:02:23.349> character<00:02:23.860> has<00:02:23.890> no

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
so for example this character has no

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.729 
so for example this character has no
attack<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:25.180> fit<00:02:25.360> no<00:02:25.540> defense<00:02:25.900> against<00:02:26.230> green

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
attack to fit no defense against green

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.820 
attack to fit no defense against green
so<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.700> take<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> green<00:02:28.750> attack<00:02:29.230> card<00:02:29.560> and

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
so you take a green attack card and

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.990 
so you take a green attack card and
these<00:02:30.340> are<00:02:30.959> their<00:02:31.959> motion<00:02:32.470> cards<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:33.489> you<00:02:33.760> know

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
these are their motion cards so you know

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.190 
these are their motion cards so you know
shows<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.330> little<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:35.230> know<00:02:35.260> fire<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:37.200> lay

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
shows a little you know fire and lay

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.839 
shows a little you know fire and lay
that<00:02:38.230> on<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:39.519> knocks<00:02:39.910> out<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.720> defense<00:02:41.849> here

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
that on that knocks out the defense here

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.330 
that on that knocks out the defense here
down<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.870> just<00:02:44.050> blew<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.130> only<00:02:45.250> have

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
down to just blew so you only have

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.930 
down to just blew so you only have
defense<00:02:45.819> against<00:02:46.120> blue<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:47.580> let's<00:02:48.580> say<00:02:48.790> we

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
defense against blue and let's say we

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.140 
defense against blue and let's say we
take<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.180> red<00:02:49.660> card<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.709> know<00:02:50.830> another

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
take this red card you know another

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.020 
take this red card you know another
another<00:02:52.150> motion<00:02:52.510> card<00:02:52.930> another<00:02:53.080> fire<00:02:53.500> card

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
another motion card another fire card

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.840 
another motion card another fire card
pop<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.269> one<00:02:55.299> on<00:02:55.569> top<00:02:55.840> now<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:57.310> character's

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
pop that one on top now this character's

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.120 
pop that one on top now this character's
still<00:02:58.090> only<00:02:58.269> has<00:02:58.420> defense<00:02:58.750> on<00:02:58.959> blue<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.739> the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
still only has defense on blue and the

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.059 
still only has defense on blue and the
power<00:03:00.370> levels<00:03:00.730> are<00:03:00.910> down<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:01.900> as<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:02.920> go
