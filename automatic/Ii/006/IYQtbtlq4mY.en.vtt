and<00:00:57.620> you<00:00:57.770> got<00:00:57.950> yourself<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.460> turret

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:27.980 

and<00:01:14.900> here<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.050> is<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.410> action<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:26.870> hope<00:01:27.870> you
