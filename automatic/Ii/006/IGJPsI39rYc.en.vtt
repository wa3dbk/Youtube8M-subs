wanted to talk to you about the windmill
to<00:00:13.760> build<00:00:14.760> a<00:00:14.970> small<00:00:15.210> structure<00:00:15.510> to<00:00:15.780> fight<00:00:16.189> and

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
to build a small structure to fight and

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.790 
to build a small structure to fight and
let<00:00:17.369> me<00:00:17.550> talk<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.450> you<00:00:18.570> about<00:00:18.599> the<00:00:19.320> windmill

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
let me talk to you about the windmill

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.880 
let me talk to you about the windmill
story<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:21.029> windmill<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.990> first<00:00:22.650> loss

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
story so the windmill is the first loss

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.340 
story so the windmill is the first loss
of<00:00:23.100> continuous<00:00:23.910> mechanical<00:00:24.449> power<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:25.050> you'll

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
of continuous mechanical power it you'll

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.519 
of continuous mechanical power it you'll
be<00:00:25.529> able<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:26.070> use<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.609> you'll<00:00:27.449> need<00:00:27.689> this

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
be able to use and you'll need this

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.849 
be able to use and you'll need this
windmill<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.490> power<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.960> you'll<00:00:31.380> need<00:00:31.560> to

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
windmill to power so that you'll need to

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.790 
windmill to power so that you'll need to
make<00:00:32.669> panels<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.390> buildings<00:00:33.840> panels<00:00:34.650> and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
make panels in buildings panels and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.130 
make panels in buildings panels and
moldings<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.340> you'll<00:00:35.519> need<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.900> craft<00:00:36.900> over

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
moldings that you'll need to craft over

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.680 
moldings that you'll need to craft over
the<00:00:37.320> wheel<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:40.190> waterwheel<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.400> a<00:00:41.540> kind<00:00:42.540> of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the wheel and waterwheel is a kind of

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.509 
the wheel and waterwheel is a kind of
the<00:00:42.870> same<00:00:43.110> thing<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.470> the<00:00:43.650> windmill<00:00:44.010> except

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
the same thing as the windmill except

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.880 
the same thing as the windmill except
that<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:44.850> smaller<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.809> more<00:00:46.470> efficient

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
that it's smaller and more efficient

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.810 
that it's smaller and more efficient
because<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.519> windmill<00:00:48.080> can't<00:00:49.080> work<00:00:49.549> during<00:00:50.549> a

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
because the windmill can't work during a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.240 
because the windmill can't work during a
stone<00:00:51.680> you<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.729> use<00:00:53.909> a<00:00:53.940> detector<00:00:54.659> block

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
stone you have to use a detector block

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.549 
stone you have to use a detector block
you<00:00:56.250> should<00:00:56.460> also<00:00:57.030> detector<00:00:57.600> lock<00:00:57.839> is<00:00:58.019> a<00:00:58.260> link

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
you should also detector lock is a link

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.950 
you should also detector lock is a link
on<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> video<00:00:59.159> in<00:00:59.610> the<00:00:59.820> description<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
on the video in the description the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.009 
on the video in the description the
video<00:01:01.080> about<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.799> detector<00:01:02.369> block<00:01:03.019> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
video about the detector block and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.020 
video about the detector block and
you'll<00:01:04.260> need<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.739> use<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.309> detector<00:01:05.820> block

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you'll need to use this detector block

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.859 
you'll need to use this detector block
to<00:01:06.450> detect<00:01:07.170> when<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.770> raining<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
to detect when it's raining and

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.620 
to detect when it's raining and
disengage<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.170> gearbox<00:01:10.619> by<00:01:11.609> pairing<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.270> with

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
disengage the gearbox by pairing it with

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.679 
disengage the gearbox by pairing it with
redstone<00:01:13.140> because<00:01:14.090> during<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> storm

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
redstone because during the storm

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.760 
redstone because during the storm
the<00:01:16.170> gearbox<00:01:17.130> connected<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.420> window<00:01:18.840> will

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the gearbox connected to the window will

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.029 
the gearbox connected to the window will
be<00:01:19.950> destroyed<00:01:20.399> if<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.939> don't<00:01:21.149> disengage<00:01:21.479> it

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
be destroyed if you don't disengage it

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.010 
be destroyed if you don't disengage it
so<00:01:23.039> the<00:01:23.490> windmill<00:01:24.109> the<00:01:25.109> windmill<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
so the windmill the windmill is a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.289 
so the windmill the windmill is a
cannabic<00:01:28.020> as<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.469> said<00:01:28.679> if<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.579> come<00:01:29.850> from<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
cannabic as I said if you come from the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.840 
cannabic as I said if you come from the
axle<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:30.929> middle<00:01:31.289> you'll<00:01:31.920> need<00:01:32.159> six

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
axle in the middle you'll need six

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.120 
axle in the middle you'll need six
blocks<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.359> every<00:01:33.630> direction<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.710> that's<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
blocks in every direction so that's a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.249 
blocks in every direction so that's a
certain<00:01:35.969> by<00:01:36.210> certain<00:01:36.859> area<00:01:37.859> but<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.869> windmill

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
certain by certain area but the windmill

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.249 
certain by certain area but the windmill
is<00:01:40.560> Kanako<00:01:41.329> really<00:01:42.329> good<00:01:42.539> looking<00:01:42.929> and<00:01:43.049> you

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
is Kanako really good looking and you

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.849 
is Kanako really good looking and you
can<00:01:43.469> also<00:01:43.619> die<00:01:44.039> it<00:01:44.929> just<00:01:45.929> like<00:01:46.109> so<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.710> you

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
can also die it just like so but you

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.559 
can also die it just like so but you
have<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.159> careful<00:01:47.579> because<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:48.329> has<00:01:48.539> a

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
have to be careful because it has a

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.550 
have to be careful because it has a
weird<00:01:48.929> effect<00:01:49.109> on<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.469> walls

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
weird effect on the walls

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.489 
weird effect on the walls
you<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:54.710> that's<00:01:55.710> what<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.359> to

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:57.499 
you just like so and that's what it to

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:00.980 
you just like so and that's what it to
