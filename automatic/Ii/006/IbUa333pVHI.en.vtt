normal<00:00:37.170> humans<00:00:37.710> now<00:00:38.129> there's<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.399> lot<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.760> great

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
normal humans now there's a lot of great

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.580 
normal humans now there's a lot of great
theories<00:00:39.360> out<00:00:39.510> there<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.930> my<00:00:40.079> theory<00:00:40.379> is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
theories out there and my theory is

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.110 
theories out there and my theory is
probably<00:00:40.890> similar<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.520> lot<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.850> other

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
probably similar to a lot of other

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.400 
probably similar to a lot of other
people's<00:00:42.480> theories<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:42.930> don't<00:00:43.170> say<00:00:43.320> I'm

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
people's theories so don't say I'm

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.170 
people's theories so don't say I'm
copying<00:00:43.680> anybody<00:00:44.219> because<00:00:44.550> I'm<00:00:44.730> pretty<00:00:45.059> much

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
copying anybody because I'm pretty much

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.260 
copying anybody because I'm pretty much
just<00:00:45.860> just<00:00:46.860> sharing<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.640> promoting<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
just just sharing it and promoting it to

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.450 
just just sharing it and promoting it to
other<00:00:48.539> people<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:48.840> shadows<00:00:49.680> whoever<00:00:50.010> has<00:00:50.250> this

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
other people so shadows whoever has this

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.580 
other people so shadows whoever has this
theory<00:00:50.760> now<00:00:51.000> let's<00:00:51.539> get<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.110> topic

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
theory now let's get on with the topic

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.470 
theory now let's get on with the topic
or<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.800> theory<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.789> known<00:00:54.300> the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.679 
easily just come into other people's
realms<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.520> stuff<00:01:29.700> maybe<00:01:30.150> he<00:01:30.329> broke<00:01:30.509> through

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
realms and stuff maybe he broke through

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.929 
realms and stuff maybe he broke through
a<00:01:30.750> barrier<00:01:31.049> like<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.710> then<00:01:32.340> he<00:01:32.610> went<00:01:32.850> to

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
a barrier like that and then he went to

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.670 
a barrier like that and then he went to
the<00:01:33.090> nether<00:01:33.299> realm<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.720> then<00:01:33.960> he<00:01:34.170> brought<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the nether realm and then he brought and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.710 
the nether realm and then he brought and
then<00:01:34.829> he<00:01:34.950> broke<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:35.759> he<00:01:35.909> wanted<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.420> free

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
then he broke and then he wanted to free

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.810 
then he broke and then he wanted to free
the<00:01:37.350> earth<00:01:37.500> Rome<00:01:37.740> warriors<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.369> then<00:01:38.610> that's

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the earth Rome warriors and then that's

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.330 
the earth Rome warriors and then that's
why<00:01:39.060> kongou<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.380> them<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.740> then<00:01:41.070> after

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
why kongou is one of them and then after

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.219 
why kongou is one of them and then after
he<00:01:41.460> was<00:01:41.610> freed<00:01:41.939> he<00:01:42.150> probably<00:01:42.420> went<00:01:42.780> into<00:01:43.049> exile

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
he was freed he probably went into exile

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
he was freed he probably went into exile
because<00:01:43.829> he<00:01:43.950> felt<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.340> Quan<00:01:44.610> Chi<00:01:44.820> would<00:01:45.000> go

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
because he felt that Quan Chi would go

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.090 
because he felt that Quan Chi would go
after<00:01:45.570> him<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> kill<00:01:46.140> him<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:46.979> he

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
after him and kill him and then he

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.319 
after him and kill him and then he
wanted<00:01:47.310> he<00:01:47.490> didn't<00:01:47.700> want<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.939> go<00:01:48.090> through<00:01:48.240> that

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
wanted he didn't want to go through that

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.480 
wanted he didn't want to go through that
so<00:01:48.750> that's<00:01:49.049> why<00:01:49.200> he<00:01:49.350> was<00:01:49.590> hiding<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:50.159> very

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
so that's why he was hiding for very

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.370 
so that's why he was hiding for very
many<00:01:50.850> years<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.360> then<00:01:51.780> probably<00:01:52.079> he<00:01:52.170> came

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
many years and then probably he came

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.950 
many years and then probably he came
back<00:01:52.619> because<00:01:52.979> he<00:01:53.189> either<00:01:53.610> he<00:01:54.360> feels<00:01:54.780> that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
back because he either he feels that

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.350 
back because he either he feels that
he's<00:01:55.140> ready<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> confront<00:01:56.130> Quan<00:01:56.430> Chi<00:01:56.670> or<00:01:56.909> he

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
he's ready to confront Quan Chi or he

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.700 
he's ready to confront Quan Chi or he
found<00:01:57.540> out<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.869> Quan<00:01:58.079> Chi<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.350> dead<00:01:58.560> because

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
found out that Quan Chi is dead because

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.230 
found out that Quan Chi is dead because
scorpion<00:01:59.460> killed<00:01:59.700> them<00:01:59.820> or<00:01:59.939> something<00:02:00.119> like

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
scorpion killed them or something like

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.149 
scorpion killed them or something like
that<00:02:00.329> that's<00:02:00.689> why<00:02:00.899> ray<00:02:01.200> didn't<00:02:01.439> ask<00:02:01.619> Quan<00:02:01.920> Chi

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
that that's why ray didn't ask Quan Chi

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.830 
that that's why ray didn't ask Quan Chi
where<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.759> been<00:02:02.880> Kong<00:02:03.149> now<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.540> because

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
where have you been Kong now is because

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
where have you been Kong now is because
Kong<00:02:04.170> law<00:02:04.350> was<00:02:04.530> probably<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:05.009> exile<00:02:05.430> for<00:02:05.640> many

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
Kong law was probably in exile for many

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.449 
Kong law was probably in exile for many
years<00:02:06.090> because<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.630> Quan<00:02:07.200> Chi<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.979> yeah<00:02:08.160> that's

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
years because of Quan Chi so yeah that's

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.430 
years because of Quan Chi so yeah that's
my<00:02:08.520> theory<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.000> why<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.360> think<00:02:09.569> Kung<00:02:09.989> Lao<00:02:10.200> is

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
my theory on why I think Kung Lao is

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.930 
my theory on why I think Kung Lao is
back<00:02:10.770> as<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> normal<00:02:11.459> human

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
back as a normal human

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.790 
back as a normal human
now<00:02:12.180> if<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.540> guys<00:02:12.660> like<00:02:12.960> my<00:02:12.990> theory<00:02:13.470> then<00:02:13.650> go

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
now if you guys like my theory then go

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.470 
now if you guys like my theory then go
ahead<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.040> give<00:02:14.370> us<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.670> like<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.150> share<00:02:15.180> it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
ahead and give us a like and share it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.120 
ahead and give us a like and share it
with<00:02:15.510> your<00:02:15.720> friends<00:02:16.110> if<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.500> guys<00:02:16.710> don't<00:02:16.980> like

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
it then leave your theories on why I

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.350 
it then leave your theories on why I
think<00:02:19.110> or<00:02:19.530> what<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.980> think<00:02:20.220> why<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.670> think<00:02:21.180> Kung

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
think or what I think why you think Kung

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.150 
think or what I think why you think Kung
Lao<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.690> back<00:02:21.870> as<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.050> normal<00:02:22.410> human<00:02:22.440> because<00:02:22.950> I

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
Lao is back as a normal human because I

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.710

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
because this is the theory I got but I

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.340 
because this is the theory I got but I
haven't<00:02:26.820> really<00:02:27.060> looked<00:02:27.270> into<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.660> lot<00:02:28.140> of
