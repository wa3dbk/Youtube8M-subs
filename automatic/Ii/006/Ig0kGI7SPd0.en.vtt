00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hi to all and the room in this 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.490
 video I'm going to talk about modes on 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.600
 gta 5 pc for those who were wondering 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.730
 question as to whether the modes 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.050
 will exist on gta 5 pc i already have 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.530
 some elements of answer to you 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.599
 to bring 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.830
 it will just not be too much in a hurry 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.269
 because there is no specific date 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.920
 but in any case you will see that he 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.990
 chances are it will happen enough 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.180
 so quickly on facebook we have a message 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.130
 of ice and answer if you do not know 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.230
 this mode is the one that allowed gta 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.590
 iv to pass this quality there 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.109
 so those who have getac apc sees the game 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.550
 like that to this quality there so there 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.590
 it's those who have the high sound mode 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.399
 sister who sees the game like that the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.410
 difference was just going 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.329
 enormously and a lot of players getting 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.489
 are asked if we would have this mode in 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.500
 gta 5 or not so i will read you the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.399
 post from ice and answer i you 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.530
 translated into English 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.629
 I checked the latest photos of GTA 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.710
 5 pc the graphics and full settings 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.820
 many more things 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.980
 as I had planned the game does not 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.719
 requires no graphical modding 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.370
 particular if not a treatment of 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.050
 colors but that's all I had a 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.280
 interview with Boris and he said to himself 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.050
 exactly the same thing 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.460
 the changes that can be made 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.350
 are really very minimal 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.950
 the game already had a lot of texts on 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.360
 ps4 xbox one ggt 1.5 on ps4 xbox on the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.340
 only thing that bothers me a little 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.320
 weather and colors but it's up to 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.790
 pretty much everything I will change the game to 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.259
 the future with a mode but not 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.939
 now the game is already pretty 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.380
 gorgeous like that and then others 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.869
 people will surely make modes 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.600
 graphs before me using reshad 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.369
 or sweat fx or even something else 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.750
 I do not like that kind of things 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.909
 not want to change a game like this 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.630
 there especially since we really do not need 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.180
 to change it 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.829
 to grow up has done wonderful thing but 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.200
 it's only good for old people 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.210
 games to make them more beautiful spas 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.100
 gta 5 on pc the only thing I 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.810
 would like to see I went to los angeles 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.250
 long enough to know what it's all about 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.710
 looks in terms of textures from 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.630
 colors and lighting g15 is really 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.619
 very close to reality especially close 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.140
 from venice beach 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.750
 it looks like an exact copy the game and 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.189
 protected for gt line i was expecting it and 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.320
 it's perfect because with a simple 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.570
 hack we can see people behind 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.219
 elements I'm going to take a look at 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.880
 throw in 5 pc to see what we can 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.009
 switch 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.240
 so here is the testimony of the famous 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.320
 iphone in syria says it's possible 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.360
 to change things 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.790
 we will see what will concoct a 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.800
 time I was at 5 pc output we can 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.150
 also think that the modes on gta 5 pc 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.980
 will arrive fairly quickly 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.750
 especially when we see the answer from 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.300
 rockstar to a question that was theirs 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.310
 asked about the modes I told you he 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.680
 have not been very explicit 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.290
 and precisely that says a lot about the 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.330
 future presence or no fashion then the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.129
 modding was very important for gta iv 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.519
 pc is what you support the modding 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.870
 in gta 5 pc their answer 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.280
 since I was online is out 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.760
 our main goal is to 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.160
 make sure nothing has an impact 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.930
 negative about the gaming experience or about 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.330
 the community so that's their answer 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.709
 basically what to understand is 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.690
 if you want to make modes in 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.550
 your corner without making anyone shit 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.319
 free to you a bit like on ps3 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.030
 for a long time but if you start 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.300
 to make modes to piss off the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.430
 world 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.319
 rockstar will take care of you it's like 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.090
 what to understand their answer 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.709
 but at least they did not say they 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.540
 had put in place an anti 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.340
 mode and so that's the modes will 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.989
 see the day soon 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.550
 that's all for this video and I 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.550
 tell you just now ciao
