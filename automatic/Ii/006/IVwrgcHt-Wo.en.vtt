to 50 a little bit longer because it's

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.280

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
speed 192 is he going to be close to 200

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.570 
speed 192 is he going to be close to 200
not<00:01:53.119> quite<00:01:53.390> sure<00:01:53.420> we<00:01:53.690> got<00:01:53.810> enough<00:01:54.080> road

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
not quite sure we got enough road

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.980 
not quite sure we got enough road
reference<00:01:55.580> point<00:01:55.790> is<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.330> shadow<00:01:56.690> on<00:01:56.960> the

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
reference point is the shadow on the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.320 
reference point is the shadow on the
ground<00:01:57.110> there<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.860> is<00:01:57.979> third<00:01:58.580> gear<00:01:58.610> right<00:01:59.119> hand

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
ground there it is third gear right hand

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.560 
ground there it is third gear right hand
to<00:01:59.420> keep<00:01:59.570> it<00:01:59.720> tight<00:01:59.960> on<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.200> entry<00:02:01.540> drifting<00:02:02.540> a

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
to keep it tight on the entry drifting a

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.289 
to keep it tight on the entry drifting a
little<00:02:02.630> bit<00:02:02.840> too<00:02:03.020> wide<00:02:03.229> there<00:02:03.590> but<00:02:03.950> power<00:02:04.790> yeah

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
little bit too wide there but power yeah

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.520 
little bit too wide there but power yeah
a<00:02:05.330> little<00:02:05.720> bit<00:02:05.780> too<00:02:05.899> aggressive<00:02:05.990> on<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.350> power

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
a little bit too aggressive on the power

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.840 
a little bit too aggressive on the power
there<00:02:06.740> but<00:02:06.920> nevertheless<00:02:07.220> it's<00:02:07.580> going<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.790> be

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
there but nevertheless it's going to be

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.120 
there but nevertheless it's going to be
a<00:02:07.880> decent<00:02:08.060> laptop<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.810> get<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.769> as<00:02:09.860> straight

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
a decent laptop and get it as straight

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.750 
a decent laptop and get it as straight
as<00:02:10.280> we<00:02:10.399> can<00:02:11.739> this<00:02:12.739> is<00:02:12.860> going<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.070> be<00:02:13.130> a<00:02:13.190> 119<00:02:13.730> I

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
as we can this is going to be a 119 I

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.160 
as we can this is going to be a 119 I
think<00:02:14.000> it's<00:02:14.120> going<00:02:14.239> to<00:02:14.300> be<00:02:14.390> close<00:02:15.820> yep<00:02:16.820> 119<00:02:17.570> 68

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
think it's going to be close yep 119 68

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.150 
think it's going to be close yep 119 68
not<00:02:18.350> bad<00:02:19.690> till<00:02:20.690> there<00:02:20.780> we<00:02:20.840> have<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.160> pretty

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
not bad till there we have a pretty

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.130 
not bad till there we have a pretty
respectable<00:02:22.850> lap<00:02:23.330> time<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.600> think<00:02:23.720> with<00:02:24.050> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
respectable lap time I think with the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.280 
respectable lap time I think with the
box<00:02:24.410> down<00:02:24.620> it<00:02:24.769> sets<00:02:24.950> up<00:02:25.069> with<00:02:25.220> 119<00:02:25.819> six<00:02:26.209> by<00:02:27.140> all

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
box down it sets up with 119 six by all

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.960 
box down it sets up with 119 six by all
means<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.620> probably<00:02:28.250> quite<00:02:28.430> quick<00:02:28.790> actually

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
means is probably quite quick actually

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.880 
means is probably quite quick actually
with<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.390> Box<00:02:29.569> down<00:02:29.780> set<00:02:30.050> up<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.440> know<00:02:30.709> if

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
with the Box down set up I know if

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.620 
with the Box down set up I know if
someone<00:02:31.069> out<00:02:31.250> there<00:02:31.400> has<00:02:31.580> done<00:02:31.790> 117<00:02:32.480> so

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
someone out there has done 117 so

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.540 
someone out there has done 117 so
obviously<00:02:32.959> they<00:02:33.140> tweaked<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.220> hell<00:02:34.370> out<00:02:34.519> of

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
obviously they tweaked the hell out of

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.190 
obviously they tweaked the hell out of
their<00:02:34.730> car<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.450> do

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
their car and to do

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.850 
their car and to do
got<00:02:36.319> it<00:02:36.440> really<00:02:36.830> stable<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:37.730> far<00:02:37.760> people<00:02:38.860> so

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
got it really stable so far people so

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.170 
got it really stable so far people so
all<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.069> footage<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:40.640> saw<00:02:40.910> here<00:02:41.060> today
