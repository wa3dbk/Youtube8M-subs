00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
thinking about Sunday I think we'll do

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.030 
thinking about Sunday I think we'll do
what<00:00:34.200> we've<00:00:34.320> been<00:00:34.350> doing<00:00:34.500> over<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.980> last

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
what we've been doing over the last

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.970 
what we've been doing over the last
three<00:00:35.489> games<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:36.090> don't<00:00:37.079> think<00:00:37.410> we've<00:00:37.590> got<00:00:37.739> push

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
three games I don't think we've got push

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.799 
three games I don't think we've got push
the<00:00:38.129> game<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.520> don't<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.270> don't<00:00:39.300> need<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> three

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the game I don't we don't need the three

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.680 
the game I don't we don't need the three
points<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.460> think<00:00:41.579> Murray<00:00:41.940> now<00:00:42.210> will<00:00:42.390> set<00:00:42.600> up

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
points so I think Murray now will set up

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.930 
points so I think Murray now will set up
his<00:00:42.719> tactics<00:00:43.260> it'll<00:00:44.160> play<00:00:44.309> Zoomer<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
his tactics it'll play Zoomer in the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.029 
his tactics it'll play Zoomer in the
middle<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.600> will<00:00:45.840> contain<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.559> four

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039

striker we've done that before obviously

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.359 
striker we've done that before obviously
we've<00:01:27.299> done<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.600> Man<00:01:27.780> United<00:01:28.170> last<00:01:28.380> year<00:01:28.710> or

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
we've done that Man United last year or

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.780 
we've done that Man United last year or
year<00:01:29.430> before<00:01:29.729> rather<00:01:30.150> although<00:01:30.600> last<00:01:30.810> year<00:01:31.790> so

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
year before rather although last year so

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.819 
year before rather although last year so
you<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.990> stuff<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.409> would<00:01:34.500> contain

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
you know we do stuff it would contain

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.840 
you know we do stuff it would contain
and<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.159> think<00:01:36.890> are<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:37.950> feeling<00:01:38.250> about<00:01:38.310> closer

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
and I think are you feeling about closer

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.510 
and I think are you feeling about closer
I<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.840> pressures<00:01:40.200> offset<00:01:40.590> certainly<00:01:41.490> I

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
I think the pressures offset certainly I

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.120 
I think the pressures offset certainly I
think<00:01:41.640> we'll<00:01:41.939> win<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.240> think<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.950> will<00:01:43.950> win

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
