to<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.010> super<00:01:02.520> streamlined<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.049> job

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
to be super streamlined to do the job

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.630 
to be super streamlined to do the job
that<00:01:04.290> they<00:01:04.439> needed<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.519> what

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
that they needed to do and that's what

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.070 
that they needed to do and that's what
we<00:01:05.729> try<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.180> with<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> tournament<00:01:06.630> edition

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
we try to do with the tournament edition

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.050 
we try to do with the tournament edition
range<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.830> stripped<00:01:08.430> out<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.610> lot<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
range so we stripped out a lot of the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.940 
range so we stripped out a lot of the
weight<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> mouse<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:10.020> weighs<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.290> 90

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
weight of the mouse it weighs just 90

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.830 
weight of the mouse it weighs just 90
grams<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:11.939> had<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.150> work<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.299> hard<00:01:12.600> to

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
grams so we had to work really hard to

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.420 
grams so we had to work really hard to
take<00:01:13.020> away<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> lot<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> metal<00:01:13.830> components

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
take away a lot of the metal components

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.370 
take away a lot of the metal components
we've<00:01:14.820> used<00:01:15.000> reinforced<00:01:15.630> plastic<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.140> make<00:01:16.259> it

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
we've used reinforced plastic to make it

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.469 
we've used reinforced plastic to make it
as<00:01:16.470> light<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.860> possible<00:01:17.030> we've<00:01:18.030> got<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> brand

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
as light as possible we've got a brand

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.570 
as light as possible we've got a brand
new<00:01:18.540> sensor<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.009> an<00:01:20.100> 80<00:01:20.310> 200

the keyboard is supposed to remain still
rather<00:03:55.799> than<00:03:56.010> be<00:03:56.970> moved<00:03:57.209> so<00:03:57.479> with<00:03:57.840> the

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
rather than be moved so with the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.059 
rather than be moved so with the
keyboard<00:03:58.079> we<00:03:58.349> actually<00:03:58.620> went<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:58.859> other<00:03:58.949> way

keyboard we actually went the other way

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.860 
keyboard we actually went the other way
we<00:03:59.250> made<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.519> keyboard<00:03:59.849> heavier<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:00.780> the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
we made the keyboard heavier so the

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.420 
we made the keyboard heavier so the

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
reliable now another thing that we've

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.050 
reliable now another thing that we've
changed<00:04:29.010> on<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.370> strike<00:04:29.610> te<00:04:29.790> we've

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
changed on the strike te we've

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.360 
changed on the strike te we've
completely<00:04:30.480> reworked<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.080> internal<00:04:31.530> PCB<00:04:32.130> and

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
completely reworked the internal PCB and

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.820 
completely reworked the internal PCB and
the<00:04:32.820> track<00:04:33.090> layout<00:04:33.540> so<00:04:34.080> we've<00:04:34.200> made<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.500> faster

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
the track layout so we've made it faster

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.800 
the track layout so we've made it faster
than<00:04:35.220> ever<00:04:35.310> before<00:04:35.370> it's<00:04:35.820> a<00:04:35.910> much<00:04:36.180> faster<00:04:36.480> and

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
than ever before it's a much faster and

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.900 
than ever before it's a much faster and
a<00:04:36.840> much<00:04:36.960> more<00:04:37.140> responsive<00:04:37.560> strike<00:04:38.400> keyboard

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
a much more responsive strike keyboard

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.150 
a much more responsive strike keyboard
than<00:04:39.060> any<00:04:39.180> that<00:04:39.360> we've<00:04:39.510> released<00:04:39.810> previously

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
than any that we've released previously

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.160 
than any that we've released previously
so<00:04:41.160> you've<00:04:41.310> actually<00:04:41.400> got<00:04:41.760> a<00:04:41.790> 30<00:04:42.120> key<00:04:42.510> rollover

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
so you've actually got a 30 key rollover

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.410 
so you've actually got a 30 key rollover
on<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.410> keyboard<00:04:44.160> so<00:04:44.970> you<00:04:45.030> can<00:04:45.300> actually

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
on the keyboard so you can actually

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.320 
on the keyboard so you can actually
access<00:04:45.690> up<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.020> 30<00:04:46.410> keys<00:04:46.800> individually<00:04:47.640> at<00:04:47.970> the
