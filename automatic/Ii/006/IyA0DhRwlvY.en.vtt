overview so first of all let's just talk
a<00:00:36.450> little<00:00:36.780> bit<00:00:36.989> about<00:00:37.200> design<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:38.210> execution

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
a little bit about design and execution

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
little bit at the end really you need to

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.190 
little bit at the end really you need to
put<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> lanyard<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.149> hole<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.930> make<00:01:55.079> it

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
put a lanyard in that hole to make it

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.719 
put a lanyard in that hole to make it
work<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.299> this<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.540> where<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.649> design<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.549> me

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
work and this is where the design to me

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.940 
work and this is where the design to me
starts<00:02:00.270> maybe<00:02:00.540> coming<00:02:00.930> apart<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.560> little<00:02:01.710> bit

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
starts maybe coming apart a little bit

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.760 
starts maybe coming apart a little bit
because<00:02:02.299> you're<00:02:03.299> looking<00:02:03.509> at<00:02:03.930> what<00:02:04.649> is

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
because you're looking at what is

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.059

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
fundamentally a very robust design and

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.100 
fundamentally a very robust design and

who<00:04:10.630> have<00:04:10.930> done<00:04:11.170> more<00:04:11.500> rigorous<00:04:12.040> testing<00:04:12.519> of

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
who have done more rigorous testing of

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.110 
who have done more rigorous testing of

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
hinders use of 20 CV and have found it

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.870 
hinders use of 20 CV and have found it
to<00:04:16.269> have<00:04:16.510> problems<00:04:17.290> so<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:17.890> can't<00:04:18.220> really<00:04:18.519> say

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
to have problems so I can't really say

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.240 
to have problems so I can't really say
that<00:04:18.910> this<00:04:19.720> knife<00:04:19.989> is<00:04:20.350> certainly<00:04:20.799> going<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.160> be

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
that this knife is certainly going to be

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.450 
that this knife is certainly going to be
well<00:04:22.240> suited<00:04:22.750> just<00:04:23.350> given<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.800> steel<00:04:24.070> type<00:04:24.310> it

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
well suited just given the steel type it

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.210 
well suited just given the steel type it
has<00:04:24.640> so<00:04:25.600> from<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:25.900> user<00:04:26.140> standpoint<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:27.070> would

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
has so from a user standpoint I would

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.660 
has so from a user standpoint I would
rather

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
rather

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.080 
rather

use a small folding knife for the

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.610 
use a small folding knife for the
slicing<00:04:31.540> tasks<00:04:32.050> that<00:04:32.170> I<00:04:32.230> think<00:04:32.470> are

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
slicing tasks that I think are

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.280 
slicing tasks that I think are
appropriate<00:04:32.830> for<00:04:33.490> this<00:04:34.330> cutting<00:04:34.720> edge<00:04:34.840> length

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
appropriate for this cutting edge length

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.310 
appropriate for this cutting edge length
now<00:04:36.130> for<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:36.460> collector<00:04:37.030> though<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:38.050> fine

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
now for a collector though the fine

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.950 
now for a collector though the fine
details<00:04:38.770> are<00:04:39.160> quite<00:04:39.460> interesting<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:40.420> if<00:04:40.840> I

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
details are quite interesting and if I

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.330 
details are quite interesting and if I
wanted<00:04:41.200> to<00:04:41.260> round<00:04:41.530> out<00:04:41.830> my<00:04:41.860> hinderer

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
wanted to round out my hinderer

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.580 
wanted to round out my hinderer
collection<00:04:42.970> I<00:04:43.210> think<00:04:43.870> that<00:04:44.020> this<00:04:44.230> would<00:04:44.440> be<00:04:44.560> a

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
collection I think that this would be a

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.830 
collection I think that this would be a
good<00:04:44.830> choice<00:04:45.450> thanks<00:04:46.450> a<00:04:46.510> lot<00:04:46.630> for<00:04:46.780> watching
