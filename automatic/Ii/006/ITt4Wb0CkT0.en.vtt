00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
better than ball retrieving because he's

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.179 
better than ball retrieving because he's
not<00:01:37.689> putting<00:01:38.689> excessive<00:01:39.200> stress<00:01:39.500> on<00:01:39.680> his<00:01:39.890> legs

and<00:01:43.520> making<00:01:44.000> sudden<00:01:44.420> turns<00:01:44.740> I'm<00:01:45.740> not<00:01:46.039> in<00:01:46.310> favor

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
and making sudden turns I'm not in favor

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.999 
and making sudden turns I'm not in favor

dogs of any age because it creates

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.649 
dogs of any age because it creates
excessive<00:01:51.500> stress<00:01:51.770> on<00:01:52.070> their<00:01:52.460> front<00:01:52.969> feet<00:01:53.240> for

stressful<00:02:03.829> for<00:02:04.189> his<00:02:04.340> legs<00:02:04.579> because<00:02:04.880> he<00:02:05.060> has<00:02:05.420> a

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.450 
stressful for his legs because he has a
he<00:02:06.380> has<00:02:06.409> a<00:02:06.530> little<00:02:06.710> bit<00:02:06.920> of<00:02:07.009> time<00:02:07.219> to<00:02:07.430> actually

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
he has a little bit of time to actually

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.100 
he has a little bit of time to actually
gauge<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.390> see<00:02:08.420> where<00:02:08.810> the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
gauge and see where the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.880 
gauge and see where the
leash<00:02:09.649> for<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.250> ball<00:02:10.460> or<00:02:10.729> your<00:02:10.880> toy<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.120> and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
leash for the ball or your toy is and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.040 
leash for the ball or your toy is and
doesn't<00:02:12.890> need<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.100> break<00:02:13.280> suddenly<00:02:14.020> on<00:02:15.020> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
doesn't need to break suddenly on the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.990 
doesn't need to break suddenly on the
other<00:02:15.290> hand<00:02:15.590> if<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:16.070> just<00:02:16.340> throw<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.790> toy

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
other hand if I just throw the toy

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.050 
other hand if I just throw the toy
without<00:02:17.270> actually<00:02:18.110> asking<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:19.040> wait<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:20.000> can

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
without actually asking to wait you can

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.180 
without actually asking to wait you can
see<00:02:20.240> that<00:02:20.690> he<00:02:21.440> actually<00:02:21.590> needs<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.980> break

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
see that he actually needs to break

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.250 
see that he actually needs to break
suddenly<00:02:22.700> which<00:02:22.910> especially<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.750> older<00:02:24.020> dogs

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
suddenly which especially in older dogs

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.440 
suddenly which especially in older dogs
can<00:02:24.950> cause<00:02:25.130> injuries<00:02:25.700> if<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:26.240> done<00:02:26.420> a

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
can cause injuries if it's done a

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.810 
can cause injuries if it's done a
repeated<00:02:26.990> basis<00:02:27.350> so<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.860> an<00:02:28.160> example<00:02:28.490> of

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
repeated basis so this is an example of

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.120 
repeated basis so this is an example of
what<00:02:29.720> not<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:30.050> do<00:02:30.200> I'm<00:02:30.440> just<00:02:30.500> going<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.950> show

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
what not to do I'm just going to show

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.510 
what not to do I'm just going to show
you<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:31.490> more<00:02:31.670> time<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:33.050> can<00:02:33.080> see<00:02:33.470> oh<00:02:33.650> here<00:02:34.280> I

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
you one more time you can see oh here I

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.430 
you one more time you can see oh here I
actually<00:02:34.910> asked<00:02:35.510> him<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.780> wait<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:35.990> little<00:02:36.290> bit

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
actually asked him to wait a little bit

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.410 
actually asked him to wait a little bit
or<00:02:36.680> maybe<00:02:36.830> held<00:02:37.190> him<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.670> it's<00:02:37.820> much<00:02:38.180> better

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
or maybe held him and it's much better

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.199 
or maybe held him and it's much better
you<00:02:39.260> can<00:02:39.440> see<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.740> he's<00:02:39.920> actually<00:02:40.209> looking

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
you can see that he's actually looking

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.640 
you can see that he's actually looking
for<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.480> toy<00:02:41.660> while<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.200> little<00:02:42.500> boy

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
for the toy while this little boy

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.680 
for the toy while this little boy
already<00:02:43.490> retrieved<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:44.090> he<00:02:44.300> didn't<00:02:44.570> notice

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
already retrieved it he didn't notice

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.530 
already retrieved it he didn't notice
sometimes<00:02:45.200> dogs<00:02:45.620> are<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:45.980> focused<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.580> once

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
sometimes dogs are so focused and once

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.380 
sometimes dogs are so focused and once
again<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:48.440> can<00:02:48.620> see<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:48.850> this<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:50.030> actually

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
again you can see that this is actually

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.479 
again you can see that this is actually
much<00:02:50.690> less<00:02:50.959> optimal<00:02:51.470> because<00:02:51.920> he<00:02:52.130> needs<00:02:52.370> to

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
much less optimal because he needs to

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.280 
much less optimal because he needs to
break<00:02:52.640> sudden<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.239> some<00:02:53.450> dogs<00:02:53.660> or<00:02:53.900> even<00:02:54.110> more

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
break sudden and some dogs or even more

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:03.210 
break sudden and some dogs or even more
crazy

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.460 

another<00:03:04.220> really<00:03:04.459> fun<00:03:04.849> way<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.120> exercise<00:03:06.080> your

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
another really fun way to exercise your

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.220 
another really fun way to exercise your
dog<00:03:06.860> is<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.549> chase<00:03:08.120> them<00:03:08.420> they<00:03:08.629> love<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.110> be

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
dog is to chase them they love to be

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.490 
dog is to chase them they love to be
chased<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.980> if<00:03:10.909> you<00:03:11.090> have<00:03:11.180> kids<00:03:11.450> make<00:03:12.319> sure

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
chased and if you have kids make sure

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.830 
chased and if you have kids make sure
that<00:03:12.650> he<00:03:12.769> supervised<00:03:13.250> them<00:03:13.549> because<00:03:13.879> we<00:03:14.659> will

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
that he supervised them because we will

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.080 
that he supervised them because we will
see<00:03:15.019> in<00:03:15.110> a<00:03:15.200> moment<00:03:15.349> what<00:03:15.890> can<00:03:16.069> happen<00:03:16.250> when<00:03:16.730> the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
see in a moment what can happen when the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.809 
see in a moment what can happen when the
supervision<00:03:17.930> is<00:03:18.080> not<00:03:18.290> perfect<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:19.010> I<00:03:19.129> didn't

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
supervision is not perfect and I didn't

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.490 
supervision is not perfect and I didn't
foresee<00:03:20.209> that<00:03:20.450> this<00:03:20.599> little<00:03:20.810> boy<00:03:21.049> will<00:03:21.319> be

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
foresee that this little boy will be

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.960 
foresee that this little boy will be
actually<00:03:21.799> so<00:03:22.010> fast<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.519> he's<00:03:22.730> going<00:03:22.910> to

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
actually so fast that he's going to

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.850 
actually so fast that he's going to
catch<00:03:23.209> sky<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:23.750> eventually<00:03:24.260> actually<00:03:24.620> fall

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
catch sky and eventually actually fall

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.559 
catch sky and eventually actually fall
on<00:03:25.040> him<00:03:25.190> which<00:03:25.959> has<00:03:26.959> resulted<00:03:27.230> in<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:28.670> little

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
on him which has resulted in a little

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.410 
on him which has resulted in a little
bit<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:30.040> misalignment<00:03:31.040> of<00:03:31.129> his<00:03:31.310> sacral<00:03:31.760> and

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
bit of a misalignment of his sacral and

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.440 
bit of a misalignment of his sacral and
lumbar<00:03:33.140> area<00:03:33.349> so<00:03:33.860> I<00:03:34.160> was<00:03:34.790> very<00:03:34.940> lucky<00:03:35.120> because

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
lumbar area so I was very lucky because

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.589 
lumbar area so I was very lucky because
our<00:03:36.040> chiropractor<00:03:37.040> friend<00:03:37.310> was<00:03:37.910> visiting<00:03:38.390> or

our chiropractor friend was visiting or

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.180 
our chiropractor friend was visiting or

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
spending some time with us you can see

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.759 
spending some time with us you can see
this<00:03:40.310> moment<00:03:40.730> here<00:03:40.940> I'm<00:03:41.329> going<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.319> show<00:03:42.560> this

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
this moment here I'm going to show this

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.619 
this moment here I'm going to show this
moment<00:03:43.190> in<00:03:43.340> slow<00:03:43.609> motion<00:03:43.849> so<00:03:44.060> you<00:03:44.209> can<00:03:44.420> see

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
moment in slow motion so you can see

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:45.460 
moment in slow motion so you can see
what<00:03:44.780> happens

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
what happens

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.920 
what happens
and<00:03:45.560> it's<00:03:45.829> a<00:03:45.920> good<00:03:46.099> example<00:03:46.209> how<00:03:47.209> important<00:03:47.780> is

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
and it's a good example how important is

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.020 
and it's a good example how important is
that<00:03:48.260> she<00:03:48.440> supervised<00:03:48.920> your<00:03:49.220> dog<00:03:49.430> because<00:03:49.879> you

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
that she supervised your dog because you

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.589 
that she supervised your dog because you
can<00:03:50.180> see<00:03:50.390> that<00:03:50.599> Skye's<00:03:51.349> back<00:03:51.650> just<00:03:51.980> sinks

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
can see that Skye's back just sinks

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.470 
can see that Skye's back just sinks
really<00:03:53.599> done<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.280> this<00:03:55.280> is<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.489> really<00:03:56.239> serious

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
really done and this is a really serious

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.380 
really done and this is a really serious
moment<00:03:57.140> for<00:03:57.950> injuries<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.579> serious<00:03:58.970> injuries

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
moment for injuries and serious injuries

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.119 
moment for injuries and serious injuries
that<00:03:59.599> will<00:03:59.780> be<00:03:59.930> long<00:04:00.109> lasting<00:04:00.319> can<00:04:00.769> actually

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
that will be long lasting can actually

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.640 
that will be long lasting can actually
happen<00:04:01.629> if<00:04:02.629> you<00:04:02.840> see<00:04:03.049> something<00:04:03.410> like<00:04:03.440> this

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
happen if you see something like this
