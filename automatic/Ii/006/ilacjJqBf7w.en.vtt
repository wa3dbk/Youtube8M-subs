00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:09.000
We will build a flute. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Actually, it's an oboe with a double reed. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Normally it's made of wood,  

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but we will make it from plastic.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We'll use a simple drinking straw.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Now we make seven holes.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Squeeze.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The dots are important to have a straight line.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
That's it.
