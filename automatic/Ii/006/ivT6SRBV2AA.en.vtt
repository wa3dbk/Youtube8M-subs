hey<00:00:07.270> this<00:00:07.479> is<00:00:07.569> diamond<00:00:07.870> driver<00:00:08.050> all<00:00:08.680> right<00:00:08.950> now

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
hey this is diamond driver all right now

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.180 
hey this is diamond driver all right now
I<00:00:10.210> got<00:00:10.809> the<00:00:10.930> other<00:00:11.049> side<00:00:11.350> covered<00:00:11.920> with<00:00:12.100> the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:38.409 
looking at here ok here is the Airbus

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:43.380 
looking at here ok here is the Airbus
a300<00:00:39.040> model<00:00:39.809> you're<00:00:40.809> looking<00:00:41.470> at<00:00:42.390> something

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
a300 model you're looking at something

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.719 
a300 model you're looking at something
like<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:44.680> that<00:00:45.299> that<00:00:46.299> makes<00:00:46.510> any<00:00:46.690> sense

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:47.729 
like like that that makes any sense

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:52.170 
like like that that makes any sense
that's<00:00:48.729> that<00:00:49.030> portion<00:00:49.629> of<00:00:49.720> the<00:00:49.809> fuselage<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
that's that portion of the fuselage and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.619 
that's that portion of the fuselage and
then<00:00:52.330> I'm<00:00:52.420> add<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.930> nose<00:00:53.970> and<00:00:54.970> then<00:00:55.330> the<00:00:55.420> tail

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
then I'm add the nose and then the tail

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.149 
then I'm add the nose and then the tail
portion<00:00:55.839> that's<00:00:56.199> going<00:00:56.379> to<00:00:56.440> be<00:00:56.530> solid<00:00:56.769> foam

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
portion that's going to be solid foam

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.189 
portion that's going to be solid foam
carved<00:00:57.790> and<00:00:58.000> hollowed<00:00:58.540> out<00:00:58.690> and<00:00:58.750> everything

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
carved and hollowed out and everything

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.289 
carved and hollowed out and everything
then<00:00:59.920> I'm<00:01:00.040> build<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.400> wings<00:01:00.610> and<00:01:01.030> then<00:01:01.150> the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
then I'm build the wings and then the

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:04.140 
then I'm build the wings and then the
stabilizer<00:01:02.080> and<00:01:02.260> the<00:01:02.379> rudder<00:01:02.619> the<00:01:03.339> tail<00:01:03.580> add

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
stabilizer and the rudder the tail add

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.410 
stabilizer and the rudder the tail add
the<00:01:04.900> engines<00:01:05.350> all<00:01:05.530> that<00:01:05.680> good<00:01:05.920> fun<00:01:06.130> stuff<00:01:06.570> so

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the engines all that good fun stuff so

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.310 
the engines all that good fun stuff so
that's<00:01:10.420> what<00:01:10.600> you're<00:01:10.720> looking<00:01:10.750> at<00:01:11.020> here<00:01:11.080> and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
that's what you're looking at here and

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.410 
that's what you're looking at here and
then<00:01:11.470> they'll<00:01:11.650> be<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.920> bottom<00:01:12.250> section<00:01:13.060> now

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
then they'll be the bottom section now

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.840 
then they'll be the bottom section now
this<00:01:13.540> is<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.750> forward<00:01:14.520> section<00:01:15.520> of<00:01:15.790> the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
this is the forward section of the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.540 
this is the forward section of the
fuselage<00:01:16.240> here<00:01:16.800> right<00:01:17.800> up<00:01:17.920> in<00:01:18.040> here<00:01:18.250> this<00:01:18.430> is

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
where maybe a battery compartment might

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.360 
where maybe a battery compartment might
be<00:01:20.500> or<00:01:20.800> something<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.860> know<00:01:23.950> I<00:01:23.980> wrap<00:01:24.220> that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
around with depron as well but I put

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.040 
around with depron as well but I put
fiberglass<00:01:28.090> tape<00:01:28.720> on<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.650> bottom<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:32.020> a

demon ironworks and make
make<00:02:15.590> my<00:02:15.739> planes<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.190> tough<00:02:17.000> as<00:02:17.150> possible<00:02:17.690> but

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
make my planes is tough as possible but

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.160 
make my planes is tough as possible but
being<00:02:18.080> as<00:02:18.230> light<00:02:18.440> as<00:02:18.620> possible<00:02:19.569> so<00:02:23.170> that's

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
being as light as possible so that's

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.420 
being as light as possible so that's
what<00:02:24.319> we<00:02:24.440> got<00:02:25.900> more<00:02:26.900> more<00:02:27.709> progress<00:02:28.160> on<00:02:28.310> the
