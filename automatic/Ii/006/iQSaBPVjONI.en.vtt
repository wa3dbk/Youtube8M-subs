 video we will show you the tutorial for 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.280
 be able to root samsung galaxy phone 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.960
 6 version gt 58 32 are compatible between 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.969
 yes and well, the truth is they are not going to 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.260
 require many things only 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.699
 we will need to download the file 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.890
 that I will leave you in the description of 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.050
 video and proceed with the tutorial that 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.790
 let's show then good what 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.559
 first we need will be a 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.839
 Once the downloaded file is going to be 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.280
 pass it to the root of the sd card to what 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.800
 I mean with the root of the sd card 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.110
 that is, they do not put it to any 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.689
 folder will be copied as is in the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.309
 sd well without any folder and good 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:06.110
 I want to emphasize that this file must be 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.670
 to pass the sd card without 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.560
 unzip it or it will happen in 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.100
 points and to be able to carry out the process 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.479
 without any problem and well I want to do 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.030
 emphasis first for those who do not 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.880
 they know that the root is the root itself 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.680
 this release and total control of 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.049
 your mobile this is going to allow you 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.430
 modify it and be able to access any 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.619
 part you want to see from your device 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.570
 is to give you total freedom of power 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.490
 modify your phone the way you 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.450
 you want and good to do the routing in everything 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.610
 terminals 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.590
 widely by the different ranges of 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.939
 android and good if we still did not have 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.130
 I invite you to do so because 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.509
 then you will not regret 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.670
 but good to start with the tutorial 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.890
 of the root we will proceed once with the 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.079
 file a sd card we proceed to 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.390
 turn off the device and let's 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.920
 learn it in recovery mode for 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.899
 turn on to recovery mode is needed 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.229
 only a combination of the keys 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.729
 which are volume plus the power button 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.759
 and the home button at the same time 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.860
 approximately 4 or 5 seconds up 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.659
 it shows the galaxy screen and 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.340
 turn off at the moment the screen 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.229
 turn off let's let go of our 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.810
 buttons and wait for mode to enter 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.640
 recovery there and let go and we hope 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.410
 to enter recovery only to 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.900
 start again but now we are going to 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.150
 enter the recovery mode 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.980
 there's that recovery mode that brings 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.930
 defect then once in mode 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.549
 We are going to select the second one 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.409
 option remember that in this modality 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.209
 we move with the keys of 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.459
 volume more and less and we select with 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.079
 the good home button already once here 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.329
 we select the second option that says 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.189
 to plus from stickers and select 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.689
 with the home button here is going to 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.030
 send to our card files 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.549
 sd and we look where we have already put the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.069
 file is ginger root me in my case what 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.390
 I have here and we select it there 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.000
 we can see that the process lasts 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.379
 about a second or two and a 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.909
 Once it is completed we select the 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.270
 first option that says reboot system 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.190
 now 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.750
 already with select we only have left 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.680
 wait for the device to boot 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.600
 as it tends to start normally and good 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.030
 while he starts I talk a little 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.130
 what they can do with root 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.350
 if they can do too many things this 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.970
 I would never finish saying them but then what 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.530
 more important is that they can eliminate 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.140
 the applications that do not work 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.050
 can install different roms can 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.450
 change kernel can modify the 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.530
 phone with different modules that already 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.080
 there are currently many applications 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.250
 that allow you to do that and then the 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.050
 most of the applications that 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.300
 they really serve you to be able to manipulate 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.770
 your android require root and then as 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.780
 they could see the process to do the 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.120
 routing was really simple do not take them 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.950
 a lot of time and then they can do it in 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.720
 the comfort of your home without risk 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.060
 any of your phone breaking down 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.890
 and well, this was all in the 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.410
 tutorial how could they see the routing was 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.180
 pretty simple and once you're 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.400
 full this we can see that it started 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.470
 the phone and we will check that the 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.110
 routing has been carried out successfully through 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.850
 the application drawer we are going to look for 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.069
 an application that should have 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.650
 installed that is called superuser 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.569
 to certify and will verify that the 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.859
 phone is already rooted and we can 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.170
 start enjoying the benefits 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.700
 of the router and well this was the video by 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.889
