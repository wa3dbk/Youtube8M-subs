00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.920
 loved ones of internets who 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.150
 accompany and kadeer show are you 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.589
 this is renato 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.490
 we will complement a little 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.570
 that video that we did a 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.809
 framing right 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.019
 talking about what the fucking trash is 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.019
 That 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.900
 But Chin is talking, is not that it? 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.690
 car is about the dramatic axis 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.559
 also called the 180graus rule 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.920
 certainly what you create an axis of 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.470
 behind 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.210
 This is to make clear the difference 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.890
 axis division what happens is that I go 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.989
 telling the farm makes a division that 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.650
 which is where it is pointing out that it has a 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.910
 axis 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.820
 this is not the case is a dramatic axis 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.620
 it would be what it is if you have two 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.030
 talking characters you have a 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.670
 interaction between them 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.750
 is this interaction between them form the 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.460
 axis 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.330
 For example, my mother was talking here. 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.000
 we have a niche in this axis the important thing is 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.070
 the viewer feel inside're 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.600
 ie is the Spanish risk is within 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.659
 You can not leave that place. 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.880
 It's because there can be no place to found 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.950
 head that gets very strange 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.790
 Are we going to make some examples and 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.790
 show you 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.240
 As we speak you have 180 degrees to 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.149
 to cover this interaction with 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.899
 cameras are not very good examples to speak 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.310
 huh 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.390
 let's talk for example is a movie 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.259
 war there're the army everywhere 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.899
 right 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.369
 Army B is on the left side and the 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.280
 Army is often all through 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.769
 similar is this imagina that the camera she 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.420
 have to stand on one side and schumann 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.580
 a queue of computer viewers 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.890
 looking yes but still had another camera 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.069
 on the other side but it is situate that was in the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.019
 right side it will stay in the eye 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.579
 I was in the final breath of 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.950
 how did they do so 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.680
 to do that, and to the army which 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.230
 is killing who is there is confused 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.390
 another cool example and that you already 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.260
 could perceive the transmission of the game 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.610
 football 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.489
 as you have seen tradition is always 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.530
 made of an isolated act can only be 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.370
 Imagine divided the bleachers of a 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.590
 side is and the team is always at night to generate 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.230
 on the black cell phone to the exchange interval 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.209
 exactly and yet you've heard of 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.190
 capital inverted camera 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.109
 even when it shows you have to put 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.540
 have written that it's inverted you know 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.549
 that was not the goal did not change the second 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.560
 long for another would be hostile 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.720
 corinthians even here on this 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.000
 time when show that a fun and 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.530
 free from that certain but you will know 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.480
 than an inverted camera and were not 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.920
 Happy and slept and woke up yesterday. 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.109
 first happened 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.109
 therefore speak also that this is so 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:19.840
 one rule is that like all other 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:23.200
 rules they do not necessarily need 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.090
 to be followed depends on the 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.549
 intention of what you are wanting 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.470
 pass the viewer will you 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.510
 confuses the viewer you can 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.280
 really worth is a way it's got 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.549
 several movies I think in the taxi driver 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.920
 have tem have a scene so are you can 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.319
 use a language too but it has 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.780
 to be inserted within a context 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.329
 normal conversation between character and 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.919
 This is strange, I imagine a movie. 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.889
 all the little square everything was a tactic 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:53.410
 square and suddenly breaks the 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.810
 There's something strange about a character. 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.970
 which for example has 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.040
 the double identity is no longer so 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.470
 Strange you understand that you are 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.380
 talking to himself goes to the 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.480
 Record dvd from the right band and I did not use it 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.620
 none and if there why even because it does not give 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.540
 To use, do not 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.099
 yes, when are you going to have some? 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.959
 events such as a show that is 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.970
 The more complicated you keep a month to 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.549
 to start today from the brand formed as the 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.530
 between the band and the public said 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.680
 the vocalista vieira by guitarist and the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.590
 guitar solista west changed delay is 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.389
 an interaction guitarist vocalist is in 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.680
 otherwise it will put all the 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.229
 single-sided cameras 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.020
 only on the right side of the owner's 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.030
 Theater is does not make sense but you can 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.100
 take some care in editing you do not 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.070
 will break the shaft in the face for example 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.690
 Are you there with the singer looking at the 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.660
 right and left and cut the image of the 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.540
 growth of the refereeing team 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.000
 So you're more expensive and if that breaks 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.250
 of exu showing between one thing and another 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.860
 battery is open public thing 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.750
 vote for the lead singer on the other side there you 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.750
 thing happens and everything is okay 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.220
 You and I keep this marriage. 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.350
 enchantment per year of marriage is the 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.910
 largest source of income in the world 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.250
 I think you do not even know each other. 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.750
 worry about that you'll go there and port 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.310
 Rich is the good. 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.680
 It's important to worry because you have 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.330
 some images that look really weird 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.060
 and especially not to vote on the left 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.090
 to the right and yes a problem is the 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.590
 next is in the wedding area I 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.010
 I know that people are very dependent on 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.360
 bids is not and not the whole freelancer 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.760
 first has a lot is starting to 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.680
 understand how this works. 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.900
 axis and remaining on this axis does not 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.510
 wanting so catch our valley for 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.950
 right to get the ring this happens 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.770
 We know, but we have to take a 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.400
 greater care and train its pilots not 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.110
 just charge them the biggest tip I think 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.600
 that we can give what is the law and 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.710
 he loses right 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:56.880
 and you study is studio and trainee is 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:00.120
 Catch a day, I have to study alone. 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.880
 the niche trying to do just filminhos 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.270
 I leave to see how to do 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.040
 movies only with 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.200
 the framework that I want to do is very 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.420
 important to study or do the thing 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.850
 To study a movie, take a video of 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.460
 someone you admire and start to 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.560
 to repair the service broke the shaft will be 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.050
 It's cool where later write look me 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.420
 being here because it is also a way of 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.560
 to study for break of fast or axis of the 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.480
 brand name 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.250
 Good, this is what I hope you have. 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.900
 understood if you did not understand 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.280
 comment below we try 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.010
 explain better not 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.780
 and then explain to understand that you 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.330
 huh 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.100
 But this does not stop studying 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.140
 If you liked this video you can give 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.300
 Like you do not like bundesliga and 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.040
 Short page on facebook has coffee with 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.710
 renner twitter 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.600
 You have to cadet on YouTube, you can too. 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.970
 sign up for our video analyst 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.890
 old we have dozens of videos there 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.810
 there are also still very much seen if you 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.730
 did not see so there's a lot of cool stuff 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.660
 And hey, we wanted to do another one. 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:04.290
 thing already did and will not repeat and right until 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.290
 the next video
