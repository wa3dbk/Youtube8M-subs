00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.260
 welcome to more than world flash class 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.130
 good on this occasion be account is a 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:21.220
 good booty of 400,000 gold and 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.619
 almost 400,000 good leasing 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.680
 what happened to this you go tovar you want 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.050
 you leave this village like this to make guardianship 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.340
 you think you think about it a lot because 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.840
 you know it 's a village that you have to 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.320
 attack yes or yes or you can not 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.000
 to lose 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.310
 it is quite a resource that is there in 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.350
 pitifully mine is up inside 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.060
 then it's the problem when you were 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.370
 tovar you want whenever there will be a 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.110
 little armies believe me if you 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.690
 you carry a few giants 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.570
 how many walls break these villages are going to 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.340
 be super easy then if in this 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.430
 case by manu laure base practically 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.640
 all the gold left almost all the elixir 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.160
 dark there I leave without touching the elixir and 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.590
 well before, it really did not matter 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.280
 so many you just carried the gold and already 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.290
 but now that you can improve with 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.780
 elixir the wall is quite important 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.400
 apart also in the ix in the elixir 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.740
 well now since that update 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.180
 I change quite a bit in what would be the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.670
 economy is worth the election 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.750
 it is practically worth almost the same as 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.150
 the gold but good is quite complicated 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.540
 already at this point that you say good what 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.890
 I'm going to do, I'm not going to be able to take that 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.400
 elixir let alone the dark liquid 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.340
 which is already saying in there I touch me 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.690
 I'm with you then it 's pretty 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.940
 important also from time to time 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.510
 vary a bit the troops the army 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.250
 van is good but I really never 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.440
 use the dark elixir for me the 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.750
 dark elixir is is untouchable 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.100
 I do not touch it at all then it 's 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.020
 question that you also think 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.400
 vary a little the armies and 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.460
 also carry other types of armies 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.880
 so as not to waste resources like 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.070
 these is more than just a title more than 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.270
 all a reflection for you so that 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.100
 they can also vary a little 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.670
 armies so that if you touch something like 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.360
 this good not only for a next 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.040
 opportunity 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.080
 that nothing after liked the video 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.760
 I hope this has served you a little 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.110
 of experience to go always go 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.560
 little armies no more to next 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.560
 bye
