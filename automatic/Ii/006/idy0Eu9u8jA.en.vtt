to<00:00:27.869> save<00:00:28.080> money<00:00:28.109> with<00:00:28.410> your<00:00:28.619> computer<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.250> not

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
to save money with your computer is not

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.870 
to save money with your computer is not
using<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.470> yeah<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.679> something<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.759> to

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
using it yeah it's something you have to

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.990 
using it yeah it's something you have to
consider<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.660> are<00:00:33.899> using<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.790> may

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
consider but if you are using it you may

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.880 
consider but if you are using it you may
not<00:00:36.390> want<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.930> use<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.350> its<00:00:37.469> fullest

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
not want to use it to its fullest

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.569 
not want to use it to its fullest
potential<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:40.410> know<00:00:40.530> certainly<00:00:41.100> notebook

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
potential so you know certainly notebook

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.310 
potential so you know certainly notebook
computers<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> one<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.540> sitting<00:00:43.079> in

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
computers like the one I have sitting in

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.869 
computers like the one I have sitting in
front<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.160> me<00:00:44.570> have<00:00:45.570> certain<00:00:46.460> features<00:00:47.460> which

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
front of me have certain features which

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.170 
front of me have certain features which
can<00:00:48.270> keep<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.260> processor<00:00:49.890> running<00:00:50.100> cool<00:00:50.789> and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
can keep the processor running cool and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.959 
can keep the processor running cool and
clean<00:00:51.690> unless<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.289> needs<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.860> run<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.789> full

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
clean unless it needs to run at full

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.850 
clean unless it needs to run at full
power<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.480> if<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.809> starting<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.260> process

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
power like if I was starting to process

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.770 
power like if I was starting to process
video<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.910> particular<00:00:57.090> computer<00:00:57.539> doing

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
video on this particular computer doing

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.209 
video on this particular computer doing
something<00:00:58.109> very<00:00:58.140> processor<00:00:58.739> intensive<00:00:58.949> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
something very processor intensive it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.610 
something very processor intensive it
would<00:00:59.370> take<00:00:59.520> up<00:00:59.670> more<00:01:00.149> energy<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.750> likewise

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
would take up more energy and likewise

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.820 
would take up more energy and likewise
more<00:01:01.890> energy<00:01:02.280> would<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:03.180> used<00:01:03.809> kind<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
more energy would that be used kind of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.020 
more energy would that be used kind of
goes<00:01:05.100> without<00:01:05.220> saying<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.909> this

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
goes without saying that in this

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.330 
goes without saying that in this
particular<00:01:06.680> notebook<00:01:07.680> computer<00:01:07.979> also<00:01:08.130> has

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
particular notebook computer also has

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520 
particular notebook computer also has
the<00:01:08.490> ability<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:09.030> graphics<00:01:09.540> switching

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the ability to do graphics switching

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.350 
the ability to do graphics switching
discreetly<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> uses<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
discreetly so it uses it like a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.480 
discreetly so it uses it like a
low-power<00:01:12.810> graphics<00:01:13.590> chip<00:01:14.189> processor<00:01:15.380> thing

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
low-power graphics chip processor thing

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.830 
low-power graphics chip processor thing
when<00:01:17.490> I'm<00:01:17.759> not<00:01:17.970> really<00:01:18.119> doing<00:01:18.330> much<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
when I'm not really doing much with it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.210 
when I'm not really doing much with it
because<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.350> right<00:01:19.650> now<00:01:19.740> I'm<00:01:19.890> looking<00:01:19.979> at<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
because like right now I'm looking at a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.490 
because like right now I'm looking at a
web<00:01:20.369> page<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:21.210> really<00:01:21.509> process<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.080> intensive

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
web page not really process or intensive

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.929 
web page not really process or intensive
so<00:01:22.920> certainly<00:01:23.220> keeping<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.580> mind<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.790> things

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
so certainly keeping in mind the things

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.399 
so certainly keeping in mind the things
that<00:01:24.119> you're<00:01:24.210> doing<00:01:24.270> could<00:01:24.869> actually<00:01:25.020> save

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
that you're doing could actually save

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.310 
that you're doing could actually save
you<00:01:25.590> money<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:26.580> you're<00:01:26.850> not<00:01:27.060> working<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:28.170> your

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
you money if you're not working at your

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.710 
you money if you're not working at your
computer<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.799> an<00:01:28.890> extended<00:01:29.220> period<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.549> time

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
computer for an extended period of time

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.300 
computer for an extended period of time
you<00:01:30.720> could<00:01:30.960> certainly<00:01:31.470> run<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> screensaver

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you could certainly run a screensaver

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.780 
you could certainly run a screensaver
that<00:01:32.520> does<00:01:33.150> take<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:33.479> cpu<00:01:34.189> in<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.520> know<00:01:35.610> any

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
that does take up cpu in you know any

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.090 
that does take up cpu in you know any
time<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.119> use<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.630> processor<00:01:37.259> you're<00:01:37.500> using

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
time you use the processor you're using

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.190 
time you use the processor you're using
energy<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.790> that's<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.299> cost<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.689> so

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
energy and that's going to cost you so

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.450 
energy and that's going to cost you so
if<00:01:40.320> you're<00:01:40.439> going<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:40.829> up<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.250> while

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
if you're going to get up for a while

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.700 
if you're going to get up for a while
you<00:01:42.390> may<00:01:42.509> actually<00:01:42.720> consider<00:01:43.200> turning<00:01:43.470> off

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
you may actually consider turning off

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.370 
you may actually consider turning off
your<00:01:44.220> screen<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.750> save<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.350> money

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
your screen that can save you money

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.289 
your screen that can save you money
without<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.189> turning<00:01:47.399> off<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.700> computer<00:01:47.909> of

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
without you turning off the computer of

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.090 
without you turning off the computer of
course<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.689> next<00:01:48.930> step<00:01:49.140> would<00:01:49.320> then<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:49.770> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
course the next step would then be you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.560 
course the next step would then be you
know<00:01:50.220> logging<00:01:50.520> out<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.909> computer<00:01:51.060> putting

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
know logging out of the computer putting
