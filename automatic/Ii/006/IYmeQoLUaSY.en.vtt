00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.240
 ok this is a hybrid vehicle is the 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:09.680
 second hybrid that toyota introduces into 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.900
 the Peruvian market the first was the 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.519
 prius and this is another vehicle of the 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.520
 prius family prius 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.230
 it's a car that has two engines a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.050
 electric motor and a fuel engine 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.910
 gasoline and he has a computer 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.829
 that commands both engines is the one 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.660
 determines which of them should enter 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.340
 operation and when it 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.960
 interesting about this car is that when 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.850
 one starts the car always starts in 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.570
 electric mode and according one goes 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.430
 accelerating and you need more power or 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.530
 highest final speed between 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.480
 running the gasoline engine that 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.219
 attends the electric motor and gives the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.739
 final power or the speed that 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.480
 you need the car is a car that generates 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.820
 for its vehicle characteristics 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.250
 Hybrid 50% less co2 emissions 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.410
 that a normal vehicle of the mechanical or 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.239
 conventional of the same size and has a 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.950
 extraordinary performance that could 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.480
 arrive according to the conditions of 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.239
 management and the terrain there is a series of 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.700
 additional characteristics of the environment 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.840
 could reach up to 133 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.840
 kilometers per gallon 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.180
 good is a vehicle that by 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.280
 features can actually get 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.690
 to different segments in a design of a 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.040
 hardware vehicle that is preferred by 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.230
 the young audience could reach a 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.120
 young segment but the improvements in the 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.490
 hybrid system make it have greater 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.200
 space with which the trunk space 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.820
 It's big enough for a 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.540
 family vehicle a small family 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.740
 has enough benefits for 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.050
 that both young and not so young 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.780
 can enjoy the comfort car of 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.310
 the security they offer we see that it is a 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.020
 funny vehicle that is a vehicle 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.990
 that has a latest technology 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.640
 generation has the last elements 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.610
 in terms of connectivity to 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.259
 powerful radio safety airbags 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.759
 to trained assistance systems 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.320
 guidance assistance system that what 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.430
 we make very complete car then 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.960
 We believe that we can fill the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.950
 expectations of different profiles of 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.950
 client with this model 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.660
 the vehicle is already on sale 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.060
 you can ask for him in all the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.069
 toyota dealer network but 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.530
 We hope to have a sales volume of 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.340
 around 100 units a year 120 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.760
 units per year 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.620
 price 26 thousand 800 dollars 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.260
 unlike the prius that had a 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.150
 price a little more higher this is a 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.560
 car that we believe will be much more 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.000
 accessible to be able to have a greater 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.000
 acceptance by the Peruvian market 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.600
 the average a person in Peru in 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.970
 average because it travels around 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.950
 20,000 kilometers a year you're not 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.750
 talking about that with this car can 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.370
 get to have a performance of 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.760
 approximately three times what 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.770
 you have with a normal vehicle with a 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.900
 engine more or less the same size 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.120
 they would be spending a third of what 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.050
 that you spend today on fuel 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.050
 with their own 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.920
 s 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.040
 2263 km 1960 and 2.8 to be more precise 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.260
 and the car is still marching like this 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.290
 that we have to return to peru gentlemen 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.300
 the country is over and we have to follow me 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.380
 the challenge still does not end we have 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.370
 battery charge 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.620
 despite the fact that the light of 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.490
 fuel there we go there we go we continue 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.490
 we have to go back
