too<00:00:38.579> much<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.760> its<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> new<00:00:39.360> maps<00:00:39.570> that

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
too much of its one of the new maps that

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.190 
too much of its one of the new maps that

not<00:00:43.290> beta<00:00:43.620> maps<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:44.070> steps<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.410> all<00:00:46.410> those

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
not beta maps like steps and all those

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.350 
not beta maps like steps and all those
blistering<00:00:47.219> sands<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.610> metal<00:00:47.910> oculus<00:00:48.239> and

all those math we see over and over and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.660 
all those math we see over and over and
over<00:00:49.590> again<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.039> an<00:00:50.100> interesting<00:00:50.219> map

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
over again so it's an interesting map

over again so it's an interesting map
you've<00:00:50.820> got<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.140> think<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> nice

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
you've got I like to think it's a nice

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.590 
you've got I like to think it's a nice
clean<00:00:53.039> map<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.730> got<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.000> nice<00:00:54.180> open

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
clean map it's got this nice open

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.119 
clean map it's got this nice open
expansion<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.230> right<00:00:55.469> off<00:00:55.620> your<00:00:55.770> ramp<00:00:55.980> it's

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
expansion it's right off your ramp it's

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.069 
expansion it's right off your ramp it's
on<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> way<00:00:56.610> from<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.629> base<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.050> the

on the way from your base to the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.170 
on the way from your base to the
opponent<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.770> you've<00:00:59.160> got<00:00:59.250> these<00:00:59.430> obvious

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.039 
bit of a nuisance for terran is this
second<00:01:32.700> ramp<00:01:32.909> coming<00:01:33.420> into<00:01:33.659> your<00:01:33.720> expansion

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
second ramp coming into your expansion

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.380 
second ramp coming into your expansion
but<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.439> has<00:01:34.619> got<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.270> destructible<00:01:36.270> rocks

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
but this has got the destructible rocks

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.999 
but this has got the destructible rocks
on<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.750> back<00:01:36.900> side<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.320> that's<00:01:37.470> kind<00:01:37.979> of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
on the back side so that's kind of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.350 
on the back side so that's kind of
protected<00:01:38.400> they've<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.670> changes<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
protected they've just changes the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.330 
protected they've just changes the
dynamic<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.900> bit<00:01:40.350> makes<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> little<00:01:41.100> bit<00:01:41.250> more

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
dynamic a bit makes it a little bit more

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.219 
dynamic a bit makes it a little bit more
interesting<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.030> yeah<00:01:42.509> really<00:01:42.720> excited<00:01:43.140> about

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
interesting so yeah really excited about

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.859 
interesting so yeah really excited about
this<00:01:43.380> matchup<00:01:43.619> because<00:01:43.799> kjh<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.689> if

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
this matchup because kjh is one of if

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
this matchup because kjh is one of if
not<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.110> best<00:01:46.290> ten<00:01:46.740> players<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.189> Australia

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
not the best ten players in Australia

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.700 
not the best ten players in Australia
and<00:01:47.610> pinder<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.210> right<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:48.899> there<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.380> kem

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
and pinder is right up there with as kem

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.859 
and pinder is right up there with as kem
saying<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> best<00:01:51.240> Protoss<00:01:51.720> in

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
saying one of the best Protoss in

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.300 
saying one of the best Protoss in
Australia<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.200> yeah<00:01:52.409> big<00:01:52.710> matchup<00:01:53.070> been

Australia so yeah big matchup been
looking<00:01:53.640> forward<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.990> map<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.229> also

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
looking forward to it this map is also

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.679 
looking forward to it this map is also
green<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.460> point<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.820> an<00:01:56.939> obvious<00:01:57.450> thing

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
green just to point out an obvious thing

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.209 
green just to point out an obvious thing
I'm<00:01:57.930> very<00:01:58.170> happy<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.439> see<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.680> different

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
I'm very happy to see a different

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.999 
I'm very happy to see a different
colored<00:01:59.729> map<00:01:59.880> too<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.479> that's<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.560> small<00:02:01.799> thing

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
colored map too so that's a small thing

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.219 
colored map too so that's a small thing
for<00:02:02.189> me<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.640> see<00:02:02.850> all<00:02:03.240> these<00:02:03.570> new<00:02:03.780> maps<00:02:03.960> in

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
for me just to see all these new maps in

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.380 
for me just to see all these new maps in
the<00:02:04.320> beta<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> very<00:02:05.640> standard<00:02:05.880> thing<00:02:06.210> so

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the beta but a very standard thing so

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.540 
the beta but a very standard thing so
far<00:02:06.630> there's<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.079> marine<00:02:07.469> coming<00:02:07.829> out<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.250> there

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
far there's a marine coming out so there

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.130 
far there's a marine coming out so there
you<00:02:08.640> go<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.390> probe<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.810> not<00:02:09.959> going<00:02:10.080> to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you go this this probe is not going to

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.880 
you go this this probe is not going to
have<00:02:10.259> much<00:02:10.410> more<00:02:10.470> scouting<00:02:11.420> so<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.810> farts

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
have much more scouting so so farts

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.580 
have much more scouting so so farts
just<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.370> gateway<00:02:15.090> into<00:02:15.420> cybernetics<00:02:15.990> core<00:02:16.290> so

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
just a gateway into cybernetics core so

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.800 
just a gateway into cybernetics core so
nothing<00:02:16.950> too<00:02:17.130> crazy<00:02:17.370> kjh<00:02:18.209> finding<00:02:18.630> all<00:02:18.720> this

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
nothing too crazy kjh finding all this

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.860 
nothing too crazy kjh finding all this
out<00:02:18.990> with<00:02:19.170> his<00:02:19.410> SCV<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.280> they<00:02:21.209> both<00:02:21.360> know<00:02:21.660> that

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
out with his SCV so they both know that

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.110 
out with his SCV so they both know that
there's<00:02:21.990> nothing<00:02:22.350> too<00:02:22.530> crazy<00:02:23.010> no<00:02:23.670> proxy

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
there's nothing too crazy no proxy

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.040 
there's nothing too crazy no proxy
pylons<00:02:24.630> no<00:02:24.900> prob<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:26.280> directs<00:02:26.640> anywheres

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
pylons no prob that directs anywheres

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.290 
pylons no prob that directs anywheres
insane<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.410> I'll<00:02:29.190> have<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.430> sit<00:02:29.670> tired<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.150> see

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
insane so I'll have to sit tired to see

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.270 
insane so I'll have to sit tired to see
if<00:02:30.420> these<00:02:30.540> guys<00:02:30.720> have<00:02:30.959> any<00:02:31.110> crazy<00:02:31.709> strategies

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
if these guys have any crazy strategies

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.010 
if these guys have any crazy strategies
for<00:02:32.490> this<00:02:32.610> map<00:02:32.790> because<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.420> course<00:02:33.840> a

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
for this map because it is of course a

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.440 
for this map because it is of course a
new<00:02:34.140> one<00:02:34.320> yeah<00:02:34.860> good<00:02:35.340> thing<00:02:35.520> invitar<00:02:36.030> pinned<00:02:36.360> a

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
new one yeah good thing invitar pinned a

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.270 
new one yeah good thing invitar pinned a
nice<00:02:37.080> little<00:02:37.260> probe<00:02:37.530> micro<00:02:37.860> they're<00:02:38.010> keeping

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
nice little probe micro they're keeping

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.370 
nice little probe micro they're keeping
it<00:02:38.370> alive<00:02:38.480> getting<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.510> away<00:02:40.140> from<00:02:40.200> that

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
it alive getting that away from that

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.570 
it alive getting that away from that
marine<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:40.860> he<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.070> going<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.280> pick<00:02:41.400> up<00:02:41.459> the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
marine so he is going to pick up the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.800 
marine so he is going to pick up the
information<00:02:41.730> pick<00:02:42.090> up<00:02:42.209> his<00:02:42.330> tap<00:02:42.540> flakes

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
information pick up his tap flakes

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.410 
information pick up his tap flakes
somehow<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:43.980> probe<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.430> still<00:02:44.700> avoiding

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
somehow this probe is still avoiding

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.660 
somehow this probe is still avoiding
this<00:02:45.600> marine<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.260> interesting<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.250> cagey

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
this marine so interesting that cagey

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.280 
this marine so interesting that cagey
host<00:02:47.910> didn't<00:02:48.180> belong<00:02:48.360> didn't<00:02:48.750> lay<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.140> tech

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
host didn't belong didn't lay the tech

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.140 
host didn't belong didn't lay the tech
lab<00:02:49.440> going<00:02:49.620> down<00:02:49.800> on<00:02:50.040> while<00:02:50.520> he's<00:02:50.550> trying<00:02:51.030> to

lab going down on while he's trying to

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.750 
lab going down on while he's trying to
deny<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.450> scout<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.580> interested<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.640> see

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
deny the scout so interested to see

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.580 
deny the scout so interested to see
whether<00:02:54.030> he's<00:02:54.450> going<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.810> throw<00:02:55.140> down<00:02:55.320> more

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
whether he's going to throw down more

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.440 
whether he's going to throw down more
tech<00:02:55.800> after<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.640> probe<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.060> denied<00:02:57.300> because

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
tech after this probe is denied because

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.699 
tech after this probe is denied because
right<00:02:57.660> now<00:02:57.690> pinner<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.080> picking<00:02:58.320> up<00:02:58.440> all<00:02:58.590> this

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
right now pinner is picking up all this

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.070 
right now pinner is picking up all this
information<00:02:58.920> meanwhile<00:02:59.850> Koh<00:03:00.600> is<00:03:00.750> doing<00:03:00.989> the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
information meanwhile Koh is doing the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.900 
information meanwhile Koh is doing the
same<00:03:01.260> just<00:03:01.530> being<00:03:02.100> chased<00:03:02.340> around<00:03:02.459> by<00:03:02.610> as<00:03:02.730> you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
same just being chased around by as you

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.280 
same just being chased around by as you
like<00:03:03.030> it's<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.450> little<00:03:03.540> bit<00:03:03.750> harder<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.019> deny

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
like it's a little bit harder to deny

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.750 
like it's a little bit harder to deny
until<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.800> stalker<00:03:05.040> comes<00:03:05.310> out<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:05.640> we've

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
until this stalker comes out and we've

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
little bit of mineral saved up here so

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.420

he's<00:03:30.870> nudging<00:03:31.079> up<00:03:31.320> against<00:03:31.650> minerals<00:03:32.220> just

pumping<00:03:33.030> out<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.150> few<00:03:33.390> stalkers<00:03:33.720> here<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.140> he

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
pumping out a few stalkers here so he

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.259 
pumping out a few stalkers here so he
may<00:03:34.410> think<00:03:34.769> about<00:03:35.070> coming<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:35.850> really<00:03:36.060> really

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
couple of more orders at the moment so

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.650

here<00:03:47.730> which<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.090> nice<00:03:48.450> feature<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.959> this<00:03:49.049> map

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.560 
here which is a nice feature of this map
and<00:03:49.670> looks<00:03:50.670> like<00:03:50.820> pinder<00:03:51.090> even<00:03:51.329> thinking

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
and looks like pinder even thinking

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.970 
and looks like pinder even thinking
about<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.810> same<00:03:52.019> saving<00:03:52.440> up<00:03:52.530> minerals<00:03:52.709> and

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
about the same saving up minerals and

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.830 
about the same saving up minerals and
there<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.370> nexus<00:03:53.670> going<00:03:53.940> down<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.570> both

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
there is the nexus going down so both

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.840 
there is the nexus going down so both
players<00:03:55.170> throwing<00:03:55.860> down<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.010> reasonably<00:03:56.640> fast

expansion here which is just thanks to
these<00:03:59.340> destructible<00:03:59.880> rocks<00:03:59.940> is<00:04:00.239> really

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
these destructible rocks is really

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.720 
these destructible rocks is really
really<00:04:00.720> easy<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.980> do<00:04:02.070> on<00:04:02.100> this<00:04:02.310> map<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.640> can

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
really easy to do on this map you can

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.759 
really easy to do on this map you can
defend<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.150> choke<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.780> then<00:04:03.989> you've<00:04:04.530> got<00:04:04.739> your

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
defend a choke and then you've got your

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.470 
defend a choke and then you've got your
wide<00:04:05.280> open<00:04:05.640> expansion<00:04:06.060> that's<00:04:06.269> nicely

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
wide open expansion that's nicely

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.300 
wide open expansion that's nicely
defended<00:04:07.049> unless<00:04:07.530> you're<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.680> zouk<00:04:07.890> player<00:04:08.100> and

defended unless you're a zouk player and

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.920

then<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.610> course<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:08.940> can't<00:04:09.540> defend<00:04:09.780> this

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
then of course you can't defend this

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.319 
then of course you can't defend this
ramp<00:04:10.170> as<00:04:10.320> well<00:04:10.470> but<00:04:10.920> no<00:04:11.130> looking<00:04:11.549> like<00:04:11.670> you've

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
that second was simulator pretty fast

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.080 
that second was simulator pretty fast
and<00:05:52.840> now<00:05:53.170> he's<00:05:53.350> got<00:05:53.530> for<00:05:54.400> gas<00:05:54.580> pumping<00:05:54.940> out

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
and now he's got for gas pumping out

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.210 
and now he's got for gas pumping out
which<00:05:55.300> kjh<00:05:56.260> is<00:05:56.410> a<00:05:56.440> little<00:05:56.680> bit<00:05:56.770> behind<00:05:56.890> in<00:05:57.130> the

which kjh is a little bit behind in the
gas<00:05:57.400> count<00:05:57.700> because<00:05:57.970> he's<00:05:58.140> sticking<00:05:59.140> to<00:05:59.260> this

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
gas count because he's sticking to this

he's<00:06:01.660> got<00:06:01.900> the<00:06:02.020> second<00:06:02.320> orbital<00:06:02.560> command<00:06:02.800> on

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
he's got the second orbital command on

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.050 
he's got the second orbital command on
so<00:06:03.070> he's<00:06:03.190> gonna<00:06:03.280> be<00:06:03.370> able<00:06:03.430> to<00:06:03.550> pump<00:06:03.640> out<00:06:03.790> so

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
so he's gonna be able to pump out so

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.970 
so he's gonna be able to pump out so
many<00:06:04.240> meals<00:06:04.480> and<00:06:04.810> just<00:06:05.320> looking<00:06:05.500> at<00:06:05.620> the<00:06:05.710> the
