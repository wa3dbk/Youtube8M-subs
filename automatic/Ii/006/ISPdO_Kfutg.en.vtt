aloo<00:00:24.050> here<00:00:24.949> we<00:00:25.159> have<00:00:25.369> a<00:00:25.669> loop<00:00:25.909> I<00:00:26.119> have<00:00:26.449> taken<00:00:26.720> 4

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
aloo here we have a loop I have taken 4

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.759 
aloo here we have a loop I have taken 4
medium<00:00:27.800> size<00:00:28.070> potatoes<00:00:28.489> and<00:00:29.349> cut<00:00:30.349> them<00:00:30.589> into

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
medium size potatoes and cut them into

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.930 
medium size potatoes and cut them into
rounds<00:00:31.339> the<00:00:31.909> slices<00:00:32.509> have<00:00:32.720> to<00:00:32.870> miss<00:00:33.020> very<00:00:33.500> thin

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
rounds the slices have to miss very thin

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.400 
rounds the slices have to miss very thin
so<00:00:34.940> that<00:00:35.120> when<00:00:35.330> you<00:00:35.420> cook<00:00:35.660> them<00:00:35.900> they<00:00:36.110> become

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
so that when you cook them they become

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.600 
so that when you cook them they become
crisp<00:00:36.740> up<00:00:37.480> then<00:00:38.480> I<00:00:38.690> have<00:00:39.080> foil<00:00:40.010> we<00:00:40.430> would

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
crisp up then I have foil we would

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.130 
crisp up then I have foil we would
require<00:00:40.940> roughly<00:00:41.390> about<00:00:41.480> 5<00:00:41.900> tablespoons

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
according to your taste let's get

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.970 
according to your taste let's get
started<00:01:07.640> first<00:01:08.180> I<00:01:08.450> pour<00:01:08.720> in<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:09.080> oil

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.970 

this<00:01:12.490> is<00:01:12.640> about<00:01:12.850> two<00:01:13.150> tablespoons<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.710> I<00:01:14.740> will

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
this is about two tablespoons so I will

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.320 
this is about two tablespoons so I will
add<00:01:15.130> a<00:01:15.160> little<00:01:15.520> more<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:18.580> before<00:01:18.790> putting

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
add a little more just before putting

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.470 
add a little more just before putting
the<00:01:19.690> potatoes<00:01:20.380> into<00:01:20.620> the<00:01:20.950> oil<00:01:21.190> I<00:01:21.580> will<00:01:22.270> just

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
the potatoes into the oil I will just

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.380 
the potatoes into the oil I will just
add<00:01:22.750> a<00:01:22.780> little<00:01:23.050> bit<00:01:23.260> of<00:01:23.380> salt<00:01:23.890> so<00:01:24.850> that<00:01:25.120> the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
add a little bit of salt so that the

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.130 
add a little bit of salt so that the
potatoes<00:01:25.930> don't<00:01:26.260> taste<00:01:26.530> very<00:01:26.890> bland<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.840> now<00:01:29.110> I

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
potatoes don't taste very bland so now I

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.290 
potatoes don't taste very bland so now I
wish<00:01:29.620> them<00:01:29.890> well<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:30.490> now<00:01:30.640> they<00:01:30.850> are<00:01:30.910> ready<00:01:31.030> to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
wish them well so now they are ready to

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:41.330 
wish them well so now they are ready to
go<00:01:31.450> into<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.950> bank

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.200 

so<00:01:41.790> now<00:01:41.970> since<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.479> value<00:01:43.080> is<00:01:43.229> getting<00:01:43.409> done

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
so now since the value is getting done

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.670 
so now since the value is getting done
we<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.659> bring<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> nice<00:01:46.380> golden

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
we have to bring it to a nice golden

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.039 
we have to bring it to a nice golden
brown<00:01:46.920> color<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.390> would<00:01:48.540> take<00:01:48.690> me<00:01:48.869> about

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
brown color so that would take me about

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.380 
brown color so that would take me about
seventy<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.619> ten<00:01:49.830> minutes<00:01:50.190> roughly<00:01:50.549> depending

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
seventy to ten minutes roughly depending

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.630 
seventy to ten minutes roughly depending
how<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:52.259> cut<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.710> loop<00:01:53.009> if<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.430> very

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
how you have cut the loop if it's very

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.850 
how you have cut the loop if it's very
thick<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.090> would<00:01:54.210> take<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> little<00:01:54.659> longer<00:01:54.900> but

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
thick it would take a little longer but

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.399 
thick it would take a little longer but
if<00:01:56.490> you've<00:01:56.700> cut<00:01:56.909> thin<00:01:57.180> slices<00:01:57.360> then<00:01:58.080> it<00:01:58.200> goes

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
if you've cut thin slices then it goes

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.060 
if you've cut thin slices then it goes
fast

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
fast

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.420 
fast
as<00:01:59.780> you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:00.930> see<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> potatoes<00:02:02.220> have

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
as you can see that the potatoes have

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.859 
as you can see that the potatoes have
changed<00:02:02.850> color<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:03.720> are<00:02:03.780> almost

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
changed color and they are almost

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.960 
changed color and they are almost
getting<00:02:04.380> done<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.430> see<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.729> amount

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
getting done and you can see the amount

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.690 
getting done and you can see the amount
of<00:02:06.119> oil<00:02:06.330> also<00:02:06.690> it's<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.350> little<00:02:07.649> excess<00:02:08.069> so

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
of oil also it's a little excess so

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.430 
of oil also it's a little excess so
after<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> potatoes<00:02:09.630> are<00:02:09.810> done<00:02:09.959> we<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.410> just

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
after the potatoes are done we can just

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.870 
after the potatoes are done we can just
drain<00:02:10.800> off<00:02:11.009> your<00:02:11.160> success<00:02:11.520> oil<00:02:11.760> also<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.700> now

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
drain off your success oil also so now

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.270 
drain off your success oil also so now
since<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.330> can<00:02:15.510> see<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.900> potatoes<00:02:16.440> they've

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
since you can see the potatoes they've

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.270 
since you can see the potatoes they've
become<00:02:17.459> nice<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:17.880> crispy<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.750> brown<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:20.040> now

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
become nice and crispy and brown so now

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.930 
become nice and crispy and brown so now
