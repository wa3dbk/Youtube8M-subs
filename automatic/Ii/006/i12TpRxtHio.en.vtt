00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.390
 Hello 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.580
 Yes, you understand correctly today review 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.360
 toilet paper 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.229
 well, not even a review 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:11.829
 some 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.479
 Such examples are a few ideas on 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.779
 what can be used 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.579
 first of course 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:21.679
 and just say something summer paper 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.759
 in general it is in fact quite versailles on 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.050
 hiv 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.849
 you can use it as yourself 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.919
 toilet paper can be used 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:29.320
 as 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.800
 napkins 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.200
 handkerchiefs can even 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.410
 signed contracts on paper 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.680
 is it possible to use another rite 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.780
 tasks let's say 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.580
 Well, firstly for me as a tourist here 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.070
 such is the view this toilet paper is not 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.020
 quite satisfied 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.820
 basically what we do 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.910
 take millet tired here it is 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.710
 hard in the middle 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.710
 we are left soft whether this paper 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.580
 by the way it is not necessary to buy one like this 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.580
 court can be a score of 54 meters 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.100
 at the same time from this part 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.240
 leave like this 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.799
 here it turns out something 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.460
 like these napkins icons of centuries 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.520
 acid heels center 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.820
 for this we have basically such 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.690
 rolls can not be changed 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.200
 just not much because 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.200
 then will not get 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.110
 that's how it is 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.670
 and take 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.620
 in cellophane package 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.910
 it is all a matter of a package 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.610
 we get some sort of gum or 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.430
 rope db 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.650
 read completely in its entirety 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.810
 he 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.350
 put on appearances so obey not 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.909
 especially suzuki that may also arise 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.250
 troubles pestering later 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.549
 Vysotsky case will do so to 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.980
 don't know what or not he is doing so 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.119
 everything would be fine so that it would not start 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:17.389
 experts agree that he 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.109
 how much can you force 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.029
 live 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:21.270
 basically no 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.889
 strict package 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.429
 tore her 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:26.789
 do what we have 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:27.730
 but what sh 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.989
 so many 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.879
 I think everyone understands nothing 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.209
 first of all it is used 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.999
 I have already said several functions 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:39.739
 I can not force to delete very well 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.120
 alive if you have big fat dishes then 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.479
 will collect 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.479
 Here is such a volume of toilet paper 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.449
 but you wash the whole thing 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:50.879
 fatty 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.189
 with your dishes 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.019
 and then either 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.129
 What do you think by ordinary means or 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.379
 the question is there is there last 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.009
 can i basically have a home 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.970
 on this paper was it possible 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.230
 positive under the stone or ignite 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.799
 or 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.400
 science to take with me in the bag afterwards 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.209
 thrown a day depending on 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.249
 conditions 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:16.649
 but accordingly in quality 

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:18.339
 handkerchiefs 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:20.349
 I understand how to use 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.749
 tear off 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:23.889
 one piece 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.529
 I use 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:27.819
 the only thing 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.889
 the problem is that handkerchiefs i'm not 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.799
 did a little differently them another 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.069
 structure 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.219
 fibers earlier or so simply do not tear and 

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:40.079
 she is not soaked with moisture 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.739
 made to flush the toilet and 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.579
 there quickly decompose 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.489
 but small particles 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.099
 basically 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.169
 all I wanted to say is such a small review 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.249

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:56.249

 it does not look like 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.329
 pretty handy thing 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.650
