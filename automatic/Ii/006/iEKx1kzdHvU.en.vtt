was sped up and not in great detail

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.060

just the ideas are using the same maxi
skirt<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.010> used<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.820> video<00:00:27.090> which<00:00:27.480> is

of<00:00:30.090> stretch<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.439> will<00:00:31.650> work<00:00:31.679> with

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
of stretch to it but this will work with

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.190

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.550 
material so like you saw before I tied
the<00:01:45.240> knot<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:45.750> longer<00:01:45.990> piece<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.439> material
