of<00:03:37.740> the<00:03:37.980> call<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.340> duty<00:03:38.400> world<00:03:38.700> because<00:03:39.690> i

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
of the call of duty world because i

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.880 
of the call of duty world because i
realize<00:03:40.830> i<00:03:40.950> respect<00:03:41.610> competitive<00:03:42.120> gamers<00:03:42.450> I

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
realize i respect competitive gamers I

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.830 
realize i respect competitive gamers I
know<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:44.280> it's<00:03:44.640> something<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:45.090> probably<00:03:45.450> I

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
know that it's something I probably I

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.020 
know that it's something I probably I
mean<00:03:46.020> maybe<00:03:46.170> with<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.470> lot<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.280> practice<00:03:47.820> I

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
mean maybe with a lot of practice I

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.360 
mean maybe with a lot of practice I
think<00:03:48.510> any<00:03:48.750> pub<00:03:49.050> star<00:03:49.380> because<00:03:50.220> they're

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
think any pub star because they're

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.190 
think any pub star because they're
obviously<00:03:50.670> good<00:03:50.880> at<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.090> game<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.540> mean<00:03:52.020> if<00:03:52.110> you

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
obviously good at the game I mean if you

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.800 
obviously good at the game I mean if you
can<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.920> know<00:03:52.980> even<00:03:53.700> shitting<00:03:54.240> on<00:03:54.360> noobs<00:03:54.600> like

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
can you know even shitting on noobs like

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.449 
can you know even shitting on noobs like
I<00:03:54.900> said<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:55.140> takes<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.709> certain<00:03:56.010> amount<00:03:56.190> of

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
I said it takes a certain amount of

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.370 
I said it takes a certain amount of
skill<00:03:56.640> I<00:03:56.880> think<00:03:57.510> any<00:03:57.630> pup<00:03:57.840> star<00:03:58.080> with<00:03:58.200> enough

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
skill I think any pup star with enough

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.260 
skill I think any pup star with enough
practice<00:03:58.800> could<00:03:59.100> do<00:03:59.400> well<00:03:59.610> in<00:03:59.790> competitive

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
practice could do well in competitive

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.449 
practice could do well in competitive
but<00:04:00.540> like<00:04:01.170> I<00:04:01.260> said<00:04:01.320> these<00:04:01.830> dudes<00:04:02.190> have<00:04:02.310> been

so<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.360> respect<00:04:23.140> it<00:04:23.290> I<00:04:23.410> seriously<00:04:23.860> respect

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
so I respect it I seriously respect

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.890 
so I respect it I seriously respect
competitive<00:04:24.760> gamers<00:04:25.060> it's<00:04:25.330> something<00:04:25.690> like<00:04:25.720> I

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
competitive gamers it's something like I

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.180 
competitive gamers it's something like I
could<00:04:26.230> never<00:04:26.320> do<00:04:26.500> I'd<00:04:26.590> probably<00:04:26.740> get<00:04:26.950> shit<00:04:27.160> on

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
could never do I'd probably get shit on

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.970 
could never do I'd probably get shit on
and<00:04:27.760> I<00:04:28.570> think<00:04:28.600> it's<00:04:28.900> just<00:04:28.960> I<00:04:29.320> think<00:04:29.830> they're

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
and I think it's just I think they're

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.390 
and I think it's just I think they're
separate<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:30.640> like<00:04:30.790> one<00:04:31.120> isn't<00:04:32.190> vastly<00:04:33.190> more

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
separate it like one isn't vastly more

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.590 
separate it like one isn't vastly more
impressive<00:04:33.910> than<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.090> other<00:04:34.180> they're<00:04:34.420> just

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
impressive than the other they're just

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.990 
impressive than the other they're just
they're<00:04:34.780> separate<00:04:35.320> spheres<00:04:36.100> of<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.700> call<00:04:36.880> of

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
they're separate spheres of the call of

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.600 
they're separate spheres of the call of
duty<00:04:37.240> world<00:04:37.740> competitive<00:04:38.740> gamers<00:04:39.130> they<00:04:39.430> could

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
duty world competitive gamers they could

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.100 
duty world competitive gamers they could
do<00:04:39.760> their<00:04:39.940> shit<00:04:40.180> you<00:04:40.300> know<00:04:40.390> they<00:04:40.510> can't<00:04:40.750> hop<00:04:40.900> on

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
do their shit you know they can't hop on

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.620 
do their shit you know they can't hop on
a<00:04:41.140> land<00:04:41.560> where<00:04:42.310> everybody's<00:04:42.850> you<00:04:43.180> know<00:04:43.210> fair
