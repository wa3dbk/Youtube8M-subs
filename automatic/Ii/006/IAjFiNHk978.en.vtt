the tripod which it shows on their

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.690 
the tripod which it shows on their
displays<00:01:32.990> I<00:01:33.990> kind<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.890> wish<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.579> was

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
displays I kind of wish that it was

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.679 
displays I kind of wish that it was
detachable<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:37.670> molded<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.819> the<00:01:39.209> plastic

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
detachable this is molded on the plastic

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.149 
detachable this is molded on the plastic
it's<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.289> one<00:01:40.560> piece

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
it's all one piece

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.740 
it's all one piece
you<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.789> adjust<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.299> here<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:44.239> up<00:01:45.239> and<00:01:45.569> down

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
you can adjust it here the up and down

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.740 
you can adjust it here the up and down
and<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:49.409> doesn't<00:01:49.739> go<00:01:49.909> side<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.939> side<00:01:51.360> but

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
and then it doesn't go side to side but

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.740 
and then it doesn't go side to side but
I<00:01:52.130> guess<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.369> turn<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.700> entire<00:01:53.970> device

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
I guess you can turn the entire device

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.979 
I guess you can turn the entire device
side<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.590> side<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:57.030> these<00:01:57.329> grips<00:01:57.599> are<00:01:57.780> pretty

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:57.989 
side to side this these grips are pretty

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:01.339 
side to side this these grips are pretty
pretty<00:01:58.860> tight<00:01:59.130> like<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.869> nice<00:02:01.020> rubber

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
pretty tight like it it's a nice rubber

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.660 
pretty tight like it it's a nice rubber
so<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.739> won't<00:02:03.170> destroy<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.829> material<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.610> your

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
so it won't destroy the material of your

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.350 
so it won't destroy the material of your
handle

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
handle

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.880 
handle
it's<00:02:06.479> very<00:02:06.950> plastic<00:02:07.950> hollow<00:02:08.599> feeling<00:02:09.599> but<00:02:10.079> it

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
it's very plastic hollow feeling but it

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.530 
it's very plastic hollow feeling but it
does<00:02:11.099> its<00:02:11.280> job<00:02:11.480> no<00:02:12.480> batteries<00:02:12.959> required<00:02:13.049> and

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
does its job no batteries required and

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.080 
does its job no batteries required and
hopefully<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.630> will<00:02:15.690> last<00:02:16.280> if<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.400> can<00:02:17.730> treat<00:02:17.940> it

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
hopefully it will last if I can treat it

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.900 
hopefully it will last if I can treat it
nicely
