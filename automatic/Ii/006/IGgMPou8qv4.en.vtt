but if you just dribble it not if you
push<00:04:06.700> it<00:04:06.910> with<00:04:07.060> your<00:04:07.090> finger<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:07.960> see<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.410> way

it's starting to firm up but it's still
quite<00:04:10.810> liquid<00:04:11.170> that<00:04:11.350> means<00:04:11.560> that<00:04:11.710> it's<00:04:11.860> still

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
quite liquid that means that it's still

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.870 
quite liquid that means that it's still
not<00:04:12.550> ready<00:04:12.820> yet<00:04:13.120> so<00:04:14.250> that<00:04:15.250> has<00:04:15.430> been<00:04:15.640> ten

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880

minutes

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.180 
minutes
and<00:04:18.570> again<00:04:19.570> just<00:04:20.260> going<00:04:20.470> to<00:04:20.560> put<00:04:20.739> a<00:04:20.770> tiny

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
and again just going to put a tiny

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
and again just going to put a tiny
little<00:04:21.400> drop<00:04:21.640> on<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:22.510> clean<00:04:23.020> cold<00:04:23.530> plate<00:04:24.210> and

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
little drop on a clean cold plate and

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.910 
little drop on a clean cold plate and
just<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:26.110> know<00:04:26.230> it<00:04:26.320> takes<00:04:26.500> a<00:04:26.590> couple<00:04:26.770> of

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
just you know it takes a couple of

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.250 
just you know it takes a couple of
seconds<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.400> dry<00:04:27.700> and<00:04:27.910> what<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.420> will<00:04:28.600> notice

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
seconds to dry and what you will notice

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.920 
seconds to dry and what you will notice
is<00:04:29.620> that<00:04:29.950> whenever<00:04:30.160> you<00:04:30.430> push<00:04:30.700> it<00:04:30.930> there

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
is that whenever you push it there

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.520 
is that whenever you push it there
starts<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:32.410> be<00:04:32.560> little<00:04:33.210> lines<00:04:34.210> on<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.930> surface

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
starts to be little lines on the surface

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.390 
starts to be little lines on the surface
and<00:04:35.800> it's<00:04:36.040> quite<00:04:36.670> thick<00:04:37.030> so<00:04:38.040> that<00:04:39.040> means<00:04:39.220> it's

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
and it's quite thick so that means it's

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.620 
and it's quite thick so that means it's
ready<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:41.680> turn<00:04:41.890> off<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.250> heat<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:43.270> let<00:04:43.450> it

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
ready to turn off the heat and let it

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.770 
ready to turn off the heat and let it
just<00:04:44.280> come<00:04:45.280> down<00:04:45.490> for<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:45.760> couple<00:04:46.120> of<00:04:46.240> seconds

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
just come down for a couple of seconds

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.140 
just come down for a couple of seconds
because<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:48.010> next<00:04:48.430> thing<00:04:48.490> that<00:04:48.640> we're<00:04:48.940> going

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
because the next thing that we're going

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.920 
because the next thing that we're going
to<00:04:49.240> do<00:04:49.420> is<00:04:49.750> just<00:04:51.270> put<00:04:52.270> it<00:04:52.390> into<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:53.710> blender<00:04:54.930> you

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.740 
what this is going to do is it's going
to<00:06:10.500> heat<00:06:10.770> up<00:06:10.800> the<00:06:11.130> metal<00:06:11.520> and<00:06:11.760> then<00:06:12.390> it's<00:06:12.570> going

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
to heat up the metal and then it's going

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.620 
to heat up the metal and then it's going
to<00:06:12.840> create<00:06:13.290> a<00:06:13.350> vacuum<00:06:13.680> inside<00:06:14.490> which<00:06:15.240> is<00:06:15.419> going

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
to create a vacuum inside which is going

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.100 
to create a vacuum inside which is going
to<00:06:15.720> make<00:06:15.900> it<00:06:16.140> to<00:06:16.470> keep<00:06:16.890> longer<00:06:17.930> so<00:06:18.930> now<00:06:19.050> that

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
to make it to keep longer so now that

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.290 
to make it to keep longer so now that
these<00:06:19.380> have<00:06:19.530> cooled<00:06:19.710> down<00:06:19.980> long<00:06:20.250> but<00:06:20.610> actually

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
these have cooled down long but actually

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.140

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
quite a fit I'm going to show you the

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.409 
quite a fit I'm going to show you the
vacuum<00:06:25.010> okay<00:06:26.010> I<00:06:26.550> don't<00:06:27.060> know<00:06:27.120> if<00:06:27.180> you<00:06:27.300> heard

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
that but that was a vacuum and it has

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.290 
that but that was a vacuum and it has
set<00:06:32.520> quite<00:06:32.940> well<00:06:34.010> so<00:06:35.010> there's<00:06:35.250> no<00:06:35.580> gelatin<00:06:36.150> and

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
set quite well so there's no gelatin and

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.850 
set quite well so there's no gelatin and
now<00:06:36.450> that's<00:06:36.720> just<00:06:37.140> the<00:06:37.380> EM<00:06:39.350> that's<00:06:40.350> just<00:06:40.740> the

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
now that's just the EM that's just the

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.990 
now that's just the EM that's just the
pectin<00:06:41.310> in<00:06:41.550> and<00:06:41.970> the<00:06:42.060> sugar<00:06:42.330> and<00:06:42.660> there's

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
pectin in and the sugar and there's

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.300 
pectin in and the sugar and there's
still<00:06:45.000> some<00:06:45.150> chunks<00:06:45.479> in<00:06:45.600> it

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.090 

some<00:06:53.310> people<00:06:53.610> get<00:06:54.140> rid<00:06:55.140> of<00:06:55.170> the<00:06:55.410> seeds<00:06:55.650> but<00:06:56.070> I

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 
some people get rid of the seeds but I

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.330 
some people get rid of the seeds but I
think<00:06:56.400> that<00:06:56.580> they<00:06:57.530> they<00:06:58.530> give<00:06:58.710> a<00:06:58.740> little<00:06:59.010> bit

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
think that they they give a little bit

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.750 
think that they they give a little bit
of<00:07:00.110> crunch<00:07:01.110> and<00:07:01.410> it's<00:07:01.560> really<00:07:01.830> really

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:02.760 
of crunch and it's really really

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.590 
of crunch and it's really really
delicious<00:07:02.940> I<00:07:03.540> hope<00:07:04.500> you<00:07:04.650> try<00:07:04.890> this<00:07:04.950> recipe<00:07:05.600> and
