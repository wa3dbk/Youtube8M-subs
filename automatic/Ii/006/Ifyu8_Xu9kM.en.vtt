00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.690
 hello to all here gerÃ©ra de minecraft 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.160
 point fr is today we we 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.470
 find for the presentation of the mode 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.300
 at her home for minecraft so this 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.430
 excellent extremely complete fashion is going 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.130
 add to the game 300 blocks of 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.380
 construction of new generation 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.119
 so I mean by generation the addition 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.130
 of a new tube the generation of your 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.850
 minecraft world so finally take care of this 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.949
 blog so this is the block look of 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.350
 mark that you can see here and from 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.239
 limestone block against pharmacy so 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.489
 it's all these cubes of all these 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.510
 new building blocks are going 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.579
 allow the architects to leave 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.039
 free rein to their imagination in their 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.699
 allowing to diversify very widely 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.640
 thanks to a diversity panel in this 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.949
 not so much a panel of blocks 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.239
 really well done so 7 the author has 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.550
 wanted to do something very simple to access 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.000
 you will obviously not have 300 kraft at 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.449
 return 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.460
 Here we will explain everything and how it 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.100
 so works to start it goes 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.000
 have to apply a tool comes to kraft 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.860
 but you will not even need a 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.330
 kraft table so it's very simple 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.710
 you just open the inventory and 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.869
 you have your four little sentences of 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.750
 crafting so you first a stick 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:25.670
 boat waiting for us and there you are there 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.159
 add an iron magot diagonally 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.720
 like that so it works that all 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.750
 crabs back and forth and you 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.340
 get your cheese and cheese and 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.390
 which means scissors in English at 6o the 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.799
 chisel to cut the paper obviously 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.210
 it's the scissors that will you 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.710
 allow according to the tailor's edition 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.479
 know the scissors of tailors to 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.189
 households when we did not have all of them yet 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.079
 these stuff that allowed to carve the 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.430
 stone we used decision like that and 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.270
 well I can tell you that it was good 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.070
 useful and that it worked very well 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.079
 besides a splendor of the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.250
 architecture in our world leaves 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.899
 think that households are going to 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.149
 make do beautiful things 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.710
 so short that was the minute of 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.090
 the story now we'll go to the 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.880
 technique and concussion can see already 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.880
 some blocks 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.470
 mode will help build 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.760
 to make it's pretty simple from the title 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.500
 it's very easy to use as I 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.090
 said objects 10 before 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.680
 here are all the blocks you go 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.380
 to be able to change because here we are going to carve 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.430
 some blocks i'm going to drop a little bit the 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.340
 his is so by cutting these blocks it's 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.880
 to us the different variants that 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.560
 will allow to enrich 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.380
 considerably constructions like 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.150
 I said it before it is very useful 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.000
 so just to use the tool 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.050
 size you make a simple right click 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.510
 and here you have a new 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.030
 interface that appears is a do 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.470
 address these market practices and 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.870
 just the block has carved we 're going 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.630
 take part and so the stones label 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.250
 stone and you place it in the center and there 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.840
 you see all device variants 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.480
 which appear from left to right for 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.790
 the stone cup recover your 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.540
 trouble stone you can also 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.739
 recover to lint cobblestone grics so 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.890
 did you want to hear a little are to 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.209
 every time you manufacture so 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.200
 the tool does not run out at the moment level 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.190
 he does not have a good life meter 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.090
 limited but he has the very big advantage 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.690
 more or to avoid a lot of 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.959
 things with an unlimited duration of which 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.540
 several very little expensive to make very 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.060
 so advantageous and the other advantage 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.420
 is that you can re kraft and the 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.190
 blocks 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.650
 if you have kraft and your cobblestone 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.000
 in cobblestone aline you vellard kraft 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.680
 and in another motive 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.480
 for example cobblestone the skippers not 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.250
 do not know at all what that means 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:49.489
 that we start with a fearful cry of 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.140
 center postponement what did I want when I 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:55.870
 'm not here to have our 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:58.070
 coben creepers it looks like 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.579
 so we can also your life by 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.590
 example the green make fencing 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.569
 a slave 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.379
 a texture are perfectly doses but 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:12.500
 others can be very useful more 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.640
 recover those merry the gold block you 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.800
 can carve the metal blocks 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.070
 also like this it can give 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.479
 interesting results gold map 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.770
 bags of gold woods believes in reasons 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:28.250
 as a block where it will be redecorated china 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.570
 if we want to block canvas and it's no 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.380
 business solutions makes a girl like 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.490
 that can be funny 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.960
 then you cut the year zurbriggen 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.310
 obviously since it's a rock raid 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.290
 the trees and merry good at the end we 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.300
 can get a lot of results 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.850
 different 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.870
 you went all these cubes there are some 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.820
 which can be very interesting as 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.160
 the agglo stone that will not be obliged anymore 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.620
 to be ugly like you to do 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.900
 beautiful variants of water stone in 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:02.030
 canyon is so business of 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.190
 gloucester mare lighting lose the 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.990
 rhythm because before that was the galley 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.080
 with the reston languages â€‹â€‹object of the 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.070
 light up boston ride for him as long as 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.750
 we continue the press we 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.330
 continue the presentation of the mode if 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.389
 I can express myself with the use 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.830
 so some of these new blocks 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.200
 that's all you can eliminate 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.720
 with any pocket is that I 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.639
 believe it's going faster and so you 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.780
 constitute a separate element what they 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.330
 are really not uncommon yes y'en 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.960
 really everywhere at all altitudes 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:35.300
 it's not very hard to find so 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.470
 for fears and this time yes yes 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.760
 no he is crashed in the workshop of 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.220
 size like all the other beaches the 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.979
 place he has for example one can have 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.210
 many light marble variants 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:53.060
 schipper nabeul of marble creepers not 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:55.610
 light light here finally short we do not care 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.440
 so we can have a very nice mardum 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.990
 to decorate it can be strong 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.770
 interesting especially for the servers its 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.020
 part is to vary the styles 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.550
 architectural 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.500
 it's a forge mode so it's 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.360
 multiplayer compatible like all 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.710
 others only fault was to put 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.910
 leave it must obviously do 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.360
 some modifs but there is not the 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.539
 question 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.129
 I am really new to knowing 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.629
 to venture into it and that's 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:22.389
 exactly the same for limestone 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:23.860
 limestone that says itself right linkstone or 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:28.629
 lan stone does not know the pronunciation 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:36.970
 accept marble beard at marbot all the 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:37.979
 world knows that hop and so lyn stone with 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.530
 ornaments 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:43.569
 yeah yeah yeah limestone ornamented 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.759
 normally limestone his ancestors 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:49.419
 still a thousand times more free table 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:52.419
 that this tweetup I was passing this district 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:54.490
 Wood chips regardless 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:55.810
 a thousand times easier to break than that 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.919
 it's a little strange that 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.419
 ultimately does not want the case is that 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:02.469
 it is to enter quickly since 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:04.539
 someone crumbles quickly 

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:06.580
 so here's these blocks it starts to 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:07.090
 to make night it is very happy I am 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.919
 plug 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.990
 it spoils the whole vineyard but it's not 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:13.380
 serious this is in regards to 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:16.270
 the installation of the mode is simple 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.930
 like any working mode 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.569
 with forget 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.009
 then this video was the first 

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:23.529
 video for my first article on 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:26.139
 minecraft point en I hope she will 

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:27.490
 will have pleased that it's nice what I have 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:29.139
 been taken as an editor that makes me 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:32.529
 a lot of pleasure I thank you already 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:34.479
 the whole site team is well 

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:37.710
 I decided to make a video for 

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:40.330
 present my articles simply 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.690
 quietly that's it always puts in 

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:46.479
 value 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:47.919
 it's a pleasure to viewers thanks to all 

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:49.380
 to have followed me so far and we 

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:51.580
 find for a next video 

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.469
 probably on an upcoming series that 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.560
 I want I already shot I do not know 

00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:58.889
 not if I will do an article 

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.889
 see you soon
