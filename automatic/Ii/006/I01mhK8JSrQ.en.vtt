00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.829 

so<00:00:04.620> this<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.069> little<00:00:05.339> stick<00:00:05.879> plane<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:06.420> um

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
so this is a little stick plane I um

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.200 
so this is a little stick plane I um
decided<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.710> build<00:00:07.980> because<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.490> had<00:00:08.670> one<00:00:09.120> of

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
decided to build because I had one of

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.450 
decided to build because I had one of
these<00:00:09.300> motors<00:00:09.840> from<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.380> mini<00:00:10.590> cargo<00:00:10.950> Condor

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
these motors from the mini cargo Condor

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.210 
these motors from the mini cargo Condor
lying<00:00:12.450> around<00:00:12.599> on<00:00:13.219> the<00:00:14.219> fuselage<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.150> stick

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
lying around on the fuselage is a stick

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.179 
lying around on the fuselage is a stick
some<00:00:17.220> five<00:00:17.520> gram<00:00:17.820> servos<00:00:18.500> the<00:00:19.500> wing<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.740> three

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
some five gram servos the wing is three

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.359 
some five gram servos the wing is three
millimeter<00:00:20.640> depron<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.529> tail<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.010> also<00:00:23.340> a

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
millimeter depron and the tail is also a

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.150 
millimeter depron and the tail is also a
three<00:00:23.550> millimeter<00:00:23.880> depron<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.740> really

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
three millimeter depron so it's a really

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.880 
three millimeter depron so it's a really
light<00:00:26.460> floaty<00:00:27.119> plane<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.810> here<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.710> some

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
light floaty plane and here is some

00:00:28.890 --> 00:01:05.420 
light floaty plane and here is some
video<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.519> flying<00:00:34.340> gliding

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:15.880 

and<00:01:06.300> there

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:30.290 

it<00:01:16.430> has<00:01:16.550> hit<00:01:16.700> it

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.390 

so<00:01:31.440> previously<00:01:32.440> I've<00:01:32.650> been<00:01:32.830> flying<00:01:33.100> this

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
so previously I've been flying this

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.920 
so previously I've been flying this
plane<00:01:33.460> with<00:01:34.180> a<00:01:37.110> 260<00:01:38.110> milliamp<00:01:39.240> 2<00:01:40.240> cell<00:01:40.510> battery

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
plane with a 260 milliamp 2 cell battery

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.870 
plane with a 260 milliamp 2 cell battery
and<00:01:41.620> now<00:01:41.770> I<00:01:41.800> put<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.480> 1600<00:01:43.480> milliamp<00:01:44.140> hour<00:01:44.950> 2

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
and now I put a 1600 milliamp hour 2

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.520 
and now I put a 1600 milliamp hour 2
cell<00:01:46.120> battery<00:01:46.540> on<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.900> and<00:01:47.020> I'm<00:01:47.080> gonna<00:01:47.260> see<00:01:47.410> how

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
cell battery on it and I'm gonna see how

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.960 
cell battery on it and I'm gonna see how
long<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:47.950> can<00:01:47.980> fly<00:01:48.340> this<00:01:48.400> thing<00:01:48.610> for<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.430> we<00:01:51.760> are

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
long I can fly this thing for so we are

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.460 
long I can fly this thing for so we are
about<00:01:53.550> 2<00:01:54.550> minutes<00:01:54.790> and<00:01:55.120> 48<00:01:55.479> seconds<00:01:56.020> into<00:01:56.320> the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
about 2 minutes and 48 seconds into the

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.040 
about 2 minutes and 48 seconds into the
flight<00:01:57.030> filming<00:01:58.030> this<00:01:58.180> myself<00:01:58.660> while<00:01:58.930> I'm

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
flight filming this myself while I'm

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.170 
flight filming this myself while I'm
flying<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.800> we're<00:02:00.100> gonna<00:02:00.220> see<00:02:00.460> how<00:02:00.700> long<00:02:00.729> it

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
flying and we're gonna see how long it

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.410 
flying and we're gonna see how long it
will<00:02:01.240> fly<00:02:01.510> for<00:02:02.070> 7<00:02:03.070> minutes<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.520> 33<00:02:03.790> seconds

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
will fly for 7 minutes and 33 seconds

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.120 
will fly for 7 minutes and 33 seconds
and<00:02:04.720> it's<00:02:04.840> just<00:02:05.020> gliding<00:02:05.530> up<00:02:05.650> there<00:02:05.890> with<00:02:06.010> the

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
and it's just gliding up there with the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.800 
and it's just gliding up there with the
power<00:02:06.280> off<00:02:06.670> 10<00:02:07.660> minutes<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.200> 33<00:02:08.560> seconds<00:02:09.810> I'm

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
power off 10 minutes and 33 seconds I'm

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.449 
power off 10 minutes and 33 seconds I'm
gliding<00:02:11.200> what<00:02:11.530> I've<00:02:11.650> been<00:02:11.740> doing<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.130> kind<00:02:12.340> of

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
gliding what I've been doing is kind of

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.850 
gliding what I've been doing is kind of
gliding<00:02:13.000> IRA<00:02:13.510> motoring<00:02:14.080> up<00:02:14.200> then<00:02:14.470> gliding

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
gliding IRA motoring up then gliding

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.880 
gliding IRA motoring up then gliding
down<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.940> we're<00:02:16.300> at<00:02:16.450> 15<00:02:16.959> minutes<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.740> it's

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
down so we're at 15 minutes and it's

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.250 
down so we're at 15 minutes and it's
getting<00:02:18.220> windy<00:02:18.640> I've<00:02:18.850> moved<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.810> sitting

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
getting windy I've moved to a sitting

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.940 
getting windy I've moved to a sitting
position<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:22.180> getting<00:02:22.540> really<00:02:22.690> hungry<00:02:23.080> 20

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
position and getting really hungry 20

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.150 
position and getting really hungry 20
minutes<00:02:25.050> it's<00:02:26.050> so<00:02:26.320> beautiful<00:02:27.870> 27<00:02:28.870> minutes

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
minutes it's so beautiful 27 minutes

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.930 
minutes it's so beautiful 27 minutes
getting<00:02:30.160> really<00:02:30.430> hungry

getting really hungry
I<00:02:31.120> was<00:02:31.480> tried<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.780> eat<00:02:31.989> some<00:02:32.170> snow<00:02:32.470> but<00:02:32.739> that

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
I was tried to eat some snow but that

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.110 
I was tried to eat some snow but that
doesn't<00:02:33.160> really<00:02:33.220> help<00:02:33.400> because<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.850> snow<00:02:34.060> is

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
doesn't really help because the snow is

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.850 
doesn't really help because the snow is
really<00:02:34.180> dirty<00:02:35.760> 35<00:02:36.760> minutes<00:02:37.300> feels<00:02:38.050> like<00:02:38.320> 35

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
really dirty 35 minutes feels like 35

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.430 
really dirty 35 minutes feels like 35
years<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.700> haven't<00:02:40.269> tried<00:02:40.450> eating<00:02:40.660> trees<00:02:41.110> yet

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
years I haven't tried eating trees yet

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.740 
years I haven't tried eating trees yet
but<00:02:42.209> 47<00:02:43.209> minutes

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
but 47 minutes

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.600 
but 47 minutes
just<00:02:44.470> flying<00:02:44.709> away<00:02:44.890> longer<00:02:45.370> than<00:02:45.519> I<00:02:45.580> thought

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
just flying away longer than I thought

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.890 
just flying away longer than I thought
it<00:02:45.910> would<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.239> I'm<00:02:46.300> getting<00:02:46.600> really<00:02:46.780> bored

and my hands are cold and I'm hungry
Oh<00:02:49.080> finally<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.470> motor<00:02:50.739> started<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.459> run

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
Oh finally the motor started to run

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.729 
Oh finally the motor started to run
lower<00:02:52.299> and<00:02:52.630> lower<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.350> battery<00:02:53.709> is

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
lower and lower and the battery is

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.770 
lower and lower and the battery is
starting<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.190> die<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:55.320> we<00:02:56.320> got<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:57.450> one<00:02:58.450> hour

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
starting to die and we got to one hour

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.630 
starting to die and we got to one hour
and<00:03:00.720> one<00:03:01.720> one<00:03:02.170> hour<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.739> nine<00:03:02.920> minutes<00:03:03.160> a

and one one hour and nine minutes a
little<00:03:04.540> plus<00:03:04.930> means<00:03:05.230> one<00:03:05.500> hour<00:03:05.680> right<00:03:06.100> there

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
little plus means one hour right there

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.390 
little plus means one hour right there
um<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.959> one<00:03:08.230> hour<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.620> nine<00:03:08.799> minutes<00:03:09.040> for<00:03:09.370> a

um so one hour and nine minutes for a

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.630 
um so one hour and nine minutes for a
really<00:03:09.730> light<00:03:09.940> plane<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:11.470> pretty<00:03:12.070> freaking

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
really light plane is pretty freaking

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.670 
really light plane is pretty freaking
good<00:03:12.880> luck<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.570> battery<00:03:13.930> into<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.410> thing

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
good luck to the battery into this thing

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.990 
good luck to the battery into this thing
and<00:03:15.549> it<00:03:15.850> says<00:03:16.120> I'm<00:03:16.480> not<00:03:16.510> 2%<00:03:17.140> of<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:18.580> battery

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
and it says I'm not 2% of the battery

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.060 
and it says I'm not 2% of the battery
left<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.600> it's<00:03:19.959> unbalanced

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
left and it's unbalanced

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.890 
left and it's unbalanced
better<00:03:22.070> charge<00:03:22.460> it<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:23.210> with<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.690> bigger

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
better charge it so with the bigger

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.840 
better charge it so with the bigger
battery<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.650> total<00:03:25.010> weight<00:03:25.190> is<00:03:25.400> 8<00:03:25.640> ounces

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
battery the total weight is 8 ounces

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.850 
battery the total weight is 8 ounces
both<00:03:26.540> smaller<00:03:26.960> batteries<00:03:27.500> that<00:03:27.650> weighs<00:03:27.830> about

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
both smaller batteries that weighs about

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.230 
both smaller batteries that weighs about
5<00:03:28.580> or<00:03:28.610> 6<00:03:28.910> ounces<00:03:29.510> um<00:03:30.520> so<00:03:31.520> basically<00:03:31.670> I'm<00:03:32.180> not

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
5 or 6 ounces um so basically I'm not

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.870 
5 or 6 ounces um so basically I'm not
sure<00:03:32.720> what<00:03:32.960> kind<00:03:33.200> of<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.350> motor<00:03:33.590> this<00:03:33.860> is<00:03:33.920> but<00:03:34.580> it

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
sure what kind of a motor this is but it

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.960 
sure what kind of a motor this is but it
came<00:03:35.090> with<00:03:35.300> a<00:03:35.330> kit<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:35.990> quadcopter<00:03:36.410> kit<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.310> the

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
came with a kit a quadcopter kit and the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.650 
came with a kit a quadcopter kit and the
little<00:03:38.360> prop<00:03:39.260> things<00:03:39.650> like<00:03:39.860> five<00:03:40.100> inches<00:03:40.660> or

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
little prop things like five inches or

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.260 
little prop things like five inches or
something<00:03:42.320> really<00:03:42.530> small<00:03:43.010> but<00:03:43.430> around<00:03:43.940> five

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
something really small but around five

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.880 
something really small but around five
inches<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:45.200> wingspan<00:03:45.680> is<00:03:45.710> 39<00:03:46.400> inches<00:03:46.820> um<00:03:47.890> let

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
inches the wingspan is 39 inches um let

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.370 
inches the wingspan is 39 inches um let
me<00:03:49.010> measure<00:03:49.250> some<00:03:49.640> more<00:03:49.850> stuff<00:03:50.210> though<00:03:50.660> wing

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
me measure some more stuff though wing

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.050 
me measure some more stuff though wing
cord<00:03:51.830> I<00:03:52.040> actually<00:03:52.130> had<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.430> trim<00:03:52.670> it<00:03:52.760> down<00:03:52.790> it

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
cord I actually had to trim it down it

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.900 
cord I actually had to trim it down it
used<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.270> be<00:03:53.360> fatter<00:03:53.680> but<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.830> wing<00:03:54.980> cord<00:03:55.280> is<00:03:55.490> 8

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
used to be fatter but the wing cord is 8

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.640 
used to be fatter but the wing cord is 8
inches<00:03:56.450> um<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:58.450> had<00:03:59.450> to<00:03:59.480> as<00:03:59.930> you<00:04:00.170> can<00:04:00.320> see<00:04:00.500> back

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
inches um I had to as you can see back

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.230 
inches um I had to as you can see back
there<00:04:00.860> I<00:04:00.890> had<00:04:01.040> to<00:04:01.160> make<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.550> horizontal

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
there I had to make the horizontal

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.620 
there I had to make the horizontal
stabilizer<00:04:02.990> bigger<00:04:03.640> but<00:04:04.640> a<00:04:04.910> horizontal

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
stabilizer bigger but a horizontal

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.420 
stabilizer bigger but a horizontal
stabilizer<00:04:06.140> cord<00:04:06.500> is<00:04:06.650> 5<00:04:06.890> inches<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.960> it<00:04:08.960> is<00:04:09.430> 13

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
stabilizer cord is 5 inches and it is 13

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.470 
stabilizer cord is 5 inches and it is 13
inches<00:04:10.610> long<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:13.100> vertical<00:04:13.520> stabilizer<00:04:14.000> is

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
inches long that vertical stabilizer is

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.620 
inches long that vertical stabilizer is
6<00:04:15.140> inches<00:04:15.350> tall<00:04:16.010> so<00:04:16.700> if<00:04:16.910> you<00:04:17.000> want<00:04:17.150> to<00:04:17.239> make<00:04:17.420> one

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
6 inches tall so if you want to make one

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.970 
6 inches tall so if you want to make one
of<00:04:17.660> these<00:04:17.810> you<00:04:18.110> probably<00:04:18.410> could<00:04:18.680> pretty

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
of these you probably could pretty

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.940 
of these you probably could pretty
easily<00:04:19.570> anyways<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.720> fuselage<00:04:21.230> is<00:04:21.530> just<00:04:21.830> a

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
easily anyways the fuselage is just a

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.030 
easily anyways the fuselage is just a
little<00:04:22.250> stick<00:04:23.090> I've<00:04:23.600> got<00:04:23.780> some<00:04:23.990> 5<00:04:24.260> gram<00:04:24.500> servos

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
little stick I've got some 5 gram servos

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.480 
little stick I've got some 5 gram servos
a<00:04:25.420> little<00:04:26.590> ESC<00:04:27.590> I<00:04:27.620> don't<00:04:27.950> even<00:04:28.010> know<00:04:28.220> what

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
a little ESC I don't even know what

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.280 
a little ESC I don't even know what
what's<00:04:29.360> up<00:04:29.480> with<00:04:29.600> that<00:04:29.630> but<00:04:29.960> there's<00:04:30.110> my

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
what's up with that but there's my

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.490 
what's up with that but there's my
receiver<00:04:30.680> up<00:04:30.950> there<00:04:32.290> basically<00:04:33.290> it's<00:04:33.470> just

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
receiver up there basically it's just

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.910 
receiver up there basically it's just
constructed<00:04:34.400> really<00:04:34.730> light<00:04:35.000> um<00:04:35.300> I<00:04:35.870> just<00:04:36.680> got

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
constructed really light um I just got

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.100 
constructed really light um I just got
some<00:04:37.460> sticks<00:04:37.970> running<00:04:38.600> through<00:04:38.780> there<00:04:38.960> and

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
some sticks running through there and

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.520 
some sticks running through there and
then<00:04:39.230> it's<00:04:40.190> just<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:40.550> that<00:04:41.210> that<00:04:41.840> middle<00:04:42.350> piece

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
then it's just a that that middle piece

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.860 
then it's just a that that middle piece
is<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:43.010> used<00:04:43.160> to<00:04:43.250> be<00:04:43.400> just<00:04:43.430> a<00:04:43.700> solid<00:04:44.090> piece<00:04:44.360> of

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
is that used to be just a solid piece of

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.420 
is that used to be just a solid piece of
pink<00:04:45.110> foam<00:04:45.350> but<00:04:45.560> I<00:04:45.590> actually<00:04:45.740> cut<00:04:46.130> it<00:04:46.250> right<00:04:46.370> in

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
pink foam but I actually cut it right in

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.090 
pink foam but I actually cut it right in
half<00:04:46.550> down<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.030> wing<00:04:47.330> to<00:04:48.200> give<00:04:48.380> a<00:04:48.410> dihedral

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
half down the wing to give a dihedral

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.250 
half down the wing to give a dihedral
so<00:04:49.460> that<00:04:49.610> works<00:04:49.760> out<00:04:49.910> pretty<00:04:49.970> nicely<00:04:50.300> so<00:04:50.630> if

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
so that works out pretty nicely so if

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.750 
so that works out pretty nicely so if
you<00:04:51.350> want<00:04:51.500> to<00:04:51.560> build<00:04:51.770> one<00:04:51.860> of<00:04:52.010> these<00:04:52.100> planes

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
you want to build one of these planes

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.170 
you want to build one of these planes
there's<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.210> specs<00:04:53.600> on<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:55.610> slider<00:04:55.970> there

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
there's the specs on the slider there

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.920 
there's the specs on the slider there
nicely<00:04:56.390> so<00:04:56.870> thanks<00:04:57.230> for<00:04:57.380> watching<00:04:57.710> bye
