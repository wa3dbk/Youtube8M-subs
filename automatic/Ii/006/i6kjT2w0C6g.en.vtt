then<00:03:34.769> restore<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.370> into<00:03:36.209> changing<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.169> borrowed

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
then restore it into changing a borrowed

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.190 
then restore it into changing a borrowed
object<00:03:38.340> into<00:03:38.849> something<00:03:38.959> entirely<00:03:39.959> different

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
object into something entirely different

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.559 
object into something entirely different
and<00:03:40.680> then<00:03:41.069> doing<00:03:41.340> something<00:03:41.609> magical<00:03:42.239> with<00:03:42.389> it

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
and then doing something magical with it

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.319 
and then doing something magical with it
I<00:03:42.720> think<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.620> both<00:03:43.859> have<00:03:44.549> their<00:03:44.849> merit<00:03:45.239> I

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
I think that both have their merit I

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.659 
I think that both have their merit I
think<00:03:45.599> that<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.840> coin<00:03:46.349> bite<00:03:46.709> is<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> strong

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
think that the coin bite is a strong

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.119 
think that the coin bite is a strong
visual<00:03:48.120> quick<00:03:48.750> piece<00:03:49.019> of<00:03:49.169> magic<00:03:49.349> I<00:03:49.680> think<00:03:50.010> that

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
visual quick piece of magic I think that

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.520 
visual quick piece of magic I think that
the<00:03:50.250> chocolate<00:03:50.669> coin<00:03:50.940> adds<00:03:51.410> another<00:03:52.410> element

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
the chocolate coin adds another element

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.240 
the chocolate coin adds another element
to<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.549> along<00:03:53.819> gates<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.750> magic

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
to it and it along gates the magic

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.039 
to it and it along gates the magic
experience<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:56.940> it's<00:03:57.389> it's<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.840> give-and-take

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
experience so it's it's a give-and-take

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.619 
experience so it's it's a give-and-take
it's<00:03:58.620> it's<00:03:58.919> up<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.489> if<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.970> want<00:04:00.239> to<00:04:00.359> make

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
it's it's up to you if you want to make

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:01.819 
it's it's up to you if you want to make
it<00:04:00.750> look<00:04:00.840> like<00:04:01.019> you<00:04:01.139> have<00:04:01.169> superhuman

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
it look like you have superhuman

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.170 
it look like you have superhuman
strength<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.340> can<00:04:02.459> bite<00:04:02.639> through<00:04:02.669> a<00:04:02.910> coin

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
strength and can bite through a coin

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.939 
strength and can bite through a coin
coin<00:04:03.900> by<00:04:04.079> it's<00:04:04.199> going<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.410> be<00:04:04.500> where<00:04:04.650> it's<00:04:04.769> at

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
coin by it's going to be where it's at

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.949 
coin by it's going to be where it's at
but<00:04:05.129> if<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.340> want<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.549> make<00:04:05.699> it<00:04:05.849> seem<00:04:06.120> like<00:04:06.150> the

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
but if you want to make it seem like the

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.770 
but if you want to make it seem like the
coin<00:04:07.530> actually<00:04:08.190> changes<00:04:08.910> into<00:04:09.599> something

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
coin actually changes into something

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.559 
coin actually changes into something
completely<00:04:10.079> different<00:04:10.609> then<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:12.060> chocolate

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
completely different then the chocolate

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.569 
completely different then the chocolate
coin<00:04:13.019> is<00:04:13.260> going<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.590> be<00:04:13.680> good<00:04:13.829> for<00:04:14.069> you<00:04:14.190> another

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
thing I will say about the chocolate

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.199 
thing I will say about the chocolate
coin<00:04:16.199> versus<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.070> coin<00:04:17.310> bite<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.849> that<00:04:18.090> the

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
coin versus the coin bite is that the

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.960 
coin versus the coin bite is that the
chocolate<00:04:18.660> coin<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:19.079> feel<00:04:19.560> brings<00:04:20.430> up<00:04:20.639> more

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
chocolate coin I feel brings up more

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.959 
chocolate coin I feel brings up more
memories<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.780> emotion<00:04:22.410> than<00:04:23.039> this<00:04:23.550> standard

element there in addition to that when

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.750 
element there in addition to that when
you<00:04:36.090> bite<00:04:36.360> into<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:36.960> people<00:04:37.320> have<00:04:38.280> memories<00:04:38.729> of

you bite into it people have memories of

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.330 
you bite into it people have memories of
what<00:04:39.180> chocolate<00:04:39.690> tastes<00:04:40.020> like<00:04:40.200> and<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:40.770> that

what chocolate tastes like and and that

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.339 
what chocolate tastes like and and that
brings<00:04:41.700> up<00:04:41.849> a<00:04:41.909> whole<00:04:42.150> different<00:04:42.479> chemical

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
brings up a whole different chemical

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.890 
brings up a whole different chemical
reaction<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.010> so<00:04:44.760> you've<00:04:45.180> got<00:04:45.419> these<00:04:45.630> other

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
reaction and so you've got these other

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.839 
reaction and so you've got these other
elements<00:04:46.169> to<00:04:46.560> it<00:04:46.830> that<00:04:47.010> are<00:04:47.130> more<00:04:47.159> than<00:04:47.610> just

this<00:04:58.770> effect<00:04:58.950> I<00:04:59.400> think<00:04:59.430> that<00:04:59.760> it's<00:04:59.909> very

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
this effect I think that it's very

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.589 
this effect I think that it's very
strong<00:05:00.570> it's<00:05:00.960> a<00:05:01.110> visual<00:05:01.590> it<00:05:01.880> evokes<00:05:02.880> emotion

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
strong it's a visual it evokes emotion

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.570 
strong it's a visual it evokes emotion
from<00:05:03.900> your<00:05:04.080> spectators<00:05:04.740> all<00:05:05.190> of<00:05:05.430> that's

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
from your spectators all of that's

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.010 
from your spectators all of that's
really<00:05:05.849> important<00:05:06.300> when<00:05:06.419> you're<00:05:06.539> choosing<00:05:06.810> a

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
really important when you're choosing a

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.469 
really important when you're choosing a
close-up<00:05:07.469> effect<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.099> it's<00:05:08.880> very<00:05:09.090> organic

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
close-up effect and it's very organic

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.719 
close-up effect and it's very organic
you<00:05:09.840> borrow<00:05:10.139> an<00:05:10.469> object<00:05:10.979> you<00:05:11.099> do<00:05:11.310> something

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
you borrow an object you do something

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.450 
you borrow an object you do something
visually<00:05:12.360> magical<00:05:13.139> with<00:05:13.320> it<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:13.710> totally

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
visually magical with it and totally

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.830 
visually magical with it and totally
impossible<00:05:14.729> and<00:05:15.210> then<00:05:15.300> you<00:05:15.360> hand<00:05:15.570> it<00:05:15.659> back<00:05:15.779> to

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
impossible and then you hand it back to

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.930 
impossible and then you hand it back to
them<00:05:16.110> I<00:05:16.289> think<00:05:16.740> this<00:05:16.830> is<00:05:16.979> really<00:05:17.279> strong<00:05:17.580> and

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
them I think this is really strong and

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.180 
them I think this is really strong and
definitely<00:05:18.479> worth<00:05:18.719> looking<00:05:19.169> into<00:05:19.260> and<00:05:19.710> you

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
definitely worth looking into and you
