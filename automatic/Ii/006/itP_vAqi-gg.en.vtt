00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.610 
Walmart for $19.99 it was on sale
usually<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.540> think<00:00:09.870> $29.99<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:12.410> had<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.590> shipped

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
usually I think $29.99 I had it shipped

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.529 
usually I think $29.99 I had it shipped
to<00:00:14.040> still<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.839> store<00:00:15.839> at<00:00:16.020> Walmart<00:00:17.240> so<00:00:18.240> it's

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
to still the store at Walmart so it's

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.620 
to still the store at Walmart so it's
surprisingly<00:00:19.199> small<00:00:22.730> if<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.970> look<00:00:24.359> at<00:00:24.510> this

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
surprisingly small if you look at this

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.939 
surprisingly small if you look at this
box<00:00:24.900> here<00:00:25.970> it's<00:00:26.970> almost<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:28.050> same<00:00:28.230> size<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.800> my

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
box here it's almost the same size is my

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:41.299 
box here it's almost the same size is my
mold<00:00:29.929> it<00:00:30.929> could<00:00:31.109> fit<00:00:31.230> my<00:00:31.380> old<00:00:31.529> toaster<00:00:31.830> oven<00:00:40.309> I

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
mold it could fit my old toaster oven I

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.869 
mold it could fit my old toaster oven I
thought<00:00:41.910> it'd<00:00:42.059> be<00:00:42.090> bigger<00:00:42.360> because<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
thought it'd be bigger because on the

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.930 
thought it'd be bigger because on the
front<00:00:44.879> picture<00:00:45.390> shows<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.899> toasts<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.940> also

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
and up to 450 degrees we'll see how it

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.710 
and up to 450 degrees we'll see how it
works<00:04:54.870> I<00:04:55.729> heard<00:04:56.729> on<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:56.970> reviews<00:04:57.270> it<00:04:57.449> doesn't

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
well it looks a lot nicer but I thought

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.520 
well it looks a lot nicer but I thought
it'd<00:05:22.780> be<00:05:22.810> bigger<00:05:23.110> I<00:05:23.760> should<00:05:24.760> have<00:05:24.850> read<00:05:25.030> the

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
it'd be bigger I should have read the

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.450 
it'd be bigger I should have read the
what's<00:05:26.530> it<00:05:26.680> called<00:05:26.890> the<00:05:28.590> dimensions<00:05:29.590> so<00:05:29.920> you

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
what's it called the dimensions so you

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.980 
what's it called the dimensions so you
can<00:05:30.700> see<00:05:32.070> it's<00:05:33.070> only<00:05:33.250> slightly<00:05:33.670> longer<00:05:34.210> my

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
can see it's only slightly longer my

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.750 
can see it's only slightly longer my

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
like I'm gonna need to do a separate

like I'm gonna need to do a separate
video<00:05:45.730> on<00:05:45.970> how<00:05:46.270> to<00:05:46.300> use<00:05:46.450> this<00:05:47.850> toaster<00:05:48.850> it's

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
video on how to use this toaster it's

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:56.130 
video on how to use this toaster it's
pretty<00:05:49.570> complicated<00:05:50.250> or<00:05:51.250> maybe<00:05:54.660> I'll<00:05:55.660> know

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
pretty complicated or maybe I'll know

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.800 
pretty complicated or maybe I'll know
cuz<00:05:56.770> it<00:05:56.980> has<00:05:57.160> this<00:05:57.340> big<00:05:57.610> manual<00:05:58.270> but<00:05:58.600> it's<00:05:58.720> in

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
cuz it has this big manual but it's in

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.280 
cuz it has this big manual but it's in
different<00:05:58.900> languages

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
different languages

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.200 
different languages
we'll<00:06:02.290> have<00:06:02.440> to<00:06:02.590> see<00:06:02.800> because<00:06:03.610> I'm<00:06:03.880> not<00:06:03.970> sure

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
we'll have to see because I'm not sure

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.450 
we'll have to see because I'm not sure
how<00:06:04.450> the<00:06:04.510> toast<00:06:04.900> and<00:06:05.140> how<00:06:05.290> to<00:06:05.350> use<00:06:06.160> the<00:06:06.310> oven

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
how the toast and how to use the oven

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.950 
how the toast and how to use the oven
separately<00:06:07.330> so<00:06:09.330> it's<00:06:10.330> a<00:06:10.540> little<00:06:10.810> more

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
separately so it's a little more

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.320 
separately so it's a little more
complicated<00:06:11.430> because<00:06:12.430> if<00:06:12.670> you<00:06:12.760> look<00:06:13.000> at<00:06:13.150> this

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
complicated because if you look at this

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.530 
complicated because if you look at this
there's<00:06:13.630> a<00:06:13.690> top<00:06:13.990> one<00:06:14.670> then<00:06:15.670> there's<00:06:15.850> a<00:06:15.940> bottom

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
there's a top one then there's a bottom

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.440 
there's a top one then there's a bottom
thing<00:06:16.780> the<00:06:16.990> bottom<00:06:17.170> was<00:06:17.470> the<00:06:17.500> timer<00:06:17.950> and<00:06:18.820> top

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
thing the bottom was the timer and top

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.750 
thing the bottom was the timer and top
one's<00:06:19.690> the<00:06:19.840> temperature<00:06:22.830> and<00:06:23.830> it<00:06:24.280> seems<00:06:24.550> like

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
one's the temperature and it seems like

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.020 
one's the temperature and it seems like
on<00:06:25.090> the<00:06:25.150> bottom<00:06:25.540> if<00:06:25.900> you<00:06:25.930> want<00:06:26.050> to<00:06:26.320> toast<00:06:27.030> you

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
on the bottom if you want to toast you

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.570 
on the bottom if you want to toast you
would<00:06:28.180> just<00:06:28.330> move<00:06:28.600> this<00:06:29.470> to<00:06:29.770> whatever<00:06:29.950> toast

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
would just move this to whatever toast

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.420 
would just move this to whatever toast
you<00:06:30.820> want<00:06:31.000> it<00:06:31.090> to<00:06:31.210> toast<00:06:31.480> it's<00:06:32.380> not<00:06:32.530> that<00:06:33.100> easy

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
you want it to toast it's not that easy

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.400 
you want it to toast it's not that easy
to<00:06:33.670> turn<00:06:33.850> off<00:06:34.120> you<00:06:34.330> just<00:06:34.480> have<00:06:34.660> well<00:06:35.080> it's<00:06:35.200> easy

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
to turn off you just have well it's easy

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:46.670 
to turn off you just have well it's easy
but<00:06:35.680> yep<00:06:39.630> pull<00:06:40.630> the<00:06:40.750> knob<00:06:40.960> down<00:06:40.990> or<00:06:41.500> something

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.210 

but<00:06:47.680> if<00:06:47.800> I<00:06:47.920> wanna<00:06:48.720> use<00:06:49.720> the<00:06:49.930> oven<00:06:50.170> I<00:06:50.860> guess<00:06:51.100> I

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
but if I wanna use the oven I guess I

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.620 
but if I wanna use the oven I guess I
have<00:06:51.340> to<00:06:51.370> first<00:06:52.680> set<00:06:53.680> the<00:06:53.800> temperature<00:06:54.630> and

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.630 
have to first set the temperature and

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.640 
have to first set the temperature and
then<00:06:55.780> I<00:06:55.840> have<00:06:55.990> to<00:06:56.080> put<00:06:56.230> the<00:06:56.350> timer<00:06:57.210> and<00:06:58.500> you<00:06:59.500> can

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
then I have to put the timer and you can

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.280 
then I have to put the timer and you can
hear<00:06:59.860> the<00:07:00.010> oven<00:07:00.520> toast<00:07:00.850> referring<00:07:01.210> it's<00:07:01.420> it's
