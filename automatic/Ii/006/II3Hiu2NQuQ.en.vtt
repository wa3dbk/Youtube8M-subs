00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.370
 Welcome to the second podcast 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.189
 follow it now in the topic image 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.860
 lux goes or how to lure a picture 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.839
 created with the kaller look up table 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.940
 that is a cc function but there is 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.800
 Of course, even the possibility that 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.900
 same with older versions 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.359
 there you work with actions 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.710
 I go even closer to that in the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.590
 progress from this video 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.240
 I would like that anyway anyway 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.690
 you do not care so much for that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.120
 technical concentrated but rather 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.070
 why a picture lub is important as one 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.680
 one can develop one like one 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.390
 can create and so on and there 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.820
 we begin now just the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.430
 most important is first of all if you are 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.289
 now with the color look up table 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.789
 So if you want to work, you want to work one 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.230
 wanted to create image look her 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.360
 later then here in the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.129
 setting level color lock up finds 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.690
 So that's how it is with me 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.989
 I have this cross look for example 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.270
 in there if you want to work like that then is 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.180
 First of all, it's important that you have one 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.520
 I have the background level now 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.630
 currently not that is a normal one 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.670
 level 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.280
 and if he turns it into a background plane 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.200
 then you can do that with me 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.540
 a right click and then up here 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.159
 So background level there must reduce 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.950
 and shut up 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.509
 only then does it work with catalog 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.799
 tables so before we get to the topic 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.570
 come as the whole is done 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.970
 maybe even a front disadvantage if 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.500
 he works with color look up table and 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.900
 for example now so a look 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.420
 then you are not able to create 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.100
 to change that look because of the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.049
 does not exist from me so actually 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.840
 consists of several levels 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.670
 but if you turn that into a look up table 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.350
 summarizes camenisch more change 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.149
 there is the advantage in actions if 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.320
 now all the whole levels have then 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.240
 Of course, the individual could be there 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.159
 setting level still vary 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.540
 so you have to decide with water 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.110
 wanted to work I'll show you now 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.200
 The way I prefer color myself 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.790
 look up table because it's just solid lux 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.409
 they will not change the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.200
 are used specifically in pictures 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.790
 So you need the background layer 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.350
 and if at the same time cooperate 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.580
 want with c6 or older 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.570
 Zion is no problem at all 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.010
 he does not need any behind and 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.350
 background level but just 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.720
 a level and now you create yourself 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.130
 a look and here it is important and 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.830
 that's just his reason 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.330
 recommendation that he finish 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.550
 or that you have the look with at least 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.600
 five setting level creates the 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.240
 I'll just put one like that 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.130
 space is still the same equal why 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.460
 means a lynx should be out at least 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.770
 five different attitude level 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.990
 exist and an adjustment level 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.980
 should be at least in a particular 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.720
 be film method 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.730
 how does that look in practice? 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.190
 start now to create look 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.950
 Now, no matter how the look at the end 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.990
 I'll just create it now 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.870
 my color losermann endem something little 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.780
 then namely a tone value correction and 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.640
 makes the deeps a little bit lighter 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.980
 then an attitude level 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.750
 black white and now watch out now 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.220
 This attitude level is set in 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.410
 the film method soft light 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.020
 so perhaps reduce this here 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.160
 little bit the mind 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.520
 Now I'm still in the selective 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.760
 color correction and will be the example 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.210
 shades of gray and still yellow 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.940
 times 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.550
 it does not matter what i do 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.130
 Now we are exactly one more 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.800
 gradation curve do the times here 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.160
 deepen a bit bluish 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.220
 the lights a bit more yellowish 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.020
 now I have here 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.670
 12345 adjustment level and at least 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.680
 an attitude level has the for 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.920
 method in case of tail light or one 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.750
 other way why if we do that 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.510
 Save all now as a look 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.890
 then we want to create a look 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.750
 Do not imitate others so fast 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.510
 if a look can only look like one 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.430
 there is something wrong 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.560
 means that he is bad you can him 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.000
 relatively easy to copy if you but 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.550
 a look had failed 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.530
 attitude level exists and then too 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.330
 still different film methods now 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.930
 incredibly difficult to look after 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.270
 So if you are now with actions 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.430
 the action could stop the action 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.200
 give a name to the action and then have it 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.270
 your finished look if you are now 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.280
 save the whole as a look up table 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.630
 volt he marks the last level and 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.210
 the first level with pressed shift 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.569
 button 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:33.710
 and then goes to export file and 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:36.349
 then choose color lookup tables and 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.630
 here in the first dialog you would have 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:41.539
 you can see that everything clicked 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.050
 I choose only 3 dl so 3d lut 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:46.970
 files that country actually needs you 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.440
 even here can not give a name 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.930
 but you do not have to be in it yet 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.930
 next dialog is there it is important 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.430
 that he gives the whole one name to me 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.080
 Save the whole time now on mine 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.590
 desktop and now call it simple 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.530
 times the demo luxor and I secure the 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.080
 file and now it is important that you 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.449
 this file in the right folder 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.660
 push so I'll go now 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:14.120
 my demo look copy and go 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.400
 now in my program folder and in the 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.810
 program folder you must now in 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.400
 photoshop then go into presets and at 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.050
 the Presets you will find a folder of 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:30.289
 is called 3d lutz and here comes the now 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.849
 purely copy and paste paste yes 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.430
 that was it 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:37.070
 that means if you are new photoshop now 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.830
 starts then you have the same look 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:43.400
 he just created that is then 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.800
 in here in the 36 where mine now 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.690
 another picture are lux in it and that was 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.969
 Actually, that's how it's done 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.240
 own lux as we can go in here 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:55.550
 color low carb then here and then 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.009
 can you blow your look this is eg 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.050
 another logan matlok and yes I have 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.759
 there are a few different ones and that is 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.830
 then a picture of not more 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.150
 After that, it can be done by putting it in 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.960
 look up table is you can really do it 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.849
 do not change anymore 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.670
 but you decide that with actions 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.670
 want to do or with 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.340
 with look up table or even in rom with 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.890
 presets in lightroom but you have now 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.750
 a little bit about how one belongs 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.580
 best in look so created with am 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.530
 best with several factors that one 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.730
 can not imitate him too well 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:30.670
 small tip still at the end and that her 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.920
 theoretically so can the look 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:36.580
 create with color look up table the 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:39.220
 works only in cc but can also use 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.610
 with older versions stop already from 26 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.290
 it means if not test version now 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.820
 htc then you can the whole lux 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.670
 create and then use in anyway 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.530
 all version but exactly create 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.570
 just in cc 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:54.540
 okay that's it that has been often 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.410
 asked how to do such a look up table 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.870
 I hope the result has you 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.020
 fallen and then we'll see soon 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.020
 again
