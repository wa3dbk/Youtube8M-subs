you hook it up to a plug because this is
12<00:00:14.759> volt<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.360> will<00:00:15.480> only<00:00:15.630> work<00:00:15.780> by<00:00:16.109> 12<00:00:16.379> volt

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
12 volt and it will only work by 12 volt

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.460 
12 volt and it will only work by 12 volt
and<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.550> wall<00:00:17.699> plugs<00:00:18.000> at<00:00:18.150> our<00:00:18.240> homes<00:00:18.449> are<00:00:18.660> 120

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
and the wall plugs at our homes are 120

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.990 
and the wall plugs at our homes are 120
volts<00:00:20.420> so<00:00:21.420> what<00:00:22.260> do<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.250> take<00:00:23.279> your

age by 2 or something the rest of the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.560 
age by 2 or something the rest of the
wires<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.890> taped<00:01:29.460> off<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> side<00:01:30.329> because

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
wires I taped off on the side because

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.969

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the way I have done so and you take the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.090 
the way I have done so and you take the
only<00:01:44.670> yellow<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.329> exists<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.860> cut

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
only yellow that exists here and you cut

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.020 
only yellow that exists here and you cut
it<00:01:47.130> out<00:01:47.399> as<00:01:47.610> well<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.180> I've<00:01:48.570> done<00:01:49.670> after<00:01:50.670> doing

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
this the next thing you do is you will

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.459 
this the next thing you do is you will
find<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.340> will<00:01:56.579> look<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.360> only<00:01:57.540> green<00:01:58.170> in

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
find you will look for the only green in

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.789 
find you will look for the only green in

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
here then the only green is the one

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.730 
here then the only green is the one
right<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.729> I've<00:02:02.880> cut<00:02:03.119> out<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:04.320> next

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
right here that I've cut out the next

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.330 
and you pick out the black so as you can
see<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.090> diagonal<00:02:16.480> from<00:02:16.750> this<00:02:17.140> green<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.800> this

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
see the diagonal from this green is this

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.060 
see the diagonal from this green is this
black<00:02:18.640> right<00:02:18.880> here<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:19.930> cut<00:02:20.230> out<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.440> only

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
black right here so you cut out the only

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.790 
black right here so you cut out the only
green<00:02:21.490> in<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.730> diagonal<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.560> black

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
green in the diagonal to that the black

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.930 
green in the diagonal to that the black
cut<00:02:24.700> those<00:02:24.940> two<00:02:25.240> out<00:02:25.890> what<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.070> do<00:02:27.190> with<00:02:27.400> those

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
cut those two out what you do with those

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.960 
cut those two out what you do with those
I<00:02:27.970> had<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:29.110> guys<00:02:29.440> cut<00:02:29.770> out<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.220> then<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.730> put

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
I had this guys cut out and then I put

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.570 
I had this guys cut out and then I put
them<00:02:31.060> together<00:02:31.320> you<00:02:32.320> must<00:02:32.590> connect<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.250> green

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
them together you must connect the green

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.330 
them together you must connect the green
on<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.880> diagonal<00:02:34.420> black<00:02:34.750> with<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.890> green<00:02:36.130> you

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
on the diagonal black with the green you

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.310 
on the diagonal black with the green you
must<00:02:36.580> connect<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.210> together<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.900> must<00:02:38.050> be

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
must connect this together it must be

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.040 
must connect this together it must be
like<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.530> bridge<00:02:39.720> now<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.950> next<00:02:42.280> thing<00:02:42.460> you<00:02:42.670> do

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
like a bridge now the next thing you do

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.990 
like a bridge now the next thing you do
you<00:02:44.050> we<00:02:44.260> must<00:02:44.530> connect<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.520> yellow<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.910> the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
you we must connect the yellow of the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000 
you we must connect the yellow of the
black<00:02:46.270> to<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.810> stereo<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:47.710> is<00:02:47.830> the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
black to the stereo this is the

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.900 
black to the stereo this is the
powerlines

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
powerlines

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.290 
powerlines
so<00:02:49.720> let's<00:02:50.590> pull<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.010> stereo<00:02:51.460> in<00:02:51.580> here<00:02:51.820> let's

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
so let's pull the stereo in here let's

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.960 
so let's pull the stereo in here let's
start<00:02:52.600> connecting<00:02:52.930> it's<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.680> easy<00:02:53.860> okay

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.140 

this<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.570> stereo<00:02:59.080> black<00:02:59.380> this<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.430> PSU

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
this is the stereo black this is the PSU

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.120 
this is the stereo black this is the PSU
black<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.590> they<00:03:03.130> go<00:03:03.310> together<00:03:04.650> we<00:03:05.650> put<00:03:05.950> those

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
black and they go together we put those

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.350 
black and they go together we put those
together<00:03:07.470> this<00:03:08.470> is<00:03:08.620> just<00:03:08.890> temporary<00:03:09.700> because

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
together this is just temporary because

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.560
