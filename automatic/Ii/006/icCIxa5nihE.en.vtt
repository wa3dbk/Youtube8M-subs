00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.090
 Sometimes we like to be alone sometimes 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:12.500

 and something as simple as a sport 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.490
 It is always a game 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.410
 like the football 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.250
 that story started in 1936 in 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.250
 Spain ' civil war was announced 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.980
 how all wars are announced with 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.620
 bombs 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.130
 the world changed in one of those 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.590

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.590
 fields was buried among rubble 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.980
 he survived Alejandro got lucky and 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.750
 they helped and he could get to a hospital 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.130
 where I would have a long recovery 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.460
 together with other young people and children 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.290
 children who like him did not want to give up 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.269
 the little things that still made them 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.600
 have fun having fun 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.840
 he was called a finisterre as his 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.469
 town and alejandro liked alejandro 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.469
 finisterre 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.829
 Alejandro wanted to imagine for his 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.079
 companions a game had to look like 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.329

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.000
 football and could be played at any 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.579
 place and everyone could play it even 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.399
 those who could not run after a ball 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:38.179
 -alejandro imagine the table football and what 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.179
 patented in 1937 a Spanish invention 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.899
 the war pushed Alexander out of 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.350
 Spain- crossing the Pyrenees and more 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.460

 but Alejandro never forgot the table football 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.329
 nor the good times with their 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.250
 Hospital mates years later 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.860
 retook the project and manufactured 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.750
 industrially the table football filling 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.090
 our world with its tables and its 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.690
 making dolls children and older 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.610
 gather around the same idea 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.410

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.000
 with its sounds with its magic 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.040
 the communications have been reinvented and 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.890
 now we look in another direction we look 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.990
 new forms of leisure global games in 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.210
 those that can be played at a distance without 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.640
 share a physical space without having 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.060

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.900
 Internet makes us closer but 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:46.340

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.100
 with the same changes that have gone 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.100
 leading to oblivion 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.890

 we all play we all have fun 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.169

 procedures to recover each 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.230
 machine at the end of its cycle to 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.340
 reuse components ensuring the 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.340
 minimal ecological impact 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.499

 with special needs and the last 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.009
 third goes to projects 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.460

 at the beginning of each game 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.840
 a coin three thirds a hundred percent 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.300
 of the collection is intended for 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.700
 social and humanitarian and this happens 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.800
 with absolute transparency your currency 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.750
 generates a game the competition and that 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.180
 heading enters the coin in the piggy bank 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:35.210
