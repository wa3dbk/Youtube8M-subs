00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.189
 do not 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.910
 now 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.000
 the follower of the fabian radioshack 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.660
 canceled will also remain sustained and 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.419
 ask sick sit here 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.029
 autographed for that and nothing now we're going 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.640
 to go back to see if we can 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.449
 see in various parts and and for the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.449
 high recorder 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.510
 in cycling 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.129
 has a great variety of emotions 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.180
 then there are mountain stages 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.140
 especially intense there 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.820
 Counter-loops like the one that 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.360
 we had yesterday in which also the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.699
 emotions are especially 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.800
 especially intense but most 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.300
 characteristic I think it's the great 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.390
 variety of emotions that I can have 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.060
 both during 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.149
 all the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.810
 turn of twenty one stages even 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.730
 during the same day 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.330
 with the changes you are taking the 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.330
 to the race 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.170
 it was the slow and dark 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.880
 and then in cases like the workshop that 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.530
 we arrived and we marked the best time 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.780
 until until the equipment comes to 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.110
 we obviously beat him is more with the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.720
 hope of being able to win and aspire to 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.470
 get leader challenge after there is there 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.120
 a lot of attention a lot of illusion 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.750
 nerves allows nerves directors 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.300
 also in addition to living also 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.210
 the emotions in a very intense way 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.310
 and very varied are those who at the same 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:06.160
 time we have to try to control 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:08.679
 those emotions and that also to the best 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.130
 the joy when you win a stage 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.850
 when you win a round when that 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.180
 moment is that moment yes I think it is 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.180
 indescribable 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.160
 and there are about 10-15 seconds that do not 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.300
 you can control it is different because 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.520
 sometimes you still go in the getaway 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.840
 then you know you're going to win but what 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.640
 more living little by little little by little and 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.400
 already in the final moment is already when 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.320
 you already confirm everything but what's different 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.390
 for example are very nice the 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.270
 sprint victories and they are very nice 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.250
 victories in the team time trials 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.120
 because in the end it is a modality in the 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.740
 that everyone always brings in you 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.420
 same is characterized by being a 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.400
 sport that everyone brings in 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.990
 every moment but if it fits more in that 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.990
 type of situations 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.710
 which also has two companions 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.120
 also something that is late 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.120
 no no no
