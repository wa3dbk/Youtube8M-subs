00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
basically the first step was recording

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.380 
basically the first step was recording
sound<00:00:21.900> from<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.109> game<00:00:22.760> you<00:00:23.760> played<00:00:24.000> for<00:00:24.210> two

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
sound from the game you played for two

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.099 
sound from the game you played for two
hours<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:25.260> had<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> list<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:26.509> sounds<00:00:27.509> that<00:00:27.720> we

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
hours we had a list of sounds that we

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.599 
hours we had a list of sounds that we
knew<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.470> want<00:00:28.679> to<00:00:28.769> record<00:00:29.099> from<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.369> game

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
knew we want to record from the game

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.570 
knew we want to record from the game
after<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.480> finished<00:00:30.810> by<00:00:31.070> opening<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> logic

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.580 
after we finished by opening the logic

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.270 
after we finished by opening the logic
made<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> project<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.140> whole<00:00:34.469> new<00:00:34.649> BF<00:00:34.950> 3

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
made a project for a whole new BF 3

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.580 
made a project for a whole new BF 3
samples<00:00:35.719> started<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.840> cut<00:00:37.020> sample<00:00:37.440> by<00:00:37.559> sample

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
samples started to cut sample by sample

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.459 
samples started to cut sample by sample
and<00:00:38.280> bouncing<00:00:38.730> into<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.000> folder<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.750> called<00:00:40.320> it

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
and bouncing into a folder I called it

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.340 
and bouncing into a folder I called it
the<00:00:40.620> view<00:00:40.920> free<00:00:41.160> samples<00:00:41.809> ok<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.050> second

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
the view free samples ok so the second

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.779 
the view free samples ok so the second
step<00:00:43.500> was<00:00:43.680> given<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.039> video<00:00:44.280> some<00:00:44.489> kind<00:00:44.700> of

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
step was given the video some kind of

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.470 
step was given the video some kind of
style<00:00:45.120> some<00:00:45.450> kind<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:46.219> atmosphere<00:00:47.219> using<00:00:48.030> all

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
style some kind of atmosphere using all

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.110 
style some kind of atmosphere using all
kinds<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.899> ambient<00:00:49.379> sound<00:00:52.039> and<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.609> knew<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.820> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
kinds of ambient sound and I knew that I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.209 
kinds of ambient sound and I knew that I
at<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.480> end<00:00:54.600> wanted<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> song<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.859> I<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.129> put

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
at the end wanted a song so I just put

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.170 
at the end wanted a song so I just put
like<00:00:56.660> like<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> sample<00:00:58.500> song<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.699> after<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
like like a sample song and after the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.119 
like like a sample song and after the
group<00:01:00.690> channels<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.199> be<00:01:01.289> music<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.039> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
group channels to be music for it it's a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.100 
group channels to be music for it it's a
cool<00:01:02.340> fact<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.760> did<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.480> was

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
cool fact that I did on this one was

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.220 
cool fact that I did on this one was
using<00:01:04.800> two<00:01:04.949> oscillators<00:01:05.160> for<00:01:05.870> the<00:01:06.870> explosion

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
using two oscillators for the explosion

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.670 
using two oscillators for the explosion
when<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> tank<00:01:08.550> shoot<00:01:08.820> at<00:01:08.940> me<00:01:09.050> the<00:01:10.050> first<00:01:10.440> one

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
when the tank shoot at me the first one

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.070 
when the tank shoot at me the first one
was<00:01:10.710> low<00:01:11.370> and<00:01:11.400> me<00:01:11.760> making<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.450> safe<00:01:12.780> sound

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
was low and me making that safe sound

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.350 
was low and me making that safe sound
and<00:01:13.410> the<00:01:14.010> high<00:01:14.160> end

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and the high end

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.020 
and the high end
feedback<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.470> your<00:01:16.710> ears<00:01:16.860> after<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.730> hear<00:01:17.880> an

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
feedback in your ears after you hear an

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.230 
feedback in your ears after you hear an
explosion<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.690> VF<00:01:19.140> three<00:01:23.120> also<00:01:24.120> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
explosion on the VF three also the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.910 
explosion on the VF three also the
explosion<00:01:24.750> at<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.870> end<00:01:25.140> took<00:01:25.590> me<00:01:25.710> some<00:01:25.890> time

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
explosion at the end took me some time

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.360 
explosion at the end took me some time
there<00:01:26.370> I<00:01:27.050> used<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.170> lot<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.410> layers<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.220> lot

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
there I used a lot of layers and a lot

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.710 
there I used a lot of layers and a lot
of<00:01:29.400> e<00:01:29.880> queuing<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.720> side<00:01:31.620> chaining<00:01:32.720> between

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
of e queuing and side chaining between

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.800 
of e queuing and side chaining between
channels<00:01:34.620> like<00:01:35.100> making<00:01:35.520> sound<00:01:36.000> more<00:01:36.300> dynamic

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
channels like making sound more dynamic

master asleep and we connect ourselves

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.100 
master asleep and we connect ourselves
through<00:02:31.980> Wi-Fi<00:02:32.310> or<00:02:32.760> ethernet<00:02:32.940> cable<00:02:33.690> if<00:02:33.840> you

shaky sometimes but then i want to talk
about<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.170> base<00:02:52.410> in<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.920> in<00:02:53.190> this<00:02:53.370> track<00:02:53.730> i

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
about it the base in the in this track i

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.850 
about it the base in the in this track i
used<00:02:54.360> like<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:55.140> gate<00:02:55.620> with<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.700> side<00:02:57.120> chain

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
used like a a gate with the side chain

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.830 
used like a a gate with the side chain
like<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.220> there<00:02:59.459> i<00:02:59.790> had<00:03:00.090> like<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.330> streaming

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
like and there i had like a streaming

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.620 
like and there i had like a streaming
sound<00:03:01.709> from<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.160> base<00:03:02.489> like<00:03:02.880> without<00:03:03.209> their

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
sound from the base like without their

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.610 
sound from the base like without their
beats<00:03:03.930> or<00:03:04.290> anything<00:03:04.830> like<00:03:04.860> very

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
triggering for something very rhythmic

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:25.710 
triggering for something very rhythmic
like<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.840> like<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.349> I<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:24.360> so<00:03:25.360> in<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.540> rest

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
like a like a and I it so in the rest

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.309 
like a like a and I it so in the rest
part<00:03:26.250> first<00:03:27.250> as<00:03:27.640> we<00:03:27.790> said<00:03:28.060> we<00:03:28.269> designed<00:03:29.170> the

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
part first as we said we designed the

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.309 
part first as we said we designed the
bits<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:30.069> start<00:03:30.819> as<00:03:31.120> regular<00:03:31.540> bit<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:31.959> then<00:03:32.110> go

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
bits to start as regular bit and then go

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.809 
bits to start as regular bit and then go
to<00:03:32.349> the<00:03:33.299> build-up<00:03:34.299> and<00:03:34.629> then<00:03:34.659> we<00:03:35.379> added<00:03:35.819> most

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
to the build-up and then we added most

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.699 
to the build-up and then we added most
of<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.180> sounds<00:03:37.720> which<00:03:37.840> were<00:03:38.019> already<00:03:38.349> playing

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
of the sounds which were already playing

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.050 
of the sounds which were already playing
like<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.280> bass<00:03:39.519> sounds<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:41.099> we<00:03:42.099> add<00:03:42.340> it<00:03:42.400> to

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
like the bass sounds and we add it to

00:03:43.060 --> 00:04:18.099 
like the bass sounds and we add it to
all<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.359> that<00:03:44.010> specific<00:03:46.200> sweep<00:03:47.200> sound

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.699 

yeah<00:04:18.889> actually<00:04:19.219> that<00:04:19.549> was<00:04:19.849> the<00:04:20.060> best<00:04:20.359> way<00:04:20.719> for

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
yeah actually that was the best way for

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.760 
yeah actually that was the best way for
creating<00:04:22.340> like<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.849> day<00:04:23.419> envelope<00:04:24.199> bass

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
creating like the day envelope bass

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.730 
creating like the day envelope bass
sounds<00:04:25.490> you<00:04:25.639> know<00:04:25.669> because<00:04:26.270> we<00:04:26.599> wanted<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.560> do

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
sounds you know because we wanted to do

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.490 
sounds you know because we wanted to do
it<00:04:27.830> fast<00:04:28.159> this<00:04:28.639> is<00:04:28.789> one<00:04:28.969> thing<00:04:29.270> about<00:04:29.539> the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
it fast this is one thing about the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.709 
it fast this is one thing about the
projects<00:04:30.979> there<00:04:31.159> with<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.729> there<00:04:32.240> is<00:04:32.330> a<00:04:32.419> canal

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:32.719 
projects there with the there is a canal

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:35.110 
projects there with the there is a canal
we<00:04:32.900> all<00:04:33.050> always<00:04:33.349> want<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:34.009> we<00:04:34.280> get<00:04:34.460> things<00:04:34.789> like

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
we all always want to we get things like

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.619 
we all always want to we get things like
a<00:04:35.150> one<00:04:35.719> hour<00:04:35.900> yeah<00:04:36.830> whatever<00:04:37.759> they<00:04:38.000> finish<00:04:38.389> and

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:38.629 
a one hour yeah whatever they finish and

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:40.959 
a one hour yeah whatever they finish and
you<00:04:38.840> wanted<00:04:39.229> a<00:04:39.349> monitor<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:39.770> happen<00:04:40.490> like<00:04:40.669> real

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:40.969 
you wanted a monitor to happen like real

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.209 
you wanted a monitor to happen like real
fast<00:04:41.330> you<00:04:41.539> know<00:04:41.719> yes<00:04:42.259> so<00:04:42.560> we<00:04:42.710> don't<00:04:42.919> have<00:04:43.009> a<00:04:43.069> lot

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:43.219 
fast you know yes so we don't have a lot

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:45.939 
fast you know yes so we don't have a lot
of<00:04:43.400> time<00:04:43.729> to<00:04:43.969> think<00:04:44.479> about<00:04:45.139> many<00:04:45.860> different

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
of time to think about many different

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.029 
of time to think about many different
ways<00:04:46.550> to<00:04:46.909> do<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.360> we<00:04:47.569> just<00:04:47.840> need<00:04:48.349> to<00:04:48.439> lock<00:04:48.620> up<00:04:48.830> on

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
ways to do it we just need to lock up on

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.760 
ways to do it we just need to lock up on
one<00:04:49.280> just<00:04:50.060> when<00:04:50.419> I<00:04:50.449> didn't<00:04:50.779> go<00:04:50.960> just<00:04:51.590> go<00:04:51.740> with

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
one just when I didn't go just go with

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.790 
one just when I didn't go just go with
it<00:04:51.979> is<00:04:52.430> quite<00:04:52.699> interesting<00:04:53.210> way<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.139> work<00:04:54.560> you

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
it is quite interesting way to work you

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.519 
it is quite interesting way to work you
know<00:04:54.949> because<00:04:55.370> you<00:04:55.870> you<00:04:56.870> find<00:04:57.050> yourself<00:04:57.469> using

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:57.529 
know because you you find yourself using

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.820 
know because you you find yourself using
the<00:04:58.189> the<00:04:58.550> tools<00:04:58.789> that<00:04:58.939> you<00:04:59.210> know<00:04:59.419> and<00:04:59.830> it's

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
the the tools that you know and it's

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.539 
the the tools that you know and it's
like<00:05:00.919> going<00:05:01.490> out<00:05:01.729> for<00:05:02.029> a<00:05:02.090> combo
