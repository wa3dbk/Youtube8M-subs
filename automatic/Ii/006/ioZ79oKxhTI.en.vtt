let<00:05:31.669> you<00:05:31.820> in<00:05:31.970> on<00:05:32.120> something<00:05:32.800> not<00:05:33.800> even<00:05:34.010> I<00:05:34.280> know

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
let you in on something not even I know

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.300 
let you in on something not even I know
why<00:05:35.090> they've<00:05:35.330> gone<00:05:35.570> amok<00:05:35.960> but<00:05:36.650> they<00:05:36.830> appear<00:05:37.250> to

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
why they've gone amok but they appear to

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.779 
why they've gone amok but they appear to
be<00:05:37.520> following<00:05:37.849> a<00:05:38.210> leader<00:05:39.130> leader<00:05:42.760> well<00:05:43.760> I

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
be following a leader leader well I

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.610 
be following a leader leader well I
guess<00:05:44.180> for<00:05:44.389> now<00:05:44.450> we'll<00:05:44.810> buy<00:05:44.990> that<00:05:45.169> Eggman

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
guess for now we'll buy that Eggman

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.400 
guess for now we'll buy that Eggman
isn't<00:05:46.070> involved

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
isn't involved

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.400 
isn't involved
hmm<00:05:48.460> so<00:05:49.460> maybe<00:05:49.760> that<00:05:50.210> has<00:05:50.539> nothing<00:05:50.960> to<00:05:50.990> do<00:05:51.380> with

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
hmm so maybe that has nothing to do with

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.170 
hmm so maybe that has nothing to do with
the<00:05:51.770> robots<00:05:52.190> that<00:05:52.340> attacked<00:05:52.820> us<00:05:55.030> where<00:05:56.030> did

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
the robots that attacked us where did

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.920 
the robots that attacked us where did
you<00:05:56.300> get<00:05:56.450> that

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.170 

so<00:06:01.680> you<00:06:01.740> were<00:06:02.070> holding<00:06:02.550> out<00:06:02.669> on<00:06:02.699> us<00:06:03.150> Eggman

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
so you were holding out on us Eggman

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.300 
so you were holding out on us Eggman
spill<00:06:06.180> everything<00:06:06.479> you<00:06:06.780> know<00:06:06.990> now<00:06:10.190> very<00:06:11.190> well

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
spill everything you know now very well

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.450 
spill everything you know now very well
I'll<00:06:11.940> tell<00:06:12.270> you<00:06:14.930> all<00:06:15.930> robot<00:06:16.590> activity<00:06:17.130> within

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
I'll tell you all robot activity within

the perfect computer but as of a few
days<00:06:30.120> ago<00:06:30.360> I've<00:06:30.870> been<00:06:30.930> unable<00:06:31.380> to<00:06:31.680> control<00:06:32.370> it

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
days ago I've been unable to control it

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.310 
days ago I've been unable to control it
remotely

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320
