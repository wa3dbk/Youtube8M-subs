00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.590
 have invited here to the interview is 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.330
 the most important thing and the questions that the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.940
 people have done through the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.990
 social networks facebook twitter es 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.320
 sharif 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.090
 you are from emiliano zapata or from xalapa 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.130
 well look I was born in Xalapa but I have 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.040
 and about 4 years living in the 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.120
 municipality because it is better not to look for 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.039
 mayoralty by xalapa 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.500
 well I have enough time 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.000
 touring the municipality of emiliano 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.280
 zapata we have done a job 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.719
 extraordinary by means of then as 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.910
 Assistant general secretary of the party 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.190
 we have already traveled several times 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.430
 the 42 communities as distributing 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.079
 toys handing out some other things 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.690
 negotiations resolving some 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.030
 problematic of the municipality and the same 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.979
 people of the municipality is the one that then 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.570
 has asked us to represent them what 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.759
 it seemed the management that carried out the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.160
 municipal president I think Carlos 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.619
 ernesto did an extraordinary job 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.710
 the truth is that the needs 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.450
 of the municipality are enough and then it is not 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.399
 can meet absolutely everything 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.690
 but I think he despite the little 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.280
 resource he had in the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.630
 municipality did an extraordinary job 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.420
 I had to make a 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.380
 more in- depth review because then later 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.679
 people make comments without knowing the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.030
 true reason and work that also 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.440
 then it is not seen because they are forty two 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.509
 communities and are far from being 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.550
 one the third municipality I think with 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.320
 greater territorial extension in veracruz 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.310
 then it is difficult 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.650
 the degree of progress or work of some 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.660
 mayor no but I have walked the 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.860
 42 communities I can tell you that if you have 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.870
 done an extraordinary job 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.130
 proposed three days regarding the 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.619
 caring for the animals in this 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.220
 municipality that would be emiliano zapata 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:10.560
 well in fact we have can already a 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.020
 farm that has our friend Gabriel 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.240
 contreras there is in Chavarrillo this 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.010
 is doing a zoo type and good 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.980
 We have our friends from the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.709
 animals that huguet carbonell has 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.870
 good that civil association and careful 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.790
 because the puppies are doing 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.760
 done on the boy they donated a term 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.400
 where it's going to be there, is he his 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.750
 law habitat for kittens 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.390
 puppies and everyone who does 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.150
 abandoned and also campaigns 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.000
 this sterilization and vaccination for 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.160
 the animals not then I think so 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.350
 following and supporting these works 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.510
 What do people do, I think we're going to 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.820
 to be able to have an extraordinary 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.640
 care to the people assistant secretary 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.650
 of the institutional revolutionary party 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.650
 what exactly is its function 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.709
 the performances good I am secretary 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.180
 general advisor of the state pri and therefore 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.239
 I performed all the activities that 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.590
 my president entrusts me 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.780
 erick lakes hernandez that rightly 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.970
 directs our party the truth is that 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.189
 he is a very enthusiastic young man who has 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.280
 I traveled throughout the state but also 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:19.140
 we work 24 by 24 all day 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.299
 he leaves very late from the office and there 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.650
 we are with him this, supporting him in 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.280
 the steps he asks us to attend 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:30.359
 but personally, they assigned me 5 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.639
 municipalities 6 municipalities east close to 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.720
 xalapa her from other secretaries because 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.000
 there are other secretaries in the party 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.950
 adjuncts also assigned them this as 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.359
 commission and we support the this 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.859
 presidents of our party because in 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.450
 some steps or some things that are 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.879
 they will treat you, we will enter 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.319
 to solve what are those 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.450
 municipalities that belong to you in 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.329
 verify then we have 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.270
 jilotepec coatepec only in subtract and 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.700
 guayacán 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.849
 coatzintla 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.610
 banderilla and emiliano zapata proposed 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.800
 you would bring your in case you come to 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.989
 have the candidacy for president 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.910
 municipal because I, but before 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.379
 nothing to tell you that for the 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.400
 needs are enough but I feel 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.440
 that the one that covers a lot little squeezes 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.870
 I think we should go into the subject 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.850
 of education this will boost the 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.130
 education because that is a reality that 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.109
 you do not imagine the amount of things 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.180
 that parents do not 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.370
 the communities the parents and 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.229
 they make ernest they already do raffles and they do 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.210
 of everything to be able to support your 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.689
 children have a quality education and 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.699
 On the other hand, there is the issue of 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:38.599
 of employment we need to encourage the 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:41.749
 employment and in that employment issue as a 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:43.489
 special topic then strengthen the field 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:45.139
 so that the ejidatarios can 

00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:47.959
 recover their farms and that 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.759
 peasants to have work again and for 

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:51.739
 On the other hand, you can give 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.929
 enter a medium shoe because the 

00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:56.719
 industry and that people can have 

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:58.009
 also jobs that way still together 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.449
 with against the industry opens a 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.969
 training institute so that the 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.469
 people can be trained for work 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:06.050
 not that I can have a decent job with 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:09.139
 a living wage also something very 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.550
 important territorially as you see the 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.360
 growth in the municipality of emiliano 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.769
 zapata, I think it 's those 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.289
 real estate companies so what 

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:19.789
 they pretend it is this then to be placed here in 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.959
 the municipality of definitely me 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.209
 xalapa because he does not have where to 

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:25.489
 grow and then the logical growth is 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:27.829
 in the shoe what you lose there 

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:31.369
 to do planning so that 

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:33.829
 the new constructions the new ones 

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:35.210
 real estate companies that stabilize here in 

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:36.949
 the municipality 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:41.470
 and establish here in the municipality then 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.470
 have this correctly so your 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.020
 well planned not your streets go up to 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.910
 that everything so then later more 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.250
 forward, it will not happen that 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.190
 same as in other municipalities with the 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.450
 traffic and these other things that you can 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.370
 say about politicians 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.500
 impuntuales I think we have to respect 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.270
 you have to respect the times of the people 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.580
 so important is your job as is the 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.170
 work of others and I think that because 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.450
 Although the agenda has to be 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.920
 tight is tight because I think that 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.170
 we must defend the priority also to 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.750
 people are not going to be being respectful of 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:15.480
 time in what way people can 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.060
 identify you with a person 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.090
 humble and loyal is not the values ​​that 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.430
 I think you have to take in the 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.260
 pennant on the flag that one with the 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.230
 that one walks and it is humility and 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.140
 slow that message would send to all the 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:34.050
 people from the municipality of emiliano zapata 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:36.390
 So it's time for a change and 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.770
 I think we 're going to get it and together 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.770
 it's how we can get it
