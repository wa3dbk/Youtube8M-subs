00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.360 
remember what do you bet it was but it
was<00:02:25.379> like<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.530> first<00:02:25.739> place<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.099> he<00:02:26.220> also

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
was like a first place that he also

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.309 
was like a first place that he also
played<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.879> while<00:02:27.060> back<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.569> think<00:02:28.200> it's

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.650 
played this a while back I think it's
very<00:02:28.379> interesting<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:29.250> maybe<00:02:30.120> it's<00:02:30.300> just<00:02:30.360> a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
very interesting so maybe it's just a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.809 
very interesting so maybe it's just a
card<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.959> personal<00:02:31.410> choice<00:02:31.620> as<00:02:31.860> i<00:02:32.280> said<00:02:32.489> i<00:02:32.519> did

however<00:02:37.140> i<00:02:37.380> have<00:02:37.590> been<00:02:38.040> reading<00:02:38.190> some<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.489> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
however i have been reading some of the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.800 
however i have been reading some of the
stuff<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.819> people<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.209> been<00:02:39.300> saying<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.780> I

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
stuff that people have been saying so I

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.770 
stuff that people have been saying so I
do<00:02:39.930> have<00:02:40.049> some<00:02:40.410> knowledge<00:02:40.590> on<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:41.010> um<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.910> yeah

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
do have some knowledge on it um and yeah

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.160 
do have some knowledge on it um and yeah
so<00:02:43.049> we<00:02:43.230> have<00:02:43.379> one<00:02:43.799> course<00:02:44.390> three<00:02:45.390> maxi<00:02:45.840> now<00:02:46.110> the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
so we have one course three maxi now the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.140 
so we have one course three maxi now the
reason<00:02:46.470> why<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.709> like<00:02:46.920> coors<00:02:47.190> up<00:02:47.459> personally<00:02:48.000> is

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
reason why I like coors up personally is

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.400 
reason why I like coors up personally is
because<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.480> gives<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:48.750> something<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:49.140> draw

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
because it gives you something to draw

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.650

everyone<00:03:53.819> probably<00:03:54.090> already<00:03:54.450> knows<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.810> and

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
everyone probably already knows that and

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.979 
everyone probably already knows that and
the<00:03:56.549> reason<00:03:56.760> why<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.060> like<00:03:57.299> it<00:03:57.329> in<00:03:57.569> this<00:03:57.750> deck<00:03:57.959> is

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
the reason why I like it in this deck is

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.050 
the reason why I like it in this deck is
because<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:58.560> deck<00:03:58.859> can<00:03:59.099> have<00:03:59.220> used<00:03:59.459> powerful

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
because this deck can have used powerful

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.319 
because this deck can have used powerful
XYZ<00:04:00.690> monsters<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.440> lot<00:04:01.859> like<00:04:02.190> we<00:04:02.670> have<00:04:02.849> powerful

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
XYZ monsters a lot like we have powerful

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.839 
XYZ monsters a lot like we have powerful
