00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
of the loadout and I usually like to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.560 
of the loadout and I usually like to
spectate<00:01:08.189> someone<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.790> see<00:01:08.970> right<00:01:09.000> here<00:01:09.210> I

spectate someone as you see right here I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
spectate someone as you see right here I
usually<00:01:10.049> spectate<00:01:10.470> someone<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.130> see

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
usually spectate someone so I can see

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.950 
usually spectate someone so I can see
where<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> person<00:01:12.060> got<00:01:12.210> infected<00:01:12.659> and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
where the person got infected and

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.080 
where the person got infected and
therefore<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> stay<00:01:14.010> away<00:01:14.189> from<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.520> area<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
therefore I stay away from that area and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.460 
therefore I stay away from that area and
I<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.210> pretty<00:01:15.600> much<00:01:15.720> stay<00:01:15.960> somewhere<00:01:16.320> else

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
I just pretty much stay somewhere else

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.350 
I just pretty much stay somewhere else
and<00:01:16.680> what's<00:01:17.100> cool<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.520> when<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.729> spectating

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and what's cool is when I spectating

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.120 
and what's cool is when I spectating
this<00:01:18.479> guy<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.840> guy<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.290> front<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.560> him<00:01:19.680> actually

not only that but always stick to the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.670 
not only that but always stick to the
sides<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.450> map<00:03:12.630> never<00:03:12.990> go<00:03:13.200> out<00:03:13.410> in<00:03:13.440> the

sides of the map never go out in the
open<00:03:14.070> and<00:03:14.220> try<00:03:14.460> to<00:03:14.520> fend<00:03:14.820> for<00:03:14.910> yourself<00:03:15.300> off

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
open and try to fend for yourself off

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.390 
open and try to fend for yourself off
you<00:03:15.750> need<00:03:16.080> an<00:03:16.200> open<00:03:16.560> area<00:03:16.980> where<00:03:17.160> there's

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
you need an open area where there's

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.460 
you need an open area where there's
probably<00:03:17.790> only<00:03:17.970> two<00:03:18.330> entrances<00:03:18.900> or<00:03:19.230> one

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
probably only two entrances or one

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.170 
probably only two entrances or one
entrance<00:03:19.890> where<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.130> infected<00:03:20.670> people<00:03:20.850> can

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
entrance where the infected people can

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.120 
entrance where the infected people can
come<00:03:21.420> towards<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.050> therefore<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.740> get<00:03:22.890> easy

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
come towards you therefore you get easy

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.950 
come towards you therefore you get easy
kills<00:03:23.490> and<00:03:23.700> there's<00:03:23.850> only<00:03:24.030> one<00:03:24.360> spot<00:03:24.690> where

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
kills and there's only one spot where

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.780 
kills and there's only one spot where
you<00:03:25.050> can<00:03:25.260> look<00:03:25.410> for<00:03:25.650> infected<00:03:26.310> people<00:03:26.460> to<00:03:26.610> come

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
you can look for infected people to come

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.940 
you can look for infected people to come
so<00:03:26.940> basically<00:03:27.270> just<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.630> recap<00:03:27.990> only<00:03:28.710> go<00:03:28.890> to

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
so basically just to recap only go to

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.400 
so basically just to recap only go to
spots<00:03:29.370> where<00:03:29.730> there's<00:03:30.600> probably<00:03:30.930> one<00:03:31.200> or<00:03:31.230> two

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
spots where there's probably one or two

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.740 
spots where there's probably one or two
ways<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.340> infected<00:03:33.120> people<00:03:33.360> can<00:03:33.600> come

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
ways that the infected people can come

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.090 
ways that the infected people can come
in<00:03:33.930> always<00:03:34.230> make<00:03:34.440> sure<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.770> have<00:03:34.920> people
