see but what I did to make it look even
more<00:02:40.730> realistic<00:02:41.299> is<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:42.019> cut<00:02:42.410> some<00:02:43.130> baby<00:02:43.400> hairs

and laid that down with some edge
control<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.630> makes<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:48.019> look<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.170> lot

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
control and that makes it look a lot

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.789 
control and that makes it look a lot
more<00:02:48.500> realistic<00:02:49.070> than<00:02:50.290> originally<00:02:51.290> but<00:02:51.440> even

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
more realistic than originally but even

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.130 
more realistic than originally but even

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
really believe they modified it drew has

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.869 
really believe they modified it drew has
been<00:03:23.659> around<00:03:23.870> for<00:03:24.739> a<00:03:24.769> while<00:03:24.920> she<00:03:24.980> is<00:03:25.370> not<00:03:25.700> new

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
been around for a while she is not new

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.580 
been around for a while she is not new
to<00:03:26.060> this<00:03:26.180> game<00:03:26.239> she's<00:03:26.720> been<00:03:26.870> around<00:03:27.140> forever

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
to this game she's been around forever

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.550 
to this game she's been around forever
and<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:28.760> believe<00:03:29.090> throughout<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.689> years<00:03:29.989> they

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
and I believe throughout the years they

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.589 
and I believe throughout the years they
made<00:03:30.950> some<00:03:31.159> modifications<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:32.030> her<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:32.420> there

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
made some modifications to her so there

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.589 
made some modifications to her so there
is<00:03:32.840> more<00:03:33.079> shape<00:03:33.409> to<00:03:33.439> her<00:03:33.799> so<00:03:34.549> if<00:03:34.849> you<00:03:35.000> have<00:03:35.239> an

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
is more shape to her so if you have an

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.220 
is more shape to her so if you have an
older<00:03:36.079> truly<00:03:36.530> like<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:37.010> had<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:38.750> might<00:03:38.930> want<00:03:39.170> to

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
older truly like I had you might want to

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.259 
older truly like I had you might want to
purchase<00:03:39.409> a<00:03:39.680> newer<00:03:39.920> one<00:03:40.189> because<00:03:40.760> they<00:03:41.239> have

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
purchase a newer one because they have

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.390 
purchase a newer one because they have
modified<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:42.049> some<00:03:42.439> and<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.799> modifications

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
modified it some and the modifications
