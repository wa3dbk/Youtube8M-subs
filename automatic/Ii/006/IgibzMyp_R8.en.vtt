hi in this video I'll show you how to do

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.789 
hi in this video I'll show you how to do
a<00:00:02.790> picture-in-picture<00:00:03.240> in<00:00:03.840> blender<00:00:04.200> in<00:00:04.410> a

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
a picture-in-picture in blender in a

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.680 
a picture-in-picture in blender in a
game<00:00:05.009> for<00:00:05.339> those<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.670> you<00:00:05.819> who<00:00:06.029> don't<00:00:06.210> know

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
game for those of you who don't know

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.009 
game for those of you who don't know
then<00:00:06.990> there<00:00:07.140> can<00:00:07.319> be<00:00:07.500> used<00:00:07.649> as<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:07.980> video<00:00:08.340> editor

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
then there can be used as a video editor

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.200 
then there can be used as a video editor
for<00:00:10.019> those<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.500> who<00:00:10.740> haven't<00:00:11.429> watched<00:00:11.849> yet

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
for those of you who haven't watched yet

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.780 
for those of you who haven't watched yet
the<00:00:12.630> previous<00:00:13.049> video<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:13.980> may<00:00:14.250> look<00:00:14.519> very

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
the previous video this may look very

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.240 
the previous video this may look very
bad<00:00:15.480> quality<00:00:15.719> but<00:00:16.199> there<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> reason<00:00:17.220> for

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
bad quality but there is a reason for

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.050 
bad quality but there is a reason for
that<00:00:17.520> we<00:00:17.789> reduce<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.510> preview<00:00:18.900> quality<00:00:19.109> to

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
that we reduce the preview quality to

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.810 
that we reduce the preview quality to
25%<00:00:21.060> that's<00:00:21.720> why<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:21.960> looks<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.820> lower

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
25% that's why this looks so lower

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.540 
25% that's why this looks so lower
resolution<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.529> if<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.800> miss<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> previous

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
resolution so if you miss the previous

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.820 
resolution so if you miss the previous
video<00:00:26.699> check<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.570> out<00:00:27.689> now<00:00:28.199> let's<00:00:28.410> see<00:00:28.590> how<00:00:28.769> we

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830

the<00:01:05.280> first<00:01:05.670> thing<00:01:05.820> probably<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> most

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the first thing probably one of the most

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.070 
the first thing probably one of the most
important<00:01:08.040> things<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:09.030> change<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.780> blend

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
important things is to change the blend

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.760 
important things is to change the blend
here<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.890> alpha<00:01:11.820> over<00:01:12.060> if<00:01:12.510> you're<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.500> seeing

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
here to alpha over if you're not seeing

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.039 
here to alpha over if you're not seeing
these<00:01:14.040> options<00:01:14.580> here<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.180> probably<00:01:15.780> means

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
these options here this probably means

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.929 
these options here this probably means
that<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> video<00:01:16.860> file<00:01:17.280> selected

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
that you have the video file selected

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.090 
that you have the video file selected
instead<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> effects<00:01:19.170> strip<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.920> make

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
instead of the effects strip so make

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.620 
instead of the effects strip so make
sure<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.490> right<00:01:20.820> click<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.330> effects

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
sure you right click on the effects

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
sure you right click on the effects
strip<00:01:21.900> then<00:01:22.080> change<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.590> plane<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.009> alpha

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
strip then change the plane to alpha

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.399 
strip then change the plane to alpha
over<00:01:23.430> also<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> are<00:01:24.659> not<00:01:24.869> seeing<00:01:25.140> these

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
over also if you are not seeing these

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.679 
over also if you are not seeing these
options<00:01:25.890> here<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.880> probably<00:01:27.270> means<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
options here this probably means that

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.770 
options here this probably means that
you<00:01:27.810> don't<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.290> properties<00:01:28.860> window

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.510 
you don't have the properties window
here<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.680> bring<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.040> out<00:01:32.250> with
