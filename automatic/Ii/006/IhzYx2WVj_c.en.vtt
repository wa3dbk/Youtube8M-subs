00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
loads and also looking for the fuel

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.630 
loads and also looking for the fuel
economy<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:20.810> this<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> system<00:00:22.640> basically

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
economy and this is the system basically

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.480 
economy and this is the system basically

so<00:00:29.369> I'll<00:00:29.429> built<00:00:29.640> into<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> one<00:00:30.119> unit<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.720> see

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
so I'll built into the one unit and see

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.290 
so I'll built into the one unit and see
the<00:00:31.019> water<00:00:31.410> cooling<00:00:31.769> lines<00:00:32.099> there<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the water cooling lines there is the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.870 
the water cooling lines there is the

start off with some fuel economy testing
and<00:01:45.280> maybe<00:01:46.280> do<00:01:46.460> some<00:01:46.490> towing<00:01:46.850> testing<00:01:47.390> later

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
and maybe do some towing testing later

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.640 
and maybe do some towing testing later
and<00:01:48.100> then<00:01:49.100> in<00:01:49.250> addition<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.670> all<00:01:49.820> that<00:01:50.650> we

and then in addition to all that we

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.140 
and then in addition to all that we
might<00:01:51.830> try<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:52.100> get<00:01:52.250> some<00:01:52.370> dyno<00:01:52.580> work<00:01:52.910> done

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
might try and get some dyno work done

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.630 
might try and get some dyno work done
sometime<00:01:53.600> today<00:01:53.810> with<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.110> bit<00:01:54.230> of<00:01:54.260> luck<00:01:54.520> so<00:01:55.520> at

economy and my check engine lights on

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.480 
economy and my check engine lights on
because<00:01:59.840> I've<00:02:00.260> removed<00:02:00.620> my<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.830> air<00:02:01.220> fuel

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490

tuning<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:25.950> think<00:03:26.950> you<00:03:27.040> ought<00:03:27.129> to<00:03:27.159> do<00:03:27.340> the

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
tuning I think you ought to do the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.990 
psi maximum boost
and<00:03:35.049> it's<00:03:35.469> about<00:03:35.620> all<00:03:35.799> you<00:03:35.950> can<00:03:36.099> use<00:03:36.370> without

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
and it's about all you can use without

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.470 
and it's about all you can use without
getting<00:03:37.269> wheelspin<00:03:37.629> through<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.079> keys<00:03:39.480> cause

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
getting wheelspin through the keys cause

getting wheelspin through the keys cause
the<00:03:40.930> potential<00:03:41.909> for<00:03:42.909> this<00:03:43.000> system

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
the potential for this system

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.840 
the potential for this system
is<00:03:45.260> much<00:03:46.260> more<00:03:46.530> can<00:03:46.890> go<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.070> eight<00:03:47.220> psi<00:03:47.700> on

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
is much more can go to eight psi on

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.449 
is much more can go to eight psi on
actually<00:03:48.210> double<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.960> amount<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.290> boost

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
actually double the amount of boost

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.890 
actually double the amount of boost
and<00:03:50.609> then<00:03:51.000> we<00:03:51.269> could<00:03:51.420> see<00:03:51.569> what<00:03:51.689> would<00:03:51.750> happen

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
and then we could see what would happen

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.660 
and then we could see what would happen
to<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.170> trial<00:03:52.439> but<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:52.709> think<00:03:52.890> we<00:03:53.010> will<00:03:53.189> firstly

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
to the trial but I think we will firstly

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.849 
to the trial but I think we will firstly
see<00:03:53.879> what<00:03:54.030> happened<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.359> the<00:03:54.450> tires<00:03:54.859> and

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
see what happened to the tires and

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.220 
see what happened to the tires and
