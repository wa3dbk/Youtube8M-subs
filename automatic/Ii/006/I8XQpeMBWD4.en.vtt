00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello yourself, okay 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.940
 sort of wall for ours and stir on 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.540
 weave nothing to do without money 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:15.179
 built walls for our my future 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.310
 for the castle for my future fortress they 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.890
 get such a square nick 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.000
 the turrets now will be redone on top a 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.430
 then make you show how and where i don't 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.250
 yes all the same right from the corners square 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.270
 it doesn't look good but 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.700
 still it will be better than doing 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.920
 precisely in the shape of the peninsula itself so 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.940
 how do they turn out very too curves 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.739
 and it is impossible to say so straight you 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.020
 include a theater cavity to do in 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.140
 walls but without them somehow all the walls and 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:59.280
 too monotonous incarnated and not 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:01:00.620
 cooked or I have my slave flies well 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.040
 so here 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.280
 the center of this castle I want to do somewhere 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.869
 even that drives should make a soul 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.110
 for hours as one person said what 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.500
 I remember no cinema at all 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.150
 thanks to him 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.560
 I liked the idea of making a town hall 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.960
 just with the clock it turns out this 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.860
 london in london something like this 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.860
 succeed but 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.830
 we can but I donâ€™t know it will turn out the town hall and 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.680
 some houses or something to build 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.380
 and that it will be nothing at all in general 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.110
 what 's some main building and 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.960
 probably a few houses but still 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.370
 houses you could have thought because 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.230
 here are the houses do not think that they will 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:52.720
 how I approach but we will see and think everything 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.380
 I haven't built it yet 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.350
 more I built it somewhere minutes somewhere 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.360
 an hour because if by k game called 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.770
 league of legends she generally mutes all plans 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.690
 generally who knows he will understand but if 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.880
 say again if you have any ideas throw 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.970
 write comments in Detinets may even 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.670
 from black memory smoke mean saw 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.150
 I really need ideas because I already 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.459
 I can not think of anything in general 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.980
 thanks for watching everyone put your fingers 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.990
 top leave the camera option on the channel and 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.990
 Good luck everyone, bye bye
