00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
all run to your power wire I have mine

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.380 
all run to your power wire I have mine
let's<00:01:05.580> go<00:01:05.670> all<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.000> way<00:01:06.030> through<00:01:06.270> your

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
let's go all the way through your

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.800 
let's go all the way through your
battery<00:01:06.950> without<00:01:07.950> inline<00:01:08.700> fuse<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.420> towards

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
battery without inline fuse up towards

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.450 
battery without inline fuse up towards
the<00:01:09.840> battery<00:01:10.200> area<00:01:10.560> more<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.340> more

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
the battery area more just more

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.850 
the battery area more just more
convenient<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.180> way<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.540> don't<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
convenient that way I don't have a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.940 
convenient that way I don't have a
distributor<00:01:14.549> block<00:01:14.909> because<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.689> little<00:01:16.590> block

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
distributor block because a little block

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.890 
distributor block because a little block
that<00:01:17.220> lets<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.610> run<00:01:17.820> one<00:01:18.090> wire<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.720> two

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
that lets you run one wire in and two

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.620 
that lets you run one wire in and two
out<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.380> don't<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.340> those<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:21.390> nice

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
