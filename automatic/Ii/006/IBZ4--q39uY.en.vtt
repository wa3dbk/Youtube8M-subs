00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.990
 Kar 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.039
 and this is a client wants to be 5 million years old and that 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:13.119
 Michelle is like fat from her center in Hannover she can with on this 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:13.750
 travel 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.609
 What is such a small value 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.939
 a tour group is not much who has maybe a value of plus 17 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.449
 50 are and then threatens the effort 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.079
 yes the effort is worth it because the tubers are very common they are kicking 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.389
 Percent like on a head hit on the street very much on the seabed 

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:30.279
 and the big number does 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.450
 They were at sea for seven weeks, I've already had a replacement for a long time 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.780
 Water is a good thing on this journey 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.360
 The most impressive was probably the drug storm in the ceiling are Bruno 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.200
 Gisler and he forced us to vomit our work for a short time 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.060
 and to escape 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.810
 on all now client new you still looking for seven weeks on tightest 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.690
 Room together 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.780
 is this 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.800
 that is quite out of demands it comes to 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.510
 Chips Koller certainly also times if with who arm yourself with that 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.930
 Balls very different Nature change but also very relaxed 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:02.950
 learns 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.220
 mostly also with you thanks to new ones you have actually searched and this 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.220
 want to explore 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.620
 how much did they find? 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.620
 these seven weeks 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.540
 So now we have exploration work there 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.760
 Exploration work and we have about 4 with Yukon salvaged for more 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.970
 investigations 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.130
 that makes him so valuable that it is the plan Rene Heintze already belongs to 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.730
 Filing the loan in it is especially valuable because of this 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.000
 Share very small share of namely cobalt copper and nickel 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.960
 which make up per cent in the collision 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.320
 Bernd Dircksen you can now also pull into the CAS 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.130
 and the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.370
 Levels have great economic value 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.640
 and that's the percent that drives the economic threshing 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.460
 makes picking up the book so difficult 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.159
 It is difficult to get that because we are in the very remote one 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.750
 Mountain area so we have to take a long journey and to 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.090
 others, the water depth is between 4 and 5 kilometers deep 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.560
 that means everyone 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.710
 Activities pulled the boat are also just very long 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.300
 and have to be planned well 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.880
 Conservationists say that the harvest 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.719
 this knoll 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.870
 to interfere with married life down there in the long run 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.580
 what do you say to them? 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.340
 So I want to concede that from human influence this one 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.510
 Execution has just now it is also important to refer to that 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.580
 as little as possible 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.799
 Damage is done and at the end of an investigation to the example too 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.230
 to pass an Environmental Impact No and if not 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:22.279
 there will be no degradation 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:26.510
 when will you be able to use the raw materials and be able to use them more spiritually 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:27.370
 the time frame 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.120
 So basically that also basically a lot of suspects must be quite cheap 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.359
 one period of ten to fifteen years 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.999
 count from the beginning of an activity to a possible use and wants 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:40.659
 I also say there is quite a percentage to be expected back there are currently 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:41.509
 no 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:45.999
 no mining or no refuse Marie the extraction of mineral 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.689
 Raw materials from the seabed 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.609
 would they say that too? 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.089
 This man cook tubers are the raw material of the future that has me some 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:54.430
 Researchers some of their colleagues 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.990
 I think it's a possible one 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.680
 and it's also a possible one because he's a long jump conventional 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.099
 Sal he comes from the marine area 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.610
 Percent where so far has little to Zwo directory activity and they must be concerned 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.829
 that the ETA is covered to two thirds of the sea 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.400
 An ever-growing human can hardly afford this area 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.859
 completely out of consideration outside 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.410
 that's less explored than the moon is not that anymore 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.410
 for a jigsaw 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.599
 I think so 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.150
 So far, Herzinger ten visitors r10 whole the finch new this purpose 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.599
 be built
