for this fallen but the problem with

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.450 
for this fallen but the problem with
catching<00:04:36.440> them<00:04:36.560> is<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:37.040> can't<00:04:37.310> really

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
catching them is you can't really

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.130 
catching them is you can't really
approach<00:04:37.790> them<00:04:38.030> from<00:04:38.120> as<00:04:38.300> close<00:04:38.510> as<00:04:38.690> an<00:04:38.780> ankle

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
approach them from as close as an ankle

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.990 
approach them from as close as an ankle
they're<00:04:39.980> gonna<00:04:40.100> pick<00:04:40.370> up<00:04:40.520> on<00:04:40.730> the<00:04:40.820> very

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
they're gonna pick up on the very

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.790 
they're gonna pick up on the very
slightest<00:04:41.480> movement<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.080> very<00:04:42.260> slightest<00:04:42.680> of

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
slightest movement the very slightest of

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.880 
slightest movement the very slightest of
sounds<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:43.520> they're<00:04:44.090> gonna<00:04:44.180> spook<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:45.740> this

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
sounds and they're gonna spook so this

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:52.999 
sounds and they're gonna spook so this
is<00:04:46.040> actually<00:04:46.370> where<00:04:46.490> I<00:04:46.520> was<00:04:46.669> casting<00:04:47.030> from

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.589 

I'm<00:04:54.009> about<00:04:54.219> five<00:04:54.639> yards<00:04:54.849> off<00:04:55.149> the<00:04:55.179> shoreline

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
I'm about five yards off the shoreline

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.229 
I'm about five yards off the shoreline
here<00:04:56.219> which<00:04:57.219> makes<00:04:57.429> it<00:04:57.579> much<00:04:57.699> easier<00:04:57.969> to

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:58.239 
here which makes it much easier to

00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:00.719 
here which makes it much easier to
approach<00:04:58.449> these<00:04:58.689> fish<00:04:59.039> and<00:05:00.039> all<00:05:00.189> I'm<00:05:00.309> doing<00:05:00.369> is

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
approach these fish and all I'm doing is

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.809 
approach these fish and all I'm doing is
casting<00:05:01.479> out<00:05:01.599> my<00:05:01.749> five<00:05:02.019> inch<00:05:02.229> Seiko<00:05:02.649> past<00:05:03.549> the

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
casting out my five inch Seiko past the

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.029 
casting out my five inch Seiko past the
spot<00:05:04.029> where<00:05:04.209> I<00:05:04.239> know<00:05:04.299> the<00:05:04.569> fish<00:05:04.749> are<00:05:04.959> then<00:05:05.949> I'm

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
spot where I know the fish are then I'm

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.949 
spot where I know the fish are then I'm
slowly<00:05:06.399> bringing<00:05:06.879> up<00:05:06.969> the<00:05:07.209> bait<00:05:07.359> back<00:05:07.659> over

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:07.959 
slowly bringing up the bait back over

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:52.720 
slowly bringing up the bait back over
that<00:05:08.109> spot

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:06:13.010 

got<00:05:53.730> one<00:05:54.710> smile<00:06:11.240> not<00:06:12.240> quite<00:06:12.630> what<00:06:12.870> I'm<00:06:12.990> looking

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
got one smile not quite what I'm looking

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:21.410 
got one smile not quite what I'm looking
forward<00:06:13.620> airing<00:06:13.920> the<00:06:13.980> spawn
