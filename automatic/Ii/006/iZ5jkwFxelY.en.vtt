00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
functionality later on after the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.830 
functionality later on after the
unboxing<00:03:30.130> so<00:03:30.669> as<00:03:30.819> we<00:03:30.940> continue<00:03:31.090> onwards<00:03:31.720> with

the rest of the unboxing comes with a

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.509 
the rest of the unboxing comes with a
like<00:03:34.269> on<00:03:35.040> there<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.160> is

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
like on there it is

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.280 
like on there it is
it's<00:03:36.819> a<00:03:36.880> little<00:03:37.120> lighter<00:03:37.359> than<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.720> originals

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
it's a little lighter than the originals

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.860 
it's a little lighter than the originals
you<00:03:38.410> know<00:03:38.530> Nintendo<00:03:39.130> like<00:03:39.819> on<00:03:40.030> but<00:03:40.840> uh

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
you know Nintendo like on but uh

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.140 
you know Nintendo like on but uh
definitely<00:03:41.859> does<00:03:42.069> the<00:03:42.190> trick<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.639> once<00:03:43.030> again

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
definitely does the trick and once again

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.620 
definitely does the trick and once again
it<00:03:43.419> doesn't<00:03:43.630> use<00:03:44.109> official<00:03:45.000> Nintendo<00:03:46.000> or

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
it doesn't use official Nintendo or

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.629 
it doesn't use official Nintendo or
Super<00:03:47.139> Nintendo<00:03:47.200> controllers<00:03:48.040> it<00:03:48.220> has<00:03:48.430> the

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
Super Nintendo controllers it has the

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.030 
Super Nintendo controllers it has the
own<00:03:48.849> control<00:03:49.389> ports<00:03:49.810> so<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:50.769> may<00:03:50.889> be<00:03:50.950> a

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
own control ports so that may be a

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.890 
own control ports so that may be a
slight<00:03:51.340> downfall<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:52.269> but<00:03:52.510> you<00:03:52.870> know

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
slight downfall to it but you know

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.409 
slight downfall to it but you know
obviously<00:03:53.709> if<00:03:53.889> you<00:03:54.040> can<00:03:54.190> play<00:03:54.489> three<00:03:55.120> types<00:03:55.329> of

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
obviously if you can play three types of

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:56.819 
obviously if you can play three types of
games<00:03:55.569> on<00:03:55.690> one<00:03:55.810> system<00:03:56.019> and<00:03:56.290> comes<00:03:56.620> fully

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
games on one system and comes fully

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.500 
games on one system and comes fully
functional<00:03:57.430> with<00:03:57.609> two<00:03:57.880> controllers<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.419> a

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
functional with two controllers and a

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.540 
functional with two controllers and a
gun<00:03:58.689> you

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
gun you

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.900 
gun you
can't<00:03:59.760> go<00:03:59.850> wrong<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:01.310> there<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.400> have<00:04:02.430> it

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
can't go wrong so there you have it

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.150 
can't go wrong so there you have it
hence<00:04:03.240> own<00:04:03.390> little<00:04:03.600> port<00:04:03.870> like<00:04:04.710> on<00:04:04.920> feature
