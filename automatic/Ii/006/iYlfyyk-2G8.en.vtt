hey<00:00:00.539> there<00:00:00.719> guys<00:00:00.900> I<00:00:01.290> want<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.560> show<00:00:01.709> you<00:00:01.770> how<00:00:02.040> to

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
hey there guys I want to show you how to

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.539 
hey there guys I want to show you how to
build<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.760> super<00:00:03.300> fast<00:00:03.510> redstone<00:00:04.140> clock<00:00:04.549> with

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
build a super fast redstone clock with

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.470 
build a super fast redstone clock with
just<00:00:06.120> two<00:00:06.359> command<00:00:06.839> blocks<00:00:08.120> basically<00:00:09.120> what

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
just two command blocks basically what

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.620 
just two command blocks basically what
its<00:00:09.599> gonna<00:00:09.660> do<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:12.559> and<00:00:13.610> it's<00:00:14.610> gonna<00:00:14.759> fire

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
its gonna do is this and it's gonna fire

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.540 
its gonna do is this and it's gonna fire
I'm<00:00:16.289> not<00:00:16.470> really<00:00:16.590> sure<00:00:16.770> how<00:00:16.890> fast<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.430> if

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
I'm not really sure how fast that is if

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.910 
I'm not really sure how fast that is if
that's<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.789> quarter<00:00:18.109> shake<00:00:19.109> or<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> half<00:00:19.590> tick

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
that's a quarter shake or a half tick

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.560 
that's a quarter shake or a half tick
but<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.730> fast<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:22.650> let's<00:00:22.830> get<00:00:22.949> started<00:00:23.250> so

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
but it's fast so let's get started so

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.519 
but it's fast so let's get started so
the<00:00:24.570> first<00:00:24.750> thing<00:00:24.900> we're<00:00:24.990> gonna<00:00:25.050> want<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> do

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
the first thing we're gonna want to do

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.470 
the first thing we're gonna want to do
is<00:00:25.859> we're<00:00:26.160> gonna<00:00:26.220> place<00:00:26.519> our<00:00:26.699> first<00:00:27.000> command

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
is we're gonna place our first command

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.839 
is we're gonna place our first command
block<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.109> we're<00:00:28.980> gonna<00:00:29.099> put<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
block and we're gonna put in the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.020 
block and we're gonna put in the
following<00:00:30.210> code<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.080> I'll<00:00:31.230> put<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.590> my

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
following code and I'll put that in my

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.930 
following code and I'll put that in my
my<00:00:33.030> description<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.860> negative<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.820> is

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
my description the negative one here is

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.660 
my description the negative one here is
the<00:00:36.149> part<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.660> would<00:00:36.899> need<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.200> change

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
the part that you would need to change

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.889 
the part that you would need to change
depending<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.790> where<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.180> want<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.690> block

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
depending on where you want the block

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.670 
depending on where you want the block
the<00:00:40.500> redstone<00:00:40.920> block<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.430> appear<00:00:42.200> in<00:00:43.200> my<00:00:43.410> case

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
the redstone block to appear in my case

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.900 
the redstone block to appear in my case
negative<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:44.520> would<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:45.140> right<00:00:46.140> here<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
negative one would be right here and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.610 
negative one would be right here and
then<00:00:47.910> I'm<00:00:48.000> gonna<00:00:48.090> put<00:00:48.329> another<00:00:48.570> command<00:00:49.410> block

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
then I'm gonna put another command block

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.740 
then I'm gonna put another command block
on<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> other<00:00:50.010> side<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:51.120> create<00:00:51.420> an<00:00:51.510> air

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
on the other side of it to create an air

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.369 
on the other side of it to create an air
block<00:00:52.699> so<00:00:53.699> let's<00:00:54.449> say<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.930> were<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.079> put

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
block so let's say if I were to put

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.680 
block so let's say if I were to put
negative<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.699> then<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> four<00:00:57.660> or

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
negative one and then a four or

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.510 
negative one and then a four or
something<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.199> that

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
something like that

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.540 
something like that
so<00:00:59.520> when<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.699> activate<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.300> command<00:01:00.629> block

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
so when I activate this command block

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.950 
so when I activate this command block
it's<00:01:02.550> gonna<00:01:02.640> create<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.030> piece<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.359> redstone<00:01:03.570> up

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
it's gonna create a piece of redstone up

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.020 
it's gonna create a piece of redstone up
in<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> air<00:01:04.290> four<00:01:04.739> blocks<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:05.280> right<00:01:05.850> above

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
in the air four blocks up right above

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.609 
in the air four blocks up right above
where<00:01:06.090> I'm<00:01:06.299> gonna<00:01:06.450> actually<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:11.390> oops

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
where I'm gonna actually have it so oops

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:19.789 
where I'm gonna actually have it so oops
now<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:13.860> leave<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.159> at<00:01:18.020> zero<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.170> nothing

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
now if we leave it at zero or nothing

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.260 
now if we leave it at zero or nothing
rather<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> negative<00:01:21.090> one

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
rather and just have the negative one

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.460 
rather and just have the negative one
it's<00:01:21.420> gonna<00:01:21.540> appear<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> want<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.350> be

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
it's gonna appear what I want it to be

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.210 
it's gonna appear what I want it to be
right<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:25.619> put<00:01:25.799> our<00:01:25.890> second

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
right here so now if we put our second

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.800 
right here so now if we put our second
command<00:01:26.520> block<00:01:26.729> down<00:01:28.009> we<00:01:29.009> want<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.810> we

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
command block down we want that to be we

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.920 
command block down we want that to be we
want<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.229> create<00:01:31.470> air<00:01:32.189> blocks<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.930> so

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
want that to create air blocks and so

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.450 
want that to create air blocks and so
the<00:01:34.079> point<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.470> system<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:34.950> there

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the point of this system is that there

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.069 
the point of this system is that there
are<00:01:35.579> some<00:01:35.790> others<00:01:36.000> out<00:01:36.210> there<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.020> one

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
are some others out there but this one

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.260 
are some others out there but this one
is<00:01:37.710> silent

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
is silent

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.219 
is silent
it<00:01:39.270> doesn't<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.630> create<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.960> lot<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.079> noise

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it doesn't really create a lot of noise

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.170 
it doesn't really create a lot of noise
or<00:01:40.500> spit<00:01:40.740> out<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> lot<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.159> particles<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.030> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
or spit out a lot of particles so it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
or spit out a lot of particles so it
might<00:01:42.270> be<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.420> little<00:01:42.509> bit<00:01:42.689> easier<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:43.020> your

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
might be a little bit easier on your

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.580 
might be a little bit easier on your
computer<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.079> case<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.920> want<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
computer and in this case you want the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.420 
computer and in this case you want the
the<00:01:49.590> coordinate<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:51.140> basically<00:01:52.280> where<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the coordinate to be basically where the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.100 
the coordinate to be basically where the
other<00:01:53.600> command<00:01:54.600> block<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.869> going<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.049> be

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
other command block is going to be

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.679 
other command block is going to be
creating<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.829> redstone<00:01:56.460> block<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.600> my

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
creating the redstone block so in my

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.420 
creating the redstone block so in my
case<00:01:57.750> it'll<00:01:58.049> be<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> positive<00:01:58.409> one<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.009> it'll<00:01:59.340> go

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
case it'll be a positive one so it'll go

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.639 
case it'll be a positive one so it'll go
this<00:01:59.579> way<00:02:01.369> so<00:02:02.369> then<00:02:02.520> once<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.759> hit<00:02:02.880> done<00:02:03.119> and

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
this way so then once you hit done and

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.859 
this way so then once you hit done and
you<00:02:04.649> place<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.130> command<00:02:05.610> block<00:02:05.820> or<00:02:06.540> I'm<00:02:06.719> sorry

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
you place the command block or I'm sorry

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.130 
you place the command block or I'm sorry
the<00:02:06.990> redstone<00:02:07.500> you'll<00:02:08.459> see<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.910> now<00:02:09.140> it's

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the redstone you'll see that now it's

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.350 
the redstone you'll see that now it's
basically<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.610> an<00:02:11.700> infinite<00:02:11.879> loop<00:02:12.060> of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
basically just on an infinite loop of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.850 
basically just on an infinite loop of
creating<00:02:13.290> or<00:02:13.470> take

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
creating or take

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.360 
creating or take
bunch<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:14.940> times<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.890> can<00:02:17.040> turn<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.220> off

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
bunch of times and you can turn it off

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.540 
bunch of times and you can turn it off
by<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:18.150> placing<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.810> redstone<00:02:19.110> block<00:02:19.290> there

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
by just placing a redstone block there

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.640 
by just placing a redstone block there
and<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.930> when<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.920> place<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.790> dispenser<00:02:23.970> and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
and so when you place a dispenser and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.170 
and so when you place a dispenser and
you<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.770> some<00:02:25.980> redstone<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.880> turn<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
you have some redstone and you turn the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.760 
you have some redstone and you turn the
system<00:02:27.330> on<00:02:28.790> it's<00:02:29.790> gonna<00:02:29.940> fire<00:02:30.180> super<00:02:30.540> fast<00:02:30.770> so

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
system on it's gonna fire super fast so

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.170 
system on it's gonna fire super fast so
if<00:02:31.860> any<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.100> your<00:02:32.220> redstone<00:02:32.430> contraptions

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
if any of your redstone contraptions

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.910 
if any of your redstone contraptions
need<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.420> system<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.780> fires<00:02:34.110> really<00:02:34.320> fast<00:02:34.650> and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
need a system that fires really fast and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.340 
need a system that fires really fast and
just<00:02:35.520> needs<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:35.970> be<00:02:36.000> simple<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:37.200> is

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
just needs it to be simple this is
