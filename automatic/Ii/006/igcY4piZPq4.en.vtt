different<00:03:32.069> weapons<00:03:32.819> that<00:03:32.940> we<00:03:33.150> can<00:03:33.389> use<00:03:33.419> and

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
different weapons that we can use and

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.449 
different weapons that we can use and
they're<00:03:33.900> just<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.230> primaries<00:03:34.799> there<00:03:35.280> are

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
they're just the primaries there are

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.550 
they're just the primaries there are
secondary<00:03:35.669> guns<00:03:36.060> as<00:03:36.329> well<00:03:36.569> with<00:03:37.169> that<00:03:37.379> many

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
secondary guns as well with that many

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.559 
secondary guns as well with that many
weapons<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.549> many<00:03:38.790> attachments<00:03:39.180> for

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
weapons and that many attachments for

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.300 
weapons and that many attachments for
each<00:03:39.690> of<00:03:39.870> those<00:03:39.959> weapons<00:03:40.230> there<00:03:40.590> are<00:03:40.739> millions

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
each of those weapons there are millions

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.280 
each of those weapons there are millions
of<00:03:41.459> combinations<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.449> can<00:03:42.629> have<00:03:42.870> to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
of combinations that you can have to

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.199 
of combinations that you can have to
play<00:03:43.470> your<00:03:43.500> own<00:03:43.829> way<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.069> battlefield<00:03:44.699> 3<00:03:44.760> and

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
play your own way in battlefield 3 and

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.030 
play your own way in battlefield 3 and
then<00:03:45.720> you've<00:03:45.870> got<00:03:46.019> gun<00:03:46.229> camos<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.919> then

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
then you've got gun camos and then

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.369 
then you've got gun camos and then
you've<00:03:47.190> got<00:03:47.220> soldier<00:03:47.790> camos<00:03:48.150> as<00:03:48.329> well<00:03:48.659> so<00:03:49.169> how

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
you've got soldier camos as well so how

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.349 
you've got soldier camos as well so how
would<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.739> translate<00:03:50.040> back<00:03:50.579> into<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.090> World

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
would that translate back into a World

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.300 
would that translate back into a World
War<00:03:51.569> two<00:03:51.780> ERA<00:03:51.810> where<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.829> customization

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
War two ERA where that customization

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.520 
War two ERA where that customization
wasn't<00:03:54.000> really<00:03:54.329> sort<00:03:54.569> of<00:03:54.659> there<00:03:55.229> at<00:03:55.409> that

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
wasn't really sort of there at that

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.379 
wasn't really sort of there at that
point<00:03:55.799> in<00:03:55.919> time<00:03:55.949> so<00:03:56.849> we<00:03:56.970> thought<00:03:57.000> maybe

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
point in time so we thought maybe

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.420 
point in time so we thought maybe
soldier<00:03:57.959> camos<00:03:58.290> could<00:03:58.530> be<00:03:58.620> more<00:03:58.829> detailed

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
soldier camos could be more detailed

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.979 
soldier camos could be more detailed
perhaps<00:03:59.819> that<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.150> could<00:04:00.329> pick<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.780> choose

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
perhaps that you could pick and choose

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.689 
perhaps that you could pick and choose
exactly<00:04:01.290> what<00:04:01.889> sort<00:04:02.099> of<00:04:02.159> shirt<00:04:02.489> you're

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
exactly what sort of shirt you're

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.849 
exactly what sort of shirt you're
wearing<00:04:02.760> trousers<00:04:03.329> helmet<00:04:04.169> all<00:04:04.349> that<00:04:04.560> kind<00:04:04.799> of

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
wearing trousers helmet all that kind of

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.349 
wearing trousers helmet all that kind of
stuff<00:04:04.919> perhaps<00:04:05.400> some<00:04:05.669> sort<00:04:05.879> of<00:04:05.940> like<00:04:06.090> face

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
stuff perhaps some sort of like face

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.780 
stuff perhaps some sort of like face
painting<00:04:06.959> or<00:04:07.229> tattoo<00:04:07.680> something<00:04:08.250> like<00:04:08.489> that

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
painting or tattoo something like that

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.089 
painting or tattoo something like that
just<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.389> keep<00:04:09.629> the<00:04:09.810> customization<00:04:10.680> level<00:04:10.979> as

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
just to keep the customization level as

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.250 
just to keep the customization level as
high<00:04:11.370> as<00:04:11.549> possible<00:04:11.579> because<00:04:12.569> I<00:04:12.750> think<00:04:13.109> if

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
high as possible because I think if

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.080 
high as possible because I think if
you're<00:04:13.859> going<00:04:14.069> to<00:04:14.220> have<00:04:14.400> a<00:04:14.430> game<00:04:14.760> like<00:04:15.030> that

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
you're going to have a game like that

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.330 
you're going to have a game like that
you<00:04:15.750> need<00:04:15.959> some<00:04:16.229> sort<00:04:16.409> of<00:04:16.470> customization

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
you need some sort of customization

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.800 
you need some sort of customization
otherwise<00:04:17.669> people<00:04:18.000> aren't<00:04:18.449> going<00:04:18.539> to<00:04:18.599> feel

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
otherwise people aren't going to feel

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.939 
otherwise people aren't going to feel
like<00:04:18.959> they're<00:04:19.169> going<00:04:19.349> to<00:04:19.440> play<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.739> game

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
like they're going to play the game

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.830 
like they're going to play the game
their<00:04:20.280> way<00:04:20.519> you'd<00:04:21.120> be<00:04:21.239> playing<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.719> the<00:04:21.750> way

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
their way you'd be playing it the way

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.719 
their way you'd be playing it the way
the<00:04:22.139> developers<00:04:22.710> wanted<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.159> to<00:04:23.279> play<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.610> and

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
the developers wanted you to play it and

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.500 
the developers wanted you to play it and
I<00:04:24.210> don't<00:04:24.450> think<00:04:24.750> that<00:04:24.810> fits

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
I don't think that fits

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.510 
I don't think that fits
well<00:04:25.720> any<00:04:25.900> more<00:04:26.140> people<00:04:26.380> want<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:27.040> customize

well any more people want to customize

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.880 
well any more people want to customize
people<00:04:27.880> want<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.240> do<00:04:28.360> it<00:04:28.480> their<00:04:28.720> way<00:04:28.750> so<00:04:29.740> that

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
people want to do it their way so that

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.440 
people want to do it their way so that
sort<00:04:30.130> of<00:04:30.220> leads<00:04:30.430> me<00:04:30.670> on<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:30.790> my<00:04:30.970> question<00:04:31.360> to

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
sort of leads me on to my question to

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.330 
sort of leads me on to my question to
you<00:04:31.480> guys<00:04:31.690> so<00:04:32.470> if<00:04:32.620> you<00:04:32.740> were<00:04:32.860> given<00:04:32.980> exactly

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
you guys so if you were given exactly

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.430 
you guys so if you were given exactly
the<00:04:33.580> same<00:04:33.790> question<00:04:34.270> what<00:04:34.810> sort<00:04:35.080> of<00:04:35.170> games

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
the same question what sort of games

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.230 
the same question what sort of games
would<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.950> like<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.400> see<00:04:36.640> bill<00:04:37.000> on<00:04:37.210> the

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
would you like to see bill on the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.780 
would you like to see bill on the
Frostbite<00:04:37.900> engine<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.920> games<00:04:39.160> don't<00:04:39.490> have<00:04:39.670> to

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
Frostbite engine the games don't have to

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.670 
Frostbite engine the games don't have to
be<00:04:39.910> specifically<00:04:40.480> battle<00:04:40.900> field<00:04:41.110> orientated

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
be specifically battle field orientated

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.830 
be specifically battle field orientated
however<00:04:42.460> this<00:04:42.580> is<00:04:42.730> a<00:04:42.760> battlefield<00:04:43.150> commentary

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
however this is a battlefield commentary

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.210 
however this is a battlefield commentary
so<00:04:43.990> it's<00:04:44.200> kind<00:04:44.410> of<00:04:44.470> sticking<00:04:44.710> true<00:04:44.980> to<00:04:45.070> that

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
so it's kind of sticking true to that

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.460 
so it's kind of sticking true to that
but<00:04:45.880> how<00:04:46.030> have<00:04:46.210> we<00:04:46.360> already<00:04:46.570> know<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.170> first

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
but how have we already know the first

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.260 
but how have we already know the first
expansion<00:04:47.860> pack<00:04:48.250> for<00:04:48.280> battlefield<00:04:48.880> 4<00:04:49.090> is

World War setting like I do it was a

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.850 
World War setting like I do it was a
really<00:05:01.210> thought-provoking<00:05:01.480> topic<00:05:02.440> for<00:05:02.590> me<00:05:02.710> so

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
really thought-provoking topic for me so
