any dirt but it didn't seem to come off

since this pen so this solution works
very<00:00:56.129> well<00:00:56.280> next<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.420> will<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.629> needing

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
very well next you will be needing

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.540 
very well next you will be needing
q-tips<00:00:59.329> cotton<00:01:00.329> balls<00:01:00.539> or<00:01:00.899> any<00:01:01.289> tissue<00:01:02.100> paper

q-tips cotton balls or any tissue paper

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.550 
q-tips cotton balls or any tissue paper
and<00:01:02.910> any<00:01:04.400> solution<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:06.150> has<00:01:06.560> benzoyl

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and any solution that has benzoyl

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.420 
and any solution that has benzoyl
peroxide<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.350> benzoyl<00:01:10.350> peroxide<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
peroxide in it benzoyl peroxide is the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.740 
peroxide in it benzoyl peroxide is the
main<00:01:11.670> key<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.720> solution<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.820> am<00:01:15.180> using

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
main key in this solution and I am using

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
main key in this solution and I am using
Proactiv<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:17.369> that's<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> only<00:01:18.090> thing

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
Proactiv because that's the only thing

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.539 
Proactiv because that's the only thing
that<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.900> has<00:01:19.049> benzoyl<00:01:19.470> peroxide<00:01:19.979> in

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
that I have that has benzoyl peroxide in

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.240 
that I have that has benzoyl peroxide in
it<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.330> anything<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:22.140> work<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
it so anything can work for this it

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.060 
it so anything can work for this it
doesn't<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.420> be<00:01:24.509> proactive<00:01:24.960> solution<00:01:25.860> it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
doesn't have to be proactive solution it

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.830 
doesn't have to be proactive solution it
can<00:01:26.250> be<00:01:26.369> anything<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.270> has<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.720> have

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
can be anything but it has to have

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.230 
can be anything but it has to have
benzoyl<00:01:28.350> peroxide<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.700> now<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:29.970> you

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
benzoyl peroxide in it so now that you

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.420 
benzoyl peroxide in it so now that you
have<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:30.479> your<00:01:30.810> materials<00:01:31.159> let's<00:01:32.159> get

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
have all your materials let's get

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.210 
have all your materials let's get
started<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.210> basically<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.439> first<00:01:34.470> thing<00:01:35.100> you

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
started so basically the first thing you

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.300 
started so basically the first thing you
want<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.090> make<00:01:36.689> sure<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:37.220> sunny<00:01:38.220> and

want to do is make sure it's sunny and
warm<00:01:38.820> outside<00:01:39.290> because<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:41.009> raining<00:01:41.490> and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
warm outside because if it's raining and

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.700 
warm outside because if it's raining and
really<00:01:41.850> cold<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.450> solution<00:01:42.840> would<00:01:43.170> not<00:01:43.409> work

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
really cold this solution would not work

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.670 
really cold this solution would not work
the<00:01:44.310> second<00:01:44.759> thing<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.030> want<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.329> do<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.810> take

really really warm and that's a good key

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.490 
really really warm and that's a good key
to<00:03:02.950> doing<00:03:03.159> this<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:04.169> you're<00:03:05.169> just<00:03:05.319> going<00:03:05.469> to

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
to doing this so you're just going to

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.349 
to doing this so you're just going to
place<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.949> LPS<00:03:06.280> on<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.519> table<00:03:07.000> or<00:03:07.150> whatever

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
place the LPS on the table or whatever

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.780 
place the LPS on the table or whatever
you're<00:03:07.659> using<00:03:07.689> to<00:03:08.260> make<00:03:08.379> it<00:03:08.530> stand<00:03:08.709> up<00:03:08.949> and<00:03:09.189> you

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
you're using to make it stand up and you

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.819 
you're using to make it stand up and you
want<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.090> adjust<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.689> so<00:03:10.989> it's<00:03:11.379> in<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.620> good

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
want to adjust it so it's in a good

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.670 
want to adjust it so it's in a good
position<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.790> Sun<00:03:13.060> hits<00:03:13.449> LPS<00:03:13.989> directly

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
position so the Sun hits LPS directly

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.420 
position so the Sun hits LPS directly
where<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.579> you<00:03:15.879> put<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.269> cream<00:03:16.540> on<00:03:16.919> so<00:03:17.919> I'm

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
where the you put the cream on so I'm

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.550 
where the you put the cream on so I'm
just<00:03:18.609> going<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.819> move<00:03:18.909> it<00:03:19.090> like<00:03:19.180> this<00:03:19.319> so<00:03:20.319> this

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
just going to move it like this so this

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.500 
just going to move it like this so this
would<00:03:20.709> be<00:03:20.859> a<00:03:20.889> good<00:03:21.099> position<00:03:21.819> for<00:03:22.090> this<00:03:22.209> husky

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
would be a good position for this husky

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.199 
would be a good position for this husky
so<00:03:23.260> once<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.680> get<00:03:23.799> your<00:03:23.859> LPS<00:03:24.280> set<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:25.000> you

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
so once you get your LPS set and you

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.629 
so once you get your LPS set and you
think<00:03:25.449> the<00:03:25.599> sun's<00:03:25.870> directly<00:03:26.500> on<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:26.859> you<00:03:27.400> just

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
think the sun's directly on it you just

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.580 
think the sun's directly on it you just
want<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:27.849> check<00:03:28.060> back<00:03:28.329> in<00:03:28.629> 30<00:03:29.019> minutes<00:03:29.379> or<00:03:29.560> so

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
want to check back in 30 minutes or so

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.069 
want to check back in 30 minutes or so
and<00:03:30.040> see<00:03:30.519> how<00:03:30.639> it's<00:03:30.849> going<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:31.359> I'll<00:03:31.840> see<00:03:32.019> you

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:35.979 
it like we just want to check on it and

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.819 
it like we just want to check on it and
I<00:03:36.669> just<00:03:36.909> put<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.269> same<00:03:37.509> thing<00:03:38.109> here<00:03:38.409> because

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
I just put the same thing here because

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.360

it<00:03:39.129> seemed<00:03:39.340> like<00:03:39.549> it<00:03:39.849> would<00:03:39.939> work<00:03:40.150> best<00:03:40.540> and

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
it seemed like it would work best and

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.890 
it seemed like it would work best and
you<00:03:42.370> can<00:03:42.489> tell<00:03:42.759> that<00:03:43.030> it's<00:03:43.269> already<00:03:43.659> coming

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900

you can tell that it's already coming
off<00:03:44.199> a<00:03:44.560> little<00:03:44.829> bit<00:03:45.389> and<00:03:46.389> I<00:03:46.509> did<00:03:46.720> add<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:46.959> little

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
off a little bit and I did add a little

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.740 
off a little bit and I did add a little
bit<00:03:47.439> more<00:03:47.470> just<00:03:48.159> because<00:03:49.060> there<00:03:49.269> was<00:03:49.419> a<00:03:49.449> lot<00:03:49.720> of

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
bit more just because there was a lot of

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.729 
bit more just because there was a lot of
pen<00:03:50.379> stain<00:03:51.189> on<00:03:51.400> there<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.930> simple<00:03:53.439> that<00:03:53.530> like

pen stain on there so simple that like

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.979 
pen stain on there so simple that like
this<00:03:53.979> so<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.430> Sun<00:03:54.639> hits<00:03:54.879> it<00:03:55.030> directly<00:03:55.389> so<00:03:55.659> I'll

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
this so the Sun hits it directly so I'll

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.020 
this so the Sun hits it directly so I'll
see<00:03:56.169> you<00:03:56.199> guys<00:03:56.439> in<00:03:56.620> a<00:03:56.709> bit<00:03:56.739> when<00:03:57.519> it's<00:03:57.699> going<00:03:57.939> to

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
show I just brought the LPS back inside

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.729 
show I just brought the LPS back inside
and<00:04:00.849> you<00:04:01.599> can<00:04:01.780> tell<00:04:02.019> that<00:04:02.199> looks<00:04:02.409> about<00:04:02.590> done

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
and you can tell that looks about done

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.270 
and you can tell that looks about done

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.159 

okay<00:04:39.759> so<00:04:39.819> once<00:04:40.240> you've<00:04:40.449> dried<00:04:40.749> and<00:04:41.020> washed

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
okay so once you've dried and washed

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.339 
okay so once you've dried and washed
your<00:04:41.439> LPS<00:04:41.979> you<00:04:42.639> can<00:04:42.849> see<00:04:43.180> that<00:04:43.509> it<00:04:43.689> is<00:04:43.839> finished

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
your LPS you can see that it is finished

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.589 
your LPS you can see that it is finished
but<00:04:45.159> there<00:04:45.400> is<00:04:45.550> still<00:04:45.819> a<00:04:45.849> little<00:04:46.059> bit<00:04:46.150> of<00:04:46.330> stain

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
but there is still a little bit of stain

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.439 
but there is still a little bit of stain
left<00:04:46.930> on<00:04:47.080> its<00:04:47.259> head<00:04:47.529> and<00:04:47.860> if<00:04:48.309> you<00:04:48.430> want<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:48.789> get

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
left on its head and if you want to get

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.839 
left on its head and if you want to get
all<00:04:49.719> of<00:04:49.870> it<00:04:50.020> off<00:04:50.169> then<00:04:50.589> you<00:04:50.770> can<00:04:50.949> still<00:04:51.490> put<00:04:51.759> it

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
all of it off then you can still put it

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.850 
all of it off then you can still put it
outside<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.599> then<00:04:52.749> do<00:04:53.199> the<00:04:53.349> steps<00:04:53.650> all<00:04:53.830> over

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
outside and then do the steps all over

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.059 
outside and then do the steps all over
again<00:04:54.400> so<00:04:55.150> this<00:04:55.449> method<00:04:55.779> works<00:04:56.259> really<00:04:56.860> really

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 
again so this method works really really

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.149
