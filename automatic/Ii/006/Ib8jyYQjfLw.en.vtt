maglev<00:00:01.020> trains<00:00:01.380> are<00:00:01.709> great<00:00:01.920> idea<00:00:02.510> instead<00:00:03.510> of

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
maglev trains are great idea instead of

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.630 
maglev trains are great idea instead of
just<00:00:03.840> using<00:00:04.080> conventional<00:00:04.620> motors<00:00:05.190> for<00:00:05.430> power

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
just using conventional motors for power

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.030 
just using conventional motors for power
they<00:00:06.299> use<00:00:06.450> magnets<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.109> levitate<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.799> train

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
they use magnets to levitate the train

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.680 
they use magnets to levitate the train
above<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.550> track<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.120> propel<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.660> forward

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
above the track and propel it forward

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.049 
above the track and propel it forward
but<00:00:10.530> maglev<00:00:10.950> trains<00:00:11.309> aren't<00:00:11.639> just<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.910> good

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
but maglev trains aren't just a good
