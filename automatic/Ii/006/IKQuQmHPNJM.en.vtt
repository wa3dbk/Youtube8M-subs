00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.710
 my career lives never 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.549
 I make myself 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.289
 above 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.049
 I have 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.820
 m 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.820
 The airline 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.260
 mmmmm 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.960
 I will do 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.910
 The charge 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.450
 main element of biomolecules still present in the atmosphere as 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.920
 carbon dioxide 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.070
 in the hydrosphere as bicarbonate it in carbonate 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.380
 and in the lithosphere in the form of carbon or petroleum carbonate rocks 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.900
 through photosynthesis or chemo synthesis the primary producers 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.760
 they incorporate the carbon of the atmosphere the hydrosphere in the form of dioxide 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.990
 carbon and integrate it into their tissues 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.520
 Through the marine and terrestrial trophic chain, consumers are fed 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.500
 of producers and carbon becomes part of all the organisms 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.770
 alive 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.080
 that those of puel sell the atmosphere with their breathing 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.610
 there was to the subsoil in the form of excrement another its decomposition originating rocks 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.590
 carbonated 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.040
 volcanic activity and the use by man of 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.990
 fossil fuels such as oil or coal also return a large 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.990
 amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.500
 the nitrogen 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.500
 constitutes 79% of atmospheric gases 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.939
 it is a macronutrient that all organisms need to synthesize 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.740
 proteins 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.450
 However, only some bacteria and algae are able to fix them together with 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.740
 hydrogen to form ammonia 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.659
 When the ammonia is incorporated into the soil, the nitrifying bacteria 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.820
 decompose in my writing and then in nitrate 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.510
 this phenomenon 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.500
 which is known as nitrification 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.620
 allows plants to incorporate nitrogen into their metabolism 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:21.099
 the vegetables are consumed by higher organisms through the 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.799
 trophic chain and the nitrate returns to the ground after its death or in the form of 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.669
 faeces 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.869
 thanks to the action demystify you of some bacteria 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:34.139
 the nitrogen passes into the atmosphere and the cycle closes 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.699
 the match 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:42.859
 it is the only macronutrient that is not found in the atmosphere 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.319
 only in solid form on the rocks 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.359
 Ametller is taken up by the roots of the plants and is incorporated into 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.419
 the trophic chain of consumers returning to the soil in the excrement or 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.659
 who after his death 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.109
 a part of the phosphorus reaches the sea transported by water currents 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:08.699
 here it is incorporated into the marine trophic chain use accumulates and is lost in the 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:13.409
 marine bottoms where it can not be taken advantage of by living beings although 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.959
 the outcrop of deep water may be incorporated into the food chain 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:23.179
 from which not a pelican bird droppings reports 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:28.119
 the phosphorus can be reused as fertilizer by starting a new cycle 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.430
 three quarters of the earth's surface 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.319
 they are covered with water 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.039
 due to the heat of the sun the water evaporates ascends to the atmosphere and 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:45.989
 condenses in the form of clouds 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.980
 when the water droplets acquire a certain size they precipitate in the form of 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.420
 rain snow operate did as a function of temperature 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.859
 a part of the water is absorbed by the plants that return it later by 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.909
 evapotranspiration 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.489
 the animals also take part of this water and return it to the environment through 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.889
 breathing or expression 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.639
 the rest of the water is filtered and circulates through underground channels or forms courses 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.459
 surface modeling the landscape 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.189
 During this process the water evaporates and the cycle begins again
