know what I was going to be today to be

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.250 
know what I was going to be today to be
honest<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.150> I<00:05:21.300> didn't<00:05:21.510> do<00:05:21.570> any<00:05:21.720> time<00:05:21.900> runs<00:05:22.140> in

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
honest and I didn't do any time runs in

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.980 
honest and I didn't do any time runs in
practice<00:05:22.620> I<00:05:22.740> was<00:05:22.830> just<00:05:22.919> trying<00:05:23.100> to<00:05:23.130> focus<00:05:23.310> on

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
practice I was just trying to focus on

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.590 
practice I was just trying to focus on
keeping<00:05:24.990> my<00:05:25.169> head<00:05:25.580> where<00:05:26.580> I<00:05:26.610> was<00:05:27.120> riding<00:05:27.450> not

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
keeping my head where I was riding not

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.820 
keeping my head where I was riding not
worrying<00:05:27.870> about<00:05:27.900> how<00:05:28.140> fast<00:05:28.350> everybody<00:05:28.740> else

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
worrying about how fast everybody else

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.230 
worrying about how fast everybody else
is<00:05:28.980> going<00:05:29.190> so<00:05:29.310> I<00:05:29.340> think<00:05:29.430> that<00:05:29.580> was<00:05:30.030> key<00:05:30.210> for

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
is going so I think that was key for

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.870 
is going so I think that was key for
today<00:05:30.630> and<00:05:31.470> this<00:05:31.830> is<00:05:32.010> a<00:05:32.040> course<00:05:32.370> that<00:05:32.520> you<00:05:32.580> like

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
through the season so I've been kind of

working and trying to make pace from

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.300 
working and trying to make pace from
that<00:06:04.440> down<00:06:05.330> part<00:06:06.330> of<00:06:06.419> my<00:06:06.740> season<00:06:07.740> I<00:06:07.890> guess<00:06:08.190> you

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
that down part of my season I guess you

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.520 
that down part of my season I guess you
could<00:06:08.370> say<00:06:08.580> so<00:06:09.240> yeah<00:06:09.690> it's<00:06:09.840> just<00:06:09.990> more<00:06:10.169> trying

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
could say so yeah it's just more trying

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.620 
could say so yeah it's just more trying
to<00:06:10.560> focus<00:06:10.800> on<00:06:11.160> getting<00:06:11.940> a<00:06:12.090> good<00:06:12.270> run<00:06:12.419> in<00:06:12.540> I

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
to focus on getting a good run in I

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.940 
to focus on getting a good run in I
think<00:06:12.720> that's<00:06:12.990> that<00:06:13.320> was<00:06:13.410> the<00:06:13.530> best<00:06:13.680> of<00:06:13.830> all<00:06:13.919> I

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
think that's that was the best of all I

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.010 
think that's that was the best of all I
could<00:06:14.070> do<00:06:14.250> really<00:06:14.460> well<00:06:15.419> this<00:06:15.600> will<00:06:15.750> probably

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
could do really well this will probably

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.840 
could do really well this will probably
earn<00:06:16.380> you<00:06:16.560> a<00:06:16.590> spot<00:06:16.890> on<00:06:16.950> the<00:06:17.280> world's<00:06:17.640> team
