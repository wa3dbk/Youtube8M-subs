00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.290
 Welcome from Las Vegas where we can 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.130
 brand new acer chromebook also in the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.719
 can hold hands and that the c 720p 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.550
 2600 not a simple name but you see 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.290
 it's easy in the title that has an intel 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.030
 celeron processors in it but the sp 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.289
 Generation means the term should be 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.150
 Okay, I 'll click 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.590
 short on the battery where we see yes 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.600
 at 80 percent but still four hours 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.130
 left over and for 300 dollars or 300 euros 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.769
 notebook actually not even that way 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.560
 bad 32 gb memory we have in it 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.260
 not too much, therefore , acer offers here 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.079
 or google actually still 100 gb drive 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.280
 even with it for free on for two 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.290
 years to minister after would have him 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.520
 so far what number not too all 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.420
 many usually eight hours 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.309
 Run time is actually too 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.020
 Apart promised I would also 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.780
 Five still estimate four products 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.489
 device connected with wireless and without wifi 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.289
 makes the tablet or the notebook 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.030
 actually not much sense what I am 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.649
 very nice for 290 euro tilted 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.570
 Here is a touchscreen that is available 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.289
 many others his chromebooks even 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.390
 not to be seen 1030 60 x 768 pixels 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.550
 resolution here also the 11.6 inches 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.930
 Display with 10 fingers at the same time 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.790
 could use here also for games 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.939
 or other things that need to here 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.650
 install 1.4 1.4 kilograms 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.450
 Weighing the device feels nice and easy 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.770
 at two gibyte ram we have here and 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.799
 connection moderately a headphone and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.470
 microphone connection in a usb 2.0 with 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.150
 a creek with it even looks 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.320
 at night 3.0 out of white blue is me though 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.860
 would now on time and appreciate 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.840
 hdmi stream if you open it 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.250
 which is ultimately good for back 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.329
 I think this is very pleasant here 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.950
 I 'm doing a little bit here again 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.720
 look then you see of exceptions 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.770
 matt white now in the case there is 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.720
 but probably think in too 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.909
 other colors then again usb 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.520
 connection with kensington and sd 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.290
 card reader and then on the bottom 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.880
 We can easily do this here 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.079
 completely upgraded I'm curious what for 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.119
 A memory in it may be 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.799
 we do the SSD also seen here 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.600
 with 16 gb features white or in the 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.640
 at least model so in it is in 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.409
 Germany only 230 work maybe 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.370
 but upgrade against something other than m 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.530
 sata 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:04.200
 bluetooth is still in there 4.0 in the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.310
 c 27 p 2600 as that means we see 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.450
 I could've even has ever time 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.320
 the touch i can also say i want 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.880
 make a game 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.380
 here are a few apps from google if 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.580
 her chrome os does not know anything like that 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.800
 you connect there or other apps 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.990
 install and otherwise 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.010
 here too most of it disappears 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.710
 leave so he a bit more from 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.570
 display looks very nice too 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.710
 can the viewing angle me too 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.960
 nice end or 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.370
 it gets a bit lighter from the top 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.720
 the colors but actually if 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.700
 you look at it from the beginning 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.510
 actually very nice device for 299th 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.890
 euro the c7 acp from the cs 2013 that was 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.530
 the short traders watched for 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.940
 I still have you very short 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.230
 maybe the webcam can show up front 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.080
 I saw it because there is one 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.360
 webcam still with it and here you see 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.170
 the quality 2 megapixel hd and you have 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.520
 especially down 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.960
 I also saw a perfect one 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.370
 I could choose myself a can 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:58.020
 big head we make quite funny 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:59.070
 make it back to normal as well 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.150
 So you can here a bit to it 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.280
 especially for students 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.720
 or even younger this should be 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.700
 be wonderful for the first entry 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.800
 with the notebook 290 euro is actually 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.540
 a very good price and up to 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.739
 next time forget about the 2013 cs 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.840
 Do not give us your name 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.840
