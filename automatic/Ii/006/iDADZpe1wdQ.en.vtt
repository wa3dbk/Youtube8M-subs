what's really cool well this one is I'm
sure<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:17.100> can<00:00:17.250> see<00:00:18.350> it's<00:00:19.350> water<00:00:19.890> resistant<00:00:20.609> up

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
sure you can see it's water resistant up

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.840 
sure you can see it's water resistant up
to<00:00:20.730> 16<00:00:21.210> feet<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.980> it's<00:00:22.980> shock<00:00:23.220> resistant<00:00:23.760> and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
to 16 feet and it's shock resistant and

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.450 
to 16 feet and it's shock resistant and
what<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.119> resistance<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.250> during<00:00:26.250> this

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
what to resistance so that during this

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.070 
what to resistance so that during this
winter<00:00:26.640> band<00:00:27.029> think<00:00:27.180> about<00:00:27.390> maybe<00:00:27.570> doing<00:00:27.689> some

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
winter band think about maybe doing some

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.950 
winter band think about maybe doing some
snowboarding<00:00:28.529> videos<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.660> then<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.840> the

snowboarding videos and then in the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.959 
snowboarding videos and then in the
summer<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.040> want<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.369> some<00:00:32.550> underwater

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
summer if I want to do some underwater

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.090 
summer if I want to do some underwater

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
videos with some of the experiments I

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.490 
videos with some of the experiments I
like<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:36.390> know<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.960> together<00:00:37.410> I

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
like to you know can together I

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.380 
like to you know can together I
might<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:37.920> able<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.129> do<00:00:38.730> some<00:00:38.940> underwater

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390

footage<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.739> stuff<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:42.600> might

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
footage and stuff like that so I might

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.990 
footage and stuff like that so I might
as<00:00:43.170> well<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> bit<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.010> an<00:00:44.129> unboxing<00:00:44.460> for

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
as well just do a bit of an unboxing for

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.619 
as well just do a bit of an unboxing for
you<00:00:45.180> show<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.600> kind<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.079> what<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.320> comes<00:00:47.250> with

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
you show you kind of what it comes with

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.900 
you show you kind of what it comes with
but<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.260> far<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:50.070> know<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.399> haven't<00:00:50.730> really

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
but so far you know I haven't really

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.720 
but so far you know I haven't really
taken<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.449> too<00:00:51.750> much<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.110> look<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.730> I've

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
taken on too much of a look at it I've

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.520 
taken on too much of a look at it I've
just<00:00:53.969> read<00:00:54.149> some<00:00:54.390> reviews<00:00:54.539> online<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.170> hear

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
just read some reviews online I hear

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.900 
just read some reviews online I hear
that<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:55.800> not<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.100> best<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.579> taking

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
that it's not the best for taking

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.459 
that it's not the best for taking
pictures<00:00:57.379> go<00:00:58.379> figure<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.829> camera<00:00:59.359> but<00:01:00.469> you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
pictures go figure it's a camera but you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.840 
pictures go figure it's a camera but you
would<00:01:01.559> expect<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.010> take<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:02.550> bit<00:01:02.699> better

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
would expect to take a little bit better

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.539 
would expect to take a little bit better
pictures<00:01:03.359> from<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> hear<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.250> it's<00:01:05.250> really

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
pictures from what I hear it it's really

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.560 
pictures from what I hear it it's really
easy<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.570> make<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:09.000> know<00:01:09.030> make<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
easy to make it you know make the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.270 
easy to make it you know make the
pictures<00:01:10.080> fuzzy<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.560> stuff<00:01:10.799> maybe<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.220> just

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
pictures fuzzy and stuff maybe it's just

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.539

me for I've already got a good camera
for<00:01:17.130> taking<00:01:17.460> pictures<00:01:17.900> but<00:01:19.250> it<00:01:20.250> would<00:01:20.369> be<00:01:20.460> cool

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
for taking pictures but it would be cool

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.280 
for taking pictures but it would be cool
for<00:01:20.850> doing<00:01:21.060> some<00:01:21.240> underwater<00:01:21.600> video<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
for doing some underwater video like I

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.210 
for doing some underwater video like I
said<00:01:22.500> maybe<00:01:22.740> some<00:01:23.070> cool<00:01:23.820> snowboarding<00:01:24.119> video

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
so and then yeah setup disk some more

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.819 
so and then yeah setup disk some more
paperwork<00:01:35.750> who<00:01:36.750> doesn't<00:01:37.140> love<00:01:37.259> paperwork

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.260 

chargeable<00:01:40.829> battery<00:01:40.890> probably<00:01:41.820> pick<00:01:42.090> up<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
chargeable battery probably pick up a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.880 
chargeable battery probably pick up a
couple<00:01:42.420> more<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.720> these<00:01:42.869> at<00:01:43.079> work<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.740> way

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
couple more of these at work so that way

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.990 
couple more of these at work so that way
I<00:01:43.920> don't<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> worry<00:01:44.460> about<00:01:44.579> running<00:01:44.850> out

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
I don't have to worry about running out

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.910 
I don't have to worry about running out
of<00:01:45.060> battery<00:01:45.479> power<00:01:48.079> charger

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:03.080 

our<00:01:52.920> sync<00:01:53.340> cable<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.840> we<00:01:58.050> can<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.680> in<00:02:02.090> now

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
our sync cable so that we can get in now

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.900 
our sync cable so that we can get in now
it<00:02:03.330> does<00:02:03.540> come<00:02:03.870> with<00:02:03.900> this<00:02:04.590> cable<00:02:05.430> er<00:02:06.440> mono<00:02:07.440> and

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.350 

101<00:02:11.910> here<00:02:12.209> but<00:02:13.070> it's<00:02:14.070> cool<00:02:14.400> about<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:14.790> camera

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
101 here but it's cool about this camera

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.420 
101 here but it's cool about this camera
I've<00:02:15.959> read<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.350> correctly<00:02:16.560> which<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.070> think<00:02:17.310> I

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
I've read it correctly which I think I

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.390 
I've read it correctly which I think I
did<00:02:17.640> right<00:02:17.880> here<00:02:18.300> we<00:02:19.260> have<00:02:20.990> hdmi<00:02:21.990> also<00:02:22.709> so<00:02:23.340> you

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
did right here we have hdmi also so you

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.750 
did right here we have hdmi also so you
