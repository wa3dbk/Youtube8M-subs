was a pretty big deal and you know it's
a<00:01:51.140> very<00:01:52.140> very<00:01:52.380> very<00:01:52.649> lot<00:01:53.460> much<00:01:53.939> exposure

from him was nice nice to hear was the
there<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> particularly<00:02:02.310> hard<00:02:02.670> moment<00:02:03.060> to

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
there a particularly hard moment to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.910 
there a particularly hard moment to
shoot<00:02:03.360> or<00:02:03.659> something<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.170> took<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.439> ton<00:02:04.890> of

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
shoot or something that took a ton of

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.080 
shoot or something that took a ton of
takes

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
takes

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.370 
takes
well<00:02:06.720> there's<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.560> there's<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:08.069> flying<00:02:08.399> scene

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
well there's a there's a flying scene

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.839 
well there's a there's a flying scene
one<00:02:10.380> I<00:02:10.410> think<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.890> longest<00:02:11.190> we<00:02:11.400> did<00:02:11.580> something

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
one I think the longest we did something

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.449 
one I think the longest we did something
was<00:02:12.150> about<00:02:12.360> twenty<00:02:13.010> twenty<00:02:14.010> fourth<00:02:14.310> or

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
was about twenty twenty fourth or

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.520 
was about twenty twenty fourth or
twenty-fifth<00:02:14.849> take<00:02:15.209> we<00:02:15.360> fell<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.660> got<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.319> scene

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
twenty-fifth take we fell I got a scene

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.960 
twenty-fifth take we fell I got a scene
I<00:02:16.650> can't<00:02:16.920> remember<00:02:17.099> actually<00:02:17.340> where<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.849> in

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
I can't remember actually where it is in

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.410 
I can't remember actually where it is in
the<00:02:18.030> film

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
the film

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.650 
the film
I<00:02:18.660> think<00:02:19.440> it's<00:02:19.530> toward<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.890> end<00:02:20.010> but<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.450> just

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
I think it's toward the end but it just

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.449 
I think it's toward the end but it just
was<00:02:21.870> really<00:02:22.140> important<00:02:22.470> important<00:02:23.190> for<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.400> to

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
was really important important for it to

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.690 
was really important important for it to
be<00:02:23.610> right<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:25.590> know<00:02:25.680> we<00:02:26.069> kept<00:02:26.280> doing<00:02:26.430> it

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
be right and you know we kept doing it

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.670 
be right and you know we kept doing it
and<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.209> trusted<00:02:27.599> that<00:02:27.660> as<00:02:28.290> Brian<00:02:28.620> said

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
and I and I trusted that as Brian said

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680 
and I and I trusted that as Brian said
one<00:02:28.950> more<00:02:29.130> take<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.790> was<00:02:30.269> gonna<00:02:30.360> be<00:02:30.540> one

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
one more take that it was gonna be one

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.120 
one more take that it was gonna be one
more<00:02:30.780> taking<00:02:31.050> we<00:02:31.140> were<00:02:31.230> gonna<00:02:31.319> get<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.709> we

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
more taking we were gonna get it we

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.580 
more taking we were gonna get it we
always<00:02:32.400> ended<00:02:32.610> up<00:02:32.730> getting<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.810> shot<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:34.290> him

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
always ended up getting the shot and him

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.650 
always ended up getting the shot and him
being<00:02:34.800> happy<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.700> didn't<00:02:36.269> really<00:02:36.390> want<00:02:36.599> to

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
being happy and I didn't really want to

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.470 
being happy and I didn't really want to
stop<00:02:37.319> until<00:02:37.500> he<00:02:37.769> was<00:02:37.970> happy<00:02:38.970> with<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.209> anyway

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
stop until he was happy with it anyway

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.240 
stop until he was happy with it anyway
cuz<00:02:39.690> he<00:02:40.290> knows<00:02:40.319> what<00:02:40.680> he's<00:02:40.769> doing

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
cuz he knows what he's doing

cuz he knows what he's doing
were<00:02:41.790> there<00:02:41.940> any<00:02:42.030> perilous<00:02:42.780> moments<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.260> sets

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
were there any perilous moments on sets

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.620 
were there any perilous moments on sets
or<00:02:43.709> near<00:02:43.860> injuries<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.640> pretty<00:02:45.060> good<00:02:45.330> stunts

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
or near injuries you pretty good stunts

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.940 
or near injuries you pretty good stunts
it<00:02:45.840> was<00:02:45.959> how<00:02:46.080> much<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.410> stunts<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.739> do<00:02:46.860> to

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
it was how much of the stunts to do to

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.559 
it was how much of the stunts to do to
yourself<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.400> did<00:02:47.670> quite<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.940> few<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.330> stunts

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
yourself I did quite a few of the stunts

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.140 
yourself I did quite a few of the stunts
there<00:02:49.230> are<00:02:49.290> only<00:02:49.410> actually<00:02:50.010> two<00:02:50.220> instances<00:02:50.970> of

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
there are only actually two instances of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.610 
there are only actually two instances of
things<00:02:51.299> that<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.540> couldn't<00:02:51.810> do<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.440> film

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
things that I couldn't do and the film

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.960 
things that I couldn't do and the film
that<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.769> remember<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.580> were<00:02:53.700> just<00:02:53.849> too

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
that I remember that were just too

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.150 
that I remember that were just too
dangerous<00:02:54.120> for<00:02:54.480> me<00:02:54.569> to<00:02:54.599> do<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.650> everything

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
dangerous for me to do and everything

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.910 
dangerous for me to do and everything
else<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.610> flying<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.209> almost<00:02:57.810> always<00:02:58.080> me<00:02:58.650> when

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
else the flying is almost always me when

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.670 
else the flying is almost always me when
so<00:02:59.190> when<00:02:59.400> it's<00:02:59.549> a<00:02:59.580> real<00:02:59.730> person<00:03:00.090> it's<00:03:00.239> me

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
so when it's a real person it's me

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.110 
so when it's a real person it's me
there's<00:03:01.680> some<00:03:01.799> inserts<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.310> boots<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:02.849> hands

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
there's some inserts of boots and hands

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.000 
there's some inserts of boots and hands
