good<00:01:20.970> at<00:01:21.210> all<00:01:21.570> when<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> hold<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> two

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
good at all when you hold the two

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.200 
good at all when you hold the two
devices<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.189> hand<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.549> clear<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.180> are

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
devices in hand it's clear that they are

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.210 
devices in hand it's clear that they are
different<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.259> most<00:01:25.470> clear<00:01:25.740> difference

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
different and the most clear difference

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.580 
different and the most clear difference
is<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.729> design<00:01:27.240> Sony<00:01:27.840> shaved<00:01:28.200> about<00:01:28.439> a

millimeters off the width but it looks
and<00:01:33.270> feels<00:01:33.540> much<00:01:34.020> smaller<00:01:34.470> mostly<00:01:35.040> thanks<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and feels much smaller mostly thanks to

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.640 
and feels much smaller mostly thanks to
the<00:01:35.610> new<00:01:35.790> rounded<00:01:36.299> edges<00:01:36.750> now<00:01:37.170> these<00:01:37.320> give<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
the new rounded edges now these give it

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.649 
the new rounded edges now these give it
a<00:01:37.770> much<00:01:38.040> classier<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.790> more<00:01:39.090> elegant<00:01:39.570> look

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
a much classier and more elegant look

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.140 
a much classier and more elegant look
but<00:01:40.140> they<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.290> sort<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.100> make<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.640> little<00:01:41.850> bit

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
but they do sort of make it a little bit

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.179 
but they do sort of make it a little bit
more<00:01:42.450> slippery<00:01:43.049> especially<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:43.920> you're<00:01:44.040> using

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
more slippery especially if you're using

more slippery especially if you're using

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
now this elegant look is aided further

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.069 
now this elegant look is aided further

washed<00:03:19.909> out<00:03:20.180> once<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:20.690> boost<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.019> brightness

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
washed out once you boost the brightness

washed out once you boost the brightness
and<00:03:21.949> even<00:03:22.370> then<00:03:22.519> it<00:03:22.699> didn't<00:03:23.030> get<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.449> bright

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870

look really really closely you can see

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.050

the<00:03:32.239> top<00:03:32.449> surface<00:03:32.720> is<00:03:33.109> also<00:03:33.290> different<00:03:33.919> and

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
the top surface is also different and

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.189 
the top surface is also different and
content<00:03:34.729> feels<00:03:34.970> like<00:03:35.209> it's<00:03:35.389> closer<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:35.930> the

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:36.199 
content feels like it's closer to the

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.020 
content feels like it's closer to the
surface<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:36.859> screen<00:03:37.099> it<00:03:37.400> feels<00:03:37.760> almost

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
surface of the screen it feels almost

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.909 
surface of the screen it feels almost
like<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.629> icons<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.349> content<00:03:39.799> is

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
like the icons and the content is

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.830 
like the icons and the content is
floating<00:03:40.400> on<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.639> top<00:03:40.849> of<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.090> surface<00:03:41.329> I

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
floating on the top of the surface I

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.379 
floating on the top of the surface I
didn't<00:03:42.349> ever<00:03:42.500> get<00:03:42.769> that<00:03:42.979> feeling<00:03:43.549> with<00:03:43.669> the<00:03:43.879> z2

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
didn't ever get that feeling with the z2

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.030 
didn't ever get that feeling with the z2
looking<00:03:44.840> at<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.049> camera<00:03:45.470> specs<00:03:45.769> you'd

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
looking at the camera specs you'd

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.830 
looking at the camera specs you'd
suggest<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.699> perhaps<00:03:46.909> they're<00:03:47.299> exactly<00:03:47.720> the

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
suggest that perhaps they're exactly the

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.259 
suggest that perhaps they're exactly the
same<00:03:48.139> one<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.919> mote<00:03:49.129> the<00:03:49.310> most<00:03:49.489> extent<00:03:50.030> they

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
same one to mote the most extent they

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.979 
same one to mote the most extent they
kind<00:03:50.870> of<00:03:50.959> are<00:03:51.169> I<00:03:51.500> took<00:03:52.340> some<00:03:52.519> pictures

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
kind of are I took some pictures

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.449 
kind of are I took some pictures
comparing<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.109> two<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.530> although<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:54.919> noticed

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
comparing the two and although I noticed

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.309 
comparing the two and although I noticed
some<00:03:55.639> differences<00:03:55.879> on<00:03:56.449> the<00:03:56.599> display<00:03:57.019> of<00:03:57.049> the

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
some differences on the display of the

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.110 
some differences on the display of the
phones<00:03:57.620> when<00:03:57.859> I<00:03:57.889> was<00:03:58.129> taking<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.579> pictures<00:03:58.970> I

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
phones when I was taking the pictures I

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.670 
phones when I was taking the pictures I
didn't<00:03:59.569> notice<00:03:59.959> a<00:03:59.989> massive<00:04:00.379> amount<00:04:00.560> of

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
didn't notice a massive amount of

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.229 
didn't notice a massive amount of
difference<00:04:01.069> when<00:04:01.220> I<00:04:01.250> saw<00:04:01.519> them<00:04:01.699> on<00:04:01.849> the<00:04:01.879> same

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
difference when I saw them on the same

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.300 
difference when I saw them on the same
display<00:04:02.750> on<00:04:03.019> my<00:04:03.099> computer<00:04:04.099> for<00:04:04.280> instance

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
display on my computer for instance

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.780 
display on my computer for instance
perhaps<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.299> z3<00:04:05.509> is<00:04:06.049> slightly<00:04:06.769> less<00:04:07.159> vivid<00:04:07.519> in

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
perhaps the z3 is slightly less vivid in

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.429 
perhaps the z3 is slightly less vivid in
terms<00:04:08.060> of<00:04:08.269> color<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:08.780> doesn't<00:04:09.019> perform<00:04:09.290> as

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 
terms of color and doesn't perform as

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.289 
terms of color and doesn't perform as
well<00:04:09.620> in<00:04:09.859> low<00:04:10.159> light<00:04:10.189> you<00:04:10.759> can't<00:04:11.000> help<00:04:11.150> but

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
well in low light you can't help but

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.179 
well in low light you can't help but
feel<00:04:11.509> that<00:04:11.569> this<00:04:11.870> maybe<00:04:12.139> has<00:04:12.470> more<00:04:12.769> to<00:04:12.949> do<00:04:13.069> with

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:13.189 
feel that this maybe has more to do with

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:15.039 
feel that this maybe has more to do with
the<00:04:13.340> processing<00:04:13.970> of<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.299> phone<00:04:14.509> than<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:14.870> does

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
the processing of the phone than it does

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.960 
the processing of the phone than it does
have<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.439> do<00:04:15.590> with<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.919> camera<00:04:16.310> makeup<00:04:16.759> but

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
have to do with the camera makeup but

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.509 
have to do with the camera makeup but
again<00:04:17.329> both<00:04:17.659> are<00:04:17.930> fantastic<00:04:18.070> cameras<00:04:19.070> what<00:04:19.489> I

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
again both are fantastic cameras what I

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.909 
again both are fantastic cameras what I
will<00:04:19.759> say<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.180> I<00:04:20.269> noticed<00:04:20.690> in<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:20.930> 4k<00:04:21.469> video

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
will say that I noticed in the 4k video

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.769 
will say that I noticed in the 4k video
recording<00:04:22.159> mode<00:04:22.610> is<00:04:22.969> that<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.270> Zen<00:04:23.479> 3

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:23.779 
recording mode is that the Zen 3

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:25.779 
recording mode is that the Zen 3
struggled<00:04:24.349> to<00:04:24.469> focus<00:04:24.919> automatically<00:04:25.580> on

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
struggled to focus automatically on

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.030 
struggled to focus automatically on
stuff<00:04:26.360> that's

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
stuff that's

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.860 
stuff that's
Oh<00:04:27.070> sup<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:28.090> same<00:04:28.330> can<00:04:28.510> be<00:04:28.540> said<00:04:28.660> of

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
Oh sup and the same can be said of

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.870 
Oh sup and the same can be said of
taking<00:04:29.380> still<00:04:29.650> photos<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:30.340> doesn't<00:04:30.640> really

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
taking still photos it doesn't really

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.300 
taking still photos it doesn't really
like<00:04:31.240> close-up<00:04:31.870> objects<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:32.950> that's<00:04:33.040> not

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
like close-up objects and that's not

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.010 
like close-up objects and that's not
something<00:04:33.550> I<00:04:33.820> struggled<00:04:34.300> with<00:04:34.330> at<00:04:34.570> all<00:04:34.780> with

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
something I struggled with at all with

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.650 
something I struggled with at all with
the<00:04:35.140> z2<00:04:35.620> pictures<00:04:36.310> are<00:04:36.550> slightly<00:04:37.270> better<00:04:37.480> on

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
the z2 pictures are slightly better on

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.290 
the z2 pictures are slightly better on
the<00:04:37.990> z2<00:04:38.440> than<00:04:38.710> they<00:04:38.860> are<00:04:38.890> on<00:04:39.040> the<00:04:39.310> z3<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.090> the

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
the z2 than they are on the z3 and the

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.180 
the z2 than they are on the z3 and the
video<00:04:40.600> recording<00:04:41.170> mode<00:04:41.200> is<00:04:41.530> definitely

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
video recording mode is definitely

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.790 
video recording mode is definitely
better<00:04:42.400> on<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.760> z2<00:04:43.180> than<00:04:43.420> it<00:04:43.540> is<00:04:43.720> on<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.200> z3

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
better on the z2 than it is on the z3

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.740 
better on the z2 than it is on the z3
so<00:04:45.100> if<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.280> really<00:04:45.490> into<00:04:45.850> photography<00:04:46.000> and

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
so if you really into photography and

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.960 
so if you really into photography and
videos<00:04:47.170> and<00:04:47.500> you've<00:04:47.860> got<00:04:48.070> a<00:04:48.100> said<00:04:48.400> tube<00:04:48.700> then

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
videos and you've got a said tube then

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.400 
videos and you've got a said tube then
there<00:04:49.120> really<00:04:49.300> is<00:04:49.540> no<00:04:49.750> reason<00:04:50.140> for<00:04:50.260> you<00:04:50.380> to

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
there really is no reason for you to

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.440 
there really is no reason for you to
upgrade<00:04:50.680> we<00:04:51.340> get<00:04:51.490> onto<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.820> performance

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
upgrade we get onto the performance

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.420 
upgrade we get onto the performance
again<00:04:52.720> I've<00:04:53.020> not<00:04:53.200> had<00:04:53.380> that<00:04:53.770> much<00:04:54.040> time<00:04:54.370> with

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
again I've not had that much time with

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.910 
again I've not had that much time with
the<00:04:54.730> z3<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.390> give<00:04:55.540> you<00:04:55.690> my<00:04:55.870> full<00:04:56.170> thoughts<00:04:56.200> it

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
the z3 to give you my full thoughts it

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.800 
the z3 to give you my full thoughts it
does<00:04:57.100> have<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.370> 2.5<00:04:57.940> gigahertz<00:04:58.510> processor

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
does have a 2.5 gigahertz processor

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.980 
does have a 2.5 gigahertz processor
versus<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.950> 2.3<00:05:00.700> gigahertz<00:05:00.730> processor<00:05:01.300> on

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
versus the 2.3 gigahertz processor on

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.020 
versus the 2.3 gigahertz processor on
the<00:05:02.020> previous<00:05:02.590> model<00:05:03.010> but<00:05:03.100> in<00:05:03.310> day-to-day<00:05:03.520> use

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
the previous model but in day-to-day use

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.700 
the previous model but in day-to-day use
I<00:05:04.210> haven't<00:05:04.480> really<00:05:04.750> noticed<00:05:04.990> where<00:05:05.530> that

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
I haven't really noticed where that

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.370 
I haven't really noticed where that
extra<00:05:06.160> point<00:05:06.460> 2<00:05:06.700> or<00:05:06.940> the<00:05:07.060> gigahertz<00:05:07.390> has<00:05:07.840> gone

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
use over an extended period will give me

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.500

a<00:05:14.890> clear<00:05:15.160> indication<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:16.090> same<00:05:16.300> could

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
a clear indication the same could

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.270 
a clear indication the same could
probably<00:05:16.900> be<00:05:17.170> said<00:05:17.200> of<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:17.710> battery<00:05:18.100> life

in<00:05:34.180> short<00:05:34.570> this<00:05:34.750> is<00:05:34.810> the<00:05:35.080> best<00:05:35.560> looking<00:05:36.040> Sony

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
in short this is the best looking Sony

in short this is the best looking Sony
Xperia<00:05:37.030> Z<00:05:37.510> phone<00:05:37.870> that's<00:05:38.200> ever<00:05:38.470> been<00:05:38.740> released

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
but if you're someone who values

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.460 
but if you're someone who values
performance<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:41.980> functionality<00:05:43.320> then<00:05:44.320> it

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
performance and functionality then it

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.440 
performance and functionality then it
doesn't<00:05:44.740> really<00:05:44.920> offer<00:05:45.190> that<00:05:45.550> much<00:05:45.850> over<00:05:46.300> its
