recommendation from one of my colleagues

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.889 
recommendation from one of my colleagues
we<00:01:02.070> will<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.640> drill<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> hole<00:01:03.090> inside

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
we will have to drill a hole inside

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.580 
we will have to drill a hole inside
because<00:01:04.890> no<00:01:05.070> matter<00:01:05.189> how<00:01:05.309> many<00:01:05.670> how<00:01:06.380> tight<00:01:07.380> it

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
because no matter how many how tight it

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.010 
because no matter how many how tight it
will<00:01:07.799> come<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.640> how<00:01:09.330> much<00:01:09.510> glue<00:01:09.869> or

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
will come on and how much glue or

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.080 
will come on and how much glue or
anything<00:01:10.200> I'll<00:01:10.500> use<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.460> water<00:01:11.700> will

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
anything I'll use the water will

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.490 
anything I'll use the water will
eventually<00:01:13.130> gather<00:01:14.130> inside<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.259> will<00:01:16.380> be

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
eventually gather inside and it will be

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.249 
eventually gather inside and it will be
slowing<00:01:16.740> slowly<00:01:17.700> dragging<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.659> down<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
slowing slowly dragging it down and it

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.649 
slowing slowly dragging it down and it
they<00:01:19.439> will<00:01:19.680> fall<00:01:19.890> off<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:21.030> I'll<00:01:21.240> start<00:01:21.570> with

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
they will fall off so I'll start with

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.249 
they will fall off so I'll start with
drilling<00:01:22.259> some<00:01:22.439> holes<00:01:23.750> for<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> water<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
drilling some holes for the water to

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.859 
drilling some holes for the water to
drain<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.799> then<00:01:26.790> we'll<00:01:27.000> quickly<00:01:27.240> jump<00:01:27.659> onto

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
drain and then we'll quickly jump onto

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.929 
drain and then we'll quickly jump onto
the<00:01:28.229> fitting<00:01:30.530> right<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.740> yeah<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.640> gonna<00:01:32.759> be

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the fitting right so yeah it's gonna be

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:40.039 
the fitting right so yeah it's gonna be
a<00:01:33.000> really<00:01:33.150> quick<00:01:33.390> one<00:01:38.180> some<00:01:39.180> paper<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.840> just

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
a really quick one some paper on it just

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.020 
a really quick one some paper on it just
in<00:01:40.200> case<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.619> turns<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.490> my<00:01:41.610> hand<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.000> it

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
in case that turns in my hand so it

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.810 
in case that turns in my hand so it
shouldn't<00:01:42.710> just<00:01:43.710> plastic<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.579> should<00:01:44.790> be

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
shouldn't just plastic so that should be

00:01:44.820 --> 00:02:03.760 
shouldn't just plastic so that should be
very<00:01:46.040> quick<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.869> marked<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.770> middle
