obviously<00:00:07.440> building<00:00:07.830> in<00:00:08.069> terms<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:09.170> not<00:00:10.170> just

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
obviously building in terms of not just

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.310 
obviously building in terms of not just
players<00:00:10.740> but<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> program<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.880> so<00:00:12.540> we've<00:00:12.870> we've

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
players but a program and so we've we've

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.379 
players but a program and so we've we've
done<00:00:13.530> we've<00:00:14.309> been<00:00:14.490> quite<00:00:14.730> consistent<00:00:15.269> with

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
done we've been quite consistent with

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.150 
done we've been quite consistent with
our<00:00:15.420> last<00:00:15.809> two<00:00:15.990> games<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.800> guess<00:00:16.980> we're

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
our last two games and I guess we're

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.580 
our last two games and I guess we're
wanting<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.640> hold<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.630> they're<00:00:19.380> still

from three learning on the field and off
the<00:00:46.739> field<00:00:46.890> has<00:00:47.190> been<00:00:47.219> pretty<00:00:47.730> amazing<00:00:48.140> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the field has been pretty amazing the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.569 
the field has been pretty amazing the
cultures<00:00:49.590> buildings<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.129> hear<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
cultures buildings you can hear the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.100 
cultures buildings you can hear the
music<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> background<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:51.840> it's

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
music in the background you know it's

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.160 
music in the background you know it's
it's<00:00:52.559> about<00:00:53.250> having<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.640> balance<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.750> you

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
it's about having that balance of you

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.660 
it's about having that balance of you
know<00:00:55.230> knowing<00:00:55.620> when<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.770> switch<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.430> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
know knowing when to switch on and to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.529 
know knowing when to switch on and to
switch<00:00:56.879> off<00:00:58.399> with<00:00:59.399> tank<00:00:59.670> at<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.910> guess<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.420> know

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
switch off with tank at I guess you know

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.779 
switch off with tank at I guess you know
that<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:01.050> terms<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.590> we've<00:01:01.980> made<00:01:02.340> subtle

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
that in terms of we've made subtle

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.870 
that in terms of we've made subtle
changes<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.510> our<00:01:03.539> game<00:01:04.290> plan<00:01:04.489> to<00:01:05.489> keep<00:01:05.640> things

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
changes to our game plan to keep things

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.539 
changes to our game plan to keep things
fresh<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.330> keep<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> opposition<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.710> guess

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
fresh to keep the opposition I guess

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.670 
fresh to keep the opposition I guess
guessing<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.540> terms<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.049> what<00:01:10.229> we're<00:01:10.409> what

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
guessing in terms of what we're what

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.770 
guessing in terms of what we're what
we're<00:01:10.799> going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.010> bring<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.540> think

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
we're going to bring and and I think

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.550 
we're going to bring and and I think
England<00:01:13.170> found<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.340> out<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.869> last<00:01:15.869> week<00:01:16.140> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
England found that out and last week and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.020

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
so we want to we want to make sure that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.030 
so we want to we want to make sure that
we're<00:01:18.320> creating<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.590> bit<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.890> learning

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.569 
take something away from them and I
think<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.659> tides<00:01:51.899> change<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.590> us<00:01:53.220> had

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
think that the tides change that us had

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.999 
think that the tides change that us had
a<00:01:53.610> good<00:01:53.820> result<00:01:54.149> against<00:01:54.390> Canada<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.020> they

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
a good result against Canada and they

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.340 
a good result against Canada and they
want<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.909> definitely<00:01:57.180> would<00:01:57.840> love<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.229> go

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
want to that definitely would love to go

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
want to that definitely would love to go
away<00:01:58.560> taking<00:01:58.979> taking<00:01:59.310> our<00:01:59.520> scalpel<00:01:59.909> yes<00:02:00.090> but

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
away taking taking our scalpel yes but

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.740
