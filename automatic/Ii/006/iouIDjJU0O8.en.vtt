00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 and good is all you commenting aqueles 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.109
 I bring white gameplay 2 good 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.670
 although another time in which there was no 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.519
 employee and commented was between keys and 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.300
 diamond camouflages I only saw 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.740
 snipers on all sides and 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.690
 bloodthirsty badges he needed 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.210
 to get me those with diamond flashes 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.760
 but good finally finally I have it the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.080
 I really do not know enough about 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.970
 have as I tell you the camouflage of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.439
 diamond I've already taken off on is 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.320
 enabling me to take out my shotguns now 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.769
 but there is every shotgun that is that I do not 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.149
 they would not touch with a stick seriously they are very 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.020
 bad some weapons or what good 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.340
 just maybe it costs 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.739
 get used but good after 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.629
 use the staple francs we are 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.860
 prepared for all good that I bring you 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.469
 gameplay with the ms mc is an employee of 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.870
 how much a week ago or something like that and 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.059
 that implies which I swelled a lot 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.730
 kill a serving the bmc for this map 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.149
 is let 's go great going to a submachine gun 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.500
 super good on this map and as I say 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.390
 It was a pretty good match 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.760
 when we moved quite well in the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.619
 team simply because you try to move 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.090
 where are they and as you know 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.840
 in this game it costs a lot 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.009
 Get used 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.469
 because he answers what they have done 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.210
 much better at least in the mode 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:15.420
 of game as confirmed low etc but 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.250
 that is to say that some of 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.799
 something else and the response 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.479
 it costs more to predict it is to say it says 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.399
 we will be out there in the back as 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.869
 that express more enemies but good 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.020
 on this map the main thing as you know 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.939
 is to keep them in the center and if you're 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.560
 in the center does not miss anything and from above 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.810
 if you wear a bulletproof vest to 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.310
 the best imagined only in the square 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.530
 from the center his life and over looking the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.899
 sides that each enemy has a greater 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.970
 Exercise goes super super super well 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.140
 so what you have to do is what 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.640
 I am here for example, get into the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.340
 enemy backing just stay 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.380
 Well, wait for them or go all the equipment 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.810
 together and this is only practically a 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.849
 suicide so good as you are 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.579
 seeing mmc streaks I was wearing was the 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:58.439
 lightning attack carries the agr wearing the 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.719
 what to be here we see a lizard 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.969
 grave on the ground then it creates 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.170
 mainly what I wanted to do as 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.689
 although at first they have killed three 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.640
 times a month out no streak but 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.769
 it's where the cool starts, it's just 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.350
 from now on how are you going to 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.080
 see this area of ​​which I said that 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.430
 you can catch all the enemies 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.810
 unsuspecting is desperate up or 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.600
 joaquin I tumble minter stuck in the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.160
 betty something quite important even 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.380
 not only lay down, but with crouching 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.980
 the two forms are already serving 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.350
 bulletproof vest because practically 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.420
 let's say it's impossible not to get killed 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.890
 because the neighbors endured in fact 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.450
 I put our potential or you will continue 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.780
 more than anything for that for the betis and 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.210
 because it hurts you a lot the damage of 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.280
 grenades and all of these things like you 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.800
 I say it 's amazing what the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.770
 difference that there is is abysmal then 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.110
 well basically the gameplay consists 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.670
 in taking out and getting the attack streak 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.800
 lightning as you are seeing here we see 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.550
 are the little red dots and just 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.050
 wait for the plates to run before 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.610
 come the manga badges this last 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.980
 that they were welcomed because it would be that they are 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.820
 the enemies appear there first 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.850
 one side served to warn me that 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.870
 If they came, they will appear 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.000
 sounds begin to appear the 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.220
 allies but as I tell you it served me 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.870
 just to know that they were not 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.519
 there the enemies on the one hand 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.959
 on the other hand to not get into 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.730
 I replied that they appear from behind but 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.739
 thing that can deaf because 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.900
 they were my teammates so good here 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.250
 I have the thing to be there I have the agr 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.650
 which is certainly one of the recipes that 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.209
 I like it first because it's a robot 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.239
 That's what it says, it's my mother, it's a small thing, 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.530
 I was expecting a use a robot hair inside 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.080
 to meet sir inside but nothing or 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.819
 incredible or is it a mini robot that 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.620
 I almost killed my own robot here if not 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.830
 it was because he was wearing vest and has 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.360
 busted but good here I have the double 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.220
 is we saw her here she eats she had 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.840
 Distinct card and I just put 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.970
 where the enemies are appearing 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.890
 of oysters I got down just 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.080
 my allies appeared there but good 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.850
 basically in this this map you already know 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.800
 that we have to maintain the center and 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.989
 try good to try and do it is very 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.930
 too much the fool and that the enemies do not 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.489
 reappear to appear next to us what 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.080
 well here if I'm playing with 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.550
 friends what you have to do is 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.500
 I just think that I usually do 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.049
 done when I'm playing with this one 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.090
 axonal these others in that sack a streak 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.260
 Well, just wait for me on those 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.300
 the maps of this game that are all 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.550
 symmetrical and they're pretty much in quotes 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.140
 elongated not that have say a side 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.020
 and another no more or less we could say 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.070
 Well, I'll always say that in a 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.570
 point of the map 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.810
 to show our time 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.750
 allies and the uncle who is was 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.360
 driving let's say the attack 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.780
 the air attack whatever it was to be 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.040
 in this case, in this way they take him out 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.810
 all the enemies in the same place is 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.190
 say follow me another time in a 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.240
 end of the map the enemies are going to 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.470
 be appearing all the time in the 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.110
 another extreme because obviously it's not going to 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.310
 appear next to you then as the 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.650
 game is well done and will not appear 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.210
 next to you what we can do is 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.860
 simply staying on one end does not 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.600
 let's kill nobody but the people that 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.850
 has got the high streak and we are 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.980
 helping then let's kill 20 30 40 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.690
 with the sealed lot I was going to come super 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.670
 well for him to get a good start not 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.320
 in fact it is the key if you look at the 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.120
 he was obviously playing back 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.210
 when I only go in the knife not 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.120
 normal normal runs the knife that pulled 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.260
 the next thing to be and I there that 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.210
 I have them very big I'm going to 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.910
 throw it but here in between I said 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.410
 here nobody will see me but I started 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.120
 throw and everyone going through all this 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.380
 passing people next to me like serving 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.880
 my future of ibr de yo cassidy 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.030
 committing suicide by defeating my mother in that 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.000
 and that and smash I reappear so much to this one 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.170
 as the chaplain is the death of 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.750
 here he got the streak 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.300
 48 4 warning is a pretty game 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.560
 good above on this map that I like 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.620
 enough for him 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:54.450
 with a sub-machine gun and above all more to sack 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:54.450
 but good this is for all
