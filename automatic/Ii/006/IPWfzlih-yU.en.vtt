00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.119
 good 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.100
 notice worse movies based on 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.719
 video games for over 20 years 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.910
 hollywood has tried to carry 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.039
 classic video games to the screen 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.930
 big the problem is that in film 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.880
 after movie they have excited us with 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.220
 to see how they come to life 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.019
 favorite characters and almost always the 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.119
 movies are terrible 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.519
 productions that fans end 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.439
 hating those of us who have the top-ten 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.140
 the worst movies based on 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.079
 video games in the tenth place it 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.120
 you find in 2005 the fans of the 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.309
 franchise eagerly awaited the 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.500
 premiere of a movie that promised no 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.390
 just innovate with incredible scenes in 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.430
 first person but also be the 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.890
 better adaptation of a video game until 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.539
 the date the final result was so bad 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.520
 like the winter brown performance 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.410
 johnson the promised scenes in 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.840
 first person were limited to about 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.180
 short minutes at the end of the movie and 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.160
 the adaptation was a total disaster that 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.410
 despite everything you feel curious about 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.830
 see it you can skip the entire movie 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.560
 until the last half hour 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.530
 in the ninth position we have a dead 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.690
 alive voluptuous girls fighting to 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.580
 death in tiny clothes that are bad 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.920
 with that because we like it or not 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.840
 movies need to have some kind of 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.600
 sense and arguments thing of what 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.250
 this film entirely without addition 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.260
 that has the most dialogues 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.920
 ridiculous and incoherent in the story 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.080
 of the cinema 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.240
 in the end the movie is so bad that 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.390
 half-naked girls lose all the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.120
 attractive at number 8 we have 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.770
 a house of the dead there is a simple reason 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.050
 why this movie is bad a 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.510
 egg the director is famous for 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.760
 turn excellent video games into 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.800
 terrible adaptations that should 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.420
 be destroyed even before 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.700
 arrive at theaters house of the dead 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.610
 has absurd situations of something 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.500
 meaningless and lousy performances if you 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.050
 what you are looking for is reverting without stopping during 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.300
 90 minutes false the dead could be 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.119
 an option only in cases of emergencies 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.580
 in place number 7 you will find black 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.830
 rain an egg does it again now 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.390
 bringing us a ridiculous story of 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.069
 vampires that makes the saga of 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.230
 'twilight' look good 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.510
 tragic of all is of actors of the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.120
 carving by ben kingsley michelle rodríguez 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.519
 michael madsen and especially geraldine 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.590
 chaplin wasting his talent the 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.959
 simple story block brain is a woman 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.700
 half vampire half human working 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.950
 as an agent for a secret society 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.450
 known as princeton in charge of 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.670
 pursue and destroy threats 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.620
 supernatural from the wrong direction 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.540
 the performance overload and a 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.219
 meaningless story we have no more 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.159
 to ask why they keep giving 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:44.799
 of course the voice productions in 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:48.489
 sixth place we all dragon 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.500
 in 1994 the brothers tried him 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.209
 try your luck on the big screen but 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.280
 the truth would have been better 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.379
 the safe world of video games 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.489
 the film itself has almost nothing to 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.889
 offer off some ridiculous 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.930
 magical medallions not only the script is 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.540
 bad the performances are little credible 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.549
 in history it has nothing to do with 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.590
 the video game if you're a fan of everything 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.900
 dragon and you have not seen the movie you 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.989
 we recommend that you keep it as far 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.449
 possible of it in the number 5 spot it 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.590
 find alone in the dark could not be 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:19.959
 other than an egg 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.760
 destroying another video game or 20 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.950
 millions of dollars got a 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.379
 decent production the movie does not have 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.940
 neither feet nor head there is senseless action 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.709
 argumentative incoherence 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.840
 bad performances a story 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.060
 incredibly complicated but about 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.310
 everything has no relation to the 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.290
 game in case it was not enough the beginning of the 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.940
 movie from the most boring in the 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.920
 history of cinema because it has a 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.989
 flat and boring voice- over that alone 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.940
 complicates more the story we only have left 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.709
 ask in the most attentive way that by 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.890
 Please do not let this man make 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.260
 more movies we approach the end and 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.060
 things get worse and worse in the 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.700
 fourth position we have street fighter 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.799
 it's a shame that street fighter was 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.870
 the penultimate movie by raúl juliá 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.819
 someone who made us laugh as much as 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.129
 homero to dance did not deserve that this 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.230
 fiasco was almost his goodbye while the 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.209
 film was a box office success was 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.489
 evident that the argument was bad the 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.190
 exaggerated performances and the result 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.410
 final a complete insult to the saga a 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.739
 big disappointment for any fan 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.380
 of the franchise in third place it 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.270
 find deadly kombat animation 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.130
 incredibly the first part of 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.440
 death to combat on the big screen 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.810
 it was not so bad the game got stuck 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.730
 had decent performances and the effects 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.980
 specials were good taking into account 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.140
 the era thanks to box office success 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.570
 that was the first part they came up with 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.430
 throw dead fight and injury that 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.940
 was based on the third installment of the 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.460
 game 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.710
 the critics smashed the tape for their 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.870
 meaningless fights special effects 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.790
 cheap and a totally story 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.160
 absurd does not cause great surprise that 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.470
 thanks to all this canceled the third 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.960
 part 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.450
 in the second position we have something like that 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.030
 of active extension throughout the 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.620
 years and with five sequels a worse than 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.570
 the previous one is not tricantino you have 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.880
 won the scorn of the fans to 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.980
 pulse however we can not stop 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.690
 the first part side so pleased 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.790
 fanatics like the specialized critic 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.070
 despite being a created story 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.110
 exclusively for the movie when 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.210
 the rumors about a second part are 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.130
 they made all the 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.780
 fans eagerly awaited the 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.000
 appearance of nemesis on the screen 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.490
 unfortunately they were taking a 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.440
 bitter drink because the fearsome nemesis of 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.870
 the games had been reduced to a 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.640
 both useless monster unable to harm 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.890
 Alice thanks to you still remember your 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.260
 feelings the worst was that he did not stop there 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.030
 torture and a third part was launched 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.830
 that made apocalypse deserve a 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.370
 oscar not only the argument did not have 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.440
 sense 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.600
 the casting was horrible a clear 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.610
 old and blonde version that does not match 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.950
 nothing with the original character which 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.230
 we all love the story starts when 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.330
 all humanity has been exterminated 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.490
 by the ki baires clair directs a convoy 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.320
 with the last survivors while 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.830
 purchase continues to generate copies of 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.840
 alice 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.700
 the cherry in the mess cake are 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.740
 the new psychic powers with which 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.830
 alice definitely has the 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.590
 Worst movies of the saga and the worst 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.380
 Video-based movie is super 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.510
 Mario Bros, despite being the first 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.910
 gender that does not justify that super 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.070
 mariobros is this bad and even the 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.720
 very bob hoskins has said that it is the 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.300
 worst movie in which he has participated 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.890
 the story is a tragedy on its own 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.990
 it has nothing to do with the 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.940
 video game in this story the brothers 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.860
 plumbers mario and luigi will have to 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.320
 rescue the daisy paleontologist who has 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.150
 been kidnapped by the evil squatter in 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.670
 the film compa lives in one dimension 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.860
 alternate to which they were transported 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.080
 all the dinosaurs at the time of falling 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.630
 the meteorite that supposedly took them 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.580
 to extinction 65 million years ago 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.770
 in this world they followed 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.960
 evolving and now they are a kind of 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.150
 half human half dinosaurs one 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.130
 story that surely makes you cry 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.990
 miyamoto every time I think of them in 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.910
 actually only certain 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.650
 references to the game as a pretext 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.070
 perfect to use the name of the 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.460
 popular franchise on the billboard
