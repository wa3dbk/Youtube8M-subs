the flavour they took out skittles new
it's<00:04:11.390> like<00:04:12.340> it's<00:04:13.340> almost<00:04:13.519> like<00:04:13.700> a<00:04:14.180> weird

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
it's like it's almost like a weird

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.199 
it's like it's almost like a weird
sprite<00:04:15.290> yeah<00:04:15.800> yeah<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.609> started<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.180> I

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
sprite yeah yeah it started you I

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.120 
sprite yeah yeah it started you I
factually<00:04:17.690> thought<00:04:17.870> it<00:04:17.959> was<00:04:18.049> good<00:04:18.230> but<00:04:18.980> the

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
factually thought it was good but the

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.440 
factually thought it was good but the
end<00:04:19.250> was<00:04:19.400> really<00:04:19.730> bad

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
end was really bad

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.480 
end was really bad
see<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.260> got<00:04:21.410> a<00:04:21.440> different<00:04:21.889> first<00:04:22.100> it<00:04:22.310> wasn't

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
see I got a different first it wasn't

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.909 
see I got a different first it wasn't
too<00:04:23.150> limey<00:04:23.419> than<00:04:23.690> FBA<00:04:23.930> it<00:04:24.290> gets<00:04:24.500> a<00:04:24.620> little<00:04:24.740> bit

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
too limey than FBA it gets a little bit

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:25.210 
too limey than FBA it gets a little bit
better

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
better

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.580 
better
it's<00:04:25.820> probably<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.150> mix<00:04:26.360> of<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:26.630> other<00:04:26.750> maybe

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
it's probably the mix of the other maybe

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.900 
it's probably the mix of the other maybe
I<00:04:27.889> think<00:04:28.160> I'm<00:04:28.220> just<00:04:28.310> gonna<00:04:28.400> give<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:28.669> to<00:04:28.700> Green
