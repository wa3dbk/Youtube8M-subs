00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.000
 hello to all and the easy jo and we get 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.110
 found for a new technique 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.300
 resale purchase 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.489
 this method will come closer to that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.960
 of 400 packs credit for it must 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.820
 not a big investment 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.800
 and you must not be 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.660
 enormously present in the market of 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.690
 transfers so today I'm going to you 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.160
 talk about the badges of big clubs 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.140
 first of all why this technique 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.710
 not just walk when you 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.840
 go buy 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.510
 there are many who are present in 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.800
 starting price at 150 credit all 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.150
 just because people when 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.790
 and sell they do not necessarily know 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.290
 the price they are worth and you will have 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.850
 also very little competition for 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.100
 buy very few people are going 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.300
 outbid your offers because everything 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.970
 it is simply a method of purchase 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.559
 resale very little used at the level of the 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.540
 sale you will always make profits 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.610
 simply because when a 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.370
 nobody buys she's going to pick 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.930
 simply the price for immediate purchase 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.970
 minimum to have their crest very 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.670
 quickly even if there are offers to 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.590
 150 people will not go out bidding 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.020
 above they prefer to buy in 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.150
 the immediate now so I'm going to you 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.220
 show how I proceed we will 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.960
 make the transfer market 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.440
 may escutcheon we will take as an example 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.850
 in the championship of barclays we will 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:39.659
 make on manchester united in hand 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.000
 prymack 150 and the berre we put all 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.760
 the offers at 105 so it's really 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.119
 a nag tech or but especially this 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.119
 we see 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.220
 so here we do it good I will not 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.910
 go to the 59th minute but you 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.760
 can do it 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.320
 and the same for manchester city is so 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.260
 sealed two examples I'm going to you 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.520
 show 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.880
 so that's all 150 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.190
 So we are, of course, after you 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.800
 make especially the big two badges 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.390
 clubs so you will then see what 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.150
 I took in my list of transfers 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.620
 but it will focus on the embeds 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.350
 chelsea united city in series ya ça va 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.710
 to be juventus milan ac league 1 it's going 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.380
 to be psg in liga bbva you will fall 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.610
 on barca and real but that's 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.460
 harder to have because it's 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.060
 really very popular but also 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.430
 the atletico madrid 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.360
 so that's about all the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.070
 patches that you can have 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.530
 easily at 150 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.180
 so once you've done that you 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.010
 expect and do renchérisse 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.840
 especially not all offers when you 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.780
 learned wants to remove them from your goals 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.360
 transfer and you can add some 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.360
 others at 150 and you will recover 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.250
 many badges like this so me 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.709
 for example I had these 33 elements in 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.660
 extremely soon after it takes 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.940
 to know that the best is still 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.130
 to buy in the morning you will have 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.450
 much more than the afternoon we go 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.220
 go to my transfer list for 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.980
 see the items I bought and that 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:18.170
 will give you an idea of ​​the badges to 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.760
 take it start with bolton have this 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.220
 because it's a second club 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.910
 popular English manchester division 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.880
 united 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:31.209
 kaizer chiefs in south africa 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:35.870
 the psg which is very popular 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:42.170
 the milan ac also the crests of 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:44.210
 dortmund manchester city ​​the juventus who 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.310
 is also popular 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:54.100
 but here's another milan kieser chief 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.100
 the baiia rossi which is a huge club 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.060
 so you see that I get everything at 150 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.680
 after there is the real one I got him to 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.180
 300 have let loose media are advancing a bit by 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.849
 hazard 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.349
 but otherwise I really buy everything at 150 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.540
 but he will be sold to his dear ones 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:21.530
 because it's the real and the barça 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:25.150
 is worth a crest of the atletico 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.150
 which is also popular 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.889
 and so you have seen that I am 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.630
 do not take the lead I put the offers to 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.000
 price i will play a game all that 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.950
 I recovered at 150 da it's all good 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.050
 everything that I was outbid I 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.310
 remove I start again at least you have 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.229
 no need to be present on the market 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.850
 transfers you do not take the 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.590
 head and that's why it's a 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.310
 rather cool method for the small budget 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.229
 that's nice 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.660
 so now I'm going to sell all that 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.970
 and we meet again to see what 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.860
 price I put them and here we are 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.810
 found once I sold everything 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.639
 you can see that there are 34 elements 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.900
 written and I had put only 33 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.940
 it's because I made a little purchase 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.760
 resale in the meantime and that I recovered 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.960
 a player that I sold just before 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.450
 to go to my list of transfers in 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.070
 was worth in my transfer goals 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.350
 where you saw that I had noted 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.750
 a few ecus sense and we'll see what 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.210
 I recovered on the whole I 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:25.310
 salvaged two manchester badges 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:28.639
 city ​​and four crest of manchester 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.130
 city and 2nd 2 manchester united 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.650
 so frankly without forcing and having the 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.510
 half of the badges that I note it's 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.340
 rather nice knowing that if you do 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.380
 this morning you can have stats 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.700
 a little better now we will go 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.700
 in my list of transfers to see to 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.990
 what price did I sell my coat of arms and 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.970
 just before I would like to tell you that 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.680
 I had to re- listed once because 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.950
 elements of bolton was not part of the 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:56.229
 first time we start with bolton at 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:06:00.289
 300 credit milan ac between 300 and 350 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:04.070
 dortmund between 400 and 450 there now 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:06.550
 milan 350 atletico madrid at 400 credit to 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.710
 dortmund 450 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:15.650
 kaiser chief at 515 50 so his 500 or 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:21.440
 550 NPC 500 or 550 such that still the 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:23.990
 kaiser chief milan paris and the real 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.990
 madrid that I sold 700 credit in 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.290
 he I had bought 300 still from 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.710
 kaiser chiefs and psg 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:36.830
 bolton manchester city that I sell at 300 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:40.940
 or at 350 credit the bayern munich is 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:46.040
 very expensive at 700 so we continue 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:50.540
 manchester united 4 400 450 the eu to 400 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:53.270
 credit and that's it by doing the calculations 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:56.720
 I was thinking 5100 credit and sales 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.810
 will bring back 13 1650 teddy so in 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.450
 big it makes me 8552 bnf 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.920
 so it's pretty good knowing that 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.650
 it's a technique requires very little 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.960
 of time because you are bidding as a 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.810
 nagging and then you can do some 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.220
 matches and collected what you earned 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.530
 to then sell them 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.770
 in addition if you can see I know is 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.840
 still 150 and I sell them between 300 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.740
 and 500 credits so really for the 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.750
 small budgets 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.060
 it's very good enough bnf 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.320
 quickly so that's it I'm done with 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.420
 this method 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.640
 I hope it will always serve you 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.500
 If you have any questions do not hesitate 

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.120
 to ask them in the comments and 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.920
 as for us we find ourselves in the middle of 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.500
 week for the fourth episode of 

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.000
 roth all a million on this I you 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.050
 wish a very good week to all 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.590
 and see you 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.590
