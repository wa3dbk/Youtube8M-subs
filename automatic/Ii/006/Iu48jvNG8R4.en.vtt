00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.299
 hello youtube friends today I brought you 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.919
 this tutorial to make them 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:07.990
 work in ville tool is much if not 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:09.670
 they know or they do not understand the bullet or they 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.040
 are the marks of the bullets in the 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.990
 walls the floor in the wood and so on - 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.480
 in the water but what the fuck are they going to 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.310
 make marks in the water xdddd shut 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.199
 that this is my tutorial and not yours 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.750
 good thing if you looked for this tutorial 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.880
 surely it is because I knew ugly subject to 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.619
 san andreas can not stand the bulle ton 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.599
 that gets stuck or just the 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.160
 screen stays there just and does not load 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.200
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.059
 is to go to the limit the download in the 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.010
 description and they will have this car 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.050
 removable and here they only give double click 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.420
 good here in this and they give him to install 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.460
 Well there will be this folder and 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.320
 within it there will be two folders one 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.789
 it's called bullet holtz mode and the other one 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.680
 that will be called has been to see good 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.360
 first they open this folder that says 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.579
 Hollywood widget and copy all the 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.410
 content if you have already downloaded 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.539
 the jolin widget does not have all these 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.520
 download files be because 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.530
 so do the configuration is not going 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.350
 to welcome the world I recommend this 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.180
 because it has the 13 x 9 in 40 point 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.110
 lly without that at least I do not 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.300
 it works to this one 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.220
 from the cetal to sense by its channel has 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.960
 good many good what they have to 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.940
 do is go to the folder of your to 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.770
 san andreas and what they had copied what 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.990
 they stick there to me I get this because I 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.910
 I already have it installed well now what 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.620
 second what they have to do is 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.570
 copy the contents of the folder has 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.610
 have been and then go to the folder of 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.560
 his gta san andreas and they stick him there 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.450
 it will come out that if they want to replace them and 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.460
 the lady that yes and now if they already did 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.229
 this and it does not work for them they still do what 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.790
 next here on the desk they give 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.680
 right click and then give you the 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.140
 properties here wait and since it came out 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.970
 this there they go here to setup and 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.009
 then they go down here where it says 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.229
 problem solver and here you guys 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.240
 they will have it this way in total acceleration and 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.160
 go down here until the third make sure 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.660
 that down here say this so that 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.670
 have errors disable the 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.380
 acceleration of all cursors and 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.479
 Advanced drawing use this 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.310
 configuration to correct problems of 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.440
 drawing good if you do not catch who 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.149
 this configuration they give to the next 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.399
 which says it disables acceleration 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.080
 of cursors and bitmaps but it 's more 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.149
 I'm sure they give this one to me 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.170
 I have never going to go down more than that 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.750
 if they are going to play 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.610
 because their game is not going to open them 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.980
 of this acceleration that I am here 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.780
 will help you regret when they have 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.670
 done this is the dra that if you want 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.530
 restart and apply settings 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.630
 but that they give to that there is no give to 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.280
 apply and then accept if they already did 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.959
 this and still do not catch them the so 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.000
 it's probably because it has a color 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.100
 way and in my being and it is look I have 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.900
 but if I fuck because I did 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.569
 something good if it has a bad color should 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.599
 delete the color files cx mode and how 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:41.260
 point well and just leave the 13-9 custom 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.060
 settings and from 3 x 9 9 point ll 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.830
 you just have to leave those two and if you have 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.870
 another very good color should just leave 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.850
 these two and delete the rest and there you will see 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.830
 that bullying or fashion will catch them 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.989
 and forget to say that if you have the chrome 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.180
 they should also delete a file that says 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.370
 color mod but down there they will realize 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.170
 which is good configuration options 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.970
 that erase and it will catch you I want 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.340
 tell them that I did not do this tutorial 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.530
 watching other tutorials I did these 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.600
 configurations because I have a pc 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.460
 Fucking and I did not use this one either 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.710
 mod and then I started doing that 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.240
 well here a proof that it will serve you 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.400
 the color mode and they will not stay 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.400
