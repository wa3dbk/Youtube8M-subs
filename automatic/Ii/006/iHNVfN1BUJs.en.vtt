00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello death they Krampus today 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.080
 i keep on seeing hormones and 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.960
 Today's mod we have teams for 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:17.369
 minecraft poket edishn so our first 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:20.520
 command this chap this whole dish by 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.990
 This team you can very highly 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.720
 jump but little and it is unlikely that you are donets 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.560
 on the contrary, you are not likely to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.520
 survive and so we type jab at 10 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.380
 recruit and we jumped 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.440
 and we are shorter in space and somewhere mouse 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.430
 fly off and we see nothing and then we 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.770
 risk fall and well undressing 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.719
 in general, yes judging by the lit-re commands she 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.590
 does n't deliver at all since you're just 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.170
 go away and break up and make no sense to you 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.190
 will skokova 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.300
 and our second team is strange 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:08.280
 team but she is very helpful and so 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:10.860
 type gif through adding and aide 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.159

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.729
 we type gif 311 so we enter and here 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.140
 please appear in our inventory 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:24.890

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.890
 honestly and so you can calm 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.189
 calm yourself to make a coleman reservation 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.700
 take the sword and rations to beat the zombies 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:40.290
 what is it really cool and very 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.409
 helpful okay our next team 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:49.399
 allows us to make it shorter 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.399
 yourself and so we type ss home 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.810
 horde 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.929
 snh 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.649
 and so here you scored Sith and do not know 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.729
 team acted or not but now 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.090
 check let's run away somewhere 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.319
 far far beyond the blue mountains and distant 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.640
 mountains hall beyond the sea 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:18.060

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.150
 constantly glitching at all for the button 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:28.380

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:30.750

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.910

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:39.720
 still the fact that I had a script and 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:43.140
 I understood what to do on the task I understood 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:47.150
 better understand what the hour creak is a little bit 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:55.260

00:02:47.150 --> 00:03:00.389
