00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
you guys my thoughts on how he's doing

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.990 
you guys my thoughts on how he's doing
right<00:00:24.150> now<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:25.260> first<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.800> all<00:00:25.949> I'd<00:00:26.310> say<00:00:26.640> he's

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
right now so first of all I'd say he's

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.960 
right now so first of all I'd say he's
doing<00:00:27.330> pretty<00:00:27.449> well<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.199> mean<00:00:28.680> he's<00:00:29.160> always<00:00:29.460> you

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
doing pretty well I mean he's always you

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.759 
doing pretty well I mean he's always you
know<00:00:30.090> got<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.570> came<00:00:30.869> shift<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.529> free

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
know got that I came shift the free

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.700 
know got that I came shift the free
flash<00:00:32.160> or<00:00:32.520> 19<00:00:33.300> minor<00:00:33.540> flash<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> 10<00:00:34.350> second

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
flash or 19 minor flash on a 10 second

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.670 
flash or 19 minor flash on a 10 second
cooldown<00:00:35.010> or<00:00:35.370> whatever<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.440> he's<00:00:37.440> still

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
cooldown or whatever it is he's still

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.150 
cooldown or whatever it is he's still
you<00:00:38.010> know<00:00:38.040> pretty<00:00:38.370> safe<00:00:38.700> he's<00:00:39.270> got<00:00:39.480> poking

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
you know pretty safe he's got poking

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.799 
you know pretty safe he's got poking
powerful<00:00:41.160> global<00:00:41.280> ultimate<00:00:42.030> he<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.450> buff<00:00:42.660> his

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
powerful global ultimate he can buff his

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.950 
powerful global ultimate he can buff his
teammates<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:44.129> I'd<00:00:44.489> say<00:00:44.730> he's<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.300> reasonably

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
teammates so I'd say he's a reasonably

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.250 
teammates so I'd say he's a reasonably
safe<00:00:46.260> pick<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:47.489> my<00:00:48.030> opinion<00:00:48.260> champions

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
safe pick but in my opinion champions

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.670 
safe pick but in my opinion champions
like<00:00:49.440> Lucien<00:00:50.210> I<00:00:51.210> would<00:00:51.930> probably<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.379> pick

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
like Lucien I would probably just pick

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.770 
like Lucien I would probably just pick
them<00:00:52.890> over<00:00:53.340> as<00:00:53.489> y'all<00:00:53.789> unless<00:00:54.149> you're<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.449> me

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
them over as y'all unless you're like me

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.950 
them over as y'all unless you're like me
because<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.039> play<00:00:56.129> Israel<00:00:56.960> con

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
because you just like to play Israel con

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.470 
because you just like to play Israel con
solution<00:00:58.379> basically<00:00:58.620> does<00:00:59.100> everything<00:00:59.910> that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
solution basically does everything that

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.470 
solution basically does everything that
as<00:01:00.899> your<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:01.859> better<00:01:02.120> Lucien<00:01:03.120> has<00:01:03.149> more

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
as your can but better Lucien has more

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.670 
as your can but better Lucien has more
damage<00:01:03.960> he's<00:01:04.350> more<00:01:04.799> mobile<00:01:05.720> he<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.869> even<00:01:07.020> poke

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
damage he's more mobile he can even poke

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.000 
damage he's more mobile he can even poke
just<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.250> well<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:08.580> Israel<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.799> unless<00:01:10.799> you're

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
just as well as Israel so unless you're

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.679 
just as well as Israel so unless you're
as<00:01:11.220> your<00:01:11.400> player<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.939> probably<00:01:12.240> would<00:01:12.479> just

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
as your player I probably would just

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.899 
as your player I probably would just
pick<00:01:12.869> Aleutian<00:01:13.409> over<00:01:13.740> him<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.520> wouldn't

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
pick Aleutian over him but I wouldn't

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.700 
pick Aleutian over him but I wouldn't
say<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.360> you'll<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.810> really<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> terrible

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
say that as you'll is really a terrible

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.320 
say that as you'll is really a terrible
pic<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> compared<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> some

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
pic it's just that compared to some

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.200 
pic it's just that compared to some
other<00:01:18.479> ADCs<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> moment<00:01:20.009> or<00:01:20.210> marksman

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
other ADCs at the moment or marksman

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.840 
other ADCs at the moment or marksman
he's<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> little<00:01:22.320> bit<00:01:22.530> lackluster<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.460> my

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
he's a little bit lackluster in my

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.060 
he's a little bit lackluster in my
opinion<00:01:24.200> particularly<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.470> nerf<00:01:25.860> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
opinion particularly with the nerf to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.280 
opinion particularly with the nerf to
blood<00:01:26.310> first<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.850> now<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.630> lose<00:01:27.840> quite<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> bit

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
blood first so now you lose quite a bit

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.170 
blood first so now you lose quite a bit
of<00:01:28.409> life<00:01:28.650> still<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.340> item<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.030> also

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
of life still on that item and you also

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.050 
of life still on that item and you also
lose<00:01:30.479> about<00:01:30.720> 20<00:01:31.170> damage<00:01:31.380> off<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.060> Israel

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
lose about 20 damage off of that Israel

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.179 
lose about 20 damage off of that Israel
and<00:01:33.299> blood<00:01:33.869> first<00:01:34.140> or<00:01:34.350> basically<00:01:34.740> best

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
and blood first or basically best

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.670 
and blood first or basically best
friends<00:01:35.729> new<00:01:36.060> blood<00:01:36.299> first<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.990> don't<00:01:37.259> think<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
friends new blood first I don't think it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.710 
friends new blood first I don't think it
does<00:01:37.829> too<00:01:38.159> well<00:01:38.430> because<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.240> life<00:01:39.450> still

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
does too well because the life still

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.230 
does too well because the life still
isn't<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:40.200> good<00:01:40.470> right<00:01:41.070> now<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.460> Israel<00:01:42.000> I

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
isn't as good right now with Israel I

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.969 
isn't as good right now with Israel I
kind<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.570> find<00:01:42.720> myself<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
kind of find myself going for the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.889 
kind of find myself going for the
longsword<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.790> three<00:01:45.240> patients<00:01:45.780> at<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
longsword and three patients at the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.630 
longsword and three patients at the
beginning<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.590> game<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.040> feel<00:01:47.490> like

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
beginning of the game I feel like

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.030 
beginning of the game I feel like
Dorian's<00:01:48.180> isn't<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:48.810> good<00:01:49.049> anymore<00:01:49.259> that's

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
Dorian's isn't as good anymore that's

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.760 
Dorian's isn't as good anymore that's
just<00:01:50.280> my<00:01:50.460> opinion<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> long<00:01:52.530> sword

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
just my opinion so I go for a long sword
