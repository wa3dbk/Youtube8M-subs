it takes up so much space in my makeup
bag<00:01:41.810> but<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.439> think<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.250> worth<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
I've been using it for a couple of days

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.090 
I've been using it for a couple of days
now<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:57.649> every<00:01:58.649> time<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.829> look<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.040> mirror

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
now and every time I look in the mirror

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.819 
now and every time I look in the mirror
it<00:01:59.610> hasn't<00:01:59.939> budged<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.350> one's<00:02:01.530> really

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
it hasn't budged and the one's really

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.760 
it hasn't budged and the one's really
nice<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.030> consistency<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.290> mascara

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
nice and the consistency of the mascara

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.139 
nice and the consistency of the mascara
is<00:02:05.070> great<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:07.049> think<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:08.160> sometimes<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
is great so I think that sometimes the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.930 
is great so I think that sometimes the
bigger<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.629> wands<00:02:09.869> are<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.860> harder<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.670> to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
bigger the wands are the harder it is to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.309 
bigger the wands are the harder it is to
get

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
get

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.319 
get
into<00:02:12.590> your<00:02:12.739> lashes<00:02:13.069> what<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.670> think<00:02:13.969> this<00:02:14.090> one's

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
nice and thin and again straight into

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:17.500 
nice and thin and again straight into
the<00:02:16.310> lash<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.670> lifts<00:02:17.060> them<00:02:17.150> up
