00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.530
I love jalapenos.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.660
A good hot pepper, there not as hot as serranos
or habaneros.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.210
They still bring a really great spice to a
lot of dishes.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.650
When you cut a jalapeno, and you get some
seeds or you get some of the juice on your

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.790
fingers, it?s really, really important to
wash your hands carefully with hot soapy water,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.379
particularly before you touch your eyes.

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.149
Now there are several ways to get the seeds
out.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:53.150
I used to cut a jalapeno in half, lengthwise,
and then kind of take my thumbnail and work

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.910
at getting the ribs and seeds out over the
sink.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:05.910
You can also, a little more simply, just cut
down the edge of the jalapeno which will avoid

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.920
the ribs in the center.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.200
And you learn over time, just about how thick
to make it.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.410
And by and large, you can cut down this way,
and there you go.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.869
The ribs and the seeds all stay here.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.980
You?ve got your jalapeno here.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:32.490
You can just line them up this way, and it?s
very simple to chop it all up.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.280
You know those pieces are still pretty big,
and I may come back.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.259
And, when I am mincing like this, I like to
just work in diagonals away from my body,

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:50.100
sweep things up into a little pile, come this
way and work it out.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.200
Oh boy, that smells good.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.670
Enjoy!

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.580
Have fun using these tips and trips, and get
cookin?.
