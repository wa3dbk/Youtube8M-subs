00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.379
 Kia Sportage in the Russian market 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.470
 equipped with two diesel engines 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.660
 136 and 184 are strong constructively they 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.940
 almost identical both in cylinder volume and 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.350
 on steppe and compression by adding to power 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.089
 older engine owes more 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.730
 modern bosch fuel equipment 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.100
 2 step turbo at home and new 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.930
 Diesel control unit 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.269
 Sportage is expected to introduce itself much 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.070
 more fun petrol overtaking are very 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.469
 easy but six-speed transmission 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.239
 not quite pleased with intense 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.610
 accelerating it allows the engine to work 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.440
 in the range from 3 to 4 thousand revolutions 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.270
 whereas the stick is maximum torque 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.729
 moment ends at 2 and a half 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:17.060
 thousands of class-driven control 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:18.890
 car is also quite satisfied closely 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.600
 burn on until i got into 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.420
 vehicle specifications i 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.080
 I was sure that there is a real one here 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.160
 Ford Hydraulic Power Steering 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.530
 anyway 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.369
 he behaves almost like a gidrach 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.960
 real in every sense and well firstly 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.869
 of course it's very clear 0 and 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.750
 quite juicy efforts that is of course 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.460
 not at all sporting but for civil 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.280
 cars especially as the basis is very 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.310
 worthy that is in any case if 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.090
 compare with the same cube or the same 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.970
 server 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.680
 Well, in addition to purely taxiway properties here 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:02.590
 there are pure drilling such problems I was 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.659
 extremely surprised when I realized that the steering wheel 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.100
 snack volitional evil if we are traffic jams 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.009
 We start to turn first in one direction 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.040
 then another sharply once it seemed 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.410
 the pressure disappears fragments in the system and 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.140
 begin to eat the wheel 2nd floor 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.670
 electric power how can there be like 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.880
 something may be missing out there 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.370
 excerpts when I'm just not there well 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.080
 the result is fun on the forums that this is a problem 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.720
 firmware 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.610
 Well if you already talk about glitches here 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.180
 electrics of course they are present 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.800
 machine has already passed 35 thousand she 2011 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.170
 years and apparently something is already 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.930
 began to fail in particular 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.909
 for example we have 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.680
 gradually failed parking sensors 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.420
 first I worked one time then later 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.420
 all sensors gone emergency mode 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.989
 Well, integrity and the outside does not leave 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.959
 doubt 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.780
 boy somewhere that something with wiring 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.939
 well, and he has a rather strange 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.859
 so can not I even worth the disease 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.340
 disease feature when we turn off 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.859
 engine and accidentally left 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.840
 gearshift selector in the drive position then he 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.439
 there is some kind of crash in the system it doesn't 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.150
 turns off the radio and even then 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.970
 correct your mistake return to 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.769
 parking position and get out of the car 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.620
 he will not want to close it until then 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.930
 until I make not drown again well 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.150
 In general, here are such weird small 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.819
 very annoying at first but then 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.819
 yatsa 10 did not get used well with them 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.560
 off-road Kia sporteydzh very 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.299
 liked me initially expected from him 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.010
 some success overcoming obstacles 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.749
 because there is a crossover in the arsenal 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.849
 and an assistant for the descent from the mountain and 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:48.920
 forced differential lock 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.170
 well , let's not forget about diesel 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.389
 outstanding maximum time since 1800 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.950
 Barotov good passability 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.569
 this is when from behind the wheel obstacles 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.090
 seem scary she divides it 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.980
 pass without tension from the first time to 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.099
 sand, we easily climbed on the hill and 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.730
 churned potassium never stuck 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.889
 traction control by the way 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.989
 it is not necessary to disconnect it smothers 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:17.299
 engine is very moderate diesel engine with him 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:19.039
 on bottoms there is enough space to prove and 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.570
 pokatushek need to remember that the road 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.849
 clearance in the portrait is small only a hundred 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.860
 seventy two millimeters mud flaps 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.810
 space and and that much less and 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.889
 they often suffer when traveling by 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.630
 bad roads and curbing 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.979
 although a difficult sandy road as I have 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.650
 said we and passed without any problems 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.449
 already much later on usual 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.490
 dirt road we wound on the clutch 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.050
 a large piece of wire sharp metal 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.789
 damaged differential oil seal 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.159
 the dealer fix price turned out to be about 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.500
 10,000 rubles with spare parts and work and 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:50.810
 oil change over news with steam 3g 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.909
 of course such a compromise would say 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.639
 because a little bit is missing and 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:56.370
 omnivorous omnivorous the one that is 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.800
 let's say u 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.830
 care up to the server but not so 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.990
 tough like let's say on a circle that is she 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.580
 provided quite good 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.639
 handling with steering 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.160
 your management is probably more important 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.919
 for crossover and for travel this is something 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.139
 that when you ride on with parte di and even she 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.540
 very rough road with 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.040
 constant potholes bumps not 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.669
 front not rear passengers not 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.760
 swayed 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.250
 we went there a child we drove 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.410
 almost 400 kilometers main 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:32.310
 the enemy of practicality here I would call not 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.770
 stiffer suspension and low profile tires 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.930
 with cast wheels which 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.990
 cars are completed in performance 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.630
 premium of course if you go somewhere for 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.000
 ring road limits as 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.900
 Petersburg after all this Moscow 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.130
 Must buy normal 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.039
 high profile tires 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.660
 because the soul on the irregularities of you 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.490
 sooner or later a new crisis 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.919
 Now about the economy since under 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.050
 hood 108 4 forces on records i'm not 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:01.349
 counted and the results really came out 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.479
 average 8.6 liters on the highway and 10 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:05.550
 liters in the city is true in the cars and myself 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.979
 did not refuse and rode at the usual pace 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.870
 although included and to modes yes and about 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.060
 refueling lack of quality fuel 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.530
 in the regions myth anyway 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.780
 we are talking about the center and the Volga 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.760
 almost everywhere disappear with diesel 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.970
 euro-4 they serve mainly 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.620
 modern european for and what 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.120
 diesel kia sport really 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.620
 good as a transport 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.960
 for traveling in Russia 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.000
 the riders aren't swaying off-road 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.550
 afraid overtakes dynamically 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.150
 Again, the savings pleases however if 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.699
 compare 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.020
 top premium versions of our test 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.820
 the car was in this configuration 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.000
 that diesel sports 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.650
 with 184 strong engine will be 80 thousand 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.080
 more expensive than gas so the difference 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.720
 pays off at best in 80 90 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.000
 thousand kilometers so i would 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.950
 took sporteydzh and 136 strong 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.650
 they cost him a million one hundred and nine thousand 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.810
 picking comfort and 184 strong 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.270
 motor second only 19 newton meters 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.670
 moment of loss for the speakers is small 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.670
 and savings, other things being equal, will
