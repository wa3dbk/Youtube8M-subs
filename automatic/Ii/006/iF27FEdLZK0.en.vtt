some aggressive flying you know putting
with<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> camera<00:00:17.369> on<00:00:17.400> there<00:00:17.609> doing<00:00:17.970> some<00:00:18.119> fast

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
with the camera on there doing some fast

with the camera on there doing some fast
forward<00:00:18.840> fast<00:00:19.140> banking<00:00:19.740> these<00:00:20.100> props<00:00:20.430> will

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
forward fast banking these props will

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.640 
forward fast banking these props will
flex<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.300> all<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.539> flexing<00:00:22.050> will<00:00:22.170> transfer

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
flex and all this flexing will transfer

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.640 
flex and all this flexing will transfer
into<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.189> frame<00:00:23.550> all<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.390> way<00:00:24.420> down<00:00:24.630> into<00:00:24.960> the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
camera mount which if you guys haven't

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.480 
camera mount which if you guys haven't
noticed<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:28.080> GoPro<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.560> kind<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.800> sensitive<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
noticed a GoPro is kind of sensitive to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.420 
noticed a GoPro is kind of sensitive to
the<00:00:30.240> extreme<00:00:31.080> vibrations<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:31.859> which<00:00:32.309> will

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the extreme vibrations but which will

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.500 
the extreme vibrations but which will
kind<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.579> give<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.820> little<00:00:33.149> shakiness

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
kind of give you that little shakiness

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.040 
kind of give you that little shakiness
and<00:00:33.780> jello<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:35.040> video<00:00:35.340> footage<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.480> what<00:00:37.020> I

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and jello in the video footage so what I

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.260 
and jello in the video footage so what I
have<00:00:37.200> here<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.980> grab<00:00:38.219> energy<00:00:38.700> props<00:00:39.030> these

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
have here is to grab energy props these

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.569 
have here is to grab energy props these
are<00:00:39.390> 8<00:00:39.660> by<00:00:39.840> 5<00:00:40.050> inch<00:00:40.260> propellers<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.980> these

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
are 8 by 5 inch propellers and these

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.360 
are 8 by 5 inch propellers and these
props<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.540> very<00:00:43.020> very<00:00:43.230> good<00:00:43.559> match<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
props are a very very good match for the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.459 
props are a very very good match for the
Phantom<00:00:44.730> however<00:00:45.059> they're<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> direct<00:00:46.170> fit

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
Phantom however they're not a direct fit

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.660 
Phantom however they're not a direct fit
so<00:00:47.270> these<00:00:48.270> props<00:00:48.570> feature<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.320> 8<00:00:50.100> by<00:00:50.370> 5

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
so these props feature a 8 by 5

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.490 
so these props feature a 8 by 5
millimeter<00:00:51.210> bore<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.809> means<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
millimeter bore what this means is the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.380 
millimeter bore what this means is the
back<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.949> beam<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.430> 8<00:00:53.640> millimeters<00:00:54.210> which

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
back is beam up to 8 millimeters which

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.560 
back is beam up to 8 millimeters which
is<00:00:54.420> perfect<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.559> stock<00:00:55.800> motor<00:00:56.129> but<00:00:56.910> that

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
is perfect for the stock motor but that

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.299 
is perfect for the stock motor but that
front<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.469> has<00:00:58.559> been<00:00:58.680> bored<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.160> one

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
front this one has been bored this one

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.619 
front this one has been bored this one
has<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.579> but<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.879> see<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> front<00:01:00.420> is

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
has not but you can see the front is

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.959 
has not but you can see the front is
actually<00:01:00.809> smaller<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.770> front<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.640> 5

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
actually smaller the front is a 5

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.479 
actually smaller the front is a 5
millimeter<00:01:03.239> bore<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.470> will<00:01:04.680> not<00:01:04.890> fit<00:01:05.280> onto

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
millimeter bore so it will not fit onto

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.250 
millimeter bore so it will not fit onto
the<00:01:06.320> stock<00:01:07.320> DJI<00:01:07.830> motors<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.720> very<00:01:09.720> easy<00:01:09.990> to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the stock DJI motors so very easy to

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.020 
the stock DJI motors so very easy to
make<00:01:10.470> these<00:01:10.619> work<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.460> all<00:01:11.610> props<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
make these work just like all props you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.480 
make these work just like all props you
will<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.200> prop<00:01:13.860> reamer<00:01:14.130> or

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
will have to get the a prop reamer or

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.429 
will have to get the a prop reamer or
you<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.729> use<00:01:14.880> some<00:01:15.090> drill<00:01:15.900> bits<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.290> have

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
you can use some drill bits if you have

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.899 
you can use some drill bits if you have
some<00:01:16.590> drill<00:01:16.770> bits<00:01:16.920> laying<00:01:17.070> around<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.759> you

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
some drill bits laying around if you

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.090 
some drill bits laying around if you
have<00:01:17.939> some<00:01:18.210> metrics<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:19.290> 8<00:01:19.439> millimeter<00:01:19.890> but

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
have some metrics get 8 millimeter but

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.950 
have some metrics get 8 millimeter but
if<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.460> some<00:01:20.670> standards<00:01:21.060> no<00:01:21.479> problem

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
if you have some standards no problem

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.810 
if you have some standards no problem
I'm<00:01:22.320> pretty<00:01:22.650> sure<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> lot<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.040> guys<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.549> US

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
I'm pretty sure a lot of guys in the US

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.740 
I'm pretty sure a lot of guys in the US
have<00:01:24.060> standards<00:01:24.570> which<00:01:24.869> will<00:01:25.830> work<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.750> what

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
have standards which will work so what

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.649 
have standards which will work so what
you<00:01:27.840> need<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> 5<00:01:28.619> by<00:01:28.650> 16<00:01:29.549> inch<00:01:29.729> drill<00:01:30.420> bit<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
you need is a 5 by 16 inch drill bit and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.170 
you need is a 5 by 16 inch drill bit and
if<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.549> want<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:32.700> safe

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
if you want to be safe

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.390 
if you want to be safe
start<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:34.049> size<00:01:34.290> smaller<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.890> believe<00:01:35.220> this

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
start one size smaller I believe this

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.010 
start one size smaller I believe this
one<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:36.290> 1/4<00:01:37.290> inch<00:01:37.439> bit<00:01:38.159> drill<00:01:38.970> bit<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.390> drill

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
one is a 1/4 inch bit drill bit so drill

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.520 
one is a 1/4 inch bit drill bit so drill
it<00:01:40.140> out<00:01:40.229> very<00:01:40.560> very<00:01:40.890> slowly<00:01:41.280> make<00:01:41.909> sure<00:01:42.119> you

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
it out very very slowly make sure you

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.960 
it out very very slowly make sure you
you<00:01:43.530> know<00:01:43.649> drill<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.100> nice<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.280> straight<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
you know drill it nice and straight and

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.300 
you know drill it nice and straight and

something better because you can get
some<00:01:50.640> nice<00:01:50.729> pressured<00:01:51.420> nice<00:01:51.869> even<00:01:52.229> pressure

this<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.259> the<00:02:00.049> 5/16<00:02:01.049> inch<00:02:01.200> which<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.439> very<00:02:01.770> very

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
this is the 5/16 inch which is very very

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.679 
this is the 5/16 inch which is very very
close<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.280> 8<00:02:02.520> millimeters<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:03.240> not<00:02:03.360> exactly

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
close to 8 millimeters it's not exactly

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.319 
close to 8 millimeters it's not exactly
8<00:02:03.930> millimeters<00:02:04.439> but<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.490> will<00:02:05.640> be<00:02:05.820> good<00:02:06.210> enough

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
8 millimeters but it will be good enough

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.540 
8 millimeters but it will be good enough
to<00:02:06.509> fit<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> stock<00:02:08.009> motor<00:02:08.310> which<00:02:08.520> is

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
to fit on to the stock motor which is

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.190 
to fit on to the stock motor which is
what<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.970> want<00:02:09.179> because<00:02:09.360> it's<00:02:09.690> better<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
what you want because it's better to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.020 
what you want because it's better to
have

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
have

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.080 
have
slightly<00:02:12.190> smaller<00:02:13.190> than<00:02:13.490> having<00:02:13.880> something

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
slightly smaller than having something

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.690 
slightly smaller than having something
slightly<00:02:14.569> larger<00:02:15.260> than<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.680> stock<00:02:15.920> hole<00:02:16.190> so

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
slightly larger than a stock hole so

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.420 
slightly larger than a stock hole so
once<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.319> ream<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.440> out<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.890> correct<00:02:19.220> size

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
once you ream it out to the correct size

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.300 
once you ream it out to the correct size
which<00:02:20.330> we<00:02:20.420> want<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.569> do<00:02:20.690> next<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:21.050> get<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.890> good

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
I'm pretty sure a lot of guys will tell

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.580 
I'm pretty sure a lot of guys will tell
you<00:02:40.370> why<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:41.360> magnetic<00:02:41.780> ones<00:02:41.959> are<00:02:42.110> not<00:02:42.260> too

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
you why the magnetic ones are not too

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.229 
you why the magnetic ones are not too
good<00:02:42.739> if<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.010> look<00:02:43.220> for<00:02:43.850> something<00:02:43.880> more

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
good if you look for something more

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.930 
good if you look for something more
precise<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.440> put<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.860> prop<00:02:46.100> on<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.550> you

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
precise so you put the prop on and you

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.370 
precise so you put the prop on and you
make<00:02:47.120> sure<00:02:47.150> it's<00:02:47.390> balanced<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.810> can<00:02:47.959> see<00:02:48.110> here

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
make sure it's balanced you can see here

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.410 
make sure it's balanced you can see here
the<00:02:49.280> prop<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.940> pretty<00:02:50.300> much<00:02:50.950> dead<00:02:51.950> on<00:02:52.190> it's<00:02:52.730> a

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
the prop is pretty much dead on it's a

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.780 
the prop is pretty much dead on it's a
little<00:02:53.959> bit<00:02:54.080> heavy<00:02:54.350> on<00:02:54.680> one<00:02:54.980> side<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:55.550> once<00:02:55.730> you

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
little bit heavy on one side so once you

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.009 
little bit heavy on one side so once you
put<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.060> on<00:02:56.120> there<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.360> know<00:02:56.510> it's<00:02:56.750> not<00:02:56.870> the

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
put it on there you know it's not the

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.070 
put it on there you know it's not the
best<00:02:57.290> prop<00:02:57.650> balancer<00:02:58.190> but<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.489> can<00:02:58.640> see<00:02:59.080> this

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
best prop balancer but you can see this

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.559 
best prop balancer but you can see this
prop<00:03:00.380> is<00:03:00.620> actually<00:03:01.010> close<00:03:01.340> enough<00:03:01.730> where<00:03:02.420> it

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
prop is actually close enough where it

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.390 
prop is actually close enough where it
shouldn't<00:03:02.810> cause<00:03:02.989> too<00:03:03.110> much<00:03:03.290> vibration<00:03:03.530> now

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
shouldn't cause too much vibration now

prop on to the motor shaft now you have

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.289 
prop on to the motor shaft now you have
to<00:03:24.500> remember<00:03:24.709> that<00:03:25.040> since<00:03:25.400> these<00:03:25.700> grappler

onto<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.549> shaft<00:03:37.790> right<00:03:38.090> here<00:03:38.390> and<00:03:38.810> you

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
onto the shaft right here and you

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.900 
onto the shaft right here and you
tighten<00:03:39.440> down<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.709> nut<00:03:39.920> because<00:03:40.250> if<00:03:40.700> you

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
tighten down the nut because if you

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.670 
tighten down the nut because if you
don't<00:03:41.120> tight<00:03:41.540> if<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:41.870> don't<00:03:42.019> use<00:03:42.200> lock<00:03:42.440> tight

don't tight if you don't use lock tight
these<00:03:43.310> nuts<00:03:43.670> will<00:03:44.000> back<00:03:44.269> off<00:03:44.299> in<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:44.900> uh<00:03:44.930> over

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
these nuts will back off in and uh over

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.680 
these nuts will back off in and uh over
time<00:03:46.070> a<00:03:46.250> flight<00:03:46.549> usually<00:03:47.450> the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
time a flight usually the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.509 
time a flight usually the
counterclockwise<00:03:48.410> their<00:03:48.920> propellers<00:03:49.400> that

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
counterclockwise their propellers that

counterclockwise their propellers that
spins<00:03:49.820> this<00:03:50.000> way<00:03:50.239> will<00:03:50.750> get<00:03:51.109> loose<00:03:51.290> over<00:03:51.530> time

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
spins this way will get loose over time

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.229 
spins this way will get loose over time
just<00:03:51.769> due<00:03:52.070> to<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.340> force<00:03:52.609> of<00:03:52.760> its<00:03:52.940> spinning

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
just due to the force of its spinning

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.849 
just due to the force of its spinning
slowing<00:03:53.720> down<00:03:53.810> spinning<00:03:54.170> slowing<00:03:54.590> down<00:03:54.680> the

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
slowing down spinning slowing down the

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.860 
slowing down spinning slowing down the
torque<00:03:55.160> will<00:03:55.340> kind<00:03:56.030> of<00:03:56.120> break<00:03:56.450> loose<00:03:56.690> that's

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
torque will kind of break loose that's

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.330 
torque will kind of break loose that's
why<00:03:56.930> you<00:03:56.989> want<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.230> use<00:03:57.260> lock<00:03:57.500> tight<00:03:57.739> to<00:03:58.070> keep

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
why you want to use lock tight to keep

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.910 
why you want to use lock tight to keep
