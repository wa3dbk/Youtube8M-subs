 like all the north because for those who defended that beneficial of having done 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.619
 has to be done 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.719
 has a very nervous design 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.410
 full of modern lines around here seeming up to ones car things 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.119
 like this 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.599
 but to him it is not so exaggerated so full of tricolor must marching of the 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.599
 do not stipulate a year 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.329
 the only thing that this laptop too well tends more to generate are these 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.530
 lights here both on the crossbar and on the sides 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.080
 and also many ahead here all of them you can configure by means of 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.060
 an msi program 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.430
 and in addition the muses that appear here in the side in the three tracks of 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.190
 frequency of the songs at the moment they are playing 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.970
 the sound system of this machine is of the village dynamo and it impresses 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.860
 by the bass he has two speakers here 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.080
 and provide with a very full sound for all types of music here 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.620
 is the top part of the keyboard the model has some touch sensitive buttons 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.240
 that allow you to choose any activity you are doing then 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.440
 if you have playing the processor performance will be much better if 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.950
 you have only have two dollars for example there it will decrease with 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.460
 photo and processor 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.340
 only problem is that these buttons think they are too sensitive 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.580
 then the board ends up pointing a bit at that kik plate where the 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.010
 The keyboard is large and has 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.480
 number drivers is that these keys are 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.430
 style that we call chewing gum 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.010
 and there are also some buttons that are customers are getting tempted here 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.340
 to facilitate at game time 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.270
 this machine has the following configuration an intel processor 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.470
 corals serves after all 720qm 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.400
 geforce gtx 285 m video card with one gigabyte of dedicated memory 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.000
 this is unworthy of ram memory are three combs of two jeeps 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.009
 Besides that 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.690
 to also 2h10 of 500 say each totalizing the land 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:17.229
 for this configuration that presides over the sale of the machine here until it does not 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:21.139
 It's so heavy she has to have style the 450 grams 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:26.419
 besides the computer comes also the bad ones and the inertia and praguinhas accompanies the 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:31.019
 product the problem is that it is slightly light another negative point of this 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.069
 laptop with 10 6 inch touch screen 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.039
