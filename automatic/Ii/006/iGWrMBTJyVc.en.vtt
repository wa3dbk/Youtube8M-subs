00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.740
F1 1993 Belgian GP (Spa - 29 August) - The race order : 1. Prost, 2. Hill, 3. Schumacher

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.400
Only some laps to go...

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.200
"Prost is coming into the pits for the 2nd time. This pit stop will be decisive"

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.600
"This makes a very interesting situation."

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.100
"Much slower, it took more time" (+3 sec, compared to Hill's pit stop).

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:00.800
Damon Hill has just taken the lead. Prost dropped back to 2nd followed by Schumacher.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.300
"Damon Hill took the lead. Alain Prost is only 2nd, look it".

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.640
"The "big null", the "big zero" is leading the race".

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.900
"I wouldn't call him "big null", allow me that".

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.500
"There is a big null on the front of his car. So, I said that with a bit of irony".

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.600
"By the way we asked Damon Hill in Budapest, at the Hungaroring, if he was bothered by the fact that there was a big zero on the front of his car".

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:46.800
"He replied : No, not at all. He will do his best to change that for a "good number" next year"

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:57.200
"Prost may reovertake him, that's for sure. Frank Williams didn't order the opposite. There isn't any rule about that".

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.220
"You're very interested in the rules (in team orders)".

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.700
"I'm very interested in the rules. Because sometimes the nr.2 driver isn't allowed to overtake the nr.1"

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.320
"But, to my mind, this (team order) has become anachronic in the recent years".

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.800
"The drivers became much larger characters than to keep any rule".

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.300
"Frank Williams always insisted on that that he didn't give any commands for his drivers anyway".

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.040
"Martin Brundle is just ahead of Damon Hill".

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.700
"And that 3 sec difference during the pit stop makes the gap (for Hill against Prost)".
