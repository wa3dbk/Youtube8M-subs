it some kind of x-ray or sensing
equipment<00:02:53.660> that<00:02:54.620> would<00:02:55.040> have<00:02:55.370> been<00:02:55.550> very

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
equipment that would have been very

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.720 
equipment that would have been very
useful<00:02:55.910> at<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.890> when<00:02:57.890> they<00:02:58.010> were<00:02:58.070> chasing<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
useful at the when they were chasing the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.060 
useful at the when they were chasing the
Marathon<00:02:59.720> bombers<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.470> would<00:03:00.620> have<00:03:00.709> been<00:03:00.860> good

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
Marathon bombers it would have been good

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
helicopters could follow the car than a

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.680 
helicopters could follow the car than a
drone<00:03:06.709> can<00:03:06.980> follow<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.459> car<00:03:07.670> but<00:03:08.090> John<00:03:08.390> you

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
drone can follow the car but John you

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.229 
drone can follow the car but John you
don't<00:03:08.900> disagree<00:03:09.320> with<00:03:09.530> an<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.610> in<00:03:10.850> a<00:03:10.970> case

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
you know how far are we going to go to

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.050 
you know how far are we going to go to
invade<00:03:33.019> people's<00:03:33.230> privacy<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:34.160> stop<00:03:34.400> crime<00:03:34.730> if

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
invade people's privacy to stop crime if

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.090 
invade people's privacy to stop crime if
we<00:03:35.420> had<00:03:35.600> cameras<00:03:36.170> on<00:03:36.320> everybody<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:36.860> guess

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
we had cameras on everybody I guess

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.830 
we had cameras on everybody I guess
there<00:03:37.280> would<00:03:37.370> be<00:03:37.400> no<00:03:37.580> drug<00:03:37.880> dealing<00:03:38.239> if<00:03:38.420> we<00:03:38.720> had

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
developing guidelines how do we do this

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.870 
developing guidelines how do we do this
without<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.570> guidelines<00:04:11.290> well<00:04:11.580> that's<00:04:12.580> why<00:04:12.850> I

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
without the guidelines well that's why I

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.060 
without the guidelines well that's why I
keep<00:04:13.270> going<00:04:13.450> back<00:04:13.600> to<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:14.110> root<00:04:14.320> cause<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:14.650> the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
keep going back to the root cause of the

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.979 
keep going back to the root cause of the
problem<00:04:15.100> which<00:04:15.760> is<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:16.060> we<00:04:16.330> are<00:04:16.360> inviting

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
problem which is that we are inviting

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.720

terrorists<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.739> come<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.190> live<00:04:18.400> here<00:04:18.430> and

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
terrorists to come and live here and

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.340 
terrorists to come and live here and
become<00:04:18.880> American<00:04:19.570> citizens<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:20.110> I<00:04:20.170> think

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
become American citizens and I think

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.020 
become American citizens and I think
it's<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.500> cheap<00:04:20.769> ploy<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.250> say<00:04:21.430> exigent

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
it's a cheap ploy to say exigent

it's a cheap ploy to say exigent
circumstances<00:04:22.720> what<00:04:23.230> if<00:04:23.350> instead<00:04:23.500> of
