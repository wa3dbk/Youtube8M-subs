00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.719
 hello friends with you chuck and today 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.730
 we will play in hiding the essence of it 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.610
 is that we turn into 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.820
 block other players owe us at the same time 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.850
 find think many of you have tried already 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.010
 similar modes 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.960
 so I think everything is already oriented I 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.080
 I play for the second time the first time I 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.750
 the general did not understand the essence but it seems like 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.019
 I understand, I do not understand, well, in general, we will now 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.129
 along with you to understand what 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:40.589
 what is there and what are we waiting for 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:47.909
 will begin the game strange all begins 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:49.980
 so I turned to the fence okay wherever 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:55.019
 us get up with you so so so so 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:58.399
 Basically here you can right here so all and the 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:04.339
 and the fence is a normal place, it seems to be 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:07.909
 you can stand waiting here principle 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:11.329
 especially a lot of action will not be purely 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:16.140
 ordinary bookshelves run past us 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:18.780
 The usual thing in this mode I played 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.630
 I still remember in call of duty modern warfare 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.880
 2 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.090
 well then this mode is pretty strong for me 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:32.740
 I liked it and I didn't know it 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:37.039
 more logical there perhaps because well, not 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.140
 I know no, I probably just said nonsense 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.829
 there I'm used to that card 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.880
 knew every nook and cranny by heart 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:50.270
 knew any crack or locker everything 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.429
 absolutely everything was known yes and 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.179
 move in if we say hiding 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.740
 it was very easy to another position so 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.860
 stop stop stop stop 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.890
 I'm fine, I don't know why they are 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:08.090
 run off could stand why are they in the water 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.090
 everybody jumped some stupid people if 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:17.329
 honestly this is all for an idiot as you can 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:21.549
 hide in the water but don't know what i don't 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:25.940
 I can hide in the semi-blocks that I 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:31.370
 a few minutes standing there not only 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.290
 Now I noticed so so so so no 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:42.049
 probably should have been a little higher 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:44.980
 rise so okay no one no op op 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.980
 op op op op 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.790
 So 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.660
 damn here all such places are strange that 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.880
 especially something and not get much in fact but 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:03.170
 it seems we noticed we stay here until 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.170
 so what 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.170
 to us the same sword did I have such a mind this 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.720
 Room Room whom run away run away 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.100
 run so probably nothing I started it 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.069
 attack but basically i already have 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.640
 there was no choice left either 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:29.380
 die 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:32.660
 either he's behind me strange weird 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.730
 okay only one hundred and sixty 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.810
 seconds i think principle we can 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:43.040
 win so here we will set and 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:46.880
 so all we are waiting for if we see on 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.320
 same enemy approaching us here 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.660
 just need to stand for a few 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.430
 seconds to turn into this block 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.860
 all these understood so left one hundred thirty 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:05.319
 five seconds so this enemy rises to 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:07.390
 we have no no yes no yes no so 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.879
 This place is generally perfect in this regard. 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.389
 because if you start rising then 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.920
 I can calmly jump down he 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.660
 see that I have nothing here 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.699
 I hide somewhere around the corner and 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.820
 I’ll go back to this building already 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.400
 quiet 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.370
 but he will not visit him because 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.880
 what why come back twice for one and 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:37.449
 same place so interesting how much 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:39.849
 strokes need to kill him just as 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.660
 and ordinary swords work or maybe 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:46.660
 somehow I remember you differently in the deck 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.840
 it was necessary to make two stabs with a knife 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.570
 the man died but it seems wrong to me 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.280
 the rule works what is how much I hit 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.940
 3 thinks exactly struck her 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:03.220
 so it remains for the pursuer 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:05.650
 70 seconds so so so and we already 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.560
 practically won we have to drag 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.720
 should drag 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.880
 on recording we have only to drag it over 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.520
 overs you can merge and behave like 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.699
 full noob but it’s impossible to record 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:23.530
 do so they are slowly approaching 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:28.810
 we have 50 seconds left 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.349
 a bit like the principle mode 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:35.229
 the most 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:37.210
 the idea itself ran softly past 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:41.789
 I liked it but the implementation somehow 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.789
 a little lame 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:51.210
 So 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:51.210
 so quiet he is not top up 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:06:14.420
 15 seconds left so 10 9 8 7 5 3 2 1 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:16.600
 and victory we all got our coins not 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.040
 I know what to spend on them 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.520
 maybe they will come in handy for me 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:26.090
 consequences and maybe here 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.400
 probably yes for these coins we buy 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.160
 to myself 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:34.190
 compass that allows us to choose 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.800
 things we want to turn into but 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.190
 it costs h3000 we have to play 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:44.540
 quite a lot more cant of this server 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:48.340
 the fact that I probably have 15 minutes here 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:50.540
 all clogged absolutely all places are occupied 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.070
 if you want to join it 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.890
 the only option you see here 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.900
 such squares is a restart of the server and 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.480
 fast fast fast fast poke 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.090
 you can have something with your mouse 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.180
 get to join but again I 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.830
 I say about 15 minutes and it took me 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.810
 Already thought a separate video to make a pro 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:12.340
 how to join servers but nothing 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:17.600
 terrible still able to go on it 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:19.460
