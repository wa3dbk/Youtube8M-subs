00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
now to be honest it's taken longer to

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
that the reason for that is that we were

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.010 
that the reason for that is that we were
not<00:00:32.520> happy<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.180> initial<00:00:33.270> samples<00:00:33.930> from
