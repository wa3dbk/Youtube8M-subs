00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.950
 where 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.400
 let's use water on the moon 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:25.910
 use as a mirror 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.910
 in the water that will come out 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.770
 with the light in a bottle of water the 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.770
 discovered a doctor 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.530
 Y 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:59.510
 Here we can see how light travels 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.220
 it seems that they use water as 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.590
 transmission of light because it does 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.590
 as if it were a mirror the ray 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.680
 and it hits it travels all over the bottle 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:17.690
 and it is reflected in the water this is how it is 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.690
 manifest reflection 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.450
 have 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.850
 observe 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.090
 in four with four different colors 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.020
 blue coffee pink and yellow 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.590
 and a glass with normal water 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.130
 now we place behind the glass with water 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.000
 that works like a mirror 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.620
 what makes the ambient image invert 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.780
 in the colors here they can denote 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.940
 now the yellow was at 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.910
 right now they are seeing what 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.990
 we can notice and the pink finds in the 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.580
 right 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.470
 we invest in the color box 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.360
 we can notice that the coffee is down and 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.680
 the yellow also but the coffee is 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.770
 the right and in the yellow of the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.020
 left and now the coffee is in the 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.520
 left 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.520
 and in yellow on the right 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.080
 this is due to 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:35.230
 the effect it causes in the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.680
 distance and water what 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.630
 does as a mirror effect then the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.630
 change d 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.110
 from one medium to another causes you to 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.030
 change position the image this what 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.710
 we can also observe in the spoons 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.710
 or in some spherical mirrors 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.370
 it behaves like a wave which gives them 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.870
 properties as are the reflection the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.230
 vibrates 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.230
 the refraction 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.900
 reflection 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.140
 occurs when in about 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.930
 and bright the image is formed 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.330
 an object this we can appreciate 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.120
 clearly now thanks to the mirror that 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.440
 is behind the glass and the 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.440
 other objects on the black 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.640
 is to make a ray change direction 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.920
 of light when passing obliquely from a medium 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.470
 to another of different speed of 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.340
 spread this has to do with the 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.050
 density of the propagation medium in 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.000
 this case we can observe this phenomenon 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.340
 in the glass with the piece of wood 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.629
 in 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.629
 and we see that in passing 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.720
 air to the oil and later to the water 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.090
 it is appreciated 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.270
 the object was short 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.250
 this is because 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.010
 the image that we see is a 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.560
 reflection of light 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.329
 and how light has this property at 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.329
 move to a different medium 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.329
 this phenomenon 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.639
 Finally, diffraction is the 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.030
 deviation of a light beam 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.800
 red on the edge of a body for ccoo 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.289
 this is a phenomenon as simple as 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.240
 shadow that we can see from us 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.569
 in this case we represent it with this 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.569
 object
