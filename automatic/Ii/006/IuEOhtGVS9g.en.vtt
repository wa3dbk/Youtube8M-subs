 they are not in direct contact with the skin 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.590
 the wheels of this product has a 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.610
 differentiated diameter and have been 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:32.209

 the two guide very practical and agile 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.850
 buttons on the front

 they are used to activate and deactivate the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.769
 swivel wheels also in this case 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.080
 however, having many or fixed wheels is 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.580
 a choice a decision that the mother makes 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.470
 based on the driving style you 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.260
 prefers and to the land on which one is 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.480
 finds the handles to walk together 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.200
 therefore it can be driven with two hands or 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.720
 with one hand and to adapt to the 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.930
 best at all heights at all three 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.680
 types of pope moms can be 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:10.830
 adjusted in height it is raised and lowered 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.670
 in a very simple way when needed 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.790
 to switch from configuration 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.620
 configuration stroller 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.130
 car seat is very simple enough 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.880
 really very few gestures on the back 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:31.440
 There are two backs of the child 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.760
 buttons that must be pressed is a lever 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.430
 placed under the wound 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.769
 which causes that very simple way the 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.640
 body of the stroller is released yes 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.640
 release from the frame 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.400
 in this way it is very simple and fast 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.989
 both take the stroller and store it in 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.180
 car when mom has finished 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.379
 use it both to go from one 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.379
 configuration to the other 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.849
 well and let's now pass the spacecraft to 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.459
 fixing it to the frame is simple there are 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:08.510
 side guides are two arrows 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.519
 placed on the body of the spacecraft that 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.160
 we must go and match them 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:17.750
 arrows pass on the structure as you can 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.060
 see the spaceship is very wide and it is 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.709
 ideal for use by the very first 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.050
 months of life of the child when the 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.900
 child needs to stay the most 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:32.000
 possible lying down and the back of the 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.900
 carrycot is adjustable in height from the 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.060
 mum 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.850
 externally thanks to this wheel 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.310
 mail a correspondent to one of the feet 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.170
 and child 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.670
 to hook the spacecraft to the 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.150
 stroller is very simple we have it 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:50.730
 having seen it unhooked enough also in 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:54.540
 this case with a simple gesture to do 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.390
 lever on this handle placed in the 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.130
 back of the structure 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.790
 let us now turn to the third element which is the 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.310
 car seal approved since birth for 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.560
 use in the car and we can 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.920
 unbalance from the base that remains on 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:14.720
 car seat and fasten on 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.670
 frame and on the stroller frame 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.630
 two important things to say about this 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:22.220
 item is extremely secure 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.840
 in addition to security, another element 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.210
 important also in this case the 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.790
 comfort in fact inside equipped with a 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.400
 very soft reducer that follows the 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:35.030
 growth of the child and follows the height 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.730
 ideal for belts and for why 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.140
 the child is always in the posture e 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.110
 in the correct position also 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:45.230
 inside the car seat both 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.210
 in the stroller configuration than in the 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.000
 transport by car 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.860
 at this point we can release from 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.630
 structure 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:58.550
 the seat and we are ready for 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.750
 close the product to compact it 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.310
 to the best 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:07.310
 It is important to put the handle in the 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.280
 lower position lower the handle 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:13.670
 and with a lever placed under the vanilla house 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.640
 compact the structure we put the 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:19.860
 product in the car 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.460
 I would say that everything against Cuba is now 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.460
 ready to go
