new batteries and they it takes two and
they<00:03:08.330> come<00:03:08.570> separately<00:03:10.720> but<00:03:11.720> you<00:03:11.900> really<00:03:12.260> need

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.550 

to<00:03:15.500> put<00:03:15.740> them<00:03:15.920> together<00:03:17.050> I'm<00:03:18.050> going<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.320> put<00:03:18.380> a

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
to put them together I'm going to put a

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:28.960 
to put them together I'm going to put a
piece<00:03:18.860> of<00:03:20.350> sealing<00:03:21.350> tape<00:03:21.530> over<00:03:21.770> here<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:28.130> a

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970

piece of sealing tape over here and a
piece<00:03:29.210> over<00:03:29.450> here<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:30.530> that's<00:03:30.710> probably

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
piece over here and that's probably

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:49.890 
piece over here and that's probably
enough<00:03:32.770> I'm<00:03:33.770> just<00:03:34.010> going<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.370> go<00:03:35.590> once<00:03:36.590> around

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:04:20.100 

so<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.110> new<00:03:51.230> battery<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.800> in<00:03:53.920> tighten<00:03:54.920> it<00:03:54.980> up

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:56.850 

so<00:04:21.110> we<00:04:21.410> put<00:04:21.800> this<00:04:21.980> bar<00:04:22.340> back<00:04:22.670> in<00:04:23.980> tighten<00:04:24.980> it

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.850 

another<00:04:57.860> thing<00:04:58.160> that's<00:04:58.370> wrong<00:04:58.670> is<00:04:59.860> the

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
another thing that's wrong is the

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.090 
another thing that's wrong is the
elevation<00:05:02.350> which<00:05:03.350> is<00:05:03.590> this<00:05:05.350> wasn't<00:05:06.350> working<00:05:06.740> I

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
elevation which is this wasn't working I

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.670 
elevation which is this wasn't working I
could<00:05:07.310> hear<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.670> motor<00:05:07.970> turning<00:05:08.330> so<00:05:09.320> this

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
could hear the motor turning so this

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.930 
could hear the motor turning so this
lever<00:05:10.330> had<00:05:11.330> come<00:05:11.750> off<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.200> cam<00:05:13.480> and<00:05:14.480> I'm

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
lever had come off the cam and I'm

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.510 
lever had come off the cam and I'm
putting<00:05:16.940> it<00:05:17.060> back<00:05:17.270> on<00:05:20.470> and<00:05:21.470> then<00:05:21.530> tightening

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
putting it back on and then tightening

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:47.869 
putting it back on and then tightening
the<00:05:22.700> screw<00:05:32.770> so<00:05:33.770> now<00:05:33.980> try<00:05:34.610> that

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:52.429 

yeah<00:05:48.449> works<00:05:48.869> fine<00:05:49.199> now<00:05:50.300> you<00:05:51.300> put<00:05:51.629> the<00:05:51.779> top<00:05:52.169> hat

00:05:55.489 --> 00:05:55.499 
on at the bottom half and just tighten

00:05:55.499 --> 00:06:25.969 
on at the bottom half and just tighten
all<00:05:55.830> the<00:05:55.860> allen<00:05:56.399> head<00:05:56.550> bolts<00:06:24.830> now<00:06:25.830> this

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
all the allen head bolts now this

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:34.330 
all the allen head bolts now this
control<00:06:26.459> panel<00:06:26.719> it<00:06:27.719> goes<00:06:27.899> back<00:06:28.139> in<00:06:28.379> here

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:41.020 

it<00:06:34.760> has<00:06:35.180> four<00:06:38.770> headed<00:06:39.770> bolts<00:06:39.980> that<00:06:40.370> fold<00:06:40.699> it<00:06:40.880> in

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
it has four headed bolts that fold it in

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:51.639 
it has four headed bolts that fold it in
so<00:06:45.130> now<00:06:46.130> we<00:06:46.190> finished<00:06:46.760> it<00:06:47.860> turn<00:06:48.860> it<00:06:49.010> on

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:51.649 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:55.290 

this<00:06:52.649> is<00:06:52.830> the<00:06:52.979> elevation

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
this is the elevation

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:02.960 
this is the elevation
what<00:06:55.569> works<00:06:57.509> all<00:06:58.509> speed<00:06:58.930> works

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.600 

ready<00:07:03.970> to<00:07:04.150> rock<00:07:04.360> and<00:07:04.390> roll
