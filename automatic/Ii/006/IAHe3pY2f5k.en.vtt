 Fancy double throw &lt;Verbatped draft: Li Mingjuan's manuscript: Li Tanku&gt; 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.700
 &lt;&lt;Action demonstration&gt;&gt; Dear students, class! 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.200
 If you see this video, you are good! 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.260
 Today we are going to teach "fancy double throw" 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.580
 Fancy double throw has two series 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.880
 Series 1: When one is empty, the other is making a fancy on our hands. 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:11.060
 These fancy styles can also be done all the time. 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:19.000
 Series 2: When both are in the air, do some body movements 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.340
 Like when two are in the air, people do skipping or turning around 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.240
 These actions actually have some small flaws. 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.560
 After mastering it, I learned very well. 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.460
 In this lesson, we will tell you the secrets of these actions! 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.540
 &lt;&lt;Basic skills&gt;&gt; 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:01.620
 Basic skills: "Double throw 50" is very basic 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.080
 Related fancy: Because we are in double throw, the bell below needs to do some fancy 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:16.840
 If these actions are not yet available, you can click on the hyperlink to review it (all have been made, you can search the Internet) 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.680
 &lt;&lt;Decomposition teaching&gt;&gt; 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.340
 &lt;1. Actions on the line&gt; First introduce "a bell in the air, a bell on the line to make a fancy" 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.140
 simply speaking 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.960
 When throwing double, throw one high, the other one will make a fancy on the line first, then continue to do double throw 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.680
 Common mistakes: throw too high, high turnover rate! At the beginning of the beginning, the height of the double throw is usually not low. 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:58.180
 When you want to throw another one higher, it is easy to be nervous and it is easy to make mistakes. 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.560
 &lt;1-2 low-high-launch! &gt; We introduce a small 这里 here 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.120
 Is to throw low, then throw high, and then start 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.460
 We first divide the double throw into the first floor, the second floor and the third floor. 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.520
 1. Usually at the height of the second floor, it is the height of our normal double throw 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.220
 When we decided to do the fancy 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.000
 2. First throw a lower one, the height of the first floor 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.120
 3. Next, then throw a little higher to the height of the third floor 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.860
 4. In this way, the bell on the first floor will receive the hand first, and there will be more time to do the action. 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.480
 5. After you have finished, throw the bell back and do a double throw. 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.220
 Does it feel very simple? 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.640
 Other online actions are also generally done with this principle. 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:07.140
 Like "infinite turn" 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.960
 Or "Range" 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.780
 But "Yangshang" has to be thrown a bit higher, because the time of relying on it will be longer. 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.200
 &lt;1-3 Continuously launched! &gt; 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.060
 After a simple proficiency, this action can also be done continuously. 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.820
 Interested students can give it a try 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.820
 Remember to take a smile when you do it, and say silently in your heart. 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.100
 "Oh ~ God! I am so handsome!" 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.980
 &lt;2 skipping rope turn&gt; low-high-high-launch 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.260
 In this way, we will use the concept of "low-high-high" to launch 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.120
 1. When deciding to launch, first throw a low 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.100
 2. After the low, both of them throw it high (the two bells will be closer in the air) 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.620
 3. People will have a longer time below, they can do skipping or turn around. 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.740
 Look at the screen of a skipping rope 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.320
 Ready 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.340
 Low, high, high, skipping rope 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.760
 very good! 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.280
 Next, throwing the bell and turning around is the same principle. 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.680
 Remind, before launching a skipping rope or turning around 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.680
 It’s easy to be too eager to learn, but toss and turn 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.180
 It’s easy to make mistakes because of the rush to turn the bell 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.980
 So I saw that both of them were stable in the air, and then they started to turn. 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.100
 This is a better way to beginners. 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.320
 OK, finally finished class! 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.000
 &lt;&lt;Extension action&gt;&gt; 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:04.360
 If you are interested in online fancy, you can challenge to see different fancy 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.340
 If you are skilled, you can put together different fancy 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.700
 It is a long set of fancy double throws! 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.920
 Extended action: three throws if the fancy double throw can be stringed more than six or more actions are very skilled 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.860
 You can also consider whether you want to practice "three throws". 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.640
 Extension concept: The ringing simulator is interested in the ringing action, you can play the ringing simulator! 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.440
 Just like this, take the class. 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.740
 Thanks for watching
