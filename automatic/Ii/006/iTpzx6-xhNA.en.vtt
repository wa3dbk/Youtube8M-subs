00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Westphalia Derby to Münster and thus 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.379
 to a game that since days 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.240
 sold out is reported by him rolf 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.130
 töpperwien and jörg dallmann 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.679
 they are limited, of course 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.640
 not on the actuality but show 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.140
 also reminiscences from old days 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.330
 walking is the fastest way to go today 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.640
 At least 28,000 people are ahead of it 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.010
 10,000 from gelsenkirchen poured into the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.990
 stadium congestion on the highways 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.160
 direction dortmund recklinghausen even 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.990
 the Schalke team bus was stuck 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.120
 right in the middle the last kilometer to the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.719
 Changing rooms require the players to walk 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.579
 return 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.040
 just as in the birth of the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.579
 bundesliga they still remember the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.550
 all first days of play 24 august 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.539
 In 1963 he received the HSV as Kreuz Münster 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.629
 and alsdorf 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.210
 the 1 0 scored and as charly dörfel 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.640
 the equalization to the 1 1-endstand managed 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.809
 that's 27 years back 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.129
 but now back to the present we 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.949
 are the differences in your opinion 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.830
 from then to today prußen münster 963 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.350
 Prussian Munster 1990 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.119
 although good football at the time 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.430
 I would like to say 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:17.259
 that initially today is much faster 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.810
 and the dynamic is played 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.520
 one at the individual scenes and get 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.770
 Yes, it is allowed to watch TV on a daily basis 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.080
 Pretended but I think that is with 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.550
 the essential difference to that time 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.259
 and financially what did they have for then 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.119
 I can get the points win 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:36.280
 do not say so in detail anymore 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.810
 but so much could be so little 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.830
 Incidentally, the highlight in the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.200
 Career There is only one 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.720
 Bundesliga goal to play Schalke in white 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.030
 took over the initiative 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.800
 Decide with the first chance 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.929
 meeting in the initial phase with a lot 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.759
 many similarities twice 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.340
 reached Schalke's valuable newcomer 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.390
 egon flad in this scene was from 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.850
 referee the yellow card 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.850
 commented by trainer Peter Neururer 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.810
 Mr said I hit the ball 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.119
 Immediately a gift was rolled out 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.689
 as a precaution guarded the referee 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.340
 had been 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.180
 By the way, the black man berthold 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.830
 tailor from püttlingen 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.470
 then there was free kick for Schalke 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.650
 at the bridge and andy müller from the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.810
 background a tight shot twelve 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.510
 played minutes 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.140
 a lively first half schalke clear 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:33.129
 Superior with clear advantages 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.680
 Tug at the bridge with the head and 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.319
 creates the far advanced the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.959
 defender of the maybe 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.970
 constant switch in the round 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.140
 Münster always plays at 17 minutes 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.760
 still without a chance bot 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.900
 a great shot what so until after 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.790
 some good chances for the Schalke 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.760
 if that should not take revenge 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.410
 See yesterday frankfurt against munich to 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.410
 jump again 34 minutes 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:10.750
 July one of the two soviets are everything 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:14.769
 it is quite safe from rostock 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.690
 the 1 0 for the gelsenkirchen after 22 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:22.980
 minutes through this volley shot of 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.980
 alexander sascha doc called gobbi 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:32.310
 then again two minutes later 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.660
 Brake with swept by flatz the 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.290
 had already seen yellow and there we 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.290
 the red card 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.780
 plates have been working for seven years 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.129
 had that such an experienced man 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.480
 just happen they had the yellow one 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.069
 card were afterwards from the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.109
 referee once again admonished 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.420
 and then have another foul 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.920
 the red was committed to me in 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.230
 order 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.909
 yes, I have to say that at the beginning of the 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.560
 was warned and I mean the game 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.810
 yellow card got completely unjustified 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.459
 have and good of the woman that you behind it 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.400
 Running and in the hectic of the game 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.569
 We are only lazy 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.169
 It happened after all one is always 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.669
 smarter 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.749
 I mean the yellow card was 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.379
 unjustified with which also the 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:13.969
 sending-off 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.290
 but they knew that they were the yellow one 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:15.680
 had received and forewarned 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.509
 been 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.180

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:21.139
 I have to admit that, stupid 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.699
 referee look at the moment 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.349
 nothing else left the 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.810
 Yes, but I hope with you 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:29.120
 to get away with a minimum punishment second 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.160

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.099
 gamblers 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:38.210
 Münster that was clear had to come now 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:42.400

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.400

 Flee the clear bay to the ground 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.210
 the referee does not press that 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.889
 the hit counted in the first one 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.780
 bundesligajahr could Schalke against

 Of course that's enough but I can 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:39.900
 The decision does not anticipate what 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:41.699
 the board decides to pull it 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.449
