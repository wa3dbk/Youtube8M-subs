on<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.920> fish<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.490> lot<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.120> people<00:01:44.180> would<00:01:44.600> think

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
on the fish a lot of people would think

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.110 
on the fish a lot of people would think
that<00:01:44.900> bears<00:01:45.380> want<00:01:46.190> a<00:01:46.250> fish<00:01:46.400> instinctually<00:01:46.850> but

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
that bears want a fish instinctually but

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.640 
that bears want a fish instinctually but
it's<00:01:47.240> actually<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.600> learned<00:01:48.080> behavior<00:01:48.260> that

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
it's actually a learned behavior that

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.840 
it's actually a learned behavior that
they<00:01:48.800> passed<00:01:49.040> down<00:01:49.250> generation<00:01:49.820> to

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
they passed down generation to

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.850 
they passed down generation to
generation<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.510> in<00:01:50.960> their<00:01:51.200> own<00:01:51.290> style<00:01:51.620> it's

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
generation and in their own style it's

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.500 
generation and in their own style it's
really<00:01:52.010> cool<00:01:52.160> because<00:01:52.220> each<00:01:52.820> bear<00:01:53.150> has<00:01:53.330> their

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
really cool because each bear has their

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.880 
really cool because each bear has their

you<00:03:01.390> know<00:03:01.480> having<00:03:01.750> animals<00:03:01.989> in<00:03:02.140> captivity

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
you know having animals in captivity

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.500 
you know having animals in captivity
it's<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:02.830> huge<00:03:03.010> responsibility<00:03:03.099> and<00:03:03.879> I<00:03:04.390> think

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
it's a huge responsibility and I think

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.630 
it's a huge responsibility and I think
the<00:03:04.720> risk<00:03:04.930> factor<00:03:05.319> is<00:03:05.709> there<00:03:06.099> but<00:03:06.280> if<00:03:06.400> your

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
the risk factor is there but if your

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.369 
the risk factor is there but if your
expert<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:07.540> have<00:03:07.629> experience<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.319> you
