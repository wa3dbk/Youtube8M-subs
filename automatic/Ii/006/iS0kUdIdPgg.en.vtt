00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.320

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.230
 the true identity of harrison webs 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.780
 and it's about nothing more and nothing less than 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.390
 of overtown if the first reverse flash 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.100
 the original since it was confirmed during 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.690
 chapter number 15 when xisco 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.159
 investigating what happened in the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.229
 chapter number 9 of the season 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.479
 entitled the man in the yellow suite that 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.559
 in the first chapter by the way he was 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.720
 the first chapter in which we could 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.300
 see reverse flash got to investigate 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.829
 what had happened and finally 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.420
 xisco came to the conclusion that 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.909
 harrison webs was not as good as 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.979
 it seemed and hid something and in that way 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.210
 If that was the case, it was discovered in the 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.060
 chapter yesterday in chapter number 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.369
 15 of this first season and it 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.130
 officially announces that what harrison 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.259
 Wells is Robert Downey and therefore 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.360
 he is also a distant relative of edition 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.270
 the detective and yogurt partner 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.670
 father davis west all this accompanied by 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.000
 a tragic death of cisco since the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.259
 discover the secret of quitting 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.049
 software it is clear that I could not 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.549
 live but calm because it is not 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.620
 all lost since also in this 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.000
 chapter we could see the first trip in 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.740
 the flash time 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.870
 it was amazing was in his fight against the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.610
 magician of time sorry if I say the magician 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.990
 of time since the new English name 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.180
 Sine number does not come to me now 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.070
 head so I apologize for that I 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.860
 I 'm going to call it the good weather wizard 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.810
 it turns out that to stop it to stop 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.340
 flash the time magician had to do 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.830
 as a kind of air barrier not 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.970
 I remember very well what it was called but 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.920
 the fact is that I had to run very 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.840
 fast from one place to another and so it was 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.850
 it happened so fast that it backs up a couple 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.160
 of days ago in time to arrive 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.360
 at the moment in which nothing of what 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.580
 had happened in the chapter had 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.200
 past yet it is to say neither xisco was 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.239
 dead nor had it revealed what jarsÃºn 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.770
 wells was edward downes that is to say a 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.090
 madness that will surely serve to 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.880
 correct several errors that there were in the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.290
 chapter an error for example no errors 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.010
 that were quite serious and there were no 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.140
 errors such as the death of 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.840
 cisco the discovery of harrison 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.400
 Wells and what I'm going to say in my opinion 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.530
 has been a chapter has been one of the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.180
 best chapters next to the chapter 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.070
 number 9 of this first season that 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.470
 It was the first time we could 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.630
 see reverse flash and I'm delighted 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.980
 with the series so if you are watching 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.030
 this video simply by mere 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.490
 curiosity and you do not know 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.459
 the series I recommend you see the series 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.110
 because it 's pretty amazing 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.600
 to tell the truth I dare to say it yet 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.040
 but I think it 's the best series of 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.080
 superheroes that are on the air in this 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.730
 we will talk about this later 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.640
 when more series come out for example 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.650
 daredevil de marvel or we will see 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.780
 let's see what else you can do to ro because 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.950
 for a moment it seems that it is there but 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.739
 in my opinion the one that is mainly 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.450
 ahead of everything is this flash well 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.860
 What good people are these have been the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.870
