00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
then it's a relatively expensive option

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.090 
then it's a relatively expensive option

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
hard lenses from decades ago were they

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.380 
hard lenses from decades ago were they
usually<00:03:04.590> slightly<00:03:04.830> bigger<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:06.210> difference

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
usually slightly bigger the difference

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.990 
usually slightly bigger the difference
is<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.260> they're<00:03:07.560> made<00:03:07.740> of<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.920> material<00:03:08.100> that

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
is that they're made of a material that

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.200 
is that they're made of a material that
allows<00:03:09.360> oxygen<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:11.010> diffuse<00:03:11.210> actually

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
allows oxygen to diffuse actually

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.710 
allows oxygen to diffuse actually
through<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.870> chemical<00:03:13.200> matrix<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.460> lens

through the chemical matrix of the lens
so<00:03:15.720> they<00:03:16.200> combine<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:17.070> best<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.530> many<00:03:19.530> worlds

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
so they combine the best of many worlds

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.240 
so they combine the best of many worlds
they<00:03:20.790> give<00:03:21.360> good<00:03:21.900> comfort<00:03:22.350> over<00:03:22.620> long<00:03:22.770> periods
