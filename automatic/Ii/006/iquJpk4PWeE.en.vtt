what<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.210> does<00:01:40.420> is<00:01:40.719> when<00:01:40.899> you're<00:01:41.049> playing<00:01:41.229> a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
what it does is when you're playing a

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.270 
what it does is when you're playing a
game<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:42.359> there's<00:01:43.359> a<00:01:43.990> moment<00:01:44.859> where<00:01:45.189> the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
game and there's a moment where the

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.099 
game and there's a moment where the
controller<00:01:45.609> will<00:01:45.789> vibrate<00:01:45.999> then<00:01:46.479> this<00:01:46.929> will

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
controller will vibrate then this will

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:50.840 
controller will vibrate then this will
light<00:01:47.289> up<00:01:47.499> so<00:01:48.189> it's<00:01:48.340> not<00:01:48.460> always<00:01:48.639> on<00:01:48.939> and<00:01:49.409> then

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
light up so it's not always on and then

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.550 
light up so it's not always on and then
third<00:01:51.850> setting<00:01:52.149> is<00:01:52.539> it's<00:01:52.810> just<00:01:52.840> constantly<00:01:53.409> on

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
third setting is it's just constantly on

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.620 
third setting is it's just constantly on
I<00:01:53.770> personally<00:01:54.670> prefer<00:01:54.789> a<00:01:55.030> third<00:01:55.329> setting

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
I personally prefer a third setting

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.800 
I personally prefer a third setting
because<00:01:56.319> it<00:01:56.590> looks<00:01:56.740> really<00:01:56.979> cool<00:01:57.539> it<00:01:58.539> just

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
because it looks really cool it just

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.609 
because it looks really cool it just
makes<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.170> really<00:01:59.350> cool<00:02:00.030> glow<00:02:01.030> to<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.170> room<00:02:02.380> and

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
makes a really cool glow to the room and

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.730 
makes a really cool glow to the room and
it<00:02:02.829> looks<00:02:02.979> really<00:02:03.100> nice<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:05.170> other<00:02:05.319> issues

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
it looks really nice so the other issues

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.749 
it looks really nice so the other issues
of<00:02:05.889> this<00:02:06.039> controller<00:02:06.459> are<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:09.280> might<00:02:09.580> have

of this controller are you might have

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.450 
of this controller are you might have
noticed<00:02:10.650> it's<00:02:11.650> going<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.890> cable<00:02:12.750> this

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
noticed it's going to cable this

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.940 
noticed it's going to cable this
is<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:15.030> cannot<00:02:15.360> take<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.660> off<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.680> cannot

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
is you cannot take this off you cannot

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.970 
is you cannot take this off you cannot
remove<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.370> cable<00:02:17.820> whatsoever<00:02:18.560> it's<00:02:19.560> to

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
remove this cable whatsoever it's to

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.310 
remove this cable whatsoever it's to
power<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:21.240> lights<00:02:21.420> which<00:02:21.840> makes<00:02:22.110> sense

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
power the lights which makes sense

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.690 
power the lights which makes sense
otherwise<00:02:22.860> you'd<00:02:23.190> probably<00:02:23.370> need<00:02:23.550> to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
otherwise you'd probably need to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.660 
otherwise you'd probably need to
recharge<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.270> all<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.140> time<00:02:25.490> but<00:02:26.490> with<00:02:26.640> a

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
recharge it all the time but with a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.640 
recharge it all the time but with a
keyboard<00:02:26.940> controller<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.840> know<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.470> there

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
keyboard controller you know that there

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.880 
keyboard controller you know that there
are<00:02:28.680> going<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.920> be<00:02:29.010> some<00:02:29.250> mild<00:02:29.430> issues<00:02:29.850> such<00:02:30.120> as

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
are going to be some mild issues such as

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.550 
are going to be some mild issues such as
it<00:02:31.890> constantly<00:02:32.520> has<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.880> be<00:02:32.970> plugged<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:34.290> he

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
it constantly has to be plugged in so he

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.140 
it constantly has to be plugged in so he
used<00:02:34.800> two<00:02:34.980> previous<00:02:35.460> generation<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.000> gaming

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
used two previous generation of gaming

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.770 
used two previous generation of gaming
it's<00:02:36.510> not<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> big<00:02:36.960> issue<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> little<00:02:39.540> bit

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
it's not a big issue it is a little bit

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.490 
it's not a big issue it is a little bit
annoying<00:02:40.340> however<00:02:43.340> in<00:02:44.340> regards<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.260> fact

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
annoying however in regards to the fact

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.040 
annoying however in regards to the fact
that<00:02:46.590> control<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:46.950> wired<00:02:47.750> there<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:48.900> always

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
that control is wired there is always

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.880 
that control is wired there is always
possibility<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:50.040> then<00:02:51.020> using<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.500> controller

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
possibility of then using the controller

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.550 
possibility of then using the controller
for<00:02:53.310> not<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.230> PlayStation<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.840> what<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.110> mean<00:02:58.410> by

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
for not a PlayStation so what I mean by

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.500 
for not a PlayStation so what I mean by
this<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.430> could<00:02:59.610> probably<00:02:59.880> use<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.330> for<00:03:00.450> a

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
this is you could probably use it for a

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.100 
this is you could probably use it for a
pc<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.050> haven't<00:03:01.500> tested<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:01.980> out<00:03:02.160> yet<00:03:02.460> but<00:03:03.110> you

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
pc I haven't tested it out yet but you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.810 
pc I haven't tested it out yet but you
know<00:03:04.140> if<00:03:04.380> you're<00:03:04.530> using<00:03:04.710> pc<00:03:05.220> games<00:03:05.460> and<00:03:05.760> you

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
know if you're using pc games and you

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.070 
know if you're using pc games and you
don't<00:03:06.030> like<00:03:06.210> using<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.570> mouse<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.960> keyboard

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
don't like using a mouse and keyboard

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.130 
don't like using a mouse and keyboard
you<00:03:07.680> could<00:03:07.830> probably<00:03:08.070> use<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:08.580> as<00:03:09.110> a

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.720 

controller<00:03:13.140> for<00:03:13.410> gaming<00:03:13.830> on<00:03:13.920> your<00:03:14.040> pc<00:03:14.400> it's

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
controller for gaming on your pc it's

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.060 
controller for gaming on your pc it's
not<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.690> wouldn't<00:03:16.020> be<00:03:16.110> too<00:03:16.260> difficult<00:03:16.290> set<00:03:16.890> up

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
not it wouldn't be too difficult set up

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.290 
not it wouldn't be too difficult set up
I<00:03:17.190> just<00:03:17.370> personally<00:03:17.640> haven't<00:03:17.910> bothered<00:03:18.060> doing

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
I just personally haven't bothered doing

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.330 
I just personally haven't bothered doing
it<00:03:18.540> myself<00:03:18.690> yet<00:03:19.050> I've<00:03:19.620> had<00:03:19.770> this<00:03:19.890> couple<00:03:20.280> of

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
it myself yet I've had this couple of

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.500 
it myself yet I've had this couple of
days<00:03:20.520> um<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:22.730> I've<00:03:23.730> games<00:03:23.970> with<00:03:24.210> it<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.360> little

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
days um and I've games with it a little

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.180 
days um and I've games with it a little
bit<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.900> PlayStation<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.620> works<00:03:25.800> perfectly

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
bit of a PlayStation it works perfectly

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.940 
bit of a PlayStation it works perfectly
fine<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:26.850> then<00:03:27.240> the<00:03:27.480> other<00:03:27.690> big<00:03:27.900> issue<00:03:28.080> with<00:03:28.560> it

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
fine so then the other big issue with it

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.490 
fine so then the other big issue with it
being<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.250> wide<00:03:29.460> controller<00:03:30.000> is<00:03:30.330> that<00:03:30.720> you

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
being a wide controller is that you

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.060 
being a wide controller is that you
can't<00:03:31.920> for<00:03:32.700> whatever<00:03:32.910> reason<00:03:33.570> turn<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.830> whole

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
can't for whatever reason turn the whole

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.160 
can't for whatever reason turn the whole
console<00:03:35.520> on<00:03:35.840> with<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.050> PS<00:03:37.290> home<00:03:37.500> button<00:03:37.830> I

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
console on with the PS home button I

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.130 
console on with the PS home button I
think<00:03:40.170> it's<00:03:40.500> because<00:03:41.210> it's<00:03:42.210> a<00:03:42.420> PlayStation

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
think it's because it's a PlayStation

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.950 
think it's because it's a PlayStation
actually<00:03:43.440> powers<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:43.950> controller<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.900> you

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
actually powers a controller so you

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.800 
actually powers a controller so you
can't<00:03:46.680> use<00:03:47.010> any<00:03:47.940> power<00:03:48.150> from<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.480> controller

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
can't use any power from the controller

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.440 
can't use any power from the controller
if<00:03:48.930> it's<00:03:49.080> not<00:03:49.230> song<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.820> means<00:03:51.000> literally

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
if it's not song so it means literally

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.070 
if it's not song so it means literally
every<00:03:51.810> time<00:03:52.020> you<00:03:52.170> want<00:03:52.710> to<00:03:52.800> play<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:54.080> have

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
every time you want to play and have

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.520 
every time you want to play and have
that<00:03:55.380> controller<00:03:55.770> is<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.040> main<00:03:56.220> controller

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
that controller is the main controller

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.830 
that controller is the main controller
you<00:03:58.530> have<00:03:58.770> to<00:03:58.920> get<00:03:59.100> up<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.690> turn<00:04:00.690> the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
you have to get up and turn the

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.170 
you have to get up and turn the
PlayStation<00:04:01.380> on<00:04:01.500> now<00:04:02.130> for<00:04:02.340> us<00:04:02.430> lazy<00:04:02.700> people

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
PlayStation on now for us lazy people

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.060 
PlayStation on now for us lazy people
that<00:04:03.360> is<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.570> little<00:04:03.750> bit<00:04:03.930> annoying<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:04.890> can

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
that is a little bit annoying you can

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.560 
that is a little bit annoying you can
turn<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.430> entire<00:04:05.520> system<00:04:05.880> off<00:04:06.180> with<00:04:06.450> the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
turn the entire system off with the

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.600 
turn the entire system off with the
controller<00:04:06.930> same<00:04:07.860> as<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.340> normal

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
controller same as the normal

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.860 
controller same as the normal
controllers<00:04:09.240> obviously<00:04:09.870> if<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.080> was<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:11.870> second

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
controllers obviously if it was a second

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.240 
controllers obviously if it was a second
controller<00:04:13.200> third<00:04:13.470> control<00:04:13.830> was<00:04:13.950> something

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
controller third control was something

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.770 
controller third control was something
like<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.520> and<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:15.330> had<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:15.480> normal

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
like that and you had a normal

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.950 
like that and you had a normal
controller<00:04:16.739> on<00:04:16.920> the<00:04:17.010> go<00:04:17.480> it's<00:04:18.480> going<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.780> work

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960 
controller on the go it's going to work

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.740 
controller on the go it's going to work
fine<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:19.650> just<00:04:19.890> usual<00:04:20.730> first<00:04:21.299> person

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
fine you just usual first person

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.310 
fine you just usual first person
controller<00:04:22.109> power<00:04:22.590> up<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.890> system

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
controller power up the system

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.590 
controller power up the system
and<00:04:24.410> so<00:04:24.560> on<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:25.100> I<00:04:25.160> it's<00:04:25.310> not<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.520> big<00:04:25.700> deal<00:04:25.730> other

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
and so on so I it's not a big deal other

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.470 
and so on so I it's not a big deal other
than<00:04:26.900> that<00:04:27.640> that<00:04:28.640> is<00:04:28.790> probably<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.150> only

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
than that that is probably the only

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.220 
than that that is probably the only
downside<00:04:30.440> I<00:04:30.470> can<00:04:30.950> see<00:04:31.910> but<00:04:32.390> even<00:04:32.840> then<00:04:33.050> it's

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
downside I can see but even then it's

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.820 
downside I can see but even then it's
not<00:04:33.320> much<00:04:33.650> of<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.920> downside<00:04:34.340> really<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:36.680> other

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
not much of a downside really the other

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.470 
not much of a downside really the other
thing<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:38.000> other<00:04:38.150> thing<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.510> take<00:04:38.660> note<00:04:38.720> of<00:04:38.990> is

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
thing the other thing to take note of is

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.420 
thing the other thing to take note of is
because<00:04:41.480> it's<00:04:41.660> not<00:04:41.870> your<00:04:42.050> classic

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
because it's not your classic

sometimes<00:05:06.980> it's<00:05:07.160> a<00:05:07.220> bit<00:05:07.250> more<00:05:07.490> helpful<00:05:07.910> when

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
sometimes it's a bit more helpful when

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.930 
sometimes it's a bit more helpful when
you're<00:05:08.810> actually<00:05:08.930> gaming<00:05:09.440> but<00:05:10.190> it<00:05:10.430> can<00:05:10.730> be

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
you're actually gaming but it can be

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.090 
you're actually gaming but it can be
annoying<00:05:11.150> if<00:05:11.570> you<00:05:11.870> were<00:05:12.020> to<00:05:12.170> just<00:05:12.380> throw<00:05:12.890> the

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
annoying if you were to just throw the

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.480 
annoying if you were to just throw the
controller<00:05:13.190> down<00:05:13.610> on<00:05:13.730> the<00:05:13.820> bed<00:05:14.000> it<00:05:14.750> might<00:05:15.490> all

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
controller down on the bed it might all

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.430 
controller down on the bed it might all
on<00:05:16.700> the<00:05:16.790> floor<00:05:16.910> wherever<00:05:17.330> but<00:05:17.690> it<00:05:17.840> might<00:05:18.050> hit

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
on the floor wherever but it might hit

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.510 
on the floor wherever but it might hit
that<00:05:19.420> incredibly<00:05:22.000> incredibly<00:05:23.000> large<00:05:23.180> trigger

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
that incredibly incredibly large trigger

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.820 
that incredibly incredibly large trigger
so<00:05:25.520> that's<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.420> other<00:05:27.050> thing<00:05:27.170> that<00:05:27.380> you<00:05:27.590> get

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
so that's the other thing that you get

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:35.470 
so that's the other thing that you get
used<00:05:28.040> to<00:05:28.160> I<00:05:28.490> just<00:05:29.090> compare<00:05:29.450> the<00:05:29.630> two<00:05:32.650> okay<00:05:34.480> so
