balance tutorial I'm Nick and today
we're<00:00:06.060> going<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.299> be<00:00:06.390> talking<00:00:06.750> about<00:00:07.140> how<00:00:07.440> to

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
we're going to be talking about how to

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.100 
we're going to be talking about how to
set<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.220> custom<00:00:08.670> white<00:00:08.970> balance<00:00:09.000> with<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.599> nikon

set a custom white balance with a nikon

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.230 
set a custom white balance with a nikon
camera<00:00:10.500> there's<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.519> couple<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.910> different

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
camera there's a couple of different

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.360 
camera there's a couple of different
ways<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.900> can<00:00:13.170> custom<00:00:13.830> set<00:00:14.070> white

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
ways that you can custom set white

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.129 
ways that you can custom set white
balance<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.000> we're<00:00:15.120> going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.330> be<00:00:15.420> using<00:00:15.809> two

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
balance and we're going to be using two

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.060 
balance and we're going to be using two
today<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:17.250> first<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.180> EZ<00:00:18.539> balance<00:00:19.140> which

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
today the first is the EZ balance which

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.570 
today the first is the EZ balance which
is<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.279> product<00:00:20.550> by<00:00:20.910> lastolite<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:23.160> second

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
is a product by lastolite and the second

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.920 
is a product by lastolite and the second
is<00:00:23.789> an<00:00:24.779> expo<00:00:25.109> desk<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:26.400> both<00:00:27.119> are<00:00:27.390> very<00:00:27.779> good

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
is an expo desk and both are very good

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.200 
is an expo desk and both are very good
ways<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.550> create<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> custom<00:00:30.000> white<00:00:30.179> balance

ways to create a custom white balance

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.110 
ways to create a custom white balance
that<00:00:30.779> will<00:00:30.990> hopefully<00:00:31.920> help<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.550> get<00:00:32.820> more

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
that will hopefully help you to get more

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.540 
that will hopefully help you to get more
accurate<00:00:33.300> color<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.020> make<00:00:34.440> your<00:00:34.739> workflow

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
accurate color and make your workflow

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.440 
accurate color and make your workflow
quite<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> bit<00:00:36.360> easier<00:00:37.760> now<00:00:38.760> white<00:00:38.969> balance<00:00:39.329> is

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
quite a bit easier now white balance is

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.160 
quite a bit easier now white balance is
an<00:00:39.600> important<00:00:40.050> part<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.610> digital<00:00:41.610> photography

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
an important part of digital photography

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.200 
an important part of digital photography
because<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.649> dramatically<00:00:44.340> change<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
because it can dramatically change the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.360 
because it can dramatically change the
way<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:45.629> image<00:00:45.930> looks<00:00:46.170> there<00:00:47.160> are

way that your image looks there are

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.360

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
different types of lighting sources that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.260 
different types of lighting sources that
are<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:51.180> everyday<00:00:51.870> life<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:53.039> cameras<00:00:53.850> the

are in everyday life the cameras the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.750 
are in everyday life the cameras the
challenge<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.719> they<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.160> determine

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
challenge that they have is to determine

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.549 
challenge that they have is to determine
the<00:00:56.969> type<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.360> light<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.170> are<00:00:58.320> shooting

dealing with mixed lighting in a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.620 
dealing with mixed lighting in a
situation<00:01:50.610> where<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:51.060> two<00:01:51.479> different

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
situation where you have two different

types<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.200> light<00:01:52.409> sources<00:01:52.970> things<00:01:53.970> become

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
types of light sources things become

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.330 
types of light sources things become
more<00:01:54.630> difficult<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.290> that's<00:01:55.680> when<00:01:55.860> setting<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
more difficult and that's when setting a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.670 
more difficult and that's when setting a
custom<00:01:56.520> white<00:01:56.880> balance<00:01:56.909> because

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
custom white balance because

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.720 
custom white balance because
necessary<00:01:58.720> now<00:01:59.720> this<00:01:59.900> is<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:00.110> d300<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:01.190> you<00:02:01.580> can

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
necessary now this is a d300 and you can

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.700 
necessary now this is a d300 and you can
see<00:02:01.910> that<00:02:02.090> there<00:02:02.300> are<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.810> number<00:02:02.840> of<00:02:03.260> controls
