00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.790
 is an android here with another video but 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.760
 first of all 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.690
 happy and giving they followed that he felt 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.690
 okay pulling video 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.260
 now let's go with what is the video 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.610
 this delay over water and 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.440
 specifically in the huila also 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:27.440
 and in the most expensive part of the union 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.440
 curiously 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.080
 I had first thought of buying the 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.540
 uib 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.820
 I have huy that I do not know how to use but 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:43.060
 the footprint looks interesting wefaq 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.810
 of the cbi it looks very interesting but 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.360
 so I have some reviews left 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.330
 his skill many interactions that 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.850
 he had and his errors mistakes that he brings 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.670
 because all the consoles and all 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.460
 new things plus three mistakes but 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.590
 I started to check 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.379
 out 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.490
 is all things I screwed up 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.430
 hands 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.340
 first we start with the branch that is more 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.330
 slow than the request 3 and the xbox 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.430
 360 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.980
 if it's a new console it may be 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.880
 faster than previously but 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.700
 Nintendo is delivered though 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.630
 what those who work in the contract 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.140
 from the computer all of that know what 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.450
 that a branch quickly that the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.840
 amount of ram is much more important 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:43.740
 and how fast the amount of ram 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.060
 the next 3 was the nintendo network 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.659
 that now they will have 50 cents per 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.829
 make a new nintendo network 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.420
 so you know no fashion the console will be 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.069
 in and of itself they will also charge pool 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.600
 ball network after finding that 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.880
 when you buy 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.509
 the willy incredibly has to sound 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.349
 an initial and mandatory update 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:16.140
 of 5 gigabytes or we had a granddaughter 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.620
 I bought the uy Uruguay is an indicator 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.330
 just start the update 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.489
 Initial and mandatory 5 gigabytes 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.230
 hose since you got a clone 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.819
 of chavo also and although they expect they are 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.560
 a life so that to be able to do that 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.100
 upgrade 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.700
 finished 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.520
 then there is also an error that 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.819
 that some new ones are frozen so 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.319
 and there was a person who managed since the 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.190
 enter the system to investigate everything 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.560
 that and the games are going to be fixing 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.050
 with a patch that already based on the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.820
 rationalization of huila 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.420
 now there is also the nintendo account 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.800
 network that is only used in the 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.190
 console in which you created it before 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.320
 so if the ue-16 your account in your 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.900
 wii oy no to production in another in another 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.610
 wii console or having someone else be 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.770
 it damaged you this will bring you a spare 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.480
 for the guarantee that you bought others go 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.410
 in which creating another account can not 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.840
 use it so that 's more 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.750
 there are also problems with audio 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.670
 in the complication h of m 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.740
 those basic 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.440
 that's base with a console it's contained 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.780
 is a console is not going to make successful by 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.660
 the moment that was one of the things that 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.000
 it discouraged me from this console 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.490
 also another thing that discouraged me goes up 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.270
 the super super super bastard super brutal 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:43.510
 these was that the battery only lasts for 3 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.890
 to 5 hours and originally originally 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.560
 in one of the interviews 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.330
 the creator of this console said he was going 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.630
 to last 8 hours 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:57.140
 that is if you want a console that 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.030
 have a normal gameplay a time 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.950
 of playing and giving me a probability of 35 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.120
 now it's very good very well but nothing 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.560
 gameplay like the one that you run and that 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.010
 only now as in the other consoles 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:12.890
 that would be 7 there was now because it should be 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:16.250
 that would be a good gameplay that 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.109
 it would be 7 to 10 hours 9 3 to 5 and so had 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.820
 the night unloading and by the day he used it 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.460
 all the time you want 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.020
 so we start also going to 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.470
 use more than just one just to 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.150
 save the departure of the new 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.150
 that if he had an egg 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.009
 from the announcement that came out of the pride 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.620
 very good also by the way that also 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.740
 I could see it 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.900
 and more brought up has already done 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.680
 you arrived well at almost the last 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.740
 there is a change and a brother something or 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.240
 a friend who is playing and recorded it from 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.960
 this and it disappeared because this is 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.060
 they lost only explode and that I've also 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.790
 found the errors on the screen 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.960
 of the menu that freezes that everything also 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.090
 you need a patch that this too 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.490
 is something and in the pensions decisions are 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.820
 enough better action than that in all 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.540
 consoles has happened just like what happened with 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:16.600
 what was the xbox 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.520
 I can also do it and the piecita 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.010
 it could get damaged on the screen 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.770
 and the current session is shared 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.259
 arranged so 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.099
 my advice is that if you are planning 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:31.090
 in buying the water that is expected to be 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.979
 are to know at least the 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.710
 updates and I knew and they see 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.940
 others received and all those things that 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.340
 to help you decide if you still 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.199
 they want to buy one too for 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.479
 see if it's still worth buying this 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:48.460
 because I was really excited 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:50.319
 and you see that a good console but but 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.599
 when I chiquito those errors because they 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:55.030
 encouraged a little that I'm going to wait for ya 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:56.650
 that also inmates specializes in the 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.319
 model all things that create very good 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.360
 as it is the first attempts 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.190
 that this would be experimental 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.630
 that went bankrupt they saw us and 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.460
 they recovered and they are doing the same 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.319
 as it happened now to the uich is 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.000
 every time it is old, they are already going to 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.460
 eliminate so we want this not to 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.389
 pass this my advice is to wait for 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.389
 see what happens 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.960
 you really can not imagine 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:24.300
 because it 's just wait 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.069
 with android there are favorites subscribe 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.589
 comment I want to say comments that 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.589
 they think about this was happening
