allowed to chicken out and surrender and

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.400 
allowed to chicken out and surrender and
for<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.570> that's<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.930> good<00:00:34.050> thing<00:00:34.320> because

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
for you that's a good thing because

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.840 
for you that's a good thing because
these<00:00:34.710> champions<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.309> kill<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
these champions can kill you in a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.490 
these champions can kill you in a
variety<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.329> ways<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.380> ranged<00:00:37.800> attacks

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
variety of ways like with ranged attacks

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.380 
variety of ways like with ranged attacks
with<00:00:40.500> magic<00:00:40.980> damage<00:00:42.649> or<00:00:43.649> good<00:00:44.610> old-fashioned

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
with magic damage or good old-fashioned

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.450 
with magic damage or good old-fashioned
melee<00:00:45.780> kind<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:48.559> so<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.590> could<00:00:49.980> say<00:00:50.250> that

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
melee kind of so you could say that

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.459 
melee kind of so you could say that
you'd<00:00:50.610> be<00:00:50.760> pretty<00:00:51.090> much<00:00:51.300> doomed<00:00:51.840> if<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.350> were

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
you'd be pretty much doomed if you were

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.750 
you'd be pretty much doomed if you were
to<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:52.710> against<00:00:53.100> these<00:00:53.250> champions

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
to go up against these champions

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.900 
to go up against these champions
face-to-face<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.809> would<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.860> many<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
face-to-face or would you many of the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.580 
face-to-face or would you many of the
weapons<00:00:57.090> being<00:00:57.449> used<00:00:57.570> against<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.469> are

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
weapons being used against you are

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.799 
weapons being used against you are
actually<00:00:59.039> completely<00:00:59.550> survivable<00:01:00.059> for

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
actually completely survivable for

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.959 
actually completely survivable for
example<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.350> human<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.829> get<00:01:01.980> shot<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.520> 20

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
example a human can get shot up to 20

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.359 
example a human can get shot up to 20
times<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.629> survive<00:01:04.019> take<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> spear<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
times and survive take a spear to the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.670 
times and survive take a spear to the
chest<00:01:05.760> or<00:01:06.090> even<00:01:06.630> take<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> few<00:01:07.140> strikes<00:01:07.409> from

chest or even take a few strikes from
deadly<00:01:07.950> predators<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.909> unless<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.270> can<00:01:09.299> run

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
deadly predators but unless you can run

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.240 
deadly predators but unless you can run
away<00:01:09.780> quickly<00:01:10.049> you'll<00:01:10.530> eventually<00:01:10.710> die<00:01:11.220> from

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
away quickly you'll eventually die from

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.100 
away quickly you'll eventually die from
any<00:01:11.700> encounter<00:01:12.270> with<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> chimp

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
any encounter with a chimp

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.899 
any encounter with a chimp
so<00:01:13.409> could<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.770> outrun<00:01:14.159> any<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> League<00:01:14.790> of

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
so could you outrun any of the League of

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.640 
so could you outrun any of the League of
Legends<00:01:15.299> champions<00:01:15.900> well<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.470> probably

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
Legends champions well you probably

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.170 
Legends champions well you probably
think<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.220> obtained<00:01:17.580> bullets<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.090> can

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
think you're obtained bullets and can

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.060 
think you're obtained bullets and can
outrun<00:01:18.479> anything<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.170> unfortunately<00:01:19.860> you

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
outrun anything but unfortunately you

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.830 
outrun anything but unfortunately you
want<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.850> instead<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.210> running<00:01:21.570> away<00:01:21.689> you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
want so instead of running away you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.390 
want so instead of running away you
could<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.500> next<00:01:22.680> best<00:01:22.979> thing

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
could do the next best thing

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.789 
could do the next best thing
hiding<00:01:23.820> also<00:01:24.299> known<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.689> being<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.080> noob<00:01:25.320> could

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
hiding also known as being a noob could

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.530 
hiding also known as being a noob could
be<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> good<00:01:26.220> strategy<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> map<00:01:27.360> has

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
be a good strategy because the map has

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.450 
be a good strategy because the map has
an<00:01:27.659> area<00:01:27.930> roughly<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> same<00:01:28.650> size<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:28.979> three

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
an area roughly the same size as three

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.370 
an area roughly the same size as three
football<00:01:29.729> fields<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.780> where<00:01:31.020> would<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
football fields so where would be the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.410 
football fields so where would be the
best<00:01:31.530> place<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.070> hide<00:01:32.460> well<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.270> weren't

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
best place to hide well if you weren't

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.270 
best place to hide well if you weren't
allowed<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.750> stay<00:01:34.079> at<00:01:34.140> your<00:01:34.380> base<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.890> safest

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
allowed to stay at your base the safest

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.130 
allowed to stay at your base the safest
place<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> first<00:01:36.329> 20<00:01:36.659> minutes<00:01:36.689> is

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
place to be for the first 20 minutes is

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.859 
place to be for the first 20 minutes is
right<00:01:37.770> outside<00:01:38.100> your<00:01:38.490> base<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.479> for<00:01:39.689> fun

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
right outside your base but for fun

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.210 
right outside your base but for fun
let's<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.350> say<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.770> are<00:01:40.920> brave<00:01:41.189> enough

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
let's just say that you are brave enough
