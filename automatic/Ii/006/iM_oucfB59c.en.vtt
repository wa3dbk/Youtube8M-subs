00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
again like the bad thing but these two

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.449 
again like the bad thing but these two
history<00:04:14.810> together<00:04:14.959> and<00:04:15.470> in<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.800> ring<00:04:15.980> again

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
history together and in the ring again

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.640 
history together and in the ring again
you<00:04:17.389> know<00:04:17.510> this<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:17.900> something<00:04:18.410> different

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
you know this is something different

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.229 
you know this is something different
something<00:04:19.070> different<00:04:19.880> from<00:04:20.090> all<00:04:20.180> the

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
something different from all the

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.710 
something different from all the
storylines<00:04:20.570> in<00:04:21.560> W<00:04:21.919> so<00:04:22.460> I'm<00:04:23.300> thinking<00:04:23.660> this

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
storylines in W so I'm thinking this

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.480 
storylines in W so I'm thinking this
feud<00:04:24.169> is<00:04:24.260> going<00:04:24.500> really<00:04:24.710> good<00:04:25.040> so<00:04:25.280> far<00:04:25.660> and

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
feud is going really good so far and

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.310 
feud is going really good so far and
yeah<00:04:28.490> so<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.389> think<00:04:29.510> they'll<00:04:29.810> put<00:04:29.960> on<00:04:30.050> a<00:04:30.080> good

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
yeah so I think they'll put on a good

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.810 
yeah so I think they'll put on a good
mask<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:30.889> think<00:04:31.070> this<00:04:31.160> will<00:04:31.280> probably<00:04:31.460> be

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
mask and I think this will probably be

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.280 
mask and I think this will probably be
my<00:04:32.000> favorite<00:04:32.030> match<00:04:32.510> of<00:04:32.870> Night<00:04:33.110> of<00:04:33.139> Champions

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.800 
my favorite match of Night of Champions
I'm<00:04:33.889> thinking<00:04:34.190> that<00:04:34.340> campaign<00:04:34.880> looks<00:04:35.450> pretty

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
I'm thinking that campaign looks pretty

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.670 
I'm thinking that campaign looks pretty
good<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.520> Miz<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.900> Daniel<00:04:39.229> Bryan<00:04:39.470> now

I think this match at Night of Champions

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.620 
I think this match at Night of Champions
will<00:05:03.620> be<00:05:03.860> good<00:05:04.070> although<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.940> Miz<00:05:05.120> is<00:05:05.270> finally

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
will be good although the Miz is finally

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.620 
will be good although the Miz is finally
defending<00:05:06.110> it<00:05:06.289> against<00:05:06.650> somebody<00:05:07.070> and<00:05:07.630> you

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
defending it against somebody and you

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.090 
defending it against somebody and you
know<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:08.990> US<00:05:09.229> title<00:05:09.410> will<00:05:09.950> be<00:05:12.100> defended

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
know the US title will be defended

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.460 
know the US title will be defended
instead<00:05:13.460> of<00:05:13.580> going<00:05:13.910> like<00:05:14.270> months<00:05:15.080> and<00:05:15.289> months

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
instead of going like months and months

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.610 
instead of going like months and months
without<00:05:16.510> defending<00:05:17.510> it<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:17.690> who<00:05:17.990> still<00:05:18.350> has

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
without defending it and who still has

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.909 
without defending it and who still has
it<00:05:18.919> I<00:05:20.020> don't<00:05:21.020> think<00:05:21.080> dang<00:05:21.380> a<00:05:21.440> bride<00:05:21.620> should<00:05:21.650> win

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
it I don't think dang a bride should win

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.740 
it I don't think dang a bride should win
it<00:05:22.039> right<00:05:22.070> away<00:05:22.430> just<00:05:22.789> to<00:05:23.120> keep<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.390> few<00:05:23.570> going

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
it right away just to keep the few going

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.580 
it right away just to keep the few going
I<00:05:24.080> think<00:05:24.410> that<00:05:25.870> then<00:05:26.870> at<00:05:27.169> the<00:05:27.260> next

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
I think that then at the next

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.840 
I think that then at the next
pay-per-view<00:05:27.740> of<00:05:28.100> that<00:05:28.250> Daniel<00:05:28.580> Bryan<00:05:28.760> should

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
pay-per-view of that Daniel Bryan should

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.600
