two white bindings and a pair of white
boots<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:43.370> got<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.579> snowboard<00:00:45.210> from<00:00:45.539> Toys<00:00:46.410> R

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
boots I got this snowboard from Toys R

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.670 
boots I got this snowboard from Toys R
Us<00:00:47.149> I'm<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.329> sure<00:00:48.510> if<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> was<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:48.989> sale<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:49.590> I

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
Us I'm not sure if it was on sale but I

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.910 
Us I'm not sure if it was on sale but I
got<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:50.039> 270<00:00:50.940> which<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> pretty<00:00:52.440> good<00:00:52.559> deal

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
got for 270 which is a pretty good deal

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.069 
got for 270 which is a pretty good deal
I<00:00:53.360> think<00:00:54.360> they<00:00:54.600> might<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.870> been<00:00:54.989> on

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
I think they might have been on

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.930 
I think they might have been on
clearance<00:00:55.590> because<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> end<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
clearance because it is the end of the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.680 
clearance because it is the end of the
year<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.329> I'm<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.140> sure<00:00:58.350> okay<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.329> what

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
year but I'm not sure okay so what

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.689 
year but I'm not sure okay so what
you're<00:01:00.840> gonna<00:01:00.960> want<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.160> prefer<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
you're gonna want to do is I prefer the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.670 
you're gonna want to do is I prefer the
orange<00:01:03.059> bindings<00:01:03.539> because<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.260> shoes<00:01:04.470> are

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
orange bindings because the shoes are

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.219 
orange bindings because the shoes are
white<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.090> doesn't<00:01:06.390> look<00:01:06.450> good<00:01:06.930> in

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
white so it just doesn't look good in

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.100 
white so it just doesn't look good in
white<00:01:07.830> binding<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.340> white<00:01:08.520> shoe<00:01:09.110> so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
white binding with the white shoe so

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.719 
white binding with the white shoe so
you're<00:01:10.229> gonna<00:01:10.320> want<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> slip<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.159> boot<00:01:11.490> into

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
you're gonna want to slip the boot into

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.960 
you're gonna want to slip the boot into
the<00:01:12.030> holes<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.990> sides<00:01:13.549> make<00:01:14.549> sure<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.939> that

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the holes on the sides make sure so that

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.490 
the holes on the sides make sure so that
fits<00:01:15.390> tight<00:01:19.939> and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> same<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
fits tight and then do the same on the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:32.710 
fits tight and then do the same on the
next<00:01:22.530> one

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.800 

the<00:01:33.720> bindings<00:01:34.140> rotate<00:01:34.680> 360<00:01:35.010> which<00:01:35.760> is<00:01:36.000> kind<00:01:36.630> of

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the bindings rotate 360 which is kind of

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.830 
the bindings rotate 360 which is kind of
unrealistic<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:38.550> it<00:01:38.700> allows<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.600> more

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
unrealistic but it allows you to do more

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.540 
unrealistic but it allows you to do more
tricks<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:41.570> also<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:43.710> bindings<00:01:44.190> are<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
tricks and also the bindings are a

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.060 
tricks and also the bindings are a
little<00:01:45.150> too<00:01:45.479> close<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.710> still<00:01:46.950> pretty

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
little too close but it's still pretty

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.390 
little too close but it's still pretty
cool

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.499 

okay<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.580> next<00:01:50.759> board<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.270> all<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:52.430> is<00:01:53.509> a

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
okay the next board that all of you is a

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.560 
okay the next board that all of you is a
Burton<00:01:55.259> snowboard<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:58.910> also<00:01:59.910> let<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.390> one

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
toys-r-us I think it was $10 because it

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.980 
toys-r-us I think it was $10 because it
comes<00:02:04.649> with<00:02:04.830> this<00:02:05.009> little<00:02:05.570> rainbow<00:02:06.570> grind
