which you can switch between apps and

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.989 
which you can switch between apps and
widgets<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:06.560> all<00:01:07.219> the<00:01:07.340> applications<00:01:07.639> are

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:07.999 
widgets and all the applications are

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:11.590 
widgets and all the applications are
basically<00:01:08.329> over<00:01:09.319> here<00:01:09.530> uh<00:01:10.209> so<00:01:11.209> yeah<00:01:11.359> it<00:01:11.450> looks

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
basically over here uh so yeah it looks

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.239 
basically over here uh so yeah it looks
exactly<00:01:11.719> and<00:01:12.259> feels<00:01:12.469> exactly<00:01:12.740> like<00:01:12.920> that<00:01:13.069> of

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:13.249 
exactly and feels exactly like that of

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:15.249 
exactly and feels exactly like that of
ICS<00:01:13.670> instead<00:01:14.389> of<00:01:14.450> actually<00:01:14.719> smoothly<00:01:14.990> as<00:01:15.229> you

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
ICS instead of actually smoothly as you

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:16.809 
ICS instead of actually smoothly as you
can<00:01:15.380> see<00:01:15.469> i<00:01:15.499> can't<00:01:15.649> describe<00:01:15.889> true<00:01:16.069> its<00:01:16.579> pitch

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:16.819 
can see i can't describe true its pitch

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:18.639 
can see i can't describe true its pitch
very<00:01:17.060> quickly<00:01:17.270> without<00:01:17.569> much<00:01:18.020> leg<00:01:18.289> which<00:01:18.529> is

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
very quickly without much leg which is

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.219 
very quickly without much leg which is
really<00:01:18.799> really<00:01:18.920> nice<00:01:19.159> I<00:01:19.749> want<00:01:20.749> me<00:01:20.869> to<00:01:20.929> show<00:01:21.170> you

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
really really nice I want me to show you

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.039 
really really nice I want me to show you
the<00:01:21.380> browser<00:01:21.639> so<00:01:22.639> the<00:01:23.029> ICS<00:01:23.420> browser

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.499 

automatically<00:01:27.049> was<00:01:27.380> signing<00:01:27.829> in<00:01:28.279> okay<00:01:29.149> cool

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
automatically was signing in okay cool

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.109 
automatically was signing in okay cool
alright<00:01:29.779> so<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:31.219> ISIS<00:01:31.490> browser<00:01:31.700> looks<00:01:31.849> like

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
alright so the ISIS browser looks like

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.649 
alright so the ISIS browser looks like
that<00:01:32.299> of<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:33.700> formalized<00:01:34.700> I<00:01:34.849> mean<00:01:34.999> the<00:01:35.329> ISIS

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
that of the formalized I mean the ISIS

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:36.969 
that of the formalized I mean the ISIS
Brussels<00:01:36.020> I<00:01:36.139> doubt<00:01:36.289> the<00:01:36.409> ISIS<00:01:36.679> processor

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
Brussels I doubt the ISIS processor

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.649 
Brussels I doubt the ISIS processor
