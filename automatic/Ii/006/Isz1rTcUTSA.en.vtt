00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.710 
do not have one of those on the album
yet<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.549> is<00:02:35.579> going<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.910> be<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> love<00:02:36.420> song

of the album I am just so excited I

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.569 
of the album I am just so excited I
don't<00:02:40.019> know<00:02:40.140> why<00:02:40.410> it's<00:02:40.739> this<00:02:40.980> song<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.400> think

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
don't know why it's this song I think

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.670 
don't know why it's this song I think
it's<00:02:41.700> because<00:02:41.850> not<00:02:42.690> only<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.079> personal<00:02:43.560> to

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
it's because not only is it personal to

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.380 
it's because not only is it personal to
someone<00:02:44.040> else<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.760> wrote<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.090> on<00:02:45.269> before

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.050 
someone else so I wrote this on before
but<00:02:45.630> it's<00:02:45.810> also<00:02:45.959> personal<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.739> me<00:02:46.980> because

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
but it's also personal to me because

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.729 
but it's also personal to me because
it's<00:02:48.060> about<00:02:48.450> being<00:02:48.690> separated<00:02:49.290> from<00:02:49.380> someone
