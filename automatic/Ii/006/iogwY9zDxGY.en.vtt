let's play for quantum solace knowing at

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.170 
let's play for quantum solace knowing at
the<00:01:12.150> machinima<00:01:12.630> I'd<00:01:13.560> say<00:01:13.830> without<00:01:13.979> within<00:01:14.610> for

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the machinima I'd say without within for

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.070 
the machinima I'd say without within for
three<00:01:15.659> or<00:01:15.810> four<00:01:15.840> days<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.869> works<00:01:18.869> when

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
three or four days because it works when

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.480 
three or four days because it works when
they<00:01:19.170> process<00:01:19.530> your<00:01:19.650> video<00:01:19.860> tells<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
they process your video tells you the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.010 
they process your video tells you the
date<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.270> hasn't<00:01:21.540> told<00:01:21.659> me<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> data

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
date and it hasn't told me the data

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.660 
date and it hasn't told me the data
because<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.560> still<00:01:22.770> processing<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.340> video

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
because it's still processing the video

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.960 
because it's still processing the video
