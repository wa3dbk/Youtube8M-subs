you coming with me Eureka let's go take
this<00:01:14.689> out<00:01:14.899> now<00:01:15.049> this<00:01:15.200> is<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.499> DCF<00:01:16.009> 21<00:01:16.729> filter

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
this out now this is the DCF 21 filter

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.989 
this out now this is the DCF 21 filter
I'm<00:01:18.319> gonna<00:01:18.499> show<00:01:18.710> you<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:18.889> best<00:01:19.069> part<00:01:19.310> take<00:01:19.969> a

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:19.999 
I'm gonna show you the best part take a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:22.599 
I'm gonna show you the best part take a
look<00:01:20.179> see<00:01:21.170> much<00:01:21.289> of<00:01:21.319> a<00:01:21.469> difference<00:01:21.590> other<00:01:22.429> than

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
look see much of a difference other than

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:24.279 
look see much of a difference other than
the<00:01:22.700> color<00:01:22.880> really<00:01:23.299> there's<00:01:23.630> no<00:01:23.810> difference

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
the color really there's no difference

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.830 
the color really there's no difference
guess<00:01:24.649> what<00:01:24.829> this<00:01:25.219> is<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:25.639> much<00:01:25.850> cheaper<00:01:26.119> and

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
guess what this is so much cheaper and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.330

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
gonna want to get that filter in and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.239 
gonna want to get that filter in and
then<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:37.819> just<00:01:37.999> twist<00:01:38.319> to<00:01:39.319> lock<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.950> in<00:01:40.069> place

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 
then you just twist to lock it in place

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:43.719 
then you just twist to lock it in place
once<00:01:41.209> it<00:01:41.329> is<00:01:41.359> locked<00:01:41.600> in<00:01:41.840> place<00:01:41.869> like<00:01:42.319> so<00:01:42.729> take

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
once it is locked in place like so take

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.269 
once it is locked in place like so take
your<00:01:43.880> canister<00:01:44.329> your<00:01:44.630> dustbin<00:01:45.049> canister<00:01:45.560> and

your canister your dustbin canister and

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:48.639 
your canister your dustbin canister and
now<00:01:46.429> this<00:01:46.729> is<00:01:46.999> probably<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.899> hardest<00:01:48.109> part

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
now this is probably the hardest part

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.219 
now this is probably the hardest part
about<00:01:48.770> replacing<00:01:49.399> these<00:01:49.729> filters<00:01:50.240> on<00:01:51.020> the
