00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.780
 this program becomes possible 

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.780
 made by lucky 'strike bowling 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:14.849
 at the Steenwijk football club 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.680
 collected the national last week 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.200
 and international inline skating 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.460
 often these are common 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.180
 marathon skaters or 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.650
 speed skaters 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.349
 and of the participants is irene schouten 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.750
 from andijk schouten is one of the 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.150
 few active on the ice in the asphalt 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.530
 I also think that is nice about harming the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.120
 variety and a summer pick or thea 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.640
 I pick myself up a little people 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.100
 have tension and know where I stand here 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.659
 just have box holes in in the winter 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.820
 skating in the winter in the summer then 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.909
 rollerblading no I don't have to ask 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.589
 whether you know it or you know it a bit 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:53.010
 well i am the ruling european 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.400
 champion on print coach so that works 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.610
 good 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.850
 can you still defend this yes yes yes 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.650
 I can still defend but I think so 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.540
 that it will be difficult because I last 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.110
 years I went pretty much 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.360
 roller skating 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.280
 also because the world championships we 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.049
 yes and this year I will not participate 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.210
 to the to the world championship it 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.520
 so that rollerblading at a lower level 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.079
 is the match in Steenwijk is one 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.729
 of the few who schouten this season 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.899
 will drive 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.640
 marathon skating where successful 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.600
 as they leave more and more left 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.820
 lie 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.619
 the reason is simple to buttons sixth 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.909
 place in the all-round World Cup at the end of March 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.219
 heerenveen now belongs to the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.009
 second tier of the long track speed skating is 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:35.700
 many came toward me really much 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.829
 yes messages and my by on everyone 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.049
 people who come to me has really super 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:45.899
 nice and yes you s also get so much 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.159
 more self-confidence and he just whole 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.810
 well into the summer 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.039
 yes you say you get many messages that 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.460
 attention it is also a bit of a kind 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.340
 status you have acquired with it 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.039
 yes you do you will be more respected 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.319
 for your performance I think yes certainly yes 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.850
 now if you are somewhere and you are 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.639
 nevertheless those who says of the world 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.600
 know how is that really nice to 

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:08.220
 to hear 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.230
 schouten already feels stronger than that 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.489
 other years and there is certainty 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.489
 10 namely looks good 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.000
 he the security and we are not going now 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.880
 2018 eat again but the team new balance 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.709
 so we now have a sponges and yes we do 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.690
 go because I have started 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.480
 yes so all new ones all 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.970
 new yes yes I think the top box 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.650
 did well, but things are changing 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.500
 a few years change a few things 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.989
 especially and the ten days from china 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.790
 yes horses and logos that change 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.860
 yes that is tasty it gives certainty 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.569
 yes sure i'm also very happy with it 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.310
 and 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.480
 we deserve to go the following week 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.819
 preparation itself more and more 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.650
 focus on skating the 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.200
 basis for a good season must go 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.730
 to be laid next weekend is the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.650
 training weekends so a bit more 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.830
 remove more bears with a group 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.930
 meet and then a little at home and then 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.720
 a little bit to 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.760
 next to you the dunes at schoorl and van 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.769
 little moutain biking 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.799
 when a few weeks cross and then to 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:18.190
 mallorca probably to two weeks too 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.230
 cycling and training and there the 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:29.049
 preparation traits are any brown 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:30.760
 think is definitely brown paper and then end 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.859
 October she must be in early November 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.810
 because then the season starts on the ice 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.769
 with qualifying matches for the 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.420
 world cups 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.630
 come while I hope I go my way 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.579
 place for the world cups and yes 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.609
 actually that I market a little less 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.920
 us driving but year long job 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.300

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.090

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.030
