just kind of like why would you why
would<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.340> make<00:01:38.460> something<00:01:38.700> more<00:01:39.000> hard<00:01:39.240> to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
would you make something more hard to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.490 
would you make something more hard to
use<00:01:39.570> um<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:41.159> blade<00:01:41.369> shape<00:01:41.670> probably<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.689> one

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
use um the blade shape probably is one

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.080 
use um the blade shape probably is one
of<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> better<00:01:43.979> ones<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.460> don't<00:01:44.729> know<00:01:44.850> why

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
of the better ones I don't know why

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.380 
of the better ones I don't know why
people<00:01:45.950> started<00:01:46.950> doing<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:48.000> whole<00:01:48.149> wide

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
people started doing the whole wide

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.480 
people started doing the whole wide
blade<00:01:48.720> thing<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.110> needed<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.710> narrow<00:01:50.040> for

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
blade thing I needed to be narrow for

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.190 
blade thing I needed to be narrow for
cutting<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:52.170> could<00:01:52.890> say<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:54.960> more

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
cutting you could say that you have more

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.709 
cutting you could say that you have more
area<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.530> sharpen<00:01:56.040> with<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:56.969> when<00:01:57.360> was<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
area to sharpen with but when was the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.810 
area to sharpen with but when was the
last<00:01:57.869> time<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.439> took<00:01:58.680> off<00:01:58.890> about<00:01:59.159> more<00:01:59.790> than

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
last time you took off about more than

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.999 
last time you took off about more than
you<00:02:00.299> know<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.600> centimeter<00:02:01.259> off<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> blade<00:02:01.740> at

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
you know a centimeter off the blade at

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.039 
you know a centimeter off the blade at
most<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.909> like<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.329> brand<00:02:03.600> new<00:02:03.659> blade<00:02:03.899> from

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
most it's like a brand new blade from

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.330 
most it's like a brand new blade from
benchmade<00:02:04.500> cost<00:02:04.740> twenty-five<00:02:05.189> dollars

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
benchmade cost twenty-five dollars

back<00:02:15.360> locks<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.870> kind<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.260> uh<00:02:16.290> they're<00:02:17.130> simple

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
back locks is kind of uh they're simple

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.830 
back locks is kind of uh they're simple
knives<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.060> make<00:02:18.240> it's<00:02:18.680> just<00:02:19.680> uh<00:02:20.510> as<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.570> can

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
knives to make it's just uh as you can

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.020 
knives to make it's just uh as you can
see<00:02:21.990> here<00:02:22.230> there's<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.130> torsion<00:02:23.550> bar<00:02:23.760> inside

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
see here there's a torsion bar inside

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.450 
see here there's a torsion bar inside
that's<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.930> permanently<00:02:25.860> affixed<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.520> the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
that's a permanently affixed to the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.830 
that's a permanently affixed to the
permanently<00:02:29.460> affixed<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.300> block<00:02:30.570> space

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
permanently affixed to this block space

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.570 
permanently affixed to this block space
if<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.140> see<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.410> grey<00:02:31.650> rod<00:02:31.950> traveling<00:02:32.400> down

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
if you see that grey rod traveling down

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.850 
if you see that grey rod traveling down
and<00:02:32.790> when<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.480> push<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.930> back<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.650> obviously

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
and when you push the back it obviously

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.070 
and when you push the back it obviously
is<00:02:35.310> going<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.700> bend<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.150> rod<00:02:36.450> which<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.960> it

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
is going to bend that rod which is it

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.280 
is going to bend that rod which is it
acts<00:02:37.470> as<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.920> spring<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.780> that's<00:02:39.780> really<00:02:40.110> it

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
acts as the spring and that's really it

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.230 
acts as the spring and that's really it
I<00:02:40.770> mean<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.100> know<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.490> don't<00:02:41.580> have<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.910> fit

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
I mean you know you don't have to fit

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.160 
I mean you know you don't have to fit
any<00:02:42.390> pieces<00:02:42.750> together<00:02:43.110> like<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> finer<00:02:43.950> um<00:02:45.170> it's

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
any pieces together like a finer um it's

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.970 
any pieces together like a finer um it's
just<00:02:46.380> basically<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.770> drop<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.250> off<00:02:47.520> dork<00:02:47.880> ah

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
just basically a drop it off dork ah

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.030 
just basically a drop it off dork ah
steel<00:02:49.980> one<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.430> d<00:02:50.790> 2<00:02:50.900> d<00:02:51.900> 2<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:52.110> actually<00:02:52.800> my

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
steel one this is d 2 d 2 is actually my

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.910 
steel one this is d 2 d 2 is actually my
favorite<00:02:53.370> steel<00:02:53.820> because<00:02:54.380> it's<00:02:55.380> very<00:02:55.560> dry

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
favorite steel because it's very dry

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.700 
favorite steel because it's very dry
where<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.190> live<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:57.230> benchmade<00:02:58.230> surface

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
where I live and benchmade surface

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.620 
where I live and benchmade surface
treatment<00:02:59.100> usually<00:02:59.340> prevents<00:02:59.850> rust<00:03:00.150> as<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.480> is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
treatment usually prevents rust as it is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.030 
treatment usually prevents rust as it is
so<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:03.090> can<00:03:03.120> have<00:03:03.480> edge<00:03:03.720> retention<00:03:04.110> exceeding

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
so you can have edge retention exceeding

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.950 
so you can have edge retention exceeding
s30v<00:03:05.700> if<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.390> keep<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.520> you<00:03:08.520> know<00:03:08.960> domestic

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
s30v if you keep it to you know domestic

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.300 
s30v if you keep it to you know domestic
tests<00:03:10.410> only<00:03:12.710> other<00:03:13.710> than<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:14.790> it's<00:03:15.120> uh<00:03:15.570> it's

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
tests only other than that it's uh it's

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.280 
tests only other than that it's uh it's
performs<00:03:17.310> very<00:03:17.580> well<00:03:17.640> um<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.630> was<00:03:18.930> like<00:03:19.140> the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
performs very well um I was like the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.170 
performs very well um I was like the
lock<00:03:19.440> back<00:03:19.650> snap<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.340> reminds<00:03:20.730> me<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
lock back snap it reminds me of the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.060 
lock back snap it reminds me of the
Endura<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:22.170> if<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.680> Endura<00:03:22.980> was<00:03:23.220> better<00:03:25.070> you

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
Endura but if the Endura was better you

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.150 
Endura but if the Endura was better you
know<00:03:26.160> feel<00:03:26.610> better<00:03:26.640> better<00:03:27.120> materials<00:03:27.690> ah<00:03:28.160> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
know feel better better materials ah the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.260 
know feel better better materials ah the
wood<00:03:29.370> handles<00:03:29.850> are<00:03:30.240> great<00:03:32.030> can't<00:03:33.030> really

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
wood handles are great can't really

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.910 
wood handles are great can't really
fault<00:03:33.570> this<00:03:33.780> knife<00:03:34.020> it's<00:03:34.380> just<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:34.740> know<00:03:34.800> I

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
fault this knife it's just you know I

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.710 
fault this knife it's just you know I
didn't<00:03:35.190> really<00:03:35.250> think<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:35.790> was<00:03:35.850> really<00:03:36.540> worth

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
didn't really think it was really worth

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.410 
didn't really think it was really worth
talking<00:03:36.959> about<00:03:37.260> but<00:03:37.860> apparently<00:03:38.640> or<00:03:39.030> moto

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
talking about but apparently or moto

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.070 
talking about but apparently or moto
think<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:39.959> buddy<00:03:40.550> so<00:03:41.550> yeah<00:03:42.450> um<00:03:42.660> that's<00:03:43.470> that

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
think so buddy so yeah um that's that

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.020 
think so buddy so yeah um that's that
again<00:03:46.080> it's<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.739> it's<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.070> very<00:03:47.280> ergonomic<00:03:47.820> knife

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
again it's a it's a very ergonomic knife

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.900 
again it's a it's a very ergonomic knife
if<00:03:48.330> you<00:03:49.290> were<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.739> do<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:49.980> knife<00:03:50.370> with<00:03:50.670> some

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
if you were to do this knife with some

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.780 
if you were to do this knife with some
kind<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.620> there<00:03:52.620> isn't<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.920> route<00:03:53.100> there<00:03:53.459> isn't

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
kind of there isn't a route there isn't

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.400 
kind of there isn't a route there isn't
a<00:03:53.820> way<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.060> really<00:03:54.360> do<00:03:54.570> snipe<00:03:54.900> with<00:03:55.170> the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
a way to really do snipe with the

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.430 
a way to really do snipe with the
anything<00:03:56.190> short<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:56.610> spider<00:03:56.940> hole<00:03:57.440> because

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
anything short of a spider hole because

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.720 
anything short of a spider hole because
you<00:03:58.560> need<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.739> lot<00:03:58.830> of<00:03:59.040> torque<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.489> get<00:03:59.640> the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
you need a lot of torque to get the

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.880 
you need a lot of torque to get the
blade<00:03:59.940> open<00:04:00.239> because<00:04:00.540> uh<00:04:00.780> because<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.770> the

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
blade open because uh because of the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.240 
blade open because uh because of the
downward<00:04:02.370> pressure<00:04:02.670> of<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.090> aloft<00:04:03.720> bar

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
downward pressure of the aloft bar

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.979 
downward pressure of the aloft bar
you're<00:04:05.250> there's<00:04:05.760> just<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.270> lot<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.660> friction

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
you're there's just a lot of friction

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.190 
you're there's just a lot of friction
and<00:04:07.290> tension<00:04:07.320> so<00:04:08.310> it's<00:04:08.640> see<00:04:09.090> if<00:04:09.360> there's<00:04:10.050> even

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
and tension so it's see if there's even

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.550 
and tension so it's see if there's even
a<00:04:10.440> notch<00:04:10.709> it's<00:04:11.130> nachi<00:04:11.459> too<00:04:11.820> um<00:04:13.670> but<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:15.450> know

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
a notch it's nachi too um but you know

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.039 
a notch it's nachi too um but you know
so<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.680> actually<00:04:17.220> do<00:04:17.700> need<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:18.120> actually<00:04:18.510> grab

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
so you actually do need to actually grab

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.529 
so you actually do need to actually grab
that<00:04:19.260> bleep<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.739> pull<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.070> out<00:04:20.310> um<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:21.330> can

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
that bleep and pull it out um you can

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.810 
that bleep and pull it out um you can
slowly<00:04:21.780> push<00:04:22.169> it<00:04:22.350> out<00:04:22.470> but<00:04:22.740> just<00:04:23.520> dangerous

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
slowly push it out but just dangerous

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.670 
slowly push it out but just dangerous
because<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.479> know<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.930> could<00:04:25.110> slip<00:04:25.410> at<00:04:25.560> any

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
because you know you could slip at any

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.960 
because you know you could slip at any
moment<00:04:25.919> and<00:04:26.190> just
