in<00:00:03.840> this<00:00:04.840> model<00:00:05.320> when<00:00:06.040> you<00:00:06.160> remove<00:00:07.139> the<00:00:08.139> ramus

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.650 
in this model when you remove the ramus

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.699 
in this model when you remove the ramus
of<00:00:08.800> the<00:00:08.860> mandible<00:00:08.980> and<00:00:10.709> the

visible

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.450 

you<00:00:26.539> can<00:00:26.750> see<00:00:26.929> the<00:00:27.289> greater<00:00:27.590> Horn<00:00:28.070> of<00:00:28.340> the

you can see the greater Horn of the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.389 
you can see the greater Horn of the
hyoid<00:00:29.240> bone<00:00:29.980> right<00:00:30.980> over<00:00:31.279> here<00:00:33.190> the<00:00:34.190> hyoid

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
hyoid bone right over here the hyoid

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.680 
hyoid bone right over here the hyoid
bone<00:00:35.149> is<00:00:35.180> not<00:00:35.750> attached<00:00:36.170> to<00:00:36.379> any<00:00:36.620> other<00:00:36.890> bone

bone is not attached to any other bone

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.720 
bone is not attached to any other bone
but<00:00:38.690> movements<00:00:39.170> of<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.379> hyoid<00:00:39.590> bone<00:00:40.010> affect

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
but movements of the hyoid bone affect

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.670 
but movements of the hyoid bone affect
three<00:00:40.970> compartments<00:00:41.540> because<00:00:41.930> it<00:00:42.290> is<00:00:42.470> on<00:00:42.650> the

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
three compartments because it is on the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.569 
three compartments because it is on the
floor<00:00:42.980> of<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.970> oral<00:00:44.180> cavity<00:00:44.390> it<00:00:45.250> is<00:00:46.250> in<00:00:46.370> front

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.280 
attached to the hyoid two of these
muscles<00:01:01.010> are<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:02.000> stylohyoid<00:01:03.159> and<00:01:05.110> you<00:01:06.110> can

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
muscles are the stylohyoid and you can

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.770 
muscles are the stylohyoid and you can
see<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:06.680> posterior<00:01:07.130> belly<00:01:07.549> of<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.659> digastric

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.210 
see the posterior belly of the digastric
muscle<00:01:09.590> here<00:01:11.170> let's<00:01:12.170> talk<00:01:12.409> about<00:01:12.560> these<00:01:13.159> two

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
muscle here let's talk about these two

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.749 
muscle here let's talk about these two
muscles<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:14.869> stylohyoid<00:01:15.320> has<00:01:16.280> an<00:01:16.549> original

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
muscles the stylohyoid has an original

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.580 
muscles the stylohyoid has an original
on<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.840> base<00:01:18.020> of<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.770> styloid<00:01:19.220> process<00:01:19.520> and

on the base of the styloid process and

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.850 
on the base of the styloid process and
inserts<00:01:21.590> on<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.880> lateral<00:01:23.180> part<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.619> body

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.190 
inserts on the lateral part of the body
of<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.610> hyoid<00:01:25.820> which<00:01:26.299> you<00:01:26.450> can't<00:01:26.689> really<00:01:26.900> see

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
of the hyoid which you can't really see

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.180 
of the hyoid which you can't really see
from<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:27.740> view<00:01:28.960> during<00:01:29.960> swallowing<00:01:30.770> it

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
from this view during swallowing it

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.720 
from this view during swallowing it
pulls<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.790> hyoid<00:01:32.080> posteriorly<00:01:33.080> and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
pulls the hyoid posteriorly and

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.870 
pulls the hyoid posteriorly and
superiorly<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:36.500> digastric<00:01:36.890> muscle<00:01:37.670> is

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
superiorly the digastric muscle is

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.330 
superiorly the digastric muscle is
called<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.780> digastric<00:01:39.110> because<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.980> has<00:01:40.130> too

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
called the digastric because it has too

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.430 
called the digastric because it has too
fleshy<00:01:40.580> bellies<00:01:41.120> connected<00:01:41.690> by<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.870> tendon

which attaches to the body of the hyoid

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.990 
which attaches to the body of the hyoid
you<00:01:47.090> could<00:01:47.240> only<00:01:47.420> see<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.760> posterior<00:01:49.760> belly

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
you could only see the posterior belly

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.469 
you could only see the posterior belly
here<00:01:50.870> which<00:01:51.830> has<00:01:52.070> an<00:01:52.250> original<00:01:52.479> mastoid

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479
