00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
yeah well anyways it frees time there

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
and they look out the back just because

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.810 
and they look out the back just because
I<00:03:35.900> didn't<00:03:36.260> show<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.560> guys<00:03:36.800> that<00:03:37.070> it's<00:03:37.460> proof

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
I didn't show you guys that it's proof

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:45.070 
I didn't show you guys that it's proof
you<00:03:38.030> can<00:03:38.210> go<00:03:38.330> through<00:03:38.540> there<00:03:43.780> quick<00:03:44.780> think<00:03:44.990> of

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
you can go through there quick think of

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.280 
you can go through there quick think of
something<00:03:45.380> else<00:03:47.230> let's<00:03:48.230> just<00:03:48.410> go<00:03:48.590> with<00:03:50.290> this

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
something else let's just go with this

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.949 
something else let's just go with this
map<00:03:51.560> was<00:03:51.920> probably<00:03:52.340> what<00:03:52.640> not<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.420> best<00:03:53.630> of<00:03:53.810> my

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
map was probably what not the best of my

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.440 
map was probably what not the best of my
making<00:03:54.350> but<00:03:54.590> it's<00:03:54.740> one<00:03:54.890> of<00:03:54.920> my<00:03:55.070> favorites<00:03:55.580> it's

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
making but it's one of my favorites it's

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.570 
making but it's one of my favorites it's
probably<00:03:56.990> going<00:03:57.110> to<00:03:57.230> be<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.590> prototype<00:03:58.040> of

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
probably going to be the prototype of

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.880 
probably going to be the prototype of
the<00:03:59.330> next<00:03:59.630> map<00:03:59.780> that<00:03:59.990> I<00:04:00.020> will<00:04:00.230> be<00:04:00.380> making<00:04:00.560> on

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
the next map that I will be making on

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.280 
the next map that I will be making on
Halo<00:04:01.430> 4<00:04:02.239> it's<00:04:02.510> gonna<00:04:02.630> be<00:04:02.780> called<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.020> same

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
Halo 4 it's gonna be called the same

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.750 
Halo 4 it's gonna be called the same
thing<00:04:03.320> again<00:04:04.160> I'll<00:04:04.400> be<00:04:04.610> in<00:04:04.670> description<00:04:05.330> and

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
thing again I'll be in description and

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.150 
thing again I'll be in description and
most<00:04:07.760> of<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:08.120> will<00:04:08.660> be<00:04:08.840> identical<00:04:09.830> to<00:04:09.950> this<00:04:10.100> one

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
most of it will be identical to this one

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.430 
most of it will be identical to this one
but<00:04:10.580> already<00:04:11.180> making<00:04:11.600> it<00:04:11.720> is<00:04:11.840> pretty<00:04:12.320> much

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
but already making it is pretty much

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.130 
but already making it is pretty much
finished<00:04:12.830> now<00:04:12.980> it's<00:04:13.970> just<00:04:14.180> it<00:04:14.600> looks<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.959> lot

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
finished now it's just it looks a lot

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.020 
finished now it's just it looks a lot
better<00:04:15.320> but<00:04:15.590> there's<00:04:15.800> a<00:04:15.890> lot<00:04:16.070> of<00:04:16.160> things<00:04:16.340> more

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
better but there's a lot of things more

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.870 
better but there's a lot of things more
about<00:04:17.239> it<00:04:17.390> but<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:18.100> don't<00:04:19.100> really<00:04:19.370> like<00:04:19.640> and

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
about it but I don't really like and

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.780 
about it but I don't really like and
you'll<00:04:20.030> see<00:04:20.269> why<00:04:20.510> I<00:04:24.490> don't<00:04:25.490> think<00:04:25.669> I've

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
you'll see why I don't think I've

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.580 
you'll see why I don't think I've
mentioned<00:04:26.030> changes<00:04:26.660> in<00:04:26.780> this<00:04:26.990> map<00:04:27.230> like

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.550 
mentioned changes in this map like
actual<00:04:28.100> work<00:04:28.520> changes<00:04:29.000> since<00:04:29.480> I<00:04:29.630> reprinted<00:04:30.440> it

people<00:04:54.080> who<00:04:54.290> work<00:04:54.500> at<00:04:54.650> Bungie<00:04:54.950> look<00:04:55.130> there<00:04:55.280> I

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
people who work at Bungie look there I

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.740 
people who work at Bungie look there I
don't<00:04:55.610> know<00:04:55.729> I<00:04:55.940> don't<00:04:56.180> have<00:04:56.300> my<00:04:56.479> story

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
don't know I don't have my story

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.090 
don't know I don't have my story
straightforward<00:04:57.350> so<00:04:57.500> I'm<00:04:57.620> not<00:04:57.740> gonna<00:04:57.890> make

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
straightforward so I'm not gonna make

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.610 
straightforward so I'm not gonna make
any<00:04:58.450> claims<00:04:59.950> just<00:05:00.950> go<00:05:01.100> with<00:05:01.220> that<00:05:01.250> and<00:05:02.620> now

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
any claims just go with that and now

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.469 
any claims just go with that and now
instead<00:05:04.130> of<00:05:04.280> just<00:05:04.400> keeping<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.760> secret<00:05:05.240> spawn

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
instead of just keeping the secret spawn

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.060 
instead of just keeping the secret spawn
so<00:05:05.690> I<00:05:05.750> get<00:05:05.960> usually<00:05:06.380> doing<00:05:06.620> this<00:05:06.710> map<00:05:06.919> I'm

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:21.239 

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:24.119 

another<00:05:22.239> thing<00:05:22.449> I<00:05:22.569> kind<00:05:22.749> of<00:05:22.839> miss<00:05:23.049> in<00:05:23.799> the

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:24.129 
another thing I kind of miss in the

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.159 
another thing I kind of miss in the
Knicks<00:05:24.459> game<00:05:24.759> is<00:05:24.969> that<00:05:25.509> you<00:05:25.809> can't<00:05:26.019> go

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
Knicks game is that you can't go

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:27.449 
Knicks game is that you can't go
underwater<00:05:26.499> anymore

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:27.459 
underwater anymore

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:29.789 
underwater anymore
I<00:05:27.489> mean<00:05:28.479> you<00:05:28.599> aren't<00:05:29.199> supposed<00:05:29.349> to<00:05:29.499> be<00:05:29.589> able<00:05:29.649> to

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:29.799 
I mean you aren't supposed to be able to

00:05:29.799 --> 00:05:31.139 
I mean you aren't supposed to be able to
own<00:05:29.889> the<00:05:30.009> water<00:05:30.129> but<00:05:30.489> I<00:05:30.519> think<00:05:30.789> they<00:05:30.879> kind<00:05:31.119> of

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:31.149 
own the water but I think they kind of

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:32.909 
own the water but I think they kind of
purposely<00:05:31.689> left<00:05:31.929> it<00:05:32.169> to<00:05:32.349> where<00:05:32.529> you<00:05:32.679> could

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
purposely left it to where you could

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.089 
purposely left it to where you could
just<00:05:33.519> place<00:05:33.759> a<00:05:33.789> teleport<00:05:34.329> out<00:05:34.389> the<00:05:34.539> balance

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
just place a teleport out the balance

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.679 
just place a teleport out the balance
that's<00:05:36.099> around<00:05:36.369> the<00:05:36.669> water<00:05:36.909> or<00:05:37.119> something<00:05:37.479> I

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:37.689 
that's around the water or something I

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.739 
that's around the water or something I
don't<00:05:37.839> know<00:05:37.959> it<00:05:38.439> was<00:05:38.559> kind<00:05:38.619> of<00:05:38.860> fun<00:05:39.099> and<00:05:39.669> I<00:05:40.479> will
