00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.350

all right we microwaved our cran in
alwal<00:01:25.780> for<00:01:26.049> three<00:01:26.409> minutes<00:01:26.619> it<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:28.020> very<00:01:29.020> hot

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
alwal for three minutes it is a very hot

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.070

glass and it looks really cool really
like<00:01:32.619> magenta<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.430> think<00:01:33.789> it's<00:01:33.880> gonna<00:01:34.000> be

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
like magenta I think it's gonna be

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.130 
like magenta I think it's gonna be
really<00:01:34.299> pretty<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.340> next<00:01:36.810> we're<00:01:37.810> going<00:01:37.990> to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
really pretty so next we're going to

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.430 
really pretty so next we're going to
carefully<00:01:38.770> over<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.610> sink<00:01:40.200> pour<00:01:41.200> this

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
carefully over the sink pour this

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.219 
carefully over the sink pour this
mixture<00:01:41.610> into<00:01:42.840> our<00:01:43.840> old<00:01:44.200> lipstick<00:01:45.100> too

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.260 

careful<00:01:50.229> sponge<00:01:50.409> on<00:01:50.560> Kevin<00:01:51.130> spongebob<00:01:51.520> Carol

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
careful sponge on Kevin spongebob Carol

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:02.010 
careful sponge on Kevin spongebob Carol
spongebob<00:01:52.780> careful<00:01:56.819> yeah<00:02:00.149> okay<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:01.810> now<00:02:01.990> I

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
spongebob careful yeah okay so now I

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.719 
spongebob careful yeah okay so now I
think<00:02:02.380> we<00:02:02.470> let<00:02:02.619> it<00:02:02.710> sit<00:02:02.920> for<00:02:02.950> 15<00:02:03.369> or<00:02:03.429> 20<00:02:03.700> minutes

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
think we let it sit for 15 or 20 minutes

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:04.949 
think we let it sit for 15 or 20 minutes
we<00:02:04.090> could<00:02:04.209> probably<00:02:04.299> even<00:02:04.539> put<00:02:04.720> it<00:02:04.810> in<00:02:04.869> the

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
we could probably even put it in the

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:07.469 
we could probably even put it in the
fridge<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.590> speed<00:02:06.459> the<00:02:06.610> process<00:02:06.729> up<00:02:07.179> you<00:02:07.390> know

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
fridge to speed the process up you know

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.160 
fridge to speed the process up you know
I<00:02:11.459> think<00:02:12.459> we<00:02:12.579> should<00:02:12.670> put<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:12.850> in<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.000> fridge

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
I think we should put it in the fridge

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.650 
I think we should put it in the fridge
help<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.350> cool<00:02:14.500> down<00:02:14.530> faster<00:02:15.299> all<00:02:16.299> right<00:02:16.450> we're

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
help it cool down faster all right we're

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.729 
help it cool down faster all right we're
going<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.810> put<00:02:16.930> this<00:02:16.989> in<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.200> fridge<00:02:17.350> we<00:02:17.680> are

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.750 

alright<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:29.739> we've<00:02:30.010> loved<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.280> refrigerate

said<00:04:23.099> that<00:04:23.460> you<00:04:23.639> can<00:04:23.849> add<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.479> couple<00:04:25.110> drops<00:04:25.229> of

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
said that you can add a couple drops of

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.219 
said that you can add a couple drops of
essential<00:04:26.009> oil<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.880> make<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.180> smell<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:27.990> or

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
essential oil to make it smell and or

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.740 
essential oil to make it smell and or
taste<00:04:28.919> better<00:04:29.310> like<00:04:29.669> she<00:04:29.940> added<00:04:30.270> orange

taste better like she added orange
essential<00:04:31.530> oil<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:31.979> so<00:04:32.699> I<00:04:32.729> think<00:04:33.000> that

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150
