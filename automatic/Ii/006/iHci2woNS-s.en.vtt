00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.850 
talk a little bit about the evolution of
that<00:01:33.659> for<00:01:33.869> stroke<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.259> mean<00:01:34.409> back<00:01:34.590> when<00:01:34.619> you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
that for stroke I mean back when you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.010 
that for stroke I mean back when you
started<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.939> know<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.240> was<00:01:36.360> two<00:01:36.540> strokes<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
started you know it was two strokes and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.480 
started you know it was two strokes and
i'm<00:01:37.079> sure<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.350> wrote<00:01:37.470> some<00:01:37.770> four<00:01:37.979> strokes<00:01:38.250> but

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
i'm sure you wrote some four strokes but

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.190 
i'm sure you wrote some four strokes but
and<00:01:38.700> i<00:01:38.970> know<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.180> write<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> four<00:01:39.689> stroke<00:01:39.930> now<00:01:40.170> I

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
and i know you write a four stroke now I

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.880 
and i know you write a four stroke now I
mean<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.270> evolution<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.890> motorcycle

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
mean the evolution of that motorcycle

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.020 
mean the evolution of that motorcycle
the<00:01:44.009> 450<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.790> phenomenal<00:01:45.299> yeah<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.409> know<00:01:46.530> it

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
the 450 just phenomenal yeah you know it

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.749 
the 450 just phenomenal yeah you know it
before<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.720> early<00:01:49.079> 70s<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.890> was<00:01:49.950> all<00:01:50.369> in

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
before the early 70s it was all in

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.850 
before the early 70s it was all in
Europe<00:01:51.509> before<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.990> sport<00:01:52.259> even<00:01:52.500> came<00:01:52.680> to

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
Europe before the sport even came to

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.490 
Europe before the sport even came to
America<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.520> was<00:01:54.030> all<00:01:54.210> four<00:01:54.630> strokes<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.200> then

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
America it was all four strokes and then

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.100 
America it was all four strokes and then
in<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> early<00:01:55.979> 70s<00:01:56.759> late<00:01:56.939> 60s<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.659> converted

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
in the early 70s late 60s it converted

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.690 
in the early 70s late 60s it converted
over<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.350> strokes<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.159> course<00:01:59.340> he<00:01:59.430> remain

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
over to strokes and of course he remain

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.630 
over to strokes and of course he remain
that<00:01:59.939> way<00:01:59.969> until<00:02:00.860> Doug<00:02:01.860> Henry<00:02:02.070> started<00:02:02.549> to

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
that way until Doug Henry started to

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.649 
that way until Doug Henry started to
ride<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.939> four-stroke<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.540> win<00:02:03.630> a

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
ride the four-stroke and win a

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.270 
ride the four-stroke and win a
championship<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.500> then<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.770> all<00:02:04.860> went<00:02:05.040> back

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
championship and then it all went back

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.359 
championship and then it all went back
to<00:02:05.430> four<00:02:05.610> stroke<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.119> it's<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.780> kind<00:02:07.020> of

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
to four stroke so it's it's kind of

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.999 
to four stroke so it's it's kind of
weird<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.759> went<00:02:09.119> back<00:02:09.929> again<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.890> know

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
weird that it went back again you know

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.240 
weird that it went back again you know
but<00:02:11.280> yeah<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.910> fourth<00:02:12.150> strokes<00:02:12.450> is

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
but yeah the fourth strokes is

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.810 
but yeah the fourth strokes is
so<00:02:13.520> much<00:02:13.760> more<00:02:14.650> power<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.010> ground<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:16.580> the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
so much more power to the ground is the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.180 
so much more power to the ground is the
big<00:02:17.000> thing<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:18.200> low<00:02:18.380> end<00:02:18.590> torque<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:19.130> the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
big thing and the low end torque and the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.120 
big thing and the low end torque and the
smooth<00:02:19.580> linear<00:02:20.360> power<00:02:20.720> makes<00:02:21.710> it<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:21.950> lot

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
smooth linear power makes it a lot

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.210 
smooth linear power makes it a lot
easier<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.550> ride<00:02:23.110> we<00:02:24.110> heard<00:02:24.350> from<00:02:24.530> gary<00:02:24.800> sinise

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
easier to ride we heard from gary sinise

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.470 
easier to ride we heard from gary sinise

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
CC two-stroke class that wasn't how long

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.910 
CC two-stroke class that wasn't how long
ago<00:02:32.030> was<00:02:32.240> it<00:02:32.300> really<00:02:32.780> i<00:02:32.810> was<00:02:32.930> just<00:02:33.140> good<00:02:33.560> just

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
ago was it really i was just good just

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.560 
ago was it really i was just good just
it<00:02:34.250> was<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.490> other<00:02:34.610> day<00:02:34.760> wasn't<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.270> seems

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
it was the other day wasn't it seems

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.959 
it was the other day wasn't it seems
like<00:02:35.780> yeah
