my<00:00:19.680> last<00:00:19.890> video<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.850> had<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.150> get<00:00:21.300> new<00:00:21.330> co2

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
my last video is I had to get new co2

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.800 
my last video is I had to get new co2
tank<00:00:22.439> because<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.699> hydrostatic

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
tank because the hydrostatic

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.419 
tank because the hydrostatic
kegerator<00:00:25.710> tank<00:00:26.300> was<00:00:27.300> expired<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:29.070> couldn't

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
kegerator tank was expired so I couldn't

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.130 
kegerator tank was expired so I couldn't
really<00:00:29.519> wait<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:30.420> picked<00:00:30.869> up<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.109> new

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
really wait and I just picked up a new

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.440 
really wait and I just picked up a new
co2<00:00:32.070> tank<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.489> my<00:00:32.579> local<00:00:33.260> paintball<00:00:34.260> shop<00:00:34.590> and

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
co2 tank for my local paintball shop and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.910 
co2 tank for my local paintball shop and
with<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> couple<00:00:36.719> adapters<00:00:37.110> from<00:00:37.260> Home<00:00:37.380> Depot<00:00:37.710> I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
with a couple adapters from Home Depot I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.459 
with a couple adapters from Home Depot I
made<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.820> work<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.300> wasn't<00:00:39.690> maybe<00:00:39.960> ten<00:00:40.290> bucks

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
made it work I wasn't maybe ten bucks

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.860 
made it work I wasn't maybe ten bucks
worth<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.800> stuff<00:00:42.200> the<00:00:43.200> regulator<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:44.329> a<00:00:45.329> reef

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
worth of stuff the regulator is a reef

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.369 
worth of stuff the regulator is a reef
fanatic<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> solenoid<00:00:47.399> switch<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.379> I

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
fanatic with a solenoid switch and I

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.130 
fanatic with a solenoid switch and I
also<00:00:49.530> picked<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.280> bubble<00:00:50.910> counter<00:00:51.140> along

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
also picked up this bubble counter along

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.260 
also picked up this bubble counter along
with<00:00:52.350> their<00:00:52.739> high<00:00:53.070> viscosity<00:00:53.280> bubble<00:00:53.969> fluid

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
with their high viscosity bubble fluid

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.270 
with their high viscosity bubble fluid
which<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.289> all<00:00:55.379> honesty<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.829> probably<00:00:56.129> just

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
which in all honesty is probably just

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.430 
which in all honesty is probably just
some<00:00:56.489> sort<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.850> thick<00:00:57.539> oil<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.050> what<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.320> looked

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
some sort of thick oil is what it looked

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.330 
some sort of thick oil is what it looked
like<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.750> I<00:01:00.750> got<00:01:00.930> about<00:01:01.140> 10<00:01:01.469> feet<00:01:01.680> worth<00:01:01.980> of

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
like and I got about 10 feet worth of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.760 
like and I got about 10 feet worth of
their<00:01:02.609> high<00:01:03.449> duty<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:04.350> heavy<00:01:04.619> duty<00:01:04.710> co2<00:01:05.400> tubing

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
their high duty or heavy duty co2 tubing

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.350 
their high duty or heavy duty co2 tubing
which<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.890> much<00:01:08.100> beefier<00:01:08.490> than<00:01:08.760> say<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
which is much beefier than say the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.219 
which is much beefier than say the
regular<00:01:10.320> airline<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.860> get<00:01:11.010> at<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> pet<00:01:11.310> store

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
regular airline you get at the pet store

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.060 
regular airline you get at the pet store
right<00:01:13.790> now<00:01:14.790> I'm<00:01:15.180> sort<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.509> playing<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:16.070> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
right now I'm sort of playing with the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.670 
right now I'm sort of playing with the
bubble<00:01:17.369> count<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:18.320> versus<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> bubble

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
bubble count here versus the bubble

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.330 
bubble count here versus the bubble
count<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.369> up<00:01:20.820> at<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.060> diffuser<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.340> I'm

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
count that is up at the diffuser and I'm

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.679 
count that is up at the diffuser and I'm
just<00:01:23.670> trying<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.150> feel<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:26.479> what<00:01:27.479> rate

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
just trying to get a feel for what rate

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.969 
just trying to get a feel for what rate
I<00:01:27.720> should<00:01:27.930> be<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.439> don't<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.740> pH

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
I should be going out I don't have a pH

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.660 
I should be going out I don't have a pH
controller<00:01:29.369> right<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:31.549> everything<00:01:32.549> is

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
controller right now so everything is

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.190 
controller right now so everything is
sort<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> regulated<00:01:33.600> or<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.810> should<00:01:34.020> say

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
sort of regulated or I should say

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.109 
sort of regulated or I should say
switched<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:34.979> off<00:01:35.070> via<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> solenoid

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
switched on and off via the solenoid

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.830 
switched on and off via the solenoid
through<00:01:36.780> my<00:01:36.960> light<00:01:37.259> timer<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.540> so<00:01:39.540> far<00:01:39.780> I'm

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
through my light timer and so far I'm

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.390 
through my light timer and so far I'm
pretty<00:01:39.869> happy<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.259> set<00:01:40.530> up<00:01:40.619> right<00:01:41.040> now<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.280> is

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
pretty happy to set up right now this is

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.240 
pretty happy to set up right now this is
sort<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.790> mock<00:01:42.000> setup<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.979> didn't

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
sort of just a mock setup and I didn't

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.200 
sort of just a mock setup and I didn't
have<00:01:44.460> everything<00:01:44.990> in<00:01:45.990> my<00:01:46.700> case<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.970> want

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
have everything in my case like I want

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.440 
have everything in my case like I want
it<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:48.630> it'll<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.020> there<00:01:49.140> eventually

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.480 

so<00:01:53.450> up<00:01:53.750> top<00:01:53.990> here<00:01:54.200> we<00:01:54.380> have<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.740> sintered

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
so up top here we have the sintered

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.400 
so up top here we have the sintered
glass<00:01:55.700> diffuser<00:01:56.380> which<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:57.620> a<00:01:57.920> mr.<00:01:58.430> aquatic

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
glass diffuser which is a mr. aquatic

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.340 
glass diffuser which is a mr. aquatic
which<00:02:00.410> I<00:02:00.500> also<00:02:00.620> got<00:02:00.830> off<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:01.130> cave<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:03.140> think

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
which I also got off a cave and I think

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.690 
which I also got off a cave and I think
it<00:02:03.410> does<00:02:03.500> a<00:02:03.530> pretty<00:02:03.620> good<00:02:03.740> job<00:02:03.860> fairly<00:02:04.550> happy

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
it does a pretty good job fairly happy

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.150 
it does a pretty good job fairly happy
with<00:02:04.910> it<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:06.140> only<00:02:06.290> thing<00:02:06.350> I<00:02:06.530> have<00:02:06.620> to<00:02:06.650> say<00:02:06.890> and

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
with it the only thing I have to say and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.600 
with it the only thing I have to say and
this<00:02:07.310> is<00:02:07.490> my<00:02:07.610> first<00:02:08.080> co2<00:02:09.080> system<00:02:09.470> setup<00:02:09.710> so<00:02:10.580> I

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
this is my first co2 system setup so I

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.730 
this is my first co2 system setup so I
notice<00:02:10.910> that<00:02:11.120> when<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.900> pressure<00:02:12.170> with<00:02:12.680> a

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
notice that when the pressure with a

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.200 
notice that when the pressure with a

something<00:02:38.510> I'm<00:02:38.600> trying<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.960> figure<00:02:39.110> out<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:40.610> if

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
something I'm trying to figure out so if

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.600 
something I'm trying to figure out so if
you<00:02:40.790> have<00:02:40.880> any<00:02:41.000> advice<00:02:41.090> let<00:02:41.450> me<00:02:41.540> know<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:43.430> only

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
you have any advice let me know the only

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.000 
you have any advice let me know the only
thing<00:02:43.700> I<00:02:43.880> could<00:02:44.030> say<00:02:44.240> is<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.860> when<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:45.920> was

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
thing I could say is that when I was

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.320 
thing I could say is that when I was
putting<00:02:46.220> my<00:02:46.280> system<00:02:46.550> together<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:50.120> little

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
putting my system together this little

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.700 
putting my system together this little
trick<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:51.410> find<00:02:51.650> air<00:02:51.830> leaks<00:02:52.300> use<00:02:53.300> Windex<00:02:53.840> or<00:02:54.440> I

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
trick to find air leaks use Windex or I

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.840 
trick to find air leaks use Windex or I
should<00:02:54.920> say<00:02:55.070> weeks<00:02:56.140> if<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.650> spray<00:02:57.980> Windex<00:02:58.520> on

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
should say weeks if you spray Windex on

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.310 
should say weeks if you spray Windex on
your<00:02:58.940> fittings<00:02:59.270> obviously<00:02:59.780> not<00:02:59.930> near<00:03:00.140> the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
your fittings obviously not near the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.670 
your fittings obviously not near the
water<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:02.150> mine<00:03:02.390> at<00:03:02.600> your<00:03:02.750> tank<00:03:03.080> but<00:03:03.380> what

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
water to mine at your tank but what

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.229 
water to mine at your tank but what
happens<00:03:03.980> is<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.190> Windex<00:03:04.459> will<00:03:04.640> bubble<00:03:04.790> up<00:03:05.000> and

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
happens is the Windex will bubble up and

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.350 
happens is the Windex will bubble up and
I<00:03:06.020> had<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.230> go<00:03:06.350> back<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.940> tighten<00:03:07.940> some<00:03:08.209> of<00:03:08.270> my

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
I had to go back and tighten some of my

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.229 
I had to go back and tighten some of my
fittings<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.370> use<00:03:10.370> teflon<00:03:10.760> tape<00:03:11.000> where<00:03:11.180> I

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
fittings and use teflon tape where I

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.810 
fittings and use teflon tape where I
didn't<00:03:11.570> before<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:12.410> get<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.680> proper<00:03:13.160> seal<00:03:13.640> on

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
didn't before to get a proper seal on

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.990 
didn't before to get a proper seal on
everything<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:15.020> just<00:03:15.050> a<00:03:15.470> word<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.950> wise<00:03:16.940> I

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
everything so just a word to the wise I

00:03:17.000 --> 00:04:04.380 
everything so just a word to the wise I
suppose<00:03:18.130> check<00:03:19.130> for<00:03:19.310> leaks

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.150 

so<00:04:04.990> this<00:04:05.140> sort<00:04:05.320> of<00:04:05.380> brings<00:04:05.590> me<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.980> my<00:04:06.100> next

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
so this sort of brings me to my next
