00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:25.699
 a lot of pleasure 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.150
 so to turn to someone who works a lot 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.250
 this is the fourth man says catherine who ends 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.790
 his training but that ended his life change with the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.139

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:35.940
 the ball 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.139
 how long have you been practicing this sport 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.999
 I practiced a crs for ten years now 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:42.810
 what was he 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.379
 your motors 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.819
 the science institute and clear goals and that I had left my father 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.989
 years 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.950
 it's a sport that you want my feeling I asked who asks 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.199
 a lot of time for a little bit of writing your daily how is it going 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.009
 it's a training ground per week 21 hours 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.009
 but he knows that m and then that's it 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:05.199
 the news with the smile the series is deeper of the world 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.759
 why 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:11.829
 but it's a very complete sport that combines both dynamism and 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.119
 cancers 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:14.719
 precisely in the city 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.979
 when I preferred you to work 7th 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:19.480
 the ball of the head on a corner 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.799
 chewing 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.899
 private houses for that 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.039
 not particularly in the country 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.960
 I let you continue to train us 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.690
 we will turn to adolphe now for 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.490
 understand more what happens in the French community with that 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.880
 rhythmic gymnastics you can make us hear a picture of this sport 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.449
 with us 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.049
 yes if we want to degrease 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.689
 a brief overview of rhythmic gymnastics 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.689
 to the French speaking gymnastics federation 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.579
 to be established on four distinct 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.139
 the part that I called pot level 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.540
 for them it is the gyms that is getting ready 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.250
 especially international competition this represents about twenty 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.539
 participating 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:02.559
 division 3 4 5 that is to say the gymnasts who compete 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:05.919
 French or national 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.739
 which represents 150 participants 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.689
 finally the money 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.800
 which represents about 500 people 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.219
 like all preparations for the international strata 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:20.509
 and finally to all readers who also practice gymnastics 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.059
 rhythmic hobbies 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:25.479
 yet the four huge portraits evidence an unemployment rate the most 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.409
 high than to evolve this sport at home 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.599
 how can we please and I think in the club 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.749
 from 20 to 25 people even that's the maximum 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:39.340
 that the only possibility to evolve again is a high level center 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.340
 where we could actually practice Monday training 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.020
 the morning 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.120
 at the end of the day 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.490
 here is a well-filled program if you want to know more about this sport 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.620
 three times w and points 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.229
 reflexology the point of others 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.060
 and we men are the only reason to practice this wonderful sport 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.050
 he must go to Japan 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.620
 it can be simple with the make sure that we rediscover the leather
