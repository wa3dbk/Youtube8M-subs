00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.909
 This is a lot changed and so on 

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.909
 Dusseldorf piece by piece, of course, the team clearly 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.850
 July Serbia against Ghana actually file as have the first training session 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.210
 marketplace 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.409
 happy people quite big so to speak percent 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.489
 To be made in his own way is guaranteed by Porsche 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.609
 the rhythm of the exercise induces 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.830
 Exercises of course come first minivan that the shelter 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.880
 try to play much faster 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.040
 Round continued to defend aggressively just over the whole 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.200
 and yes after this first violation against ereicht must make «especially since we relatively 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.940
 quickly had a player 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.350
 but now I will be the next player in the second training session 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.610
 time this week 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.430
 to go into more detail 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.770
 but then of course you will notice more and more of his plans of Salma 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.800
 Hayek 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.540
 but there is still a lot to be done where they play offensively 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.810
 is now exposed again first 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.110
 a bit more of the riding Veldhoven 10 m will be from 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.450
 game systems 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.780
 from last year 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.200
 that will be some 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.790
 new game systems 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.390
 have come to it 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.730
 certainly most changes and will always be moral again 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.729
 surpassed further 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.430
 have gotten two at Alice as self-defense 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.900
 Mario Franke from the harpist sure to pair everything 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.520
 he consumes for the first time against St 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.010
 applied that was born in war is variable defend that Werder 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.550
 on 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.530
 very aggressive 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.810
 For example, percent defended against it 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.180
 and so on yesterday at the bar and rehearsed another 5 1-variant 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.340
 So everything is very variable in the direction 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.570
 always defending with six years flows 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.159
 yes he also has some players numbers classifier wanted me out says offers 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:01:59.850
 leave 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.390
 how that is different now to prepare for the new opponents yes, too 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.150
 entertain games prepare game system 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.650
 all around 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.679
 that was it so that we sat down 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.019
 literally Meerbusch 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.279
 gone through 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:17.379
 Pauli's offer says what we believe in what's so easy Monday 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.720
 partly also worked well and we have decades 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.529
 Volatile was playing under% copper and percent 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:28.539
 Meyer even a friend audience probably abroad, no wonder 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.469
 up to 50 times out again 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.359
 we have to expect daffodils of course very very important game what 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.349
 we have or that means we are also very aware and give advice 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.900
 Of course, the goal for the rest of a song must be no home game 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.599
 to lose 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.319
 and so the prohibition of their natural very demanding opponents on us 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.289
 waited a bit problematic himself 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:56.269
 but the impression of the player material has enough potential and has been dealing with it ever since 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:03:00.229
 Whatever ours the car can certainly learn 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.229
 try our games Arx out 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.019
 continue to establish and what we have done well until 30 minutes again 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.739
 maybe her husband whole game percent reach me that we can 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.049
 Want to be a team 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.379
 This team attacks the opponent Store itself is attacked 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.529
 at 0 1 percent a year simply that aggression / Görges process 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:25.429
 To determine the game speed level yourself before playing against 8 votes 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.950
 otherwise what you can expect from the beginning as I said that is very very strong 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.029
 my head is allowed around 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:34.739
 So with percent evening 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.889
 OHRIS Hampel but on ten balls in fourth gave to that it certainly so 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:39.729
 your 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.729
 their most important percent 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.549
 but, of course, know that it will be able to do it again as well 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.180
 do true sense of the word and now Tim Ohlbrecht also not neglected 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.929
 As a result of this, Sotomo will have to go away again 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:57.459
 Component won so that in which very very serious 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.699
 Dr in spite of their problems because we put weir 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.879
 In the evening, I believe then but the ps2 three training days the better 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.799
 Have preparation 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:08.319
 the protocol
