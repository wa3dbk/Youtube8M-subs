differences with this club over our

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.580 
differences with this club over our
competitors<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:15.270> section<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.140> tub<00:01:16.560> is

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
competitors this section of the tub is

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.160 
competitors this section of the tub is
actually<00:01:16.979> quite<00:01:17.310> big<00:01:17.670> compared<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.450> some

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
actually quite big compared to some

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.959 
actually quite big compared to some
other<00:01:19.259> tubs<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.159> that's<00:01:20.310> fundamentally

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
other tubs and that's fundamentally

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.060 
other tubs and that's fundamentally
because<00:01:21.030> we've<00:01:21.270> tried<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.630> grow<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.560> surface

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
because we've tried to grow this surface

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.770 
because we've tried to grow this surface
out<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.609> there's<00:01:23.759> no<00:01:23.909> additional<00:01:24.359> bodywork

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
out so there's no additional bodywork

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.440 
out so there's no additional bodywork
and<00:01:24.929> this<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.140> actually<00:01:25.969> aerodynamic<00:01:26.969> surface

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and this is actually aerodynamic surface

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.700 
and this is actually aerodynamic surface
there's<00:01:27.899> no<00:01:28.369> clutch<00:01:29.369> table<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.880> driver

some quick release buttons here so

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.380 
some quick release buttons here so
there's<00:01:53.069> a<00:01:53.130> problem<00:01:53.249> we<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.939> actually<00:01:54.240> get

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
there's a problem we can actually get

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.969 
there's a problem we can actually get

safety measure that was introduced a few
years<00:02:19.709> back<00:02:19.950> which<00:02:20.250> was<00:02:20.400> designed<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.970> help

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
years back which was designed to help

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.760 
years back which was designed to help
stop<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.780> car<00:02:21.959> from

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
stop the car from

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.440 
stop the car from
turning<00:02:23.070> over<00:02:23.190> fuel<00:02:23.730> filler<00:02:23.940> here<00:02:24.120> there's

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
turning over fuel filler here there's

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.960 
turning over fuel filler here there's
one<00:02:24.570> of<00:02:24.870> these<00:02:25.020> on<00:02:25.200> either<00:02:25.410> side<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:25.980> one<00:02:26.700> side

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
one of these on either side and one side

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.850 
one of these on either side and one side
is<00:02:27.000> for<00:02:27.420> filling<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.260> fuel<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.710> other

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
is for filling the fuel and the other

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.230 
is for filling the fuel and the other
side<00:02:29.070> is<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.310> breathe<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.700> air<00:02:29.790> out<00:02:29.970> whilst

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
side is to breathe the air out whilst

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.820 
side is to breathe the air out whilst
you're<00:02:30.450> filling<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.080> can<00:02:31.290> fill<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.620> tank

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
you're filling so you can fill the tank

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.890 
you're filling so you can fill the tank
very<00:02:32.040> quickly<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.790> see<00:02:33.000> these<00:02:33.240> two<00:02:33.660> shapes

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
very quickly you see these two shapes

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.590 
very quickly you see these two shapes
here<00:02:34.200> battery<00:02:34.800> fits<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.340> from<00:02:35.550> underneath<00:02:35.790> and

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
here battery fits in from underneath and

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.420 
here battery fits in from underneath and
you<00:02:36.690> have<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.020> calling<00:02:37.770> hoses<00:02:38.100> which<00:02:38.280> are

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
you have to calling hoses which are

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.640 
you have to calling hoses which are
coming<00:02:38.640> out<00:02:38.730> through<00:02:38.970> here<00:02:39.150> fuel<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:40.050> being

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
coming out through here fuel is being

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.890 
coming out through here fuel is being
fed<00:02:40.860> from<00:02:41.010> here<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.520> then<00:02:42.210> this<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.570> pitch<00:02:42.720> it

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.000 
here is where the high-voltage battery
cables<00:02:46.080> will<00:02:46.200> come<00:02:46.380> out<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.740> then<00:02:46.860> they'll

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
cables will come out and then they'll

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.220 
cables will come out and then they'll
sweep<00:02:47.310> round<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.420> motor<00:02:48.720> controller

the<00:03:01.410> rack<00:03:02.340> low<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.760> we're<00:03:02.880> really<00:03:03.090> trying<00:03:03.330> to

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
the rack low and we're really trying to

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.660 
the rack low and we're really trying to
utilize<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:04.710> underfloor<00:03:05.220> as<00:03:05.340> much<00:03:05.520> as

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
utilize the underfloor as much as

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.510 
utilize the underfloor as much as
possible<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:06.150> generate<00:03:06.270> all<00:03:06.600> over<00:03:06.780> downforce

possible to generate all over downforce

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.620

theoretically<00:03:08.520> this<00:03:08.760> car<00:03:09.000> will<00:03:09.360> generate

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
theoretically this car will generate

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.390 
theoretically this car will generate
enough<00:03:09.900> downforce<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.710> you<00:03:10.830> could<00:03:11.010> drive<00:03:11.340> it

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
enough downforce that you could drive it

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.750 
enough downforce that you could drive it
