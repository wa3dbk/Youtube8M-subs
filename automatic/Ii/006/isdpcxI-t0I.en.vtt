difference is on these guys are very

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.170 
difference is on these guys are very
very<00:01:03.949> minimal<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:05.939> comes<00:01:06.119> down

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
very minimal really it just comes down

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.870 
very minimal really it just comes down
to<00:01:06.330> size<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> blade<00:01:07.530> length<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
to size so the blade length here on the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.730 
to size so the blade length here on the
mini<00:01:09.030> grip<00:01:09.210> tell<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.450> first<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.720> all<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.020> just

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
mini grip tell you first of all is just

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.700 
mini grip tell you first of all is just
under<00:01:10.920> three<00:01:11.159> inches<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.460> think<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:12.710> two

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
under three inches I think it's like two

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.289 
under three inches I think it's like two
point<00:01:13.920> nine<00:01:14.130> five<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.760> something<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.150> that

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
point nine five or something like that

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.840 
point nine five or something like that
on<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:16.020> full-size<00:01:16.229> you're<00:01:17.159> looking<00:01:17.460> at<00:01:17.580> three

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
on the full-size you're looking at three

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.030 
on the full-size you're looking at three
point<00:01:18.090> four<00:01:18.420> five<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.930> basically<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> half<00:01:19.740> inch

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
point four five so basically a half inch

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.740 
point four five so basically a half inch
difference<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.150> blade<00:01:21.360> length<00:01:21.570> which

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
difference in blade length which

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.390 
difference in blade length which
actually<00:01:22.259> isn't<00:01:22.439> very<00:01:22.650> much<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.310> you

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
actually isn't very much when you

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.880 
actually isn't very much when you
consider<00:01:23.759> how<00:01:24.450> much<00:01:24.509> larger<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> full-sized

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
consider how much larger the full-sized

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.399 
consider how much larger the full-sized
grip<00:01:26.130> telling<00:01:26.430> really<00:01:26.850> looks<00:01:27.290> compared<00:01:28.290> to

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
grip telling really looks compared to

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.649 
grip telling really looks compared to
the<00:01:28.500> mini<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.770> half<00:01:29.009> inch<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.520> blade<00:01:30.240> length<00:01:30.450> is

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the mini a half inch on blade length is

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.370 
the mini a half inch on blade length is
really<00:01:31.170> very<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.759> whole<00:01:33.150> lot<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.750> whole

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
really very not a whole lot of a whole

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.090 
really very not a whole lot of a whole
lot<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.729> cutting<00:01:35.729> edge<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:37.100> interestingly

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
lot of cutting edge so interestingly

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.800 
lot of cutting edge so interestingly
enough<00:01:39.829> they're<00:01:40.829> running<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> same<00:01:41.340> steel

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
enough they're running the same steel

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.660 
enough they're running the same steel
you're<00:01:42.810> running<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.079> same<00:01:43.200> steel<00:01:43.670> basically

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
you're running the same steel basically

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.249 
you're running the same steel basically
the<00:01:44.790> same<00:01:45.000> grind<00:01:45.360> now<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.840> also<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the same grind now there is also the

in<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.549> back<00:02:05.759> there<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.799> can<00:02:07.799> see<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.220> has

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
in the back there you can see it has

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.050 
in the back there you can see it has
liners<00:02:09.720> only<00:02:10.349> up<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.679> about<00:02:10.890> here

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
liners only up to about here

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.180 
liners only up to about here
and<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.690> liner<00:02:12.959> itself<00:02:13.230> kind<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.739> tapers<00:02:14.160> down

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
and the liner itself kind of tapers down

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.190 
and the liner itself kind of tapers down
here<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:14.849> there's<00:02:15.030> there's<00:02:15.630> actually<00:02:15.959> plastic

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
here so there's there's actually plastic

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.110 
here so there's there's actually plastic
there<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.860> way<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.459> back<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.060> see

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120

there and way in the back you can see
the<00:02:18.360> line<00:02:19.819> where<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.970> liner<00:02:21.209> comes<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:21.720> it

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
the line where the liner comes so it

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.890 
the line where the liner comes so it
kind<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.080> from<00:02:22.770> here<00:02:23.010> kind<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.370> tapers<00:02:23.790> down<00:02:23.900> to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
kind of from here kind of tapers down to

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.680 
kind of from here kind of tapers down to
there<00:02:25.250> interestingly<00:02:26.250> enough<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.060> kind<00:02:27.569> of

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
there interestingly enough I I kind of

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.650 
there interestingly enough I I kind of
spent<00:02:28.020> some<00:02:28.140> time<00:02:28.319> looking<00:02:28.470> at<00:02:28.739> these<00:02:28.860> two<00:02:29.130> and

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
spent some time looking at these two and

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.540 
spent some time looking at these two and
you'll<00:02:30.660> find<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.769> since<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.099> liner<00:02:32.310> only

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
you'll find that since the liner only

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.940 
you'll find that since the liner only
comes<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.940> there<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.810> actual<00:02:34.170> liners<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
comes to there the actual liners the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.470 
comes to there the actual liners the
steel<00:02:35.190> liners<00:02:35.550> on<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.760> mini<00:02:35.970> group<00:02:36.090> tailing

steel liners on the mini group tailing

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.290 
steel liners on the mini group tailing
are<00:02:36.630> larger<00:02:37.349> than<00:02:38.130> on<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.610> full-sized<00:02:39.030> script

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
are larger than on the full-sized script

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.949 
are larger than on the full-sized script
ileum<00:02:39.599> which<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:41.340> kind<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.790> weird<00:02:41.970> the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.599 
really nicely gripped and on the full

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
a lot smoother and so you don't get as

they took this small check ring and
applied<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.650> large<00:03:58.920> handle<00:03:59.400> because

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
applied it to the large handle because

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.259 
applied it to the large handle because
the<00:04:00.900> larger<00:04:01.319> one<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:01.889> not<00:04:02.250> as<00:04:02.489> aggressive

the larger one is is not as aggressive

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
now the full-size one does fit better in
