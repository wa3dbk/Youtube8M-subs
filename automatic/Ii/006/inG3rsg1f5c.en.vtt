00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
I doubt that so what for real clean

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.499 
I doubt that so what for real clean
there<00:00:28.540> but<00:00:29.540> I<00:00:29.570> do<00:00:29.660> like<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:30.050> idea<00:00:30.410> so<00:00:31.360> not<00:00:32.360> only

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
there but I do like the idea so not only

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.830 
there but I do like the idea so not only
can<00:00:32.809> you<00:00:32.870> put<00:00:33.110> this<00:00:33.230> in<00:00:33.290> your<00:00:33.650> transmission

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
can you put this in your transmission

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.080 
can you put this in your transmission
what<00:00:35.840> is<00:00:35.960> easy<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:36.550> comes<00:00:37.550> in<00:00:37.790> your

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
what is easy you comes in your

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.020 
what is easy you comes in your
transmission<00:00:38.690> cooler<00:00:38.960> lines<00:00:39.460> or<00:00:40.460> you<00:00:40.879> could

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
transmission cooler lines or you could

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.500 
transmission cooler lines or you could
also<00:00:41.210> use<00:00:41.660> them<00:00:42.309> on<00:00:43.309> your<00:00:43.580> power<00:00:43.879> steering

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
also use them on your power steering

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.680 
also use them on your power steering
keep<00:00:44.750> your<00:00:44.870> power<00:00:45.140> steering<00:00:45.440> a<00:00:45.769> roll<00:00:46.690> right

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
keep your power steering a roll right

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.920 
keep your power steering a roll right
there<00:00:48.519> so<00:00:49.519> it<00:00:49.610> gives<00:00:49.790> you<00:00:49.970> different<00:00:50.629> options

that's a 40 D I think this is our 400
700<00:02:27.760> our<00:02:27.880> or<00:02:28.030> something<00:02:28.299> like<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:28.600> which<00:02:29.110> is

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
transmission cooler is and then it comes

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.300 
transmission cooler is and then it comes
back<00:03:32.380> on<00:03:32.920> this<00:03:33.490> hose<00:03:33.790> up<00:03:34.120> here<00:03:37.650> up<00:03:38.650> here<00:03:38.770> that's

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
where I had to cut it in and it's the

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.900 
where I had to cut it in and it's the
only<00:03:41.050> spot<00:03:41.470> I've<00:03:41.680> better<00:03:42.280> they<00:03:42.370> had<00:03:42.459> nothing

holders to it with your hose clamps on
there<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.340> fire<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.360> up

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
there and fire it up

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:11.589 
there and fire it up

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:19.569 

so<00:04:12.140> far<00:04:12.439> so<00:04:12.680> good<00:04:18.130> now

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
so far so good now

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.650 
so far so good now
that's<00:04:19.729> supposed<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.060> be<00:04:20.180> a<00:04:20.209> lot<00:04:20.479> better

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
that's supposed to be a lot better

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.810 
that's supposed to be a lot better

but you don't have to change it as

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.590 
but you don't have to change it as
frequently<00:04:57.530> now<00:04:58.070> as<00:04:58.340> just<00:04:59.090> changing<00:04:59.150> that

frequently now as just changing that
little<00:04:59.870> filter<00:05:00.229> in<00:05:00.500> line<00:05:00.770> that's<00:05:01.039> that's

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
little filter in line that's that's

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.279 
little filter in line that's that's
where<00:05:01.789> you<00:05:01.880> go<00:05:04.510> okay<00:05:05.510> according<00:05:06.020> to<00:05:06.199> the

where you go okay according to the
paperwork<00:05:06.620> that<00:05:06.830> came<00:05:07.070> to<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.280> filter<00:05:09.610> it

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
paperwork that came to the filter it

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.590 
paperwork that came to the filter it
says<00:05:10.910> kilometers<00:05:11.720> on<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.850> actual<00:05:13.850> filter<00:05:14.180> so

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
says kilometers on the actual filter so

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.310 
says kilometers on the actual filter so
I<00:05:14.690> had<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:15.490> check<00:05:16.490> this<00:05:16.669> out<00:05:16.910> here<00:05:17.240> see<00:05:18.139> if<00:05:18.229> they

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
I had to check this out here see if they

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.629 
I had to check this out here see if they
got<00:05:18.440> in<00:05:18.620> miles<00:05:18.860> without<00:05:19.220> getting<00:05:19.580> my

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
got in miles without getting my

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.339 
got in miles without getting my
calculator<00:05:20.150> out<00:05:20.240> doing<00:05:20.630> some<00:05:20.780> kind<00:05:20.960> of<00:05:21.020> metric

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
calculator out doing some kind of metric

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.170 
calculator out doing some kind of metric
conversion<00:05:21.979> but<00:05:22.789> according<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:23.449> this<00:05:23.570> is

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
conversion but according to this is

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.640 
conversion but according to this is
install<00:05:26.180> a<00:05:26.210> new<00:05:26.330> filter<00:05:26.690> every<00:05:27.050> after<00:05:27.620> every

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
install a new filter every after every

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.710 
install a new filter every after every
overhaul<00:05:28.400> transmission<00:05:29.060> exchange<00:05:29.510> or

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
overhaul transmission exchange or

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.080 
overhaul transmission exchange or
transmission<00:05:30.199> fluid<00:05:30.680> change<00:05:30.949> or<00:05:31.250> every

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
transmission fluid change or every

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.670 
transmission fluid change or every
30,000<00:05:32.900> miles<00:05:33.050> so<00:05:33.470> I<00:05:35.410> don't<00:05:36.410> think<00:05:36.500> I'll<00:05:36.650> let

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
30,000 miles so I don't think I'll let

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.920 
30,000 miles so I don't think I'll let
it<00:05:36.830> go<00:05:37.010> through<00:05:37.220> 30,000<00:05:38.060> miles<00:05:38.210> for<00:05:38.570> a<00:05:38.599> change

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
it go through 30,000 miles for a change

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.730 
it go through 30,000 miles for a change
I'll<00:05:39.080> probably<00:05:39.289> change<00:05:39.889> it<00:05:40.010> at<00:05:40.130> 10,000<00:05:40.849> miles

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
I'll probably change it at 10,000 miles

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.600 
I'll probably change it at 10,000 miles
maybe<00:05:42.740> sooner

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:55.260

it's just right I like it all right this

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:10.860 
it's just right I like it all right this
is<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:09.490> Bronco<00:06:09.939> I<00:06:10.030> just<00:06:10.210> did<00:06:10.360> the<00:06:10.479> Bronco

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
is the Bronco I just did the Bronco

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.330 
is the Bronco I just did the Bronco
right<00:06:11.020> now<00:06:11.199> so<00:06:11.409> this<00:06:11.590> is<00:06:11.740> what<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:11.949> Bronco

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
right now so this is what the Bronco

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:22.379 
right now so this is what the Bronco
looks<00:06:12.580> like<00:06:20.009> that's<00:06:21.009> where<00:06:21.370> I<00:06:21.400> put<00:06:21.699> it<00:06:21.879> in<00:06:22.030> on

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
looks like that's where I put it in on

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:36.649 
looks like that's where I put it in on
the<00:06:22.840> Bronco<00:06:23.349> and<00:06:33.270> that's<00:06:34.270> all<00:06:34.599> there<00:06:34.840> is<00:06:34.870> to<00:06:35.319> it

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659 
the Bronco and that's all there is to it

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.540 
the Bronco and that's all there is to it
just<00:06:37.659> fewer<00:06:38.050> information<00:06:38.889> I<00:06:39.039> think<00:06:39.250> it's<00:06:39.370> good

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
just fewer information I think it's good

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.050 
just fewer information I think it's good
idea<00:06:39.699> a<00:06:40.919> whole<00:06:41.919> lot<00:06:42.129> easier<00:06:42.310> changing<00:06:42.940> out

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
idea a whole lot easier changing out

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.939 
idea a whole lot easier changing out
that<00:06:43.270> little<00:06:43.569> filter<00:06:43.960> inlined<00:06:44.409> and<00:06:44.710> pulling

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:44.949 
that little filter inlined and pulling

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:54.760 
that little filter inlined and pulling
the<00:06:45.039> pan<00:06:45.279> out<00:06:45.900> cool<00:06:46.900> in<00:06:46.990> the<00:06:47.050> pan

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.379 

and<00:06:55.770> it<00:06:56.039> makes<00:06:56.220> it<00:06:56.340> really<00:06:56.580> simple<00:06:56.759> since<00:06:57.270> I've

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:57.389 
and it makes it really simple since I've

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:00.350 
and it makes it really simple since I've
got<00:06:57.599> a<00:06:57.629> drain<00:06:58.460> I've<00:06:59.460> got<00:06:59.639> a<00:06:59.669> drain<00:06:59.879> plug<00:07:00.090> on

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
got a drain I've got a drain plug on

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.469 
got a drain I've got a drain plug on
both<00:07:00.509> transmissions<00:07:03.710> drain<00:07:04.710> the<00:07:04.860> oil<00:07:05.449> pop<00:07:06.449> a

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 
both transmissions drain the oil pop a

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:09.140 
both transmissions drain the oil pop a
new<00:07:06.719> little<00:07:07.050> filter<00:07:07.409> in<00:07:07.590> there<00:07:07.819> ready<00:07:08.819> to<00:07:08.909> roll

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150 
new little filter in there ready to roll

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.649 
new little filter in there ready to roll
now<00:07:10.729> unfortunately<00:07:11.729> I<00:07:11.759> would<00:07:11.969> have<00:07:12.240> liked<00:07:12.479> to

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:12.659 
now unfortunately I would have liked to

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:15.469 
now unfortunately I would have liked to
have<00:07:13.139> change<00:07:13.469> though<00:07:13.789> put<00:07:14.789> that<00:07:14.939> filter<00:07:15.210> in

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 
have change though put that filter in

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:17.209 
have change though put that filter in
when<00:07:15.810> I<00:07:15.840> serviced<00:07:16.319> the<00:07:16.439> transmission<00:07:17.069> which

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:17.219 
when I serviced the transmission which

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:23.290 
when I serviced the transmission which
was<00:07:17.460> like<00:07:17.729> 3,000<00:07:18.479> miles<00:07:18.629> ago

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.300 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.700 

but<00:07:24.300> these<00:07:24.449> transmissions<00:07:25.199> take<00:07:25.439> about<00:07:25.650> a

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.710 
but these transmissions take about a

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.070 
but these transmissions take about a
case<00:07:25.979> of<00:07:26.159> transmission<00:07:26.699> oil<00:07:26.819> about<00:07:27.629> 5<00:07:27.990> gallons

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 
case of transmission oil about 5 gallons

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.390 
case of transmission oil about 5 gallons
so<00:07:31.080> I<00:07:31.110> don't<00:07:31.500> want<00:07:31.650> to<00:07:31.710> waste<00:07:31.860> that<00:07:32.069> a<00:07:32.129> loyal

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 
so I don't want to waste that a loyal

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.670 
so I don't want to waste that a loyal
I'm<00:07:32.879> just<00:07:33.090> going<00:07:33.240> to<00:07:33.319> change<00:07:34.319> the<00:07:34.710> filters<00:07:36.680> I'm

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 
I'm just going to change the filters I'm

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.990 
I'm just going to change the filters I'm
going<00:07:37.860> to<00:07:37.919> change<00:07:38.159> your<00:07:38.310> filters<00:07:38.729> a<00:07:38.819> little

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 
going to change your filters a little

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.559 
going to change your filters a little
more<00:07:39.120> often

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:39.569 
more often

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:41.420 
more often
especially<00:07:40.440> the<00:07:40.530> first<00:07:40.770> one<00:07:40.979> will<00:07:41.190> let<00:07:41.400> that

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:41.430 
especially the first one will let that

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.480 
especially the first one will let that
go<00:07:41.789> in<00:07:41.940> there<00:07:42.090> for<00:07:42.300> a<00:07:42.330> few<00:07:42.419> thousand<00:07:42.930> miles<00:07:43.050> and

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:43.490 
go in there for a few thousand miles and

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.749 
go in there for a few thousand miles and
change<00:07:44.490> it<00:07:44.639> out<00:07:45.050> check<00:07:46.050> the<00:07:46.199> fluid<00:07:46.759> everything

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759

should<00:07:47.940> be<00:07:47.969> good<00:07:48.270> I<00:07:48.569> got<00:07:49.169> to<00:07:49.259> check<00:07:49.409> my<00:07:49.469> miles

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:49.949 
should be good I got to check my miles

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:52.490 
should be good I got to check my miles
