00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.840
 there is a moment in all the companies in 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.509
 the one that overwhelms them manifold and 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.980
 complicated operational processes 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.349
 innumerable transactions and many but 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.990
 many papers then questions arise 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.480
 how correct is the report that I just 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.000
 receive what is the risk we have of 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.710
 pay a large tax fine your 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.230
 company generates a large amount per month 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.390
 of contracts but they are running 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.730
 suitably the supports are 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.009
 necessary how much are we paying in 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.130
 wrong fees or how much money 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.050
 we may be losing what is evident is 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.820
 that all these processes are 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.130
 generating more headaches than 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.170
 benefits you want to improve this 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.540
 panorama but due to lack of time or 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.160
 ideas could not solve them then 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.410
 The first thing you think is that for 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.830
 everything works well you should hire more 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.930
 and more and more staff but how long 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.940
 and resources are devoting to the work 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.010
 administrative and operational your company 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.160
 how much do they spend making sense of 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.400
 information you receive 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.530
 it has to be all this so complex the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.570
 truth is that you should not only apply the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.210
 formula that successful businesses by 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.280
 strategy have adopted that is to say you 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.560
 is dedicated to what he does best and does not 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.510
 loses time or valuable resources in 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.210
 business processes that an expert 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.700
