00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.600
 and now I want to tell you a tie 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.599
 shakom is a japanese stitch 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.689
 such an old stitch nobody knows about 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.020
 her origin when she appeared but 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.329
 in Japan there is even a club sashiko 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.779
 which only quilted they do not connect 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.509
 pieces of cloth they just lash 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.279
 traditional japanese stitch this on 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.070
 dark blue indigo white thread 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.020
 thick unlike artistic 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.969
 stitches we talked about where thin 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.449
 the threads in the flower are very small 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.489
 needle 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.460
 Japanese sashka to do Sasha 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.929
 contrasting threads that is on 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.719
 let's say light fabrics with dark threads 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.969
 or vice versa on dark light fabric 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.210
 thread some quilted 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.370
 and the preparation is also absolutely the same 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.350
 also you collect sweeps away the canvas 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.219
 put some drawing stencil 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.210
 what do you need 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.129
 and then you start quilting if in 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.330
 art stitches stitch size 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.899
 there are two or three millimeters then in Japanese 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.970
 stitches Sasha to stitch width 5 6 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.430
 millimeters and the distance between them is two 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.210
 three i.e. big stitch itself big 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.960
 needle is a big thread thick this is ours 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.140
 ten 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.110
 iris floss and several layers right now 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.310
 we will start quitting also from 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.299
 mid through sintepon we spend 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.299
 needle 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.130
 mean and five to six millimeters 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:53.460
 distance and immediately immediately literally 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:56.100
 put the needle up the stitches should be 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.680
 absolutely even in this beauty of this 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.160
 stitches that stitches should be perfect 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.470
 even because if it doesn't 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.460
 the impression will be just sloppy 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.550
 some sort of sweeping waist incomprehensible 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.310
 Sasha Coves are the same empty 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.800
 squares that's how pretty you are now 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.630
 braced border turns beautiful 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.790
 work items of clothing or that's how i 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.550
 the blanket that I showed you when 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.340
 the fabric itself is not very interesting 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.690
 acquires due to sasha to such his 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.690
 very beautiful sound 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.240
 That's the way you talk about if 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.520
 you have a thread over rather 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.010
 your drawing is finished and the thread is still there 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.110
 then you pass through the thickness of the tissue and in 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.950
 the next element and about tightening 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.950
 next item 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.720
 here's a flash drive with shakom we finished it 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.800
 absolutely the same pattern as on 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.110
 artistic stitches 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.890
 I deliberately took so that even we could 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.850
 compare with you how the effect is the same 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.390
 all the same 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.190
 remove our from the label that was 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.790
 remove residues 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.040
 of our soap or chalk whichever 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.650
 than we draw recommend to apply 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.860
 special marker that disappears by itself 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.860
 by oneself 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.160
 here you are 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.170
 Here we have this picture 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:53.880
 there is already a large stitch wide bright 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.050
 if we compare that's what we had 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.390
 exactly the same picture 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.390
 but they look completely different
