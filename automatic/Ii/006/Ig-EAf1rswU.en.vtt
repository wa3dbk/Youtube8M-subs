 according to the Reuters news agency. 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.450
 zuckerberg and various institutions 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.820
 financial institutions would have 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.640
 deceived investors about the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.100
 Facebook's economic situation before

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.370
 billions of dollars superbug is accused of 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.159
 have omitted internal projections on 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.350
 possible reductions in site revenue 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.500
 In addition, the information 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.390
 what zuckerberg would be about to sell 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.790

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.759
 facebook for tax reasons 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.340
 marvel forced the aeromec factory to 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.080
 close your kickstarter campaign by 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.030
 copyright infringement 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.610
 for those who do not know this is a company 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.130
 that has created a project of one 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.409
 replica of the iron man's armor and 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.659
 sought to finance the idea through the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.520
 that you are having that site that helps 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.880
 finance different projects 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.430
 now the company can not continue with the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.140
 idea then who was celebrating the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.090
 who was finding it cool that he could 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.189
 to be an iron man's armor can 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.060
 Forget the marvel ended the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.780
 Just kidding 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.540
 bmw and 8 can have a key that is so 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.880
 cool as the car itself this car 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.049
 technologies that respect the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.659
 environment 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.570
 the bieber faial site states that the key 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.969
 will have a high resolution lcd screen 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.429
 which displays information related to the 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.530
 load on the vehicle and the distance 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.560
 possible to go through before making a 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.500
 replenishment 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.180
 the accessory will be customizable each time 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.250
 button may have its function 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.020
 we note that this car is still in 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.700
 conceptual phase 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.550
 so it's still not sure if it really 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.010
 will have a nice key like this 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.599
 tizen mobile system developed by 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.670
 samsung and intel 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.489
 apparently it is getting more expensive 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.069
 modern with websites is node neighborhood disclosed 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.970
 several images supposedly see this 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.040
 system 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.180
 they show that the interface seems 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.549
 better with more details and more colors 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.459
 some spelling mistakes but there is a 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.709
 theoretical explanation for these errors 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.540
 be attributed to the fact that the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.030
 system is not yet fully 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.670
 translated into English or to other 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.099
 languages players point many 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.000
 problems in san andrÃ©s version for 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.090
 android 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.310
 the game is paid cost 7 dollars but he 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.769
 does not recognize a legitimate version and 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.959
 prevents the device from falling under the 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.870
 of the files needed to play 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.359
 criticisms of size are so great that the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.709
 received only one star from the 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.380
 playstation store users 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.390
 The criticism of the players is so 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.459
 the game received only one star 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.620
 google places user review 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.470
