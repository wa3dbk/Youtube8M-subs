 day of veron with a very good tweet 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:24.550
 it's called good touch we're going to 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.550
 install it we have to enter Syria 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.220
 well we are already in good here we go and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.790
 we are inside of him we are going to where 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.739
 he says driving here we are driving 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.920
 we enter sources we give you edit 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.040
 add we are going to have to add a 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.210
 source inside laziness 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.210
 with M 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.450
 along with these he rebuked 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.239
 these 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.910
 Do not worry, I'm going to leave you the 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.460
 link of the source below the video of 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.270
 youtube or on facebook and I'm also going 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.320
 to leave the link 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.710
 of a gene to validate to validate it 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.360
 As we bought we are going to have to 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.770
 go to enter this 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.140
 well for us to generate the code for 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.470
 validate it as good bought this we give 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.670
 in adding 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.659
 I canceled it because I already have it 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.820
 shourd steles that we add that from 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.690
 there to put me 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.909
 They look good if it is within this 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.650
 source 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.110
 there are many good tweets 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.050
 good for 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.500
 to be top we go to the search engine we go to 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.500
 search for 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.670
 we write doc 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.590
 if I look I have three different docs this 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.750
 big box job the one down here is 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.819
 from latina from syria 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.489
 this work is from above forgive 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.990
 insane and other source this is also is 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.010
 free 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.470
 dynastic we do not have to take it from 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.490
 put me that is the one in the box 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.920
 this is the reason we must enter 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.569
 we went in there 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.569
 and we are going to install 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.000
 we install it let's confirm 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.850
 and look at this is the touch 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.770
 what we have 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.320
 when we installed it 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.990
 A page opens before we even 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.090
 it's on the side 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.840
 when to me it is because I already 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.420
 I had validated 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.680
 when you install it, enter the 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.530
 dock and then then you will see them a 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.890
 window that says to the bottom that you're 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:50.360
 trial and to activate there comes 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:53.630
 and on the left side when I saw it as 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.420
 a code on the left side 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.390
 from this lake will come a code is what 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.569
 let's write down the notebook 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.300
 this good we left doc to me I get 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.360
 different because I already had it 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.360
 installed 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.720
 good 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.720
 Now I will focus on the complainant 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.010
 when we click on the video 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.930
 of youtube below the link that says that 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.700
 will give us this page or on youtube 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.690
 also and here we are going to 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.350
 in the first box we're going 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.350
 get in 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.030
 doc if you have iphone white votes 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.069
 come in here if you have the ipad 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.030
 here comes the one below and me in my case 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:45.690
 i'm going to enter iphone 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.180
 ok look and it was there in the next 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:53.330
 box here is in the background is achieved 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.639
 see is barely able to see that we put the 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.379
 in the code that came from trial that was 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.099
 on the left side when we open the 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:02.750
 dock then then a page appears 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:05.590
 we write that code and here we are going to 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.590
 to write 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.599
 we are not going to have to write like this and that 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:11.599
 how is it in upper case 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.919
 in my case in my case is this you do not 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.860
 write down what I have because I have 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.939
 another number of days is not the same 3 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.939
 pointing out that they get 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.760
 in my case it is this 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.620
 remember that 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.610
 here are uppercase 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.110
 If not, it will not validate us 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:43.470
 It would be giving it to us 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:46.340
 they have to do all uppercase 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.340
 two letters 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.379
 well, it's all left 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:13.550
 write these letters in the box 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.550
 down that is empty 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.250
 in these letters it does not matter that they are 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.320
 lower case letters put them all in 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.320
 lowercase here there's no problem 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.150
 space because there is a space 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.270
 if they look, it has already generated the code 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:08.050
 this is for code that gave us here the 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:13.650
 who is it for 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.650
 so that we point it to where to activate 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:21.090
 you write notebooks she goes to 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:23.250
 be the cereal now yes 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.520
 if you are honest now if we can enter 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.069
 to the touch 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.240
 I already get different because I already 

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:32.689
 I have activated 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.699
 it already comes to me as 

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:36.949
 as if it were bought from you 

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:40.179
 to leave also like this they give in activate and 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:40.179
 they only point in cereals 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.330
 well that would be all I can not 

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.560
 do so right now because I know more a 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:49.080
 I breathe and it would be cut 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.990
 Well I hope you like it if they have 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:55.200
 questions let me know as if they have 

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:57.600
 problems when they leave they can send me 

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:02.240
 your trial number that comes out in docs 

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.240
 if they do not understand it and I am the one 

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:06.370
 Well that's it
