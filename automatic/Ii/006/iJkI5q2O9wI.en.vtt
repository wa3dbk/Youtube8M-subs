00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
it he's going up an RKO out of nowhere

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.789

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
by the way why on earth if this is

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.089 
by the way why on earth if this is
supposed<00:04:20.949> to<00:04:21.250> be<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:21.699> big<00:04:22.150> intense<00:04:22.660> show<00:04:23.110> is<00:04:23.379> it

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
supposed to be a big intense show is it

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.219 
supposed to be a big intense show is it
free<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:24.729> mean<00:04:25.060> why<00:04:25.300> wouldn't<00:04:25.539> they<00:04:25.780> take<00:04:26.080> this

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
free I mean why wouldn't they take this

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.129 
free I mean why wouldn't they take this
opportunity<00:04:26.949> to<00:04:27.039> make<00:04:27.220> money<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.960> don't<00:04:28.960> know<00:04:29.110> I
