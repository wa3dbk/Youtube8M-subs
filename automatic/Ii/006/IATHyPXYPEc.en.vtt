00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
version 4.0.4 and the main aim of this

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.300 
version 4.0.4 and the main aim of this
is<00:00:15.660> just<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.890> can<00:00:17.010> group<00:00:17.279> your

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
is just so that you can group your

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.580 
is just so that you can group your
applications<00:00:18.060> together<00:00:18.390> in<00:00:18.630> more<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.470> an

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
applications together in more of an

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.620 
applications together in more of an
orderly<00:00:20.100> fashion<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.850> for<00:00:21.060> example<00:00:21.420> if<00:00:21.510> you've

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
orderly fashion so for example if you've

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.420 
orderly fashion so for example if you've
got<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.960> bunch<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.439> games<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.070> instead<00:00:23.369> of

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
got a bunch of games and instead of

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.490 
got a bunch of games and instead of
having<00:00:23.640> them<00:00:23.880> sort<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.750> scattered<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
having them sort of scattered on the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.140 
having them sort of scattered on the
screen<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:25.980> various<00:00:26.310> icons<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.760> can<00:00:26.910> group

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
screen in various icons you can group

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.179 
screen in various icons you can group
them<00:00:27.269> together<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.900> folder<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:28.980> can

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
them together in a folder so you can

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.650

this folder you've got the plus symbol
layer<00:02:40.490> which<00:02:41.490> will<00:02:41.640> tap<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.150> then<00:02:42.420> he<00:02:42.510> puts

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
layer which will tap and then he puts

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.080 
layer which will tap and then he puts

folder you hit done and you can see some

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.840 
folder you hit done and you can see some
moves<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.620> there<00:02:55.800> or<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.370> other<00:02:56.550> way<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.730> can

moves in there or the other way you can
do<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.270> hold<00:02:57.930> down<00:02:58.080> an<00:02:58.470> app<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.340> then<00:03:00.170> just

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
do it is hold down an app and then just

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.440 
do it is hold down an app and then just
let<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.380> go<00:03:01.620> on<00:03:01.860> top<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.460> folder<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.060> you

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
let it go on top of the folder and you

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.080 
let it go on top of the folder and you
can<00:03:03.480> see<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.870> puts<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.200> inside<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.730> if<00:03:05.790> we<00:03:05.940> go

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
can see it puts it inside so if we go

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.520 
can see it puts it inside so if we go
inside<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.420> folder<00:03:06.840> now<00:03:06.930> just<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.260> see<00:03:07.380> what's

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
inside the folder now just to see what's

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.320 
inside the folder now just to see what's
in<00:03:07.650> there<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:08.280> can<00:03:08.430> see<00:03:08.580> there's<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:09.000> unti

in there you can see there's that unti

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.450 
in there you can see there's that unti
g1<00:03:09.690> benchmark<00:03:10.590> there<00:03:10.770> that<00:03:10.920> we<00:03:11.010> put<00:03:11.220> in<00:03:11.310> that

g1 benchmark there that we put in that
we<00:03:11.580> started<00:03:11.940> with<00:03:12.090> there's<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.930> vellum<00:03:13.320> er<00:03:13.380> one

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
we started with there's a vellum er one

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.200 
we started with there's a vellum er one
that<00:03:13.920> we<00:03:14.040> picked<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.370> plus<00:03:14.580> sign<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:14.970> added

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
that we picked the plus sign and added

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.270 
that we picked the plus sign and added
it<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.660> there's<00:03:15.960> a<00:03:16.020> quadrant<00:03:16.530> one<00:03:16.680> where<00:03:17.160> we

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
it and there's a quadrant one where we

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.180 
it and there's a quadrant one where we
drag<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:17.700> drop<00:03:17.880> it<00:03:18.060> into<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.270> folder<00:03:19.190> now

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
drag and drop it into the folder now

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.720 
drag and drop it into the folder now
that's<00:03:20.430> done<00:03:21.620> we<00:03:22.620> just<00:03:22.650> hit<00:03:22.950> back<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.190> second<00:03:23.640> so

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
that's done we just hit back a second so
