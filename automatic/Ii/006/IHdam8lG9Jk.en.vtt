 I've been in Mexico for over 22 years as 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.829
 which I already feel quite Mexican 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.540
 because Mexico has given many more things to 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.050
 a beautiful daughter 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.820
 it's beautiful in a lot of things that was 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.480
 which started in the circus papaya 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.360
 the good dogs I started almost at 15 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.850
 years I started being clown first there was 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.950
 where everything started after it was already in 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.050
 the circus and I dedicated myself to what was the 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.910
 horses the equestrian later already 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.460
 teach what the fantastic pendulum is 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.500
 then the balloon of death and already 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.750
 then I learned just the guys 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.880
 that have given this side martínez 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.790
 tell us a little bit so that all 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.290
 children and everyone know how is the deal 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.450
 and especially the training of a 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.740
 Of course yes friends and friends of the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.680
 training starts from very 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.110
 little ones with chicken because we're going like this 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.060
 it is not a stick with here and here 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.220
 we put the chicken and for example so that 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.350
 jump from bank to bank we call it a 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.500
 chain and that is following the chicken 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.410
 this is already done as one says 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.420
 a routine then dist and it goes 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.090
 recording what is going to be does not go to one 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.100
 she gives the order and she does it and she takes off 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.810
 the chicken and afterwards it is given when 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.370
 finish working something I remember 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.290
 a lot is that for them to jump 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.600
 great distances first 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.580
 with the banks completely together and of 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.200
 There, they are being made to go 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.000
 going up going down and up and down and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.490
 there when the tigers are already growing 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.260
 specials you are giving more length and 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.270
 they already jump the big ones 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.009
 distances directly and friends and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.929
 friends I also want you to know that today 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.400
 in day the tigers then what is 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.320
 animal training circuses 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.240
 they are not mistreated on the contrary 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.800
 they eat every day for example 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.600
 the tigers here in the boy drink water 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.090
 of garrafon do not drink water from the tap 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.530
 your eyes remember that day that 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.670
 they came in because they always serve our 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.060
 our feet 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.740
 there is like a plastic stave once 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.870
 we change the grandmother and then not 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.180
 we reached to put it and he started to follow 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.730
 up and above all be that although 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.160
 was the one who entered first came in and said 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.900
 like what's up that that's what 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.220
 is happening and they came in and doing them 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.680
 towards the little legs that our 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.870
 used to working in sawdust but 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.030
 well let's know a little more about 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.069
 the tigers to see we go from this side 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.340
 moment this skin 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.049
 is a tiger that is very fierce how they see it 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.639
 That is the most treacherous one I have here 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.299
 from the pack because one turns around and 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:07.239
 he does not know what he is going to do well he is the 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:08.920
 treacherous and she is beautiful 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.010
 belinda and tranquilita no more than a 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.790
 some pretty angry sometimes she is 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.790
 as the most 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.830
 like he always does what he wants 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.420
 do it like you contreras 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.750
 I want to do this I want to do 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.750
 that and this beautiful is a beauty 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.150
 she is the most curious and apart is the 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.880
 most noble of them all is in fact 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.950
 seeing me here in the microphone I think 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.600
 that is what he wants what he wants 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.430
 see why it does not stop me from putting 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.770
 attention but she is one of the 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.730
 noblest we have here in the circus 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:58.870

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.360
 that the matriarch is the head of the 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.220
 the females and the one here is this 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.070
 the youngest of all the tigers this is 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.080
 maximum and therefore young is the 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.670
 who enters only to play to love 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.720
 bite everything and is the one who does the 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.500
 disorder

 she has always had a very character 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.680
