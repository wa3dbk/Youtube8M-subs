00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
you know the Jungle Book

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.250 
you know the Jungle Book
it's<00:06:43.580> just<00:06:43.760> the<00:06:43.880> idea<00:06:44.000> of<00:06:44.300> the<00:06:44.570> jungle<00:06:44.990> is<00:06:45.080> more

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 
it's just the idea of the jungle is more

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.210 
it's just the idea of the jungle is more
powerful<00:06:45.590> than<00:06:45.770> the<00:06:46.610> actual<00:06:46.970> jungle<00:06:48.130> so<00:06:49.130> it

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:49.220 
powerful than the actual jungle so it

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.120 
powerful than the actual jungle so it
was<00:06:49.340> a<00:06:49.370> much<00:06:49.610> more<00:06:49.640> magical<00:06:50.590> imagined<00:06:51.590> jungle

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
was a much more magical imagined jungle

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.350 
was a much more magical imagined jungle
so<00:06:52.220> it<00:06:52.280> was<00:06:52.370> much<00:06:52.460> more<00:06:52.670> sort<00:06:52.880> of<00:06:52.940> powerful

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
so it was much more sort of powerful

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.020 
so it was much more sort of powerful
because<00:06:53.750> it<00:06:53.870> was<00:06:54.020> dreamlike<00:06:54.680> and<00:06:55.010> strange<00:06:55.790> and

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
because it was dreamlike and strange and

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.910 
because it was dreamlike and strange and
anxiety<00:06:56.450> rather<00:06:57.170> than<00:06:57.320> that<00:06:57.530> should<00:06:57.680> you<00:06:57.800> go

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:57.920 
anxiety rather than that should you go

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.140 
anxiety rather than that should you go
to<00:06:57.980> the<00:06:58.130> jungle<00:06:58.490> was<00:06:58.580> probably<00:06:58.790> full<00:06:58.940> of<00:06:59.030> big

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.360 
to the jungle was probably full of big
bugs<00:06:59.390> and<00:06:59.660> is<00:06:59.750> a<00:06:59.780> bit<00:06:59.960> great<00:07:00.170> for<00:07:00.350> you<00:07:00.470> and<00:07:00.980> not

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.150 
bugs and is a bit great for you and not
as<00:07:02.030> visually<00:07:02.810> pleasing<00:07:02.960> so<00:07:03.470> we<00:07:03.590> tried<00:07:03.800> to<00:07:03.950> make

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 
as visually pleasing so we tried to make

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.320 
as visually pleasing so we tried to make
give<00:07:04.670> the<00:07:04.790> show<00:07:05.030> look<00:07:05.510> don't<00:07:05.720> mean<00:07:05.930> that<00:07:06.050> way
