 already the people from here and is the 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.319
 first time i came to africa now 

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:04.960
 to angola had first in cape verde 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:07.000
 which is the key to Africa and the dollar 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.850

 very very dear, very educated, right? 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.100

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.270
 Can you sing all the songs I 'm singing ? 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.270
 practically at home 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840
 ae 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.960
 ae 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.000
 I know 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960
 i 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.630
 now 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.590
 was actually marveled at 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:29.850
 what I found did not know he had 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:29.850
 So many fans out here in Japan 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.560
 expects the people to sing their 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.180
 songs because that's what I was surprised 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.790
 since this is another who suddenly 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.770
 could have played here or come through 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.380
 internet but do not know a repertoire 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.760
 whole then this shows how much my 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.440
 I do not work at work. 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.930
 frontier music has no border and 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.270
 people come to conquer this space 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.450
 It is not with simplicity that it is more 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.450
 important 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.930
 Sat 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.640
 the tiredness 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.010
 the lawyer is a bee boot 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.340

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.090
 catch 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.620
 is that I need to sing with the 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:15.130
