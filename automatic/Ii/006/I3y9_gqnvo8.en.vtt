this<00:00:54.039> is<00:00:54.250> my<00:00:54.399> well<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.449> sort<00:00:55.839> of<00:00:55.930> tried<00:00:56.110> it<00:00:56.410> led

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
this is my well I sort of tried it led

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.079 
this is my well I sort of tried it led
me<00:00:56.649> there<00:00:56.769> to<00:00:57.010> go<00:00:57.160> but<00:00:57.460> this<00:00:57.610> is<00:00:57.699> really<00:00:57.879> my

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
me there to go but this is really my

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.979 
me there to go but this is really my
first<00:00:58.300> time<00:00:58.540> writing<00:00:58.839> with<00:00:59.199> this<00:00:59.410> I<00:01:00.660> guess<00:01:01.660> a

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
first time writing with this I guess a

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.680 
first time writing with this I guess a
minute<00:01:02.470> ago<00:01:02.559> basically<00:01:03.519> they<00:01:04.089> come<00:01:04.300> with<00:01:04.509> that

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
minute ago basically they come with that

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.870 
minute ago basically they come with that
sort<00:01:04.989> of<00:01:05.050> skin<00:01:05.350> on<00:01:05.379> them<00:01:05.710> so<00:01:06.040> I<00:01:06.070> took<00:01:06.250> that<00:01:06.460> off

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
sort of skin on them so I took that off

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.469 
sort of skin on them so I took that off
and<00:01:07.240> kind<00:01:07.390> of<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:09.040> walked<00:01:09.850> around<00:01:10.000> on<00:01:10.360> the

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
and kind of just walked around on the

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.980 
and kind of just walked around on the
paint<00:01:10.720> can<00:01:11.009> but<00:01:12.119> that's<00:01:13.119> not<00:01:13.210> a<00:01:13.330> flat<00:01:13.630> surface

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
paint can but that's not a flat surface

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.530 
paint can but that's not a flat surface
so<00:01:14.320> you<00:01:15.220> know<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.490> could<00:01:15.700> really<00:01:15.970> get<00:01:16.180> a<00:01:16.240> feel

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
so you know it could really get a feel

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.440 
so you know it could really get a feel
for<00:01:19.470> ya<00:01:20.470> I<00:01:20.860> had<00:01:21.429> the<00:01:21.610> paint<00:01:21.820> can<00:01:22.060> because<00:01:22.360> I

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
and big and it works just like a small

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.980 
and big and it works just like a small
mark<00:01:35.409> all<00:01:35.619> I<00:01:36.450> mean<00:01:37.450> yeah<00:01:38.319> why<00:01:39.130> not<00:01:39.340> it<00:01:40.179> course

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
mark all I mean yeah why not it course

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.109 
mark all I mean yeah why not it course
these<00:01:41.229> are<00:01:41.289> that<00:01:41.619> sticky<00:01:42.399> so<00:01:42.819> if<00:01:43.000> you
