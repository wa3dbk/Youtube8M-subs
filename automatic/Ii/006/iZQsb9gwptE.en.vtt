you

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.959 

on<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.769> chart<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.340> looks<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:32.730> we're<00:00:32.940> about

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
on this chart it looks like we're about

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.869 
on this chart it looks like we're about
25<00:00:33.629> miles<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.530> interlaken<00:00:35.190> shouldn't<00:00:35.790> be

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
25 miles from interlaken shouldn't be

00:00:35.879 --> 00:01:26.580 
25 miles from interlaken shouldn't be
long<00:00:36.059> now

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.099 

did<00:01:27.189> you<00:01:27.369> do<00:01:27.549> that<00:01:27.579> what<00:01:28.450> happened<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:28.990> the

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
did you do that what happened to the

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.700 
did you do that what happened to the
engine<00:01:29.820> great<00:01:30.820> so<00:01:31.329> now<00:01:31.359> we're<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:31.869> glider<00:01:32.350> I

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
engine great so now we're a glider I

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.740 
engine great so now we're a glider I
assume<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:33.640> practice<00:01:34.090> for<00:01:34.299> this<00:01:34.420> sort<00:01:34.659> of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
assume you practice for this sort of

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.819 
assume you practice for this sort of
thing<00:01:35.399> right<00:01:36.399> I<00:01:39.899> think<00:01:40.899> we<00:01:41.049> passed<00:01:41.079> over<00:01:41.740> an

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
thing right I think we passed over an

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.240 
thing right I think we passed over an
airport<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.490> little<00:01:42.520> while<00:01:42.909> back<00:01:43.829> yes<00:01:44.829> it's

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
airport a little while back yes it's

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.459 
airport a little while back yes it's
right<00:01:45.520> here<00:01:45.759> on<00:01:45.819> the<00:01:46.060> chart<00:01:46.390> saanen<00:01:47.259> and

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
right here on the chart saanen and

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.399 
right here on the chart saanen and
another<00:01:48.159> airport<00:01:48.640> st.<00:01:49.030> Stefan<00:01:49.600> is<00:01:49.630> up<00:01:50.229> ahead

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
another airport st. Stefan is up ahead

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.740 
another airport st. Stefan is up ahead
to<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.890> southeast<00:01:51.459> in<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:52.119> valley<00:01:52.359> on<00:01:52.630> the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
to the southeast in the valley on the

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.870 
to the southeast in the valley on the
other<00:01:52.899> side<00:01:53.170> of<00:01:53.200> that<00:01:53.409> Ridge<00:01:53.700> looks<00:01:54.700> like

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
other side of that Ridge looks like

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.609 
other side of that Ridge looks like
we're<00:01:55.090> about<00:01:55.179> halfway<00:01:55.689> between<00:01:55.959> the<00:01:56.409> two

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
we're about halfway between the two

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.429 
we're about halfway between the two
airports<00:01:57.130> I<00:01:57.280> guess<00:01:58.060> we<00:01:58.270> can<00:01:58.450> turn<00:01:58.750> around<00:01:59.110> or

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
airports I guess we can turn around or

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.329 
airports I guess we can turn around or
see<00:02:00.039> if<00:02:00.159> we<00:02:00.280> can<00:02:00.429> make<00:02:00.459> it<00:02:00.789> over<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.119> ridge
