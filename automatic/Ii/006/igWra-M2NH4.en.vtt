00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.470
 when addressing the subject of addictions 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.180
 technology and mobile telephony 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.130
 it is important to observe the evolution of 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.430
 mobile telephony and the impacts 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.070
 by the same the grandparents of the mobile telephony 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.779
 reaches the whole society without restrictions 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.759
 social age 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.800
 the most impressive is that this 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.930
 evolution and marriage of the internet with 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.330
 cell phones have caused 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.199
 they lost the main function that the 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.000
 connections 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.519
 American research indicates that the 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.809
 cell phone serves only 16 per 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.940
 cent of the time 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.000
 In Brazil, users can not get out. 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.320
 from home without their marton sounds almost all 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.960
 use the phone for other 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.580
 activities will watch tv movies and even 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.640
 while reading books 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:03.140
 people look at smartphones 150 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.239
 times a day every day is easily 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.189
 noted the increasing access to 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.740
 phone numbers even surpassing 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.060
 inhabitants being a large part of them with 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.189
 Internet access 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.090
 According to the anatel, Brazil closed the 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:20.000
 with 265 and 52 million 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.210
 mobile phone lines featuring 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.140
 high of 0.37 percent compared to 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.100
 April 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.890
 in May, there were 900 74,29 thousand 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.610
 new homes and with that the number of 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:41.060
 mobile lines in the country increased to 134.20 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:43.370
 4 for every 100 inhabitants 24 hours per 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.260
 connected day because so when I am 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.909
 sleeping like this, my cell phone beeps 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.890
 Sometimes I wake up and see that the people are 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.370
 talking about a game but a little bit of luck is a 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.630
 very big disease I get connected 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.070
 basically from the time the agreement 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.530
 So far it was my first thing that 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.780
 I do the wheel-tacking there to see the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.140
 messages and the last thing I do 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.390
 sleep is pick up the phone one day to 9 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.130
 to call all the moments when the oil 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.500
 smartphone would give a couple of hours 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.500
 the cell phone or 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.739
 ipad computer are prosthetics do 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.409
 part of our body as prosthetics do 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.890
 part of us because they are virtual but not 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:26.359
 only we are not part of our life 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.930
 It transforms us in this life but are parts 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.209
 members of a change 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:38.489
 to what has been happening there since 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:40.709
 this dependence generated by the 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.109
 easy access to the internet through 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.310
 lipsticks interferes with the 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.500
 daily life 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.139
 international surveys show that 10% 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.299
 of Internet users passing through a 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.670
 period of addiction 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.560
 but it may be transitory it would be foolish 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.540
 say there is no benefit 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.700
 we can cite the speed and exchange of 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.220
 information such as the use of 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.919
 online newspapers video conferences 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.439
 banking transactions and others 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:09.239
 the use of the internet and the aid of networks 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.060
 increases the possibility of 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.889
 find that childhood friend and even 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.280
 even make new friends with people 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.930
 from anywhere in the world 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.909
 on the other hand this facility can 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.620
 influence who is actually close 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.230
 failing to exchange real experiences 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.419
 I promise this release can be 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.400
 noticed in bars and even in ballads 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.829
 where many are glued to the cell phones 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.720
 of social networks posting photos 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:43.260
 talking and not interacting with 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:46.979
 which is in front of you and was very 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.060
 long I realized you did not leave the 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:51.389
 cell phone 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.290
 Who is alright you not wide 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.580
 cell phone on the side of the cup who ruled 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.400
 mutual friends 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.930
 did not stay mute facebook generate my 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.290
 husband already called my daughter that I 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.280
 I was friend that if it was just this 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.520
 photo and the bet now let me know that I 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.790
 I like the food already cost coast potato 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.870
 to put the bloody honey your friend 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:22.290
 response to this huge will also 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.730
 intensify when the end does not mean 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.730
 that at the table with the cell phone in the bag 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.230
 two people were arrested and talking 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.230
 with me also an integration here and I 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.330
 become dark in the virtual world and this 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.640
 ask all this here brings this synergy 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:49.290
 All I did not know is the skateboard. 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:51.420
 hitting the pamphlet share the 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.000
 feeling of having the world in 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.520
 be good but it can also be bad as 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.100
 said Christian psychologist nabuco opens 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.050
 quotes a search on the one hand will say 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.450
 that from the moment you 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.730
 back to technology 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.440
 in fact you would be losing many 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.460
 fundamental experiences for its 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.770
 formation 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.930
 the other line will say yes that is 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.970
 very positive in that are 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.310
 being bombarded with new information 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.320
 with capacity to be tasks 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.230
 there will be an increase in young people qi 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.790
 who enjoy this technology ie 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.680
 great is wonderful 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.500
 provided you do not become enslaved by 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.150
 It closes quotation marks as it was said a lot 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.830
 healthy thing of this use 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.710
 and much of this enchantment brings 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.110
 This way it is very playful too. 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.120
 deal with these apparatuses the recommendation 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.900
 then you have good sense and 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.900
 self-criticism
