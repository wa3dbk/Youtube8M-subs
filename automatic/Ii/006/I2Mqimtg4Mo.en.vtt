we're here with Dave from Cannon we're

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.700 
we're here with Dave from Cannon we're
looking<00:00:02.970> at<00:00:03.060> their<00:00:03.179> new<00:00:03.360> CSC<00:00:04.080> camera<00:00:04.500> which<00:00:04.589> is

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
looking at their new CSC camera which is

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.920 
looking at their new CSC camera which is
coming<00:00:05.009> out<00:00:05.100> later<00:00:05.310> this<00:00:05.490> year<00:00:05.910> it<00:00:06.569> could<00:00:06.779> be

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
coming out later this year it could be

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.100 
coming out later this year it could be
yours<00:00:07.200> m3<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.790> I'm<00:00:08.910> soaked<00:00:09.150> Dave<00:00:09.389> over<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.960> you

give us a you know you're overdue what

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.539 
give us a you know you're overdue what
do<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.509> think<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:12.900> yeah<00:00:13.290> sure<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.400> is

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
do you think of it yeah sure so this is

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.180 
do you think of it yeah sure so this is
a<00:00:14.580> brand<00:00:14.880> new<00:00:15.059> sensor<00:00:15.960> inside<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.070> new

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
a brand new sensor inside a it's a new

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.720 
a brand new sensor inside a it's a new
24<00:00:17.760> million<00:00:18.090> pixel<00:00:18.660> sensor<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.619> it's<00:00:20.430> quite<00:00:20.609> an

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
24 million pixel sensor so it's quite an

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.370 
24 million pixel sensor so it's quite an
increased<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.240> other<00:00:21.570> precess<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
increased on the other precess of the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.099 
increased on the other precess of the
original<00:00:22.800> appeals<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.369> we<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:24.630> our<00:00:24.750> digital

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
original appeals and we have our digital

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.080 
original appeals and we have our digital
six<00:00:25.260> processor<00:00:25.830> inside<00:00:26.130> here<00:00:26.369> as<00:00:26.460> well<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.000> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
six processor inside here as well so the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.460 
six processor inside here as well so the
image<00:00:27.330> quality<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.840> going<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.050> be<00:00:28.109> improved

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
image quality is going to be improved

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.140 
image quality is going to be improved
over<00:00:28.830> anything<00:00:29.310> we've<00:00:29.460> seen<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.970> this

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
over anything we've seen like this

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.759 
over anything we've seen like this
before<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:31.170> what's<00:00:31.349> really<00:00:31.500> interesting

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
before but what's really interesting

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.160 
before but what's really interesting
about<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.279> new<00:00:32.399> sensing<00:00:32.820> processor<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.780> it's

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
about the new sensing processor is it's

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.340 
about the new sensing processor is it's
giving<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> new<00:00:34.710> hybrid<00:00:34.950> CMOS<00:00:35.670> AF<00:00:35.940> 3<00:00:36.719> which

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
giving you a new hybrid CMOS AF 3 which

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.190 
giving you a new hybrid CMOS AF 3 which
is<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> new<00:00:37.920> autofocus<00:00:38.879> system<00:00:39.059> okay

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
is a new autofocus system okay

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.500 
is a new autofocus system okay
what<00:00:41.070> we're<00:00:41.219> saying<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> new

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
what we're saying is that the new

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.500 
what we're saying is that the new
autofocus<00:00:43.079> system<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.530> 6.1<00:00:44.399> times<00:00:44.760> faster

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
autofocus system is 6.1 times faster

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.389 
autofocus system is 6.1 times faster
than<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> original<00:00:46.230> eos<00:00:46.920> am<00:00:47.390> very<00:00:48.390> very<00:00:48.750> fast

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
than the original eos am very very fast

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:50.569 
than the original eos am very very fast
system

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
system

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.729 
system
what<00:00:51.480> we've<00:00:51.629> also<00:00:51.719> done<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.590> in

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
what we've also done with with that in

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.799 
what we've also done with with that in
mind<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.309> were<00:00:53.760> expecting<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.270> camera<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> be

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
mind we were expecting this camera to be

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.250 
mind we were expecting this camera to be
used<00:00:55.110> perhaps<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.649> more<00:00:56.420> advanced<00:00:57.420> way<00:00:57.480> so

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
used perhaps in a more advanced way so

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.810 
used perhaps in a more advanced way so
we've<00:00:58.350> put<00:00:58.559> some<00:00:58.680> more<00:00:58.829> advanced<00:00:59.160> functions

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
we've put some more advanced functions

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.209 
we've put some more advanced functions
on<00:01:00.030> him<00:01:00.300> some<00:01:00.570> more<00:01:00.600> advanced<00:01:01.020> features<00:01:01.559> so

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
on him some more advanced features so

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.680 
on him some more advanced features so
you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.730> straight<00:01:03.059> away<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.359> it's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
you can see straight away that it's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.910 
you can see straight away that it's
actually<00:01:03.960> got<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.470> got<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> slightly<00:01:04.830> more

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
actually got a it's got a slightly more

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.620 
actually got a it's got a slightly more
curved<00:01:05.250> grip<00:01:05.640> here<00:01:05.909> which<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.180> very<00:01:06.360> similar

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
curved grip here which is very similar

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.600 
curved grip here which is very similar
to<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:07.290> we<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.619> our<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:08.130> our<00:01:08.189> Els

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
to what we have in our on our Els

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.520 
to what we have in our on our Els
cameras<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.390> our<00:01:09.450> else<00:01:12.140> which<00:01:13.140> means<00:01:13.320> it's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
cameras and our else which means it's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.420 
cameras and our else which means it's
really<00:01:13.860> nice<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.040> hold

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
really nice to hold

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.950 
really nice to hold
especially<00:01:14.790> where<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> extended<00:01:15.570> period<00:01:15.750> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
especially where the extended period of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.929 
especially where the extended period of
time<00:01:16.229> yeah<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.640> shutter<00:01:17.850> button

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
time yeah this is the shutter button

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.789 
time yeah this is the shutter button
here<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:18.630> around<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.500> actually<00:01:19.619> have

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
here then around it you actually have

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.800 
here then around it you actually have
this<00:01:20.070> little<00:01:20.250> wheel<00:01:20.580> okay<00:01:21.240> which<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.659> can

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
this little wheel okay which you can

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.210 
this little wheel okay which you can
actually<00:01:22.049> customize<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.710> do<00:01:22.860> different

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
actually customize to do different

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.620 
actually customize to do different
things<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.700> what's<00:01:23.880> quite<00:01:24.090> nice<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.570> can

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
things but what's quite nice is you can

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.929 
things but what's quite nice is you can
do<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.320> aperture<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.729> then

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
do like your aperture on there and then

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.249 
do like your aperture on there and then
you<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.270> do<00:01:27.390> your<00:01:27.420> shutter<00:01:27.750> speed<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
you can do your shutter speed on the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.870 
you can do your shutter speed on the
wheel<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> backs<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.159> very<00:01:29.400> quickly<00:01:29.670> you

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
wheel on the backs and very quickly you

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.880 
wheel on the backs and very quickly you
can<00:01:30.060> use<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.329> camera<00:01:30.689> manually<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.740> must

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
can use this camera manually you must

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.899 
can use this camera manually you must
have<00:01:32.040> noticed<00:01:32.310> there's<00:01:32.460> an<00:01:32.549> exposure

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
have noticed there's an exposure

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.270 
have noticed there's an exposure
compensation<00:01:33.240> we're<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.079> here<00:01:34.350> which<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.040> set

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
compensation we're in here which is set

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.520 
compensation we're in here which is set
really<00:01:35.790> nice<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.150> way<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> fun<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.439> you

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
really nice the way the fun is so you

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.300 
really nice the way the fun is so you
can<00:01:37.619> actually<00:01:37.740> adjust<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.340> expose<00:01:38.700> your<00:01:38.880> very

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
can actually adjust to expose your very

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.760 
can actually adjust to expose your very
now<00:01:41.310> looking<00:01:41.580> on<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.730> back<00:01:41.910> it<00:01:42.720> has<00:01:42.900> a<00:01:43.170> 3<00:01:43.740> inch

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
now looking on the back it has a 3 inch

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.770 
now looking on the back it has a 3 inch
screen<00:01:44.250> which<00:01:44.580> is<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:44.910> same<00:01:45.120> screen<00:01:45.480> that<00:01:45.540> we

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
screen which is the same screen that we

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.720 
screen which is the same screen that we
have<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.050> our<00:01:46.140> G<00:01:46.290> 1<00:01:46.500> X<00:01:46.590> mark<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.220> source<00:01:47.550> on<00:01:47.700> a

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
have on our G 1 X mark to source on a

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.880 
have on our G 1 X mark to source on a
million<00:01:48.060> screen<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.230> it's<00:01:49.350> variable<00:01:49.800> angle

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
million screen and it's variable angle

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.160 
million screen and it's variable angle
like<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.730> can<00:01:50.760> set<00:01:51.120> it<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.330> to<00:01:51.390> shoot

can actually intimidate people but

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.479 
can actually intimidate people but
something<00:03:08.450> like<00:03:08.510> this<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:09.080> not<00:03:09.769> intimidating

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
something like this is not intimidating

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.750 
something like this is not intimidating
is<00:03:11.110> really<00:03:12.110> nice<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:12.500> fun<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.830> use<00:03:13.069> it's<00:03:13.640> very

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
is really nice and fun to use it's very

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.960 
is really nice and fun to use it's very
small<00:03:14.150> from<00:03:14.450> what<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.660> can<00:03:14.750> see<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.610> for<00:03:16.610> me<00:03:16.790> it

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
small from what I can see and for me it

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.670 
small from what I can see and for me it
seems<00:03:17.180> like<00:03:17.330> it's<00:03:17.600> almost<00:03:17.780> like<00:03:17.959> a<00:03:18.080> trust<00:03:18.440> and

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
seems like it's almost like a trust and

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.259 
seems like it's almost like a trust and
something<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:19.489> if<00:03:19.610> you're<00:03:19.730> looking<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.970> fine

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
something that if you're looking a fine

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.030
