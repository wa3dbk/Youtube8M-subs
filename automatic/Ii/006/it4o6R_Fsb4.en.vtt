00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.850
 it was the turn of Huawei this brand that 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.740
 the world does not know much but that 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.240
 certainly this year is going to give a lot of 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.350
 what to talk because they announced here in 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.810
 mobile world congress that will 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.670
 enter a global campaign to give 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.710
 to know those shouts vargas and here 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.140
 from mobile world congress in the city 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.940
 from spain we have in the huawei area 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.160
 we want you to know 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.520
 testing one of the cell phones that have been 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.500
 presented at this event and it 's doing 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.480
 we have them here and that as 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.260
 you can see look at this wow it is 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.999
 a Chinese company but they certainly have 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.280
 evolved a lot in what is a 

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:46.280
 design and how you can see this 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.100
 team in class 2 because it has one that 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.139
 it's very attractive, light, light, 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.379
 the use of plastic is present by 

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:57.979
 all sides but it does not stop being the ones with 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.659
 these chips or this is the design and it's 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.809
 silver on the side because it gives you a certain 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.809
 I touched 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.610
 of sophistication to the phone we go now 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.260
 of the specifications the phone is 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.060
 quad band which means that 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.310
 works in virtually all 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.850
 networks in except for for example 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.580
 t-mobile which is 1700 2100 in this case 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.570
 does not have to of 2000 the 1700's sorry and 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.850
 then it could not work 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.990
 correctly but as timor is 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.509
 moving away from that then there should be 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.909
 problem when they launch more then lte already 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.880
 that this phone as such is that it has 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.330
 a 4-point screen 7 inches high 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.880
 definition that is 720 pesos and also in 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.280
 the screen is 15 which means 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.929
 who spoke space using a 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.450
 new technology a technology that already 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.860
 we had seen for a while now for 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.630
 integrate different components of the 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.570
 screen none days only and occupy 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.690
 less space in an edition to this then 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.460
 the processor is 1.5 days is game 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.080
 art which means we're going to 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.240
 try it here right now as it moves 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.229
 and for that 9 pretty good that 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.100
 this certainly allows us to have 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.479
 access to 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.070
 You can do different types of 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.960
 transition within different types of 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.590
 transition because the processor so 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.230
 It allows 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.690
 then in addition to this the camera is 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.910
 of 13 megapixels as you can see there 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.930
 and of course it has flash and can 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.230
 record 1080 videos and 1 gb memory 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.890
 ram wifi has nfc what he wants to say 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.300
 that therefore allows it to perform 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.730
 file transfer or only 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.340
 touch the phone with another and so 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.290
 successively first impression them 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.650
 I can say that this phone if I 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.959
 put at a reasonable price at a price 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.940
 accessible will be very successful because 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.700
 Although the brand is not well known , 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.010
 phone has been designed in such a way 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.739
 that compete favorably at least 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.200
 since put is performing with others 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.319
 models of other brands so let's 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.760
 be well aware of what huawei 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.989
 will be offering during this year of 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.670
 convention at the beginning we can be 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.650
 getting known with a campaign 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.500
 Worldwide advertising from mobile 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.970
 world congress with the ace the p2 of huawei 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.100
 to attend and two dot com in the 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.450
 camera roberto flÃ³rez and this one that 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.450
 have informed milton panista
