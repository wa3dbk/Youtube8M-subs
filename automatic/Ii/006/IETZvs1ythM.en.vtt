is the fourth of July
so<00:00:28.759> we<00:00:29.210> thought<00:00:29.509> we'd<00:00:29.930> bring<00:00:29.960> some<00:00:30.439> Australian

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.990 
so we thought we'd bring some Australian
culture<00:00:31.789> into<00:00:32.750> Independence<00:00:33.650> Day<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.220> what

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
culture into Independence Day and what

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.410

could be more Australian than Vegemite

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.180 
could be more Australian than Vegemite

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190

perhaps<00:01:37.940> it's<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.300> Vegemite<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:39.640> probably

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
perhaps it's the Vegemite I probably

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.920 
perhaps it's the Vegemite I probably
would<00:01:40.880> go<00:01:41.060> with<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:43.300> infusing<00:01:44.300> of<00:01:44.660> the

would go with this infusing of the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.380 
would go with this infusing of the
Vegemite<00:01:45.350> in<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.619> chocolate<00:01:46.070> over<00:01:46.390> the

Vegemite in the chocolate over the
Vegemite<00:01:47.900> by<00:01:48.080> itself<00:01:49.479> I<00:01:50.479> think<00:01:51.729> there<00:01:52.729> might

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
Vegemite by itself I think there might

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.030 
Vegemite by itself I think there might
be<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:52.970> little<00:01:53.090> bit<00:01:53.270> too<00:01:53.360> much<00:01:53.509> in<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:53.720> middle
