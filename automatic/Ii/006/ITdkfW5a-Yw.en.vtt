 from where laura it's offshore wind 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.980
 that gets stronger and mehdi on which 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.180
 welcome back has cost all we have time 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.790
 which is variable it makes relatively 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.710
 soft it is 24 to 25 degrees in 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.960
 the water is rising 20 degrees a tide that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.449
 is descending the plane dalet 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.430
 at 16:30 the coefficients are 41 sure 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.350
 this descendant we have the wind that is 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.690
 strengthens in the southeast sector it turns a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.550
 little south is a strong word for salad the plan 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.290
 of water become wrinkled is when 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.300
 even clean and we have 7 and where the long of

 m 30 at times we are 50 via sludge 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.009
 there is something to slide but wanted 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.140
 not very well oriented vaccines 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.640
 quite fast a little elusive phases 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.590
 action lice the shoulders are subject 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.390
 dig it shifts it's not hyper 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.280
 orderly but in the pile is still 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.170
 some waves to catch there are some 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.310
 world to water the bar schools enough 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.289
 easy to cross if there are 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.210
 lulls there is no current the 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.190
 waves are tartine a little about 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.720
 Syrian it's a bit selective but good 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.009
 there are the beautiful catchers enjoy it 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.340
 now the bus for the rest of the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.229
 day 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.509
 the wind should strengthen a little more 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.009
 in the south sector we expect waves in 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.569
 terms of degradation 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.009
 the arcachon buoy had his big one to a 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:38.610
 meter seventy and nine seconds and 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.140
 so we are waiting 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.789

 Beaufort good to watch the evolution 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.869
 for the rest of the day we will fall 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.569
 on a low tide at this art 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.950
 today little coefficient maybe 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.229
 languages ​​still on the best 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.660
 low tide terminals that's for the
