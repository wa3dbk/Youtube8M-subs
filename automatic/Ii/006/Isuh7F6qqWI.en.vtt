00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.869
 the doctor says we disassemble osburgh 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:17.980
 mazda 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:20.650
 was the year 2011 2013 2012 model release 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.470
 good principle seems like different bk 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.350
 frequent problem they break 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.050
 supposedly pump gur and throw it all away 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.880
 luggage is no different from close body 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.619
 only by the fact that here is another one. have u 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.620
 us and gur 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.840
 they are just gur he is electric 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.300
 He was produced in principle on the baggage as with 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.170
 the eighth year it means understands very 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.380
 Simply untwist bolts they 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.930
 specific there means a stopper is worth 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:54.070
 power bolt-specific asterisk 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:58.120
 under the asterisk along with the guide 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.399
 whether these bolts exit then at the expense of us 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.440
 starred 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.059
 like this way this way 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.359
 us 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.329
 I dreamed about the construction, that is, we first 

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:12.249
 10 unscrewed then removed on the pump itself and 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.850
 it's hydraulics it's not this 

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:15.579
 electrician 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.219
 further we unscrew the bolts here 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:21.279
 removed here and so hydraulics 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:23.799
 here it is here by the way there is such 

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:26.469
 bushing is by the way frequent breakdown but 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.869
 here connects the two shafts this shaft and this 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.369
 shaft here this sleeve if you can 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.490
 see what you see here should 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.469
 to be a flat Slot but here it is 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.229
 Rasherachili production was 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.789
 accordingly a lot of work here 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.310
 also 1 shooting range on another wave 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:47.979
 opposite such 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.779
 it means the sleeves are not sold in the set they 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.719
 do not enter can look at any 

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:54.639
 the bridge catalog they are not supplied 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:57.329
 0 from google want to easily farm this 

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:57.329
 very enjoy 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.830
 bang on this 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:06.130
 discuss and select work appeared 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.130
 this 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.570
 let's go further to get to the very 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.860
 motor since buzz 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:36.530
 we have it there roughly speaking the motor itself 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.450
 electrical winding anchor anchor 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.870
 to get there we need something 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.850
 there is when you make out you will 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.040
 copper tracks 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.800
 they are soldered welded by copper welding 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.010
 cut means either write off or 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.750
 bite off the place of welding 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.750
 they are then easily soldered this slightly 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.970
 later also show so we collect 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.970
 cleaned up mean those copper tracks 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:14.360
 cleaned easily and naturally by one 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:16.880
 flick of the wrist removed why 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.870
 they are removed as a result later on 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.310
 what we do 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.940
 reveal the hull itself open spaces something 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:29.140
 the subtle case of our first was enough 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.510
 we beat him that way yes throughout 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.850
 that is, to beat, too, need not much because 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.510
 what you build into the hull itself can split 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.710
 it means a little bit made a go and 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.910
 further conventional slotted screwdriver 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.070
 neatly not to remember which 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.510
 the edges 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.400
 reveal the core body itself opens with 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.170
 sound because it sits and sealants 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.210
 smells so to speak on we remove from 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:05.790
 effort because there still could 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:08.640
 powerful but not so powerful magnet a 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.520
 here itself by the way 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.450
 fucking insulating even mean here 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.459
 what apparently is apparently the motor winding 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.830
 see for yourself near the previous one 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.260
 m he is not just the previous repair here 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.110
 just moisture often fall but in our 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.120
 In case of repair, moisture got in there. 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.930
 I have already wiped it and we see that rust 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.580
 where there are walls on 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.700
 bearing itself was such a gasket she 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.900
 also all the rust in what we had 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:46.330
 problem means here 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:50.860
 the device is simple the motor itself 2 drops 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.840
 when I have forgiven for ages a very cape anchor 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.460
 here even see traces of rust 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:00.940
 That means it is a bearing and another 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.850
 bearing we are here we are 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.250
 checked it does not seem to rattle all 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.290
 rotates the only thing that noticed it 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.330
 small backlash well maybe he and 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.780
 let's say because what other sound is not 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.970
 heard 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.300
 And problems were in this bearings if 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:19.000
 look he rusted was all 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.969
 such in mucus if you unscrew the sound here 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.459
 i.e. lounging bearings 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.649
 the Neva bearing is easily looked for on sale 

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:26.929
 There is a Russian counterpart worth 10 

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:30.179
 rubles 

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:30.809
 Currently we decide concealer like 

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:34.559
 take off 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:36.149
 for this thing bends cannot be beaten 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:38.459
 because a magnet can break 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:40.679
 so most likely we will look for either 

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:43.499
 puller or hold in a vise and we 

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:45.329
 delay it but say it a little later 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:47.159
 but in theory we change this bearing 

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:49.559
 further back right all clean and 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.669
 back we collect it in theory should 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:53.599
 earn one more such moment 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:56.129
 when you collect the collector to the end you need 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.259
 you need to file will only see how 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:02.279
 he worked a minute of attention 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:05.789
 original bearing called to and 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:15.319
 608 goal and replaced by domestic 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:18.360
 bearing 618 marking marking 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:20.219
 we will collect all the good luck 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.199
 show the result of the work and how 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:24.199
 going therefore checked
