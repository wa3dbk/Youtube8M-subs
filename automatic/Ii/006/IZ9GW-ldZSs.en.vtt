00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
to toast it so we'll see how it goes

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.770 
to toast it so we'll see how it goes
I've<00:00:32.340> never<00:00:32.520> made<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.790> before<00:00:32.940> but<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.480> like<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
I've never made it before but I like the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780 
I've never made it before but I like the
wraps<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> roasted<00:00:34.860> vegetables<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
wraps with the roasted vegetables and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.520 
wraps with the roasted vegetables and
stuff<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.630> don't<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:36.989> lots<00:00:37.350> of

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
stuff in it and I don't have lots of

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.139 
stuff in it and I don't have lots of
different<00:00:37.890> kinds<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.370> shows<00:00:38.610> Ross<00:00:38.910> but

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
different kinds of that shows Ross but

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.110 
different kinds of that shows Ross but
we'll<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.899> might<00:00:40.079> be<00:00:40.200> tasty<00:00:40.620> knows<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:42.000> if

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
we'll see it might be tasty knows so if

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.910 
we'll see it might be tasty knows so if
you<00:00:42.210> decided<00:00:42.510> i'm<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.989> use<00:00:43.230> cream

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
you decided i'm going to use cream

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.069 
you decided i'm going to use cream
cheese<00:00:44.219> instead<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.850> cottage<00:00:45.360> cheese<00:00:45.390> I

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
cheese instead of cottage cheese I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.410 
cheese instead of cottage cheese I
normally<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.100> goat<00:00:47.399> cheese<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.390> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
normally like goat cheese in it so I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.600 
normally like goat cheese in it so I
figured<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.559> cream<00:00:49.920> cheese<00:00:49.950> might<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
figured the cream cheese might be a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.459 
figured the cream cheese might be a
little<00:00:50.789> bit<00:00:50.969> more<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.629> texture<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
little bit more like that texture and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.520 
little bit more like that texture and
taste<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.550> we're<00:00:53.670> going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:55.020> frig

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
taste so we're going to do that so frig

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.680 
taste so we're going to do that so frig
off<00:00:55.649> cottage<00:00:56.129> cheese<00:00:56.160> does<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.120> drop<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.600> on

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
off cottage cheese does it drop it on

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.680 
off cottage cheese does it drop it on
the<00:00:57.719> floor<00:00:57.840> way<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.680> go<00:00:58.859> me<00:00:59.270> cook<00:01:00.270> them<00:01:00.390> stuff
