advance an expert play on their own one

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.880 
advance an expert play on their own one
more<00:00:48.719> thing<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.989> mention<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.559> we're<00:00:49.710> not

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
more thing to mention is that we're not

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.220 
more thing to mention is that we're not
going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.190> include<00:00:50.519> builds<00:00:51.359> in<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.600> guy<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
going to include builds in this guy the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.959 
going to include builds in this guy the
reason<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.679> is<00:00:52.949> bills<00:00:53.429> get<00:00:53.609> out<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.850> date

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
reason for that is bills get out of date

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.700 
reason for that is bills get out of date
very<00:00:54.000> quickly<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.899> I'm<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.050> gonna<00:00:55.289> do<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.620> so

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
very quickly so I'm not gonna do that so

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.349 
very quickly so I'm not gonna do that so
we<00:00:55.829> don't<00:00:55.920> date<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> guide<00:00:56.519> so<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.179> guide

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
we don't date the guide so this guide

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.669 
we don't date the guide so this guide
will<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.539> relevant<00:00:58.019> even<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.320> year<00:00:58.500> from<00:00:58.589> now

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
will be relevant even a year from now

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.709 
will be relevant even a year from now
unless<00:00:59.100> Agni<00:00:59.460> gets<00:00:59.609> remade<00:01:00.030> there's<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> idea

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
unless Agni gets remade there's the idea

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.540 
unless Agni gets remade there's the idea
there<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.739> should<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:02.010> all<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.399> so

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
there and that should be all of it so

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.000 
there and that should be all of it so
let's<00:01:02.730> go<00:01:02.820> ahead<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.120> get<00:01:03.210> going

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
let's go ahead and get going

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.590 
let's go ahead and get going
so<00:01:05.010> Agni<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.730> traditional<00:01:06.240> man<00:01:06.420> she's

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
so Agni is a traditional man she's

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.450 
so Agni is a traditional man she's
extremely<00:01:07.260> bursty<00:01:07.800> in<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.920> short<00:01:08.160> amount<00:01:08.220> of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
extremely bursty in a short amount of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.920 
extremely bursty in a short amount of
time<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.880> he<00:01:08.940> can<00:01:09.090> cause<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.630> lot<00:01:09.810> of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
time and he can cause just a lot of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.720 
time and he can cause just a lot of
damage<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.350> death<00:01:10.500> he<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.800> kill<00:01:10.980> pretty<00:01:11.430> well

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
damage and death he can kill pretty well

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.490 
damage and death he can kill pretty well
you'd<00:01:12.270> also<00:01:12.390> set<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.840> four<00:01:13.020> teammates<00:01:13.260> with<00:01:13.470> a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
you'd also set up four teammates with a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.170 
you'd also set up four teammates with a
stun<00:01:13.800> that<00:01:13.830> he<00:01:14.070> has<00:01:14.280> now<00:01:14.730> because<00:01:15.030> he's<00:01:15.150> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
stun that he has now because he's a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.640 
stun that he has now because he's a
matrix<00:01:15.570> traditionally<00:01:16.020> played<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.410> mid

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
matrix traditionally played in the mid

matrix traditionally played in the mid
he<00:01:17.010> can<00:01:17.220> bleed<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.640> solo<00:01:18.060> jungle<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:19.020> so

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
he can bleed in the solo jungle not so

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.640 
he can bleed in the solo jungle not so
great

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
great

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.770

we got to talk about combos there are
five<00:03:25.950> potential<00:03:26.400> combos<00:03:26.970> with<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.299> noxious

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
five potential combos with the noxious

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.910 
five potential combos with the noxious
fumes<00:03:27.989> three<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.290> them<00:03:28.380> can<00:03:28.530> be<00:03:28.620> done<00:03:28.799> when<00:03:28.890> you

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
fumes three of them can be done when you

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.380 
fumes three of them can be done when you
throw<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.160> fumes<00:03:29.400> at<00:03:29.549> first<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.000> two<00:03:30.030> can<00:03:30.299> be

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
throw the fumes at first and two can be

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.880 
throw the fumes at first and two can be
done<00:03:30.540> after<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.110> first<00:03:31.260> thing<00:03:31.470> your<00:03:31.590> simple

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
done after the first thing your simple

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.500 
done after the first thing your simple
that<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.340> put<00:03:32.489> out<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:32.700> fume<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.209> you<00:03:33.360> hit

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
that is you put out the fume and you hit

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.150 
that is you put out the fume and you hit
it<00:03:33.600> with<00:03:33.690> your<00:03:33.750> flame<00:03:34.140> wave<00:03:34.380> or<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.890> hit<00:03:35.040> it

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
it with your flame wave or you hit it

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.220 
it with your flame wave or you hit it
with<00:03:35.280> your<00:03:35.340> dash<00:03:35.820> or<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.390> hit<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:36.720> with<00:03:36.989> your

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
with your dash or you hit it with your

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.780 
with your dash or you hit it with your
ultimate<00:03:37.739> simple<00:03:38.100> is<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.250> now<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.580> other

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
ultimate simple is that now the other

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.100 
ultimate simple is that now the other
two<00:03:39.000> are<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.090> little<00:03:39.150> more<00:03:39.330> complex<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.019> that

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
two are a little more complex and that

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.960 
two are a little more complex and that
is<00:03:40.350> after<00:03:40.650> your<00:03:40.860> dash<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.340> can<00:03:41.489> turn<00:03:41.820> around

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
is after your dash you can turn around

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.180 
is after your dash you can turn around
and<00:03:42.360> put<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.780> fumes<00:03:43.049> on<00:03:43.290> top<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.829> your<00:03:43.950> flame

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
and put the fumes on top of your flame

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.550 
and put the fumes on top of your flame
half<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.450> can<00:03:45.630> stun<00:03:45.900> someone<00:03:46.079> chasing

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
half and that can stun someone chasing

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.870
