all right well as far as we can conclude
the<00:02:18.380> Dinka<00:02:18.770> thrust<00:02:18.800> with<00:02:19.370> wheelies<00:02:19.850> is

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
the Dinka thrust with wheelies is

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.610 
the Dinka thrust with wheelies is
bastard<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.810> want<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:20.990> try<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.140> one<00:02:21.290> more<00:02:21.440> time

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
bastard you want to try it one more time

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.300 
bastard you want to try it one more time
just<00:02:21.680> without<00:02:22.190> wheelies<00:02:22.550> at<00:02:22.670> all<00:02:22.840> yeah<00:02:23.840> all

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310

can do that all right ready to go there
we<00:02:38.660> go<00:02:38.690> nice<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:40.250> can't<00:02:40.490> lean<00:02:40.700> down<00:02:40.910> as<00:02:41.090> far<00:02:41.300> on

we go nice you can't lean down as far on
this<00:02:41.510> bike<00:02:41.920> yeah<00:02:42.920> no<00:02:43.360> all<00:02:44.360> right<00:02:44.630> yeah<00:02:44.990> so<00:02:45.260> it

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
this bike yeah no all right yeah so it

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.870 
this bike yeah no all right yeah so it
does<00:02:45.500> look<00:02:45.620> like<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.950> bait<00:02:46.190> oh<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.550> baby's

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
does look like the bait oh the baby's

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.600 
does look like the bait oh the baby's
actually<00:02:47.090> yeah<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.959> baby<00:02:48.200> beats<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:49.130> Dinka

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
actually yeah the baby beats the Dinka

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.840 
actually yeah the baby beats the Dinka
thrust<00:02:50.410> when<00:02:51.410> you're<00:02:51.860> not<00:02:52.070> wheelie<00:02:52.490> and<00:02:52.670> yeah

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
thrust when you're not wheelie and yeah

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.750 
thrust when you're not wheelie and yeah
you're<00:02:53.090> you're<00:02:53.390> far<00:02:53.660> ahead<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:53.930> me<00:02:54.110> now<00:02:54.760> all

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
you're you're far ahead of me now all

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.420 
you're you're far ahead of me now all
right<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.360> now<00:02:56.720> we<00:02:56.780> have<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.110> conclusion<00:02:57.500> the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
right so now we have a conclusion the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.640 
right so now we have a conclusion the
Dinka<00:02:58.730> thrust<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:59.180> faster<00:02:59.660> well<00:02:59.810> we<00:03:00.050> leaing<00:03:00.440> I

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
Dinka thrust is faster well we leaing I

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.830 
Dinka thrust is faster well we leaing I
don't<00:03:01.430> know<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:01.640> beat<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.150> every<00:03:02.300> time<00:03:02.450> that's

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
don't know it beat you every time that's

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.110 
don't know it beat you every time that's
so<00:03:03.080> weird<00:03:03.320> anyway<00:03:04.160> Dinka<00:03:04.790> thrust<00:03:04.820> while

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
so weird anyway Dinka thrust while

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.150 
so weird anyway Dinka thrust while
wheeling<00:03:05.330> is<00:03:05.780> better<00:03:06.260> than<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.560> baby<00:03:06.770> but<00:03:07.070> the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
wheeling is better than the baby but the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160 
wheeling is better than the baby but the
baby<00:03:07.190> does<00:03:07.610> have<00:03:07.760> better<00:03:07.910> speed<00:03:08.330> when<00:03:09.020> you're

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
baby does have better speed when you're

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.690 
baby does have better speed when you're
just<00:03:09.320> racing<00:03:09.650> on<00:03:09.739> ground<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.519> baby

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
just racing on ground and the baby

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.340 
just racing on ground and the baby
obviously<00:03:10.880> can<00:03:11.390> really<00:03:11.780> better<00:03:11.959> just<00:03:12.230> like

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
obviously can really better just like

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.380 
obviously can really better just like

this<00:03:15.170> bike<00:03:15.440> has<00:03:15.590> terrible<00:03:15.920> handling<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:16.519> I

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
this bike has terrible handling so I

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.400 
this bike has terrible handling so I
mean<00:03:16.790> if<00:03:17.330> you're<00:03:17.420> going<00:03:17.570> for<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.750> speed<00:03:18.050> bike<00:03:18.260> on

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
mean if you're going for a speed bike on

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.870 
mean if you're going for a speed bike on
long<00:03:18.620> roads<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.280> you're<00:03:19.430> not<00:03:19.550> worried<00:03:19.790> about

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
long roads and you're not worried about

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.640 
long roads and you're not worried about
handling<00:03:20.480> like<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.959> long<00:03:21.170> straight<00:03:21.410> roads

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
handling like a long straight roads

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.110 
handling like a long straight roads
definitely<00:03:21.920> I<00:03:22.190> guess<00:03:22.459> to<00:03:22.580> choose<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.850> Dinka

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
definitely I guess to choose the Dinka

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.210 
definitely I guess to choose the Dinka
thrust<00:03:23.150> if<00:03:23.600> you<00:03:23.690> like<00:03:23.840> wheeling<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.290> lot<00:03:24.440> but

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
thrust if you like wheeling a lot but

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.770 
thrust if you like wheeling a lot but
for<00:03:25.370> everything<00:03:25.550> else<00:03:25.730> think<00:03:26.300> of<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.600> baby

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
for everything else think of the baby

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.310 
for everything else think of the baby
like<00:03:27.500> an<00:03:27.680> really<00:03:28.100> painted<00:03:28.970> bike<00:03:29.239> yeah<00:03:30.080> this

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
like an really painted bike yeah this

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.390 
like an really painted bike yeah this
thing's<00:03:30.530> 75<00:03:31.070> K<00:03:31.340> anyway<00:03:31.760> if<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:32.870> guys<00:03:33.160> just<00:03:34.160> use

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
thing's 75 K anyway if you guys just use

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.040 
thing's 75 K anyway if you guys just use
it<00:03:34.550> for<00:03:34.580> anything<00:03:34.850> else<00:03:35.030> obviously<00:03:35.480> use<00:03:35.930> the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
it for anything else obviously use the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.780 
it for anything else obviously use the
baby<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.440> baby<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:36.709> still<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.459> all-around

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
baby the baby is still the all-around

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.540 
baby the baby is still the all-around
better<00:03:38.180> bike<00:03:38.450> I<00:03:38.750> think<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:40.160> Akuma<00:03:40.400> is

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
better bike I think so the Akuma is

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.580 
better bike I think so the Akuma is
pretty<00:03:40.730> good<00:03:40.880> too<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:41.269> that's<00:03:41.989> up<00:03:42.170> for<00:03:42.290> debate

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
pretty good too so that's up for debate
