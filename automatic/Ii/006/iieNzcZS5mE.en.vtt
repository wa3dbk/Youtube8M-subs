00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 so hello to everyone recently acquired a plate 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.400
 mascara for snes so want to share my 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.540
 impressions about him say pros and cons 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.570
 this. 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.929
 she looks like a regular card just a little 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.430
 smaller also have black 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.680
 housing 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.250
 cavitation flash drive is also pretty good 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.150
 All this is good packaging manual disk usb 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.270
 cable 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.730
 their one for mini steak art well and plus 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.710
 given flash cartridges save game 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.930
 older real time game 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.690
 firmware call firmware become and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.489
 updated support from multiple cards 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.199
 sd memory file transfer support 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.980
 auto hacking function but embedded 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:50.550
 cheat codes 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:53.780
 support for formats about but 708 in in general 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.660
 these are pictures but very primitive and 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.539
 format and regional patch function 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.860
 protection allows you to play games 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.119
 different regions and 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.760
 and the right writer slot American 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.880
 card mode 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.800
 so go japanese and american 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.650
 through a very interesting feature to do 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.860
 backup copy of the current game this is 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.320
 which also inserted our cartridge on 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.170
 page as a file why is it needed 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.940
 only the Chinese are probably known but so 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.490
 there are several other interesting 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.980
 functions will not be now about them 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.990
 we will probably go to the minuses 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.820
 the main disadvantage of this flash card 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.630
 lie you will not go those game 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.700
 there are special things 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.340
 but even if the game went you could 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.570
 missing any sounds in the game or 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.329
 even some music 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.830
 a label but some games can be creepy 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.380
 lag them will be impossible 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.560
 Unfortunately , I do not test the whole game. 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.840
 I can and there are a lot of them and I am not here 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.140
 I do not know about the most who like 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.380
 contra worm jim 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.260
 top 7 neighbors easier they go without problems 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.390
 but I read it on the forums that if 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.119
 insert a cartridge with that chip which 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.370
 about that game is used there 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.940
 which vocals or not she can go 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.880
 to go 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.550
 then there is one more plus and that's it 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.970
 price with you darling 2000 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.030
 Plugins in this area I ordered 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.090
 I found it from Spain for 2,400 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.250
 Well, of course he justified his price 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.599
 but in principle, all the pros and cons of this 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.290
 flash cartridges by the way have anthony 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.629
 overdrive is also good 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.459
 You like him and get to play 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.459
 snes thanks everyone for watching
