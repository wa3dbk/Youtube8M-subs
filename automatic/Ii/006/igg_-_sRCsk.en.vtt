00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.589
 hello and welcome to the first one 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.580
 tutorial maybe you already have 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.280
 once money 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.380
 have seen the videos seen for these videos 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.230
 I will modify the tennis 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.820
 tour tomorrow used in this tutorial 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.770
 I want to show you which 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.060
 Modifications are needed a little more 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:34.600
 to get ground clearance 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:36.489
 Let's go the two plates on the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.989
 bottom of the streets cut out 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.850
 because the swinging under the 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.120
 blocked by springs from these plates 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.120
 become 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.470
 we have the same problem at the stern 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.030
 of the vehicle 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:01:01.720
 remove the five screws which the 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:01:04.590
 template plate then could also hold 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.590
 remove the plate 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.190
 after that the five screws are removed 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.300
 which hold the rear plate and 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.300
 remove this plate too 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:26.670
 now look the wheels off the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.670
 lower screws of the front wheel carrier 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.740
 you can now note the drive and 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.210
 remove the differential output 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.890
 this exit must also 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.300
 these are removed 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.010
 screw on the winter under the 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.660
 swing and take the same 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.140
 drive bones and the differential 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.140
 output 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.440
 now with the plates removed 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.880
 they have to be cut out a bit 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.410
 Use a knife and cut 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.690
 along the backs of the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.400
 plates indicated lines after you 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.300
 the plates should have cut out 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.300
 it looks like this 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.250
 now to the differential outputs 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.690
 something has to be cut away , too 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.220
 because the outputs are supposed to be there 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.640
 Oysters on the upper wings 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.640
 grind 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.790
 should cut after that emanated 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.790
 look like this 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.690
 now you can do it all again 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.690
 Assemble the differential output 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.710
 make the ansitz 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:03.480
 and the rear screws pay attention 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.870
 Replacement of the plates on that 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.769
 the wings can move freely 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.700
 after that carries the five screws of 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.700
 rear plate again 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.150
 builds and the front of the car also 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.650
 in differential output and the drive 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.610
 weeks again and writes the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.610
 carrier again 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.659
 now you can also follow the plate 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.659
 fasten again with the five screws 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.180
 Finally, you can now the rieder 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.180
 screw on again 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.150
 thanks for watching and if you 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.650
 I would like this video 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.650
 look forward to a positive review
