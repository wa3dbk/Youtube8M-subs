00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.580 

I<00:00:05.850> like<00:00:06.850> using<00:00:07.210> the<00:00:07.510> Thomas<00:00:07.930> Stewart<00:00:08.230> wheel

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
I like using the Thomas Stewart wheel

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.879 
I like using the Thomas Stewart wheel
because<00:00:09.309> of<00:00:09.490> the<00:00:09.610> power<00:00:09.850> that<00:00:10.000> it<00:00:10.360> has

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
because of the power that it has

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.890 
because of the power that it has
particularly<00:00:11.889> when<00:00:12.430> you're<00:00:12.639> centering<00:00:13.180> you

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
particularly when you're centering you

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.720 
particularly when you're centering you
need<00:00:14.080> to<00:00:14.260> work<00:00:14.469> with<00:00:14.500> the<00:00:14.860> speed<00:00:15.160> of<00:00:15.190> the<00:00:15.400> wheel

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
need to work with the speed of the wheel

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.320 
need to work with the speed of the wheel
and<00:00:16.180> if<00:00:16.750> the<00:00:17.410> wheel<00:00:17.890> starts<00:00:18.400> to<00:00:18.520> slow<00:00:18.789> down<00:00:19.000> as

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
and if the wheel starts to slow down as

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.210 
and if the wheel starts to slow down as
soon<00:00:19.450> as<00:00:19.600> you<00:00:19.720> put<00:00:19.900> any<00:00:20.110> strong<00:00:20.500> pressure<00:00:20.920> on

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
soon as you put any strong pressure on

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.240 
soon as you put any strong pressure on
it<00:00:21.430> then<00:00:21.670> that's<00:00:21.880> no<00:00:22.150> good<00:00:22.650> you're<00:00:23.650> using<00:00:23.920> then

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
it then that's no good you're using then

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.310 
it then that's no good you're using then
a<00:00:24.280> lot<00:00:24.610> of<00:00:24.760> your<00:00:24.970> own<00:00:25.150> strength<00:00:25.570> rather<00:00:26.020> than

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
a lot of your own strength rather than

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.010 
a lot of your own strength rather than
the<00:00:26.530> strength<00:00:26.830> of<00:00:27.100> the<00:00:27.220> wheel<00:00:30.360> this<00:00:31.360> is<00:00:31.660> where

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
the strength of the wheel this is where

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.740 
the strength of the wheel this is where
it's<00:00:32.200> very<00:00:32.770> important<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.879> control<00:00:34.329> of<00:00:34.600> the

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
it's very important the control of the

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.710 
it's very important the control of the
speed<00:00:35.079> because<00:00:35.559> you're<00:00:35.829> working<00:00:36.039> on<00:00:36.690> such<00:00:37.690> a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
speed because you're working on such a

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.040 
speed because you're working on such a
low<00:00:38.170> angle<00:00:38.590> you<00:00:39.280> certainly<00:00:39.700> don't<00:00:39.970> want<00:00:40.240> the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
low angle you certainly don't want the

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.990 
low angle you certainly don't want the
wheel<00:00:41.650> to<00:00:42.070> change<00:00:42.540> its<00:00:43.540> revolutions<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:45.430> to<00:00:45.880> be

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
wheel to change its revolutions or to be

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.600 
wheel to change its revolutions or to be
jerky<00:00:46.450> in<00:00:46.600> any<00:00:46.810> way<00:00:47.079> otherwise<00:00:47.610> definitely

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
jerky in any way otherwise definitely

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:58.830 
jerky in any way otherwise definitely
that<00:00:48.820> rim<00:00:49.060> is<00:00:49.210> going<00:00:49.270> to<00:00:49.480> draw

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.479 

another<00:00:59.840> aspect<00:01:00.470> of<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.800> Thomas<00:01:01.220> Stuart

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
another aspect of the Thomas Stuart

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.490 
another aspect of the Thomas Stuart
wheel<00:01:01.730> that<00:01:02.000> I<00:01:02.060> like<00:01:02.420> is<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.900> fact<00:01:03.140> that<00:01:03.260> you

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
wheel that I like is the fact that you

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.540 
wheel that I like is the fact that you
can<00:01:03.739> purchase<00:01:04.370> leg<00:01:04.879> extensions<00:01:05.720> I<00:01:06.560> have

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
can purchase leg extensions I have

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.790 
can purchase leg extensions I have
muscles<00:01:08.120> in<00:01:08.479> this<00:01:08.720> right<00:01:08.990> leg<00:01:09.260> that<00:01:09.560> don't

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
muscles in this right leg that don't

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.050 
muscles in this right leg that don't
work<00:01:10.010> very<00:01:10.040> well<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:11.200> used<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.380> be<00:01:12.500> able<00:01:12.800> to

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
work very well and used to be able to

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.510 
work very well and used to be able to
throw<00:01:14.060> in<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.869> squatting<00:01:15.229> kind<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:15.920> position

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
throw in the squatting kind of position

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.570 
throw in the squatting kind of position
but<00:01:16.760> now<00:01:17.080> with<00:01:18.080> this<00:01:18.259> difficulty<00:01:19.070> I'm<00:01:19.250> able<00:01:19.550> to

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
but now with this difficulty I'm able to

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.260 
but now with this difficulty I'm able to
race<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.300> wheel<00:01:20.479> to<00:01:21.200> accommodate<00:01:22.070> this<00:01:22.910> leg

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
race the wheel to accommodate this leg

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.840 
race the wheel to accommodate this leg
that<00:01:23.630> I<00:01:23.990> don't<00:01:24.619> have<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:25.009> pain<00:01:25.220> that<00:01:25.430> I<00:01:25.490> used

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
that I don't have the pain that I used

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.230 
that I don't have the pain that I used
to<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.470> you<00:01:27.470> can<00:01:27.650> adjust<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.250> leg<00:01:28.430> extensions

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
to and you can adjust the leg extensions

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.350 
to and you can adjust the leg extensions
to<00:01:29.479> almost<00:01:29.869> any<00:01:30.140> height<00:01:30.410> that<00:01:30.619> you<00:01:30.830> want<00:01:31.360> I've

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
to almost any height that you want I've

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.170 
to almost any height that you want I've
been<00:01:32.539> using<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.350> Thomas<00:01:33.950> Stuart<00:01:34.310> for<00:01:34.550> quite<00:01:35.149> a

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
been using the Thomas Stuart for quite a

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.359 
been using the Thomas Stuart for quite a
number<00:01:35.390> of<00:01:35.600> years<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.890> thing<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:37.340> I

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
number of years and the thing that I

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.210 
number of years and the thing that I
like<00:01:37.729> probably<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.810> most<00:01:39.140> is<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.740> size<00:01:40.009> of

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
like probably the most is the size of

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.050 
like probably the most is the size of
the<00:01:40.430> splash<00:01:40.759> pan<00:01:41.229> it's<00:01:42.229> nice<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.740> deep<00:01:43.060> which

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
the splash pan it's nice and deep which

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.410 
the splash pan it's nice and deep which
allows<00:01:44.450> you<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.930> clean<00:01:45.259> up<00:01:45.289> any<00:01:45.789> slurry<00:01:46.789> or<00:01:47.149> if

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
allows you to clean up any slurry or if

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.920 
allows you to clean up any slurry or if
you're<00:01:47.600> trimming<00:01:48.050> to<00:01:48.590> get<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.860> trimmings<00:01:49.340> out

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
you're trimming to get the trimmings out

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.260 
you're trimming to get the trimmings out
you<00:01:50.930> can<00:01:51.200> take<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.770> wheel<00:01:52.100> head<00:01:52.399> off<00:01:52.640> but<00:01:53.060> it's

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
you can take the wheel head off but it's

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.870 
you can take the wheel head off but it's
not<00:01:53.539> necessary<00:01:54.289> there's<00:01:55.160> plenty<00:01:55.550> of<00:01:55.580> room<00:01:55.820> for

of the size of it you can be trimming an
awful<00:02:02.420> lot<00:02:02.600> of<00:02:02.630> work<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.290> not<00:02:03.860> have<00:02:04.159> any
