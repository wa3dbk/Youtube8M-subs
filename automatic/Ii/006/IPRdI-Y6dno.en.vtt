00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 in a few years lydia has become a 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.609
 major actress of the protection of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.200
 the environment in his department the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.920
 come in by creating this health center of 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.750
 wildlife 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.309
 the young woman allows each year the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.310
 taking care of eight hundred birds and 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.990
 injured mammals or orphans for 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.560
 that the idea had to make many 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.410
 sacrifices 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.730
 to start with his career because it's 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.710
 while studying at the veterinary school 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.260
 that she has discovered this vocation 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.910
 and give up everything to invest in 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.910
 100% from his little protÃ©gÃ©s 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.289
 I do what I like I know why 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.730
 I get up every morning and every 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.559
 mornings without exception even at night 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.059
 since the animals to heal it eat 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.239
 every day but but that makes me 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.190
 happy so that's not good baths 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.659
 to all horizons 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.540
 only this one was a victim of a 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:57.030
 protective mesh of strawberries and lights 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.909
 and surrounded the right hind leg 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.409
 so we had to amputate the posterior he 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.320
 was almost at a stage of skepticism 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.399
 there are still well cleaned and 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.530
 disinfected 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.090
 because bristling it's a very animal 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.210
 pig and it's not him who will do his 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.210
 toilet 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.289
 acquia 12 it's a little weasel 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.409
 brought us three days ago 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.369
 discovery on a supermarket car park 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.799
 akira at three weeks is a small 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.500
 boy this is the first time they 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.119
 arrive at the care center and yet 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.060
 since 2007 that the care center is 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.979
 open we have 800 animals a year in 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.960
 average and this is a first 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.759
 it is an animal that is found that has been 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.340
 even classified harmful here 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.709
 unfortunately and there it is downgraded 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.330
 harmful after that there is still a lot 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.490
 of risks because he is not loved 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.860
 not liked by hunters for example 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.329
 and so it will be very thoughtful before 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.759
 know where is he going to be released 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.170
 it may be a park 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.670
 unfortunately it may not be the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.009
 freedom that we do not know yet we 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.989
 will see following the evolution of this animal 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.989
 is in need of a break 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.250
 veterinary nurse lydia could have 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.470
 choose a more lucrative business 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.570
 working in a cabinet she prefers 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.980
 it's 60 hours a week paid 20 at 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.110
 smic by his association 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.330
 a generosity that she transmitted to her 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.540
 son I 'm going to open the cage for you 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.730
 turtledoves not banging her away 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.770
 first the water the water is everyone 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.360
 I really like my mom and when he is 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.190
 sick actually it's me who's taking care of me 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.240
 we imagine that you are proud of what is being done 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.240
 even armand yes very 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.340
 so we go quickly because I received 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.810
 a call actually for a bird in 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.540
 distress it's apparently an owl 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.800
 middle duke and so I gave a 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.120
 go to the person in the square 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.120
 from the village to recover the animal 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.220
 hello hello it's okay but then it's 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.920
 a means of a way of the kwh is so they 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.860
 risk not leaving it was enough 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.510
 cold we found on the road we 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.920
 thought at first that he was he had 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.280
 been snapped up by a car and then at 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.129
 final 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.069
 in the end everything is fine the wings are 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.260
 unfortunately nothing broken so we mostly saw 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.959
 a state of weakness 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.310
 on the other hand there is a ball below 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.690
 yeah on the phone we could think of 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.660
 a pump problem since this is the 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.060
 season there I am safer maybe a 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.530
 last pack at the intestines 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.650
 good I not stress more I put 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.660
 in his box very well go but 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.549
 since then it seems obvious to me to take a 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.500
 wild animal that we do not have the right to 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.480
 keep at home more and have to have 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.040
 the abilities to take care of it and I 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.060
 think this is the best it is 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.980
 take him to a health center for 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.340
 they should be released as soon as possible 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.340
 its natural environment 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.720
 for the female Long - eared Owl 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.720
 direction clinic 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.640
 and we will 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.890
 here with doctor mercier lydia to 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.280
 find listening and assistance is 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.550
 purely inflammatory that has no offer 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.530
 residuals then the treatment 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.120
 antibiotic and and anti inflammatory 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.530
 there is nothing else to do 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.150
 I really need the doctor mercier 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.220
 to be more precise in fact in the 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.540
 care and give maximum chances to 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.610
 the animal so I have a lot of luck 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.350
 to have this clinic actually just to 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.240
 side we try to go the most 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.670
 far away 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.290
 first to reward her for all 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.050
 efforts she makes and then after 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.150
 because we are also our profession 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.800
 so it's a challenge 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.540
 we do not really limit ourselves in 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.770
 does if something can be cheated 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.310
 we try it 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.310
 thank you so much 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.550
 lydia and louis still have a lot to do 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.750
 in the other large aviaries 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.750
 raptors continue their convalescence 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.980
 luis is forever scared of 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.860
 handle birds like this ever 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:13.010
 I feel good with it relaxes me 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.830
 raptor has always been my favorite and I 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:19.550
 finds that intelligence is huge and 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.340
 that a beauty sublimates the rate of 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.900
 success is in the 85% on the 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.580
 raptors then when those of the releases to 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.110
 the hand there is always something that 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.770
 that there will be an emotion 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.320
 special 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.320
 so you put your arm like that facts
