table just like like this and they'll be

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.309 
table just like like this and they'll be
sitting<00:01:47.300> on<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.509> top<00:01:47.690> of<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.869> table<00:01:48.200> like

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
sitting on the top of the table like

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.499 
sitting on the top of the table like
that<00:01:48.350> there's<00:01:48.740> four<00:01:48.950> of<00:01:49.159> them<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:49.490> just<00:01:50.299> take

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
that there's four of them you just take

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.010 
that there's four of them you just take
these<00:01:50.890> out<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:53.950> unscrew<00:01:54.950> them<00:01:55.720> slide<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.869> T

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
these out and unscrew them slide the T

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.590 
these out and unscrew them slide the T
nut<00:01:57.200> back<00:01:57.380> in<00:02:02.229> use<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:04.000> bolt<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.179> slide<00:02:05.450> it

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
nut back in use the bolt to slide it

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.170 
nut back in use the bolt to slide it
over<00:02:08.049> and<00:02:09.049> then<00:02:09.470> just<00:02:09.729> pop<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:11.060> there

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
over and then just pop that in there

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.460 
over and then just pop that in there
like<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:15.250> actually<00:02:16.250> might<00:02:16.579> be<00:02:16.609> easier<00:02:17.060> to

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
like that actually might be easier to

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:25.900 
like that actually might be easier to
bring<00:02:18.470> this<00:02:19.329> out<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.920> attach<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.519> before<00:02:25.820> you

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
bring this out and attach it before you

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.170 
bring this out and attach it before you
slide<00:02:26.209> it<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:27.489> think<00:02:28.489> that's<00:02:28.760> probably<00:02:28.970> the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
slide it in I think that's probably the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.690 
slide it in I think that's probably the
way<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.299> do<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:30.400> these<00:02:31.400> uh<00:02:33.130> T<00:02:34.130> nuts<00:02:34.310> are<00:02:34.519> just

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
way to do it these uh T nuts are just

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.670 
way to do it these uh T nuts are just
little<00:02:35.920> square<00:02:36.920> pieces<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.430> metal<00:02:38.410> not<00:02:39.410> really

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
little square pieces of metal not really

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
little square pieces of metal not really
T<00:02:39.920> nuts<00:02:40.630> but<00:02:41.630> uh

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
T nuts but uh

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.860 
T nuts but uh
take<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.450> couple<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.870> those<00:02:45.569> put<00:02:46.569> them<00:02:46.690> on<00:02:46.780> the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
take a couple of those put them on the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.600 
take a couple of those put them on the
vise<00:02:47.019> put<00:02:47.410> them<00:02:47.500> through<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.800> holes<00:02:48.340> in<00:02:48.489> the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
vise put them through the holes in the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:03:05.190 
vise put them through the holes in the
vise<00:02:59.010> and<00:03:01.680> line<00:03:02.680> those<00:03:02.890> peanuts<00:03:03.400> up<00:03:03.900> with<00:03:04.900> a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
vise and line those peanuts up with a

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:13.740 
vise and line those peanuts up with a
slot<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.739> table<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:10.660> then<00:03:11.230> now<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:13.569> can

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
slot in the table and then now you can

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.330 
slot in the table and then now you can
cinch<00:03:14.019> that<00:03:14.080> down<00:03:14.910> now<00:03:15.910> you'll<00:03:16.090> want<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:17.340> line

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
cinch that down now you'll want to line

you also get there's two cutters here's
the<00:04:00.250> other<00:04:00.340> cutter<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:03.370> let's<00:04:04.120> see<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:05.440> that's

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
the other cutter and let's see so that's

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.190 
the other cutter and let's see so that's
another<00:04:06.480> double-ended<00:04:07.480> end<00:04:07.720> mill<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.859> then<00:04:09.819> a

collet<00:04:14.620> so<00:04:14.859> basically<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:15.730> machine<00:04:16.000> comes

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
collet so basically the machine comes

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.819 
collet so basically the machine comes
with<00:04:16.450> that<00:04:16.539> all<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.109> tooling<00:04:17.440> you<00:04:17.530> need<00:04:17.680> to

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
with that all the tooling you need to

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.360 
with that all the tooling you need to
get<00:04:17.979> started<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:19.650> start<00:04:20.650> cutting<00:04:20.829> right<00:04:21.130> away

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
get started and start cutting right away

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.379 
get started and start cutting right away
with<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.630> exception<00:04:23.050> of<00:04:23.139> perhaps<00:04:24.210> diode<00:04:25.210> test

indicator to get everything lined up
properly<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:32.280> but<00:04:33.280> yeah<00:04:33.490> that's<00:04:33.940> that's

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
properly and but yeah that's that's

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.330 
properly and but yeah that's that's
pretty<00:04:34.660> much<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:35.050> now<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.289> way<00:04:35.410> these<00:04:35.560> year

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
pretty much it now the way these year

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
lip at the top and these spring Kaulitz

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.930 
lip at the top and these spring Kaulitz
snap<00:04:52.599> in<00:04:52.840> from<00:04:53.110> one<00:04:53.260> side

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
snap in from one side

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.690 
snap in from one side
and<00:04:55.060> once<00:04:56.020> they<00:04:56.170> snap<00:04:56.440> in<00:04:56.650> they<00:04:57.370> shouldn't

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
and once they snap in they shouldn't

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.660 
and once they snap in they shouldn't
fall<00:04:57.880> out<00:04:58.060> on<00:04:58.240> their<00:04:58.390> own<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:59.740> if<00:05:00.400> they<00:05:00.550> don't

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
fall out on their own and if they don't

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.730 
fall out on their own and if they don't
then<00:05:01.090> you've<00:05:01.210> got<00:05:01.390> it<00:05:01.420> in<00:05:01.780> there<00:05:02.110> right<00:05:02.350> if<00:05:02.650> you

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
then you've got it in there right if you

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.990 
then you've got it in there right if you
hold<00:05:02.920> it<00:05:02.980> upside<00:05:03.310> down<00:05:03.340> it<00:05:03.580> shouldn't<00:05:03.850> fall

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
hold it upside down it shouldn't fall

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.260 
hold it upside down it shouldn't fall
out<00:05:04.210> because<00:05:04.390> it<00:05:04.930> should<00:05:05.140> be<00:05:05.230> held<00:05:05.440> in<00:05:05.620> by<00:05:05.830> that

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
out because it should be held in by that

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.760 
out because it should be held in by that
non<00:05:07.270> concentric<00:05:08.190> ring<00:05:09.190> inside<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:10.770> they

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
non concentric ring inside and they

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.220 
non concentric ring inside and they
should<00:05:11.950> pop<00:05:12.130> out<00:05:12.340> by<00:05:13.090> pressing<00:05:13.390> on<00:05:13.690> the<00:05:13.810> collet

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
should pop out by pressing on the collet

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.380 
should pop out by pressing on the collet
from<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.470> other<00:05:14.590> side<00:05:14.890> or<00:05:15.610> turning<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.270> this

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
from the other side or turning it this

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.420 
from the other side or turning it this
way<00:05:16.630> and<00:05:17.380> it<00:05:17.470> should<00:05:17.500> pop<00:05:17.740> out<00:05:17.920> of<00:05:18.100> that<00:05:18.190> little

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
way and it should pop out of that little

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.270 
way and it should pop out of that little
ring<00:05:18.960> but<00:05:19.960> once<00:05:20.110> you<00:05:20.230> got<00:05:20.380> it<00:05:20.500> in<00:05:20.590> there<00:05:20.800> and<00:05:21.190> it

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
ring but once you got it in there and it

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.090 
ring but once you got it in there and it
doesn't<00:05:21.430> fall<00:05:21.730> out<00:05:22.440> then<00:05:23.440> you<00:05:23.590> just<00:05:23.740> basically

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
doesn't fall out then you just basically

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.860 
doesn't fall out then you just basically
slide<00:05:24.340> it<00:05:24.610> up<00:05:24.700> in<00:05:24.880> here<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:27.460> and<00:05:28.300> screw<00:05:28.600> it<00:05:28.720> on

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
slide it up in here and and screw it on

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.840 
slide it up in here and and screw it on
and<00:05:30.540> and<00:05:31.540> then<00:05:32.080> tighten<00:05:32.440> up<00:05:32.530> the<00:05:32.770> this<00:05:33.580> with<00:05:33.820> a

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
and and then tighten up the this with a

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.240 
and and then tighten up the this with a
with<00:05:34.240> a<00:05:34.270> wrench<00:05:34.570> and<00:05:34.840> then<00:05:34.930> you<00:05:35.890> know<00:05:36.040> you're

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
with a wrench and then you know you're

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.030 
with a wrench and then you know you're
ready<00:05:36.400> to<00:05:36.520> go<00:05:37.200> so<00:05:38.200> let's<00:05:38.230> see<00:05:38.650> what<00:05:38.800> we<00:05:38.890> got

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:46.410 
on this little collet do the same thing
with<00:06:39.010> the<00:06:39.130> end<00:06:39.280> mill<00:06:39.630> and<00:06:40.630> that<00:06:45.300> should<00:06:46.300> just

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:46.420 
with the end mill and that should just

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.140 
with the end mill and that should just
slide<00:06:46.750> up<00:06:46.960> in<00:06:47.310> into<00:06:48.310> the<00:06:48.430> collet<00:06:48.760> like<00:06:48.910> that

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
slide up in into the collet like that

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:56.460 
slide up in into the collet like that
and<00:06:50.160> then<00:06:52.140> take<00:06:53.140> that<00:06:53.430> and<00:06:54.900> mount<00:06:55.900> that<00:06:56.140> into

and then take that and mount that into

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:06.649 
and then take that and mount that into
our<00:06:58.470> collet<00:06:59.470> nut

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:06.659 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:09.179 

actually<00:07:07.659> you<00:07:07.719> probably<00:07:07.749> should<00:07:08.199> mount<00:07:08.979> them

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:09.189 
actually you probably should mount them

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:11.249 
actually you probably should mount them
call<00:07:09.999> it<00:07:10.150> into<00:07:10.330> the<00:07:10.419> collet<00:07:10.749> net<00:07:10.900> before<00:07:11.199> you

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:11.259 
call it into the collet net before you

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:16.290 
call it into the collet net before you
put<00:07:11.409> the<00:07:11.499> cutter<00:07:11.710> in<00:07:11.909> makes<00:07:12.909> it<00:07:13.029> easier<00:07:15.300> and

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.300 
put the cutter in makes it easier and

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.980 
put the cutter in makes it easier and
then<00:07:16.599> slide<00:07:16.960> the<00:07:17.080> cutter<00:07:17.319> into<00:07:17.710> the<00:07:18.899> end<00:07:19.899> of

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 
then slide the cutter into the end of

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:28.220 
then slide the cutter into the end of
the<00:07:20.050> collet<00:07:20.409> and<00:07:21.240> then

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.230 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.240 

and<00:07:29.040> there<00:07:29.460> you<00:07:29.580> go<00:07:30.560> that's<00:07:31.560> all<00:07:31.740> there<00:07:31.890> is<00:07:31.920> to

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.250 
and there you go that's all there is to

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.920 
and there you go that's all there is to
it<00:07:32.430> I<00:07:32.610> don't<00:07:32.820> know<00:07:32.940> if<00:07:33.000> your<00:07:33.120> cutter<00:07:33.330> now

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930 
it I don't know if your cutter now

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.810 
it I don't know if your cutter now
before<00:07:34.260> we<00:07:34.350> can<00:07:34.500> do<00:07:34.590> any<00:07:34.770> cutting<00:07:35.460> or<00:07:35.670> anything

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:35.820 
before we can do any cutting or anything

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.810 
before we can do any cutting or anything
like<00:07:36.000> that<00:07:36.060> we'll<00:07:36.420> need<00:07:36.540> to<00:07:36.600> align<00:07:36.930> this<00:07:37.820> vise

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:38.820 
like that we'll need to align this vise

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.890 
like that we'll need to align this vise
up<00:07:39.120> with<00:07:39.660> the<00:07:40.760> spindle<00:07:41.760> and<00:07:42.000> then<00:07:42.660> we'll<00:07:42.810> be

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 
up with the spindle and then we'll be

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.380 
up with the spindle and then we'll be
ready<00:07:43.050> to<00:07:43.440> try<00:07:44.280> it<00:07:44.340> out<00:07:44.490> so<00:07:44.850> that's<00:07:45.090> it<00:07:45.270> for

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:45.390 
ready to try it out so that's it for

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.750 
ready to try it out so that's it for
this<00:07:45.510> video<00:07:45.720> try<00:07:46.350> and<00:07:46.440> keep<00:07:46.560> them<00:07:46.760> short

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:47.760 
this video try and keep them short

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.520 
this video try and keep them short
enough<00:07:48.030> that<00:07:48.060> anybody<00:07:48.930> will<00:07:49.050> actually<00:07:49.350> watch

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:49.530 
enough that anybody will actually watch

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.520 
enough that anybody will actually watch
them<00:07:49.770> so<00:07:50.190> I'll<00:07:50.640> do<00:07:50.790> the<00:07:51.110> lining<00:07:52.110> up<00:07:52.230> the<00:07:52.320> vise

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:52.530 
them so I'll do the lining up the vise

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.530 
them so I'll do the lining up the vise
in<00:07:52.740> the<00:07:52.830> next<00:07:53.070> video<00:07:53.310> that's<00:07:53.940> it<00:07:54.210> for<00:07:54.420> now

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:54.540 
in the next video that's it for now

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.440
