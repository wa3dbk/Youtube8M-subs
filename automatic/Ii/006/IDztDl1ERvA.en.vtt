00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.680
 many countries 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 it's difficult 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.240
 in the following years this act of obedience gave great power to 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.010

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.980
 children seem to humiliate 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.300
 and turn away from your sins 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.480

 this is rare our land 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.320
 in many countries, children are not only 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.929

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.029
 it does not matter much the size of the meeting place 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.520
 What really matters is that Christians find a place to gather together to spend 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.549
 time together summoning god for the lost 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.650
