get<00:00:00.780> a<00:00:00.870> here<00:00:01.410> I've<00:00:01.530> got<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.770> pair<00:00:02.070> of<00:00:02.330> RNA

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:03.440 
get a here I've got a pair of RNA

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.099 
get a here I've got a pair of RNA
hazards<00:00:05.000> with<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.029> bit<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.359> damage<00:00:06.569> on<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.930> lens

polarized black lens first we need to

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.030 
polarized black lens first we need to
remove<00:00:41.340> our<00:00:41.730> damaged<00:00:42.239> lenses<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.800> very

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
remove our damaged lenses this is very

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.100 
remove our damaged lenses this is very
easy<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.670> turn<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> glasses<00:00:45.360> over<00:00:45.780> and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
easy you just turn the glasses over and

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.319 
easy you just turn the glasses over and
with<00:00:46.260> pinching<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> frame<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:47.850> your<00:00:47.879> thumb

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
with pinching the frame with your thumb

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.770 
with pinching the frame with your thumb
and<00:00:48.510> index<00:00:48.600> finger<00:00:49.170> pull<00:00:49.829> apart<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.570> twist<00:00:51.570> in

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and index finger pull apart and twist in

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.110 
and index finger pull apart and twist in
woods<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.920> pull<00:00:53.100> apart<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.670> twist<00:00:53.940> in

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
woods so just pull apart and twist in

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.139 
woods so just pull apart and twist in
there<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.079> nice<00:00:55.289> strong<00:00:55.920> frame<00:00:56.399> these<00:00:56.670> hazards

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
there a nice strong frame these hazards

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.709 
there a nice strong frame these hazards
but<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> little<00:00:58.379> firm<00:00:58.649> pressure<00:00:59.719> firm

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
but with a little firm pressure firm

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.689 
but with a little firm pressure firm
action<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.379> too<00:01:01.590> strong<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:01.920> firm

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
action not too strong just firm

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.090 
action not too strong just firm
that'll<00:01:03.120> pop<00:01:03.300> out<00:01:03.510> quite<00:01:03.930> easily<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.619> once

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that'll pop out quite easily so once

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.640 
that'll pop out quite easily so once
again<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:07.850> pinching<00:01:08.960> pulling<00:01:09.960> out<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.500> can

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
again it's pinching pulling out you can

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.440 
again it's pinching pulling out you can
see<00:01:10.830> I've<00:01:10.950> made<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.130> little<00:01:11.280> gap<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.330> they're

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
see I've made a little gap and they're

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.550 
see I've made a little gap and they're
just<00:01:12.600> popping<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.080> out

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.130 

okay<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.250> then<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.460> give<00:01:17.640> our<00:01:17.850> new<00:01:18.150> lenses<00:01:18.869> here

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
okay so then we give our new lenses here

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.630 
okay so then we give our new lenses here
from<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:20.250> sunglass<00:01:20.729> fix<00:01:22.040> put<00:01:23.040> them<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.310> we're

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
from the sunglass fix put them in we're

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.450 
from the sunglass fix put them in we're
gonna<00:01:23.820> start<00:01:24.180> with<00:01:24.650> bottom<00:01:25.650> outside<00:01:26.040> corner

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
gonna start with bottom outside corner

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.940 
gonna start with bottom outside corner
first<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.150> work<00:01:27.750> our<00:01:27.960> way<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.200> towards<00:01:28.799> this

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
first and work our way up towards this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.859 
first and work our way up towards this
more<00:01:29.250> flexible<00:01:29.460> part<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> lens<00:01:30.479> here

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
more flexible part of the lens here

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.550 
more flexible part of the lens here
so<00:01:32.360> popping<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:36.030> outside<00:01:36.450> corner<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.020> I'm

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
so popping the outside corner in I'm

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.020 
so popping the outside corner in I'm
going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> use<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.100> same<00:01:38.340> action<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.820> pulling

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
going to use the same action of pulling

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.749 
going to use the same action of pulling
the<00:01:39.329> frame<00:01:39.570> apart<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.320> twisting<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.340> popping

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the frame apart and twisting and popping

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.770 
the frame apart and twisting and popping
the<00:01:41.909> lens<00:01:42.119> in

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.609 

that's<00:01:45.780> snapped<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:47.159> no<00:01:47.369> trouble<00:01:47.880> at<00:01:47.909> all

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
that's snapped in with no trouble at all

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.960 
that's snapped in with no trouble at all
I'm<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.649> walking<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.369> thumbs<00:01:50.610> around<00:01:50.790> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
I'm just walking the thumbs around to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:01.440 
I'm just walking the thumbs around to
make<00:01:51.090> sure<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.570> place

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:09.219 

don't<00:02:04.869> just<00:02:05.869> like<00:02:06.049> that<00:02:07.780> when<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:08.840> order<00:02:09.110> your
