we're going to do some instructions in
Reverse<00:00:14.840> first<00:00:15.840> you'll<00:00:16.020> need<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> basic<00:00:16.710> set<00:00:16.890> of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
Reverse first you'll need a basic set of

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.860 
Reverse first you'll need a basic set of
socket<00:00:17.460> wrenches<00:00:17.789> maybe<00:00:18.180> pair<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.570> scissors

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:18.870 
socket wrenches maybe pair of scissors

for<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.110> rope<00:00:19.290> and<00:00:19.730> then<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:21.240> will<00:00:21.390> need<00:00:21.510> to

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
for the rope and then you will need to

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.060 
for the rope and then you will need to
disassemble<00:00:21.960> along<00:00:22.410> alright<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.890> first
