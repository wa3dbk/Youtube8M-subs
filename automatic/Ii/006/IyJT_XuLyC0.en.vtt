people really studied the art of
blocking<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.040> shot<00:02:44.630> it's<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.690> great<00:02:45.959> Intimidator

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
blocking a shot it's a great Intimidator

it's<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.569> great<00:02:48.870> thing<00:02:49.110> but<00:02:49.319> it's<00:02:49.470> greater<00:02:49.769> if

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
it's a great thing but it's greater if

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.699 
it's a great thing but it's greater if
you<00:02:50.670> block<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.180> shot<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.720> come<00:02:52.440> down<00:02:52.470> with

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
carried away that every time a guy is

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.050 
carried away that every time a guy is
going<00:02:58.950> someplace<00:02:59.280> you're<00:02:59.639> going<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.819> block<00:03:00.030> a

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
what we just demonstrated can be done

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.299 
what we just demonstrated can be done
with<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.489> great<00:03:05.700> player<00:03:06.060> like<00:03:06.180> Sampson<00:03:08.060> work<00:03:09.060> on
