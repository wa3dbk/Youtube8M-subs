like in the fold of my crease and giving
more<00:03:01.260> depth<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.770> then<00:03:02.130> after<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:03.120> set<00:03:03.420> in

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
more depth and then after that is set in

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.570 
more depth and then after that is set in
there<00:03:03.840> I'm<00:03:04.110> just<00:03:04.620> going<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.980> blend<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.400> out

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
there I'm just going to blend it out

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.449 
there I'm just going to blend it out
with<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:06.180> same<00:03:06.390> brush<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.870> use<00:03:06.900> which<00:03:07.830> was<00:03:08.190> I

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
with that same brush I use which was I

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.120 
with that same brush I use which was I
believe<00:03:08.520> it's<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:08.940> sigma<00:03:09.300> 2<00:03:09.450> 2<00:03:09.480> 4<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.140> then

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
believe it's a sigma 2 2 4 and then

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.180 
believe it's a sigma 2 2 4 and then
place<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.000> white<00:03:12.330> back<00:03:12.570> on<00:03:12.810> because<00:03:13.050> it<00:03:13.590> did

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
place the white back on because it did

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.360 
place the white back on because it did
fall<00:03:14.400> out<00:03:14.580> while<00:03:14.940> blending<00:03:15.709> then<00:03:16.709> using<00:03:17.040> my<00:03:17.130> LA

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
fall out while blending then using my LA

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.420 
fall out while blending then using my LA
Colors<00:03:18.000> liquid<00:03:18.840> liner<00:03:19.110> I'm<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:19.739> going<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.070> do

Colors liquid liner I'm just going to do
a<00:03:21.530> winged<00:03:22.530> line<00:03:22.980> her<00:03:23.370> wing<00:03:23.940> liner<00:03:24.180> looked<00:03:24.540> a

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
a winged line her wing liner looked a

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.199 
a winged line her wing liner looked a
bit<00:03:24.750> thick<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.890> wasn't<00:03:26.190> too<00:03:26.430> winged<00:03:26.700> out<00:03:26.940> it

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
was a little bit of a short wing so

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.430 
was a little bit of a short wing so
that's<00:03:30.269> basically<00:03:30.540> what<00:03:30.989> I'm<00:03:31.110> trying<00:03:31.410> to

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
replicate here and yeah that's basically

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:43.340
