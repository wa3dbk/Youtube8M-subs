00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.630
 good a new preseason begins 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.509
 that left the other tournament personally 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:15.599
 will be true or not happy to start from 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.000
 return with much desire with expectations 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.830
 new and the truth that the other for very 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.140
 tournament served me 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.710
 personally because I think I grew up 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.910
 you can play a lot game ramÃ³n 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.540
 gave me the confidence that that is 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.100
 important and good that's what I rescue 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.890
 most important in your position and 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.570
 continuity the difference of the other 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.970
 stage with almeyda who was flying for 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.060
 left and a couple of matches yes the 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.000
 true that 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.280
 I could play when came the possibility of 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.430
 play in my position that was what I 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.830
 I know how to play as a kid 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.540
 put and good luckily they gave me 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.500
 the things 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.200
 made a couple of goals the truth that was 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.600
 cute cute semester that is a position 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.489
 different or because I say yes on the move 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.040
 hooks lived more goal scorer more 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.260
 mediapunta you discovered another way or is 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.860
 one thing that implements him up to what 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.380
 I already knew no no no no I always deal in 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.250
 that position of reaching the arc of being 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.520
 always there 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:26.380
 I love being vertical, making goals 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.420
 to play my companions hope but 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.550
 luckily it happened and now continue 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.710
 improving not staying with those who are missing 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.200
 the team was supported by the last 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.380
 championship to walk a little more and to 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.020
 first to the first place and I think that 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.229
 a little have that tranquility in front 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.640
 of the goal to convert the goals 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.950
 I think that is the touch that we lack 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.810
 but good now let's try to 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.390
 achieve it I think we're going for a good 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.130
 way and that is important missing 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.050
 also the goals what perhaps is missing a 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.910
 scorer as in the championship happens 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.220
 now it is the Chinese is funes mori 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.320
 also andra but you can iturbe mora 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.220
 who gave him a pair of goals also yes 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.009
 yes but we have 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.690
 and many good forwards I think that 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.750
 it is simply at the end that aim 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.030
 and so things are going to be taken for another 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.680
 side that I'm still not with 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.790
 you something that affects you having in 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.130
 account all the inference has the 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.010
 campus and on the team and is a player 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.810
 extraordinary is the truth that is a 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.870
 fundamental piece but but good hopefully 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.090
 for his sake and for being able to go 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.640
 us because because as a person and 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.310
 as a footballer he does us very well hopefully 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.900
 that what is for what is 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.790
 He mentions that maybe he can come to you 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.950
 it affects something you see it knows it is that 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.080
 maybe they can play together or that 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.860
 I can contribute to the team if I believe that 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.370
 I wish I wish they could go so I think it's going to 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.590
 give your best for river 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.599
 whenever you're here, you're going to have 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.910
 competition that the good thing about football 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.540
 have competition 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.000
 decline not know but I think if you come 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.860
 will give the best for the club of another 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.860
 new preseason in jumps as the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.710
 first time today what do you expect me to 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.440
 you need to affirm on the river and already 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.710
 be a full player 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.780
 and the truth that many things we have 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.640
 much more prominence 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.400
 grab the ball be constantly 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.280
 on the move try to achieve those 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.620
 things that I'm missing for good for 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.660
 follow this road the reinforcements say 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.430
 the management that today presented carbon 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.170
 what can come that can bring you and 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.980
 also one that was mentioned but that 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.590
 maybe it will not come 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.000
 aimar someone that you what you are very much 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.540
 in football 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.640
 yes all the reinforcements bulls that come 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.360
 it's going to be for the best they're always going to 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.360
 bring many things 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.599
 they do not always have to be positive 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.530
 for the group that's important and 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.330
 I think that this way we get along and the 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.700
 things that can contribute will serve us 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.890
 of a lot of help finally there is a lot of talk 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.720
 of the players to sell today maybe 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.819
 you are not mentioned so much this takes it 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.830
 something calm as to have 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.590
 only your head in ribery and achieve 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.209
 what you want is an advance more like 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.669
 player as we have been showing 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.760
 past championship I am I have my head 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.500
 henrique but today I love this 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.590
 club I'm a fan of this club 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:31.150
 I am a partner my whole family is a member of 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:34.230
 little one and here one never wants 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.180
 but I'm not calm what 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.580
 that I'm thinking here, here I am 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.580
 good and good, I'll keep thinking like that
