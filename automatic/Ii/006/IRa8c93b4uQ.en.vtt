00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.200
 of person who entered me goal in this 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.390
 cut some do it for fame others what 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.610

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.380

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.620
 they will have to put things in their place 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.080
 it sounds strange if I tell them I do not profit and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.210
 it's my job remember not only do I want that 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.190
 already said it god live a weird and lived 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.809
 between lagoons of ink I feel in 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.059
 extinction as it happens with clients 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.250
 that now the soda predominates in some 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.260
 accounts before you value less the letter that 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.299
 like christa the coffers that I value 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.489
 the cards are on the walls 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.080
 silver the pieces will be networks will be that 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.180
 I do not like a couple of pipelines a day 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.580
 many clever and messes with whores 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.770
 junk or everything is going very fast I live 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.960
 everyone stuck together it was enjoyed 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.420
 more in the past evolution has come 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.700
 in the form of market and then they ask me 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.880
 why the fuck I get angry I talk and say 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.030
 many listen and do not say anything I release 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.920
 mind caged from what I see I do not believe 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.840
 nothing else you have captivated with paraphernalia 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.790
 makeup and you want to change 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.860
 television network but that's the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.350
 chain that binds your vision 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.210
 life insane your mind flattens out late 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.250
 to be yesterday early to be tomorrow 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.110
 I play with them as an annoyance in the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.420
 global economy since it would not go out 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.610
 why is not your funeral or god or 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 Owner since I was small, I'm still in sleep 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.740
 constant effort but glory is a whore 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.810
 superficial nymphomaniac obsessed by the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.340
 empty and artificial appearance inside 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.650
 a criminal state or in a society 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.570
 blind in charge of the dirty work as 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.670
 vincent vega seems that everything 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.950
 you talk I've already heard that as the day of 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.780
 the marmot becomes repetitive invisible 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.550
 and addictive I forget because I write 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.770
 only music is the medicine that 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.410
 keeps alive nothing is impossible while 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.720
 there is nothing so believable reason more than you 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.820
 illusion we went to talk with sorry 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.070
 that emotion in which that is the drug 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.920
 that creates addiction, nothing is impossible 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.959
 as long as there's reason nothing so believable anymore 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.450
 that your illusion we turn to action 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.489
 we feel that emotion but it is born that is the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.500
 drug that creates us addictions I speak 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.209
 of music that forgives you correct 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.670
 some do it for pasta for others it is 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.620
 an exit to a way of life to think 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.049
 a flight in a few years the poor woman 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.800
 of rap was left a widow and see that I did not 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.390
 like to keep silent 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.610
 things what for you is a rapper 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.290
 for me is the rose prey no matter what 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.120
 what happens if there are nuns less bears 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.010
 they burst the deepest they burial 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.810
 in your common things that I leave 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.820
 unpunished in this battle I am one of those who 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.830
 to do rap, he has to spare with a tracksuit and 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.510
 with beer at the bar hesitate to 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.670
 ingenuity style and not car bombs 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.890
 or chin face clothes if they seem 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.480
 bitches but with less dignity I laugh at 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.790
 they like TV do it with rap 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.920

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.840

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.500
 the teeth fear us the same and 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.660
 enclosed you hear the maximum acm 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.580
 I started my career years ago and I do not look for 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.190
 goal others raise their life I had see if 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.720
 it sounds the reds the sun comes out 40 degrees in 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.700
 the balcony a trip with magicians more 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.190
 precise that the hawk's eye to the local 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.310
 with folios and phrasings we already have fear 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.170
 write with a head more reason 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.390
 look boy I did not fill stadiums but 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.070
 elf farming more diverse of the outskirts 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.350
 sanchis that go from star but have not 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.480
 leave the neighborhood fashions as a passenger 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.340
 cycle if the rays does not matter what you do 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.350
 you can not stop what you want 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.420
 conquer inviting her to dinner and going 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.720
 inside your mind and it does not let you think 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.520
 you know that the next step is the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.640
 look everywhere without knowing what to say 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.160
 You want to get away but you can not run only 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.200
 there is an option and the option is to flow leaves 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.270
 to intuit what may happen to live 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.660
 nothing is impossible while there is reason 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.860
 nothing is incredible more than your illusion 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.720
 we went to talk with we felt that 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.940
 emotion in the park that is the water 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.640
 that creates addiction, nothing is impossible 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.830
 while there is reason nothing so incredible 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.260
 more than your illusion we turn to action 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.030
 we feel that emotion but this is the 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.030
 drug that creates addictions
