00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
ground target I think we'll be safe to

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:34.420 
ground target I think we'll be safe to
guess<00:01:24.080> that<00:01:24.380> these<00:01:25.039> are<00:01:25.399> tapped<00:01:26.119> jets

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
in the scene is this incredible recoil

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.050 
in the scene is this incredible recoil
oh<00:02:30.510> yeah<00:02:31.200> granted<00:02:31.800> that<00:02:31.950> he<00:02:32.130> does<00:02:32.760> have<00:02:33.000> some

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
oh yeah granted that he does have some

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.610 
oh yeah granted that he does have some
sort<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.420> scope<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:33.989> gun<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.470> is

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
sort of scope on this gun and it is

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.580 
sort of scope on this gun and it is
going<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.890> amplify<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.430> recoil<00:02:36.030> but<00:02:36.900> even

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
going to amplify the recoil but even

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.960 
going to amplify the recoil but even
still<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.890> recoil<00:02:38.549> looks<00:02:38.700> pretty

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
still the recoil looks pretty

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.940 
still the recoil looks pretty
substantial<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.320> gotta<00:02:40.530> get<00:02:40.709> ready<00:02:40.799> to

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
substantial so you gotta get ready to

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.580 
substantial so you gotta get ready to
burst<00:02:41.130> fire

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590

about this gun that is holding nowadays

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.490 
about this gun that is holding nowadays
pretty<00:02:50.330> dark<00:02:50.569> so<00:02:50.750> it's<00:02:50.900> kind<00:02:51.050> of<00:02:51.080> hard<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.319> make

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
pretty dark so it's kind of hard to make

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.440 
pretty dark so it's kind of hard to make
out<00:02:51.650> what<00:02:51.830> kind<00:02:52.069> of<00:02:52.099> gun<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.459> but<00:02:52.790> based<00:02:53.330> on

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
out what kind of gun it is but based on

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.240 
out what kind of gun it is but based on
the<00:02:53.510> shortness<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.260> muzzle<00:02:54.680> I'm<00:02:54.890> going<00:02:55.190> to

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
the shortness of the muzzle I'm going to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.780 
the shortness of the muzzle I'm going to
speculate<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:55.819> this<00:02:56.330> is<00:02:56.540> either<00:02:56.780> an<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:58.160> 91

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
carbine or a PDR SMG and it also looks
