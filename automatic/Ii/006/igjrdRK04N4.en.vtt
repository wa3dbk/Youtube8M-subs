basically i'll move it so you guys can
see<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.430> slice<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:56.969> straight<00:00:57.420> down<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.840> middle

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
see I slice it straight down the middle

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.689 
see I slice it straight down the middle
and<00:00:58.640> then<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.760> slice<00:01:00.090> both<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.199> those<00:01:01.379> again<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
and then I slice both of those again to

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.969 
and then I slice both of those again to
make<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.030> bores<00:01:03.539> down<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.140> other<00:01:04.320> middle<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
make it bores down the other middle and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.670 
make it bores down the other middle and
then<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.640> take<00:01:06.119> each<00:01:06.510> side<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.049> stack<00:01:07.320> them<00:01:07.500> so

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
then I take each side and stack them so

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.590 
then I take each side and stack them so
that<00:01:07.710> they<00:01:07.920> kind<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.220> measure<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
that they kind of measure like this and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.789 
that they kind of measure like this and
then<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.350> slice<00:01:10.650> those<00:01:10.979> down<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.610> middle<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
then I slice those down the middle and

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.300 
then I slice those down the middle and
then<00:01:14.659> after<00:01:15.659> you've<00:01:15.810> sliced<00:01:16.049> both<00:01:16.380> those<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.220> I

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
then after you've sliced both those in I

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.710 
then after you've sliced both those in I
stack<00:01:17.670> them<00:01:17.880> because<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.299> goes<00:01:18.450> quicker

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
stack them because then it goes quicker

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.020 
stack them because then it goes quicker
but<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.070> after<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.400> slice<00:01:20.610> both<00:01:20.850> of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
but and then after you slice both of

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.200 
but and then after you slice both of
those<00:01:21.890> isolate<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.250> fuller<00:01:23.580> ones<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
those isolate the fuller ones on the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:34.540 
those isolate the fuller ones on the
middle<00:01:26.060> and

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.800 

okay<00:01:35.550> so<00:01:36.330> so<00:01:36.990> um<00:01:37.320> after<00:01:38.190> you<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.850> sliced<00:01:39.510> up

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
okay so so um after you have sliced up

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.060 
okay so so um after you have sliced up
you<00:01:40.050> get<00:01:40.230> these<00:01:40.410> little<00:01:42.380> triangle<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.770> you

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
you get these little triangle if you

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.490 
you get these little triangle if you
will<00:01:47.630> little<00:01:48.630> triangle<00:01:49.050> things<00:01:49.260> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
will little triangle things and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.140 
will little triangle things and
basically<00:01:49.980> what<00:01:50.190> i<00:01:50.220> do<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.520> then<00:01:50.730> I<00:01:50.820> pull<00:01:51.060> it

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
basically what i do is then I pull it

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.750 
basically what i do is then I pull it
apart<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.800> you<00:01:52.800> just<00:01:52.920> lay<00:01:53.070> them<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.340> your<00:01:53.550> pan

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
and wherever he can fit them on your

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.730 
and wherever he can fit them on your
pretty<00:01:56.640> crowded<00:01:57.030> right<00:01:57.480> now<00:01:57.690> and<00:01:58.050> you<00:01:58.590> just

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
