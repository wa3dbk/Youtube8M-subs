00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.150
 now we see the armor as mind 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.010
 costs novelty 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:16.039
 I think it starts with motard now that it's here 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:20.179
 and it slips in becoming so much 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:25.599
 elastic like it used to be 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:28.759
 now by voting you put on your pants 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:36.530
 who have these classics will have to 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:39.340
 first put on your pants like this and then 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.900
 this must be passed 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:51.670
 inside this memory as it is 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.670
 badly done the pants will not fall 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:01:02.910
 but above all there is high mobility 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.790
 shoes 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:24.990
 that's how they trust when new talent 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:31.240
 strings 1 and 2 and Saturday with the abdomen 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:35.580
 name of the club here behind the 95 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.580
 percent of people will look back and 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.520
 says together with the theme of equal alcohol 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:53.220
 do n't move said all that's done 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.160
 these super attack attack 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.790
 attack anyway to give more 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.320
 support 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:06.210
 these in here is the Velcro here 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:09.750
 below and will give you 92 agreement support e 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.970
 undercollar means over the neck the neck 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.790
 here, too , everything is very elastic 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.530
 very light it seems to be stopped 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:27.180
 the contract limits let's see why 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:30.480
 so this sense is at the end and then 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.250
 this piece that is always here 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.100
 craf to be able to detach what you can 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:40.709
 directly activate so with a kind 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:49.580
 of giant t - shirt together 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:49.580
 and here there are clans and very beautiful 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.489
 however we say but then I succeeded 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.989
 then hook into systems all right 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.820
 in front of the mirror it was just less 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.230
 nothing except my phone 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:07.350
 what we do we put our arms on 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.500
 arms simply slip in arrives 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.190
 mobility is a very good you can also 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.560
 this releases the parenthesis below 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.940
 there is always another 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.550
 between comb that like without there is a 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.960
 old that will help you keep well 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.790

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.400
 municipality of Rome jump directly to or 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:47.280
 if not, then, only to put back six 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:51.960
 almost practically invented then take 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.960
 house from the mask 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.170
 take the mask this ever 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:25.130
