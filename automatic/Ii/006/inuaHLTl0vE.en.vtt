00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
her characters always been about justice

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.050 
her characters always been about justice
so<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.780> think<00:05:02.590> it's<00:05:02.860> really<00:05:02.949> interesting<00:05:03.310> if

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
so I think it's really interesting if

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.820 
so I think it's really interesting if
they<00:05:04.180> go<00:05:04.330> this<00:05:04.569> route<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:05.139> why<00:05:05.319> she<00:05:05.650> might

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
they go this route and why she might

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.709 
they go this route and why she might
meet<00:05:06.069> up<00:05:06.099> with<00:05:06.460> wild<00:05:06.819> cat<00:05:07.030> which<00:05:07.210> is<00:05:07.360> great<00:05:07.599> to

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:07.719 
meet up with wild cat which is great to

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:10.110 
meet up with wild cat which is great to
see<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:07.990> Wildcat<00:05:08.440> references<00:05:08.979> here<00:05:09.219> we<00:05:09.940> know

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
see the Wildcat references here we know

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.909 
see the Wildcat references here we know
that<00:05:10.330> she's<00:05:10.449> gonna<00:05:10.569> be<00:05:10.690> trained<00:05:10.930> by<00:05:11.050> him<00:05:11.289> so

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
that she's gonna be trained by him so

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.860 
that she's gonna be trained by him so
it's<00:05:12.280> this<00:05:12.639> is<00:05:12.819> definitely<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.419> beginning<00:05:13.840> of

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
it's this is definitely the beginning of

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.110 
it's this is definitely the beginning of
black<00:05:14.740> and<00:05:14.919> hairy<00:05:15.069> and<00:05:15.370> I'm<00:05:15.879> really<00:05:16.000> excited

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
black and hairy and I'm really excited

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.839 
black and hairy and I'm really excited
but<00:05:16.719> again<00:05:16.930> it's<00:05:17.469> sad<00:05:17.740> to<00:05:17.770> see<00:05:18.099> the<00:05:18.250> expense<00:05:18.610> of

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
but again it's sad to see the expense of

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.700 
but again it's sad to see the expense of
a<00:05:18.969> really<00:05:19.240> cool<00:05:19.419> character<00:05:19.779> like<00:05:19.930> Sarah<00:05:20.229> so<00:05:20.650> I

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
a really cool character like Sarah so I

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.850 
a really cool character like Sarah so I
am<00:05:20.889> upset<00:05:21.069> that<00:05:21.279> she<00:05:21.550> did<00:05:21.759> pass<00:05:22.389> away<00:05:22.419> in<00:05:22.960> this

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
am upset that she did pass away in this

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.830 
am upset that she did pass away in this
episode<00:05:24.129> I<00:05:24.580> you<00:05:25.180> know<00:05:25.300> it's<00:05:25.449> a<00:05:25.479> great<00:05:25.569> cliff

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
episode I you know it's a great cliff

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.860 
episode I you know it's a great cliff
hanger<00:05:26.139> and<00:05:26.199> but<00:05:26.680> it's<00:05:27.039> is<00:05:27.699> that<00:05:28.090> momentum<00:05:28.629> it

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
hanger and but it's is that momentum it

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.629 
hanger and but it's is that momentum it
is<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.169> momentum<00:05:29.440> and<00:05:29.800> I<00:05:29.860> think<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:30.400> the

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
is the momentum and I think the the

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:31.830 
is the momentum and I think the the
fandom<00:05:30.969> is<00:05:31.000> gonna<00:05:31.150> be<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.240> little<00:05:31.389> split<00:05:31.690> with

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
fandom is gonna be a little split with

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.550 
fandom is gonna be a little split with
that<00:05:31.870> uh<00:05:33.090> overall<00:05:34.090> I<00:05:34.449> did<00:05:34.629> like<00:05:34.779> the<00:05:34.900> episode<00:05:35.289> I

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
that uh overall I did like the episode I

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.869 
that uh overall I did like the episode I
think<00:05:35.800> there<00:05:35.919> could<00:05:36.069> have<00:05:36.159> been<00:05:36.219> a<00:05:36.310> little<00:05:36.610> bit

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
think there could have been a little bit

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:39.480 
think there could have been a little bit
more<00:05:37.240> in<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.650> whole<00:05:38.830> episode<00:05:39.250> as<00:05:39.370> a<00:05:39.400> whole

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
more in the whole episode as a whole

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.219 
more in the whole episode as a whole
just<00:05:39.729> because<00:05:40.300> there's<00:05:40.539> a<00:05:40.629> lot<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:40.810> character

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
just because there's a lot of character

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.980 
just because there's a lot of character
development<00:05:41.490> um<00:05:42.490> but<00:05:42.940> not<00:05:43.270> Allah<00:05:43.479> Shockers

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
development um but not Allah Shockers

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.689 
development um but not Allah Shockers
until<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.620> end<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:45.009> kind<00:05:45.159> of<00:05:45.279> wish<00:05:45.430> you<00:05:45.550> was<00:05:45.669> a

until the end I kind of wish you was a

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:47.850 
until the end I kind of wish you was a
little<00:05:45.909> bit<00:05:46.000> more<00:05:46.120> shockers<00:05:46.569> but<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.469> find<00:05:47.680> out
