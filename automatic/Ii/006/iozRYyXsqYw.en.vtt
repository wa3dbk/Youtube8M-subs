ways<00:00:29.770> down<00:00:30.219> the<00:00:30.399> line<00:00:30.579> now<00:00:31.239> this<00:00:31.450> figure<00:00:31.719> can

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
ways down the line now this figure can

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.959 
ways down the line now this figure can
be<00:00:32.020> in<00:00:32.500> robot<00:00:33.010> mode<00:00:33.040> in<00:00:33.430> two<00:00:33.579> different<00:00:33.850> ways

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
be in robot mode in two different ways

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.510 
be in robot mode in two different ways
you<00:00:34.000> just<00:00:34.239> saw<00:00:34.600> me<00:00:34.780> put<00:00:34.960> up<00:00:35.079> his<00:00:35.230> wings<00:00:35.500> that<00:00:36.280> is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
you just saw me put up his wings that is

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.820 
you just saw me put up his wings that is
the<00:00:36.670> secondary<00:00:37.270> way<00:00:37.540> you<00:00:37.600> could<00:00:37.900> have<00:00:38.080> him<00:00:38.350> or

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
the secondary way you could have him or

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.020 
the secondary way you could have him or
you<00:00:38.920> could<00:00:39.040> just<00:00:39.070> put<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.430> wings<00:00:39.610> straight

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
you could just put the wings straight

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.330 
you could just put the wings straight
down<00:00:40.270> doesn't<00:00:41.260> really<00:00:41.590> matter

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
down doesn't really matter

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.840 
down doesn't really matter
I<00:00:42.370> actually<00:00:43.300> claim<00:00:44.290> to<00:00:44.470> like<00:00:44.740> the<00:00:45.010> wings<00:00:45.220> up<00:00:45.700> a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
I actually claim to like the wings up a

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.150 
I actually claim to like the wings up a
little<00:00:46.060> bit<00:00:46.329> I<00:00:46.570> actually<00:00:46.990> like<00:00:47.380> that<00:00:47.410> it<00:00:47.860> I

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
little bit I actually like that it I

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.850 
little bit I actually like that it I
think<00:00:48.310> that<00:00:48.640> works<00:00:48.940> for<00:00:49.360> me<00:00:49.660> anyway<00:00:50.290> and<00:00:50.800> I

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
think that works for me anyway and I

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.650 
think that works for me anyway and I
think<00:00:51.040> it<00:00:51.130> actually<00:00:51.430> works<00:00:51.670> pretty<00:00:51.970> well<00:00:52.120> for

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
think it actually works pretty well for

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.490 
think it actually works pretty well for
it<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.870> figure<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:55.390> figures<00:00:55.750> robot<00:00:56.110> mode<00:00:56.320> is

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
it the figure this figures robot mode is

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.490 
it the figure this figures robot mode is
awfully<00:00:57.340> planing<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.060> that's<00:00:58.899> kind<00:00:59.350> of<00:00:59.410> a

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
awfully planing and that's kind of a

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.560 
awfully planing and that's kind of a
knock<00:00:59.770> on<00:01:00.010> most<00:01:00.370> of<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.730> aerial<00:01:01.120> bots<00:01:01.300> they're

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
knock on most of the aerial bots they're

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.139 
knock on most of the aerial bots they're
all<00:01:01.690> just<00:01:02.020> red<00:01:02.260> white<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.800> black<00:01:03.040> with<00:01:03.790> some

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
all just red white and black with some

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.420 
all just red white and black with some
gold<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:04.839> maybe<00:01:05.019> blue<00:01:05.409> highlights<00:01:05.979> here<00:01:06.250> and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
gold and maybe blue highlights here and

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.609 
gold and maybe blue highlights here and
there<00:01:06.579> it's<00:01:07.060> not<00:01:07.360> a<00:01:07.420> bad<00:01:07.720> looking<00:01:08.079> figure<00:01:08.320> at

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
there it's not a bad looking figure at

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.679 
there it's not a bad looking figure at
all<00:01:08.770> by<00:01:08.979> any<00:01:09.159> means<00:01:09.429> but<00:01:09.700> it<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:09.969> a<00:01:09.999> very<00:01:10.450> very

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
all by any means but it is a very very

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.700 
all by any means but it is a very very
plain<00:01:11.139> I<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.880> appreciate<00:01:13.359> the<00:01:13.659> high<00:01:13.990> quality

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
plain I do appreciate the high quality

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.889 
plain I do appreciate the high quality
molding<00:01:15.280> going<00:01:15.579> on<00:01:15.729> with<00:01:15.939> his<00:01:16.119> head<00:01:16.149> sculpt

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
molding going on with his head sculpt

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.580 
molding going on with his head sculpt
yeah<00:01:17.409> it<00:01:17.710> is<00:01:17.889> a<00:01:17.920> very<00:01:18.399> very<00:01:18.789> g1<00:01:19.359> as<00:01:19.840> head<00:01:20.170> sculpt

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
yeah it is a very very g1 as head sculpt

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.270 
yeah it is a very very g1 as head sculpt
but<00:01:21.069> it<00:01:21.189> works<00:01:21.429> in<00:01:21.759> many<00:01:22.539> many<00:01:22.840> ways<00:01:22.959> and<00:01:23.560> you

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
but it works in many many ways and you

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.029 
but it works in many many ways and you
notice<00:01:24.609> the<00:01:24.789> little<00:01:24.939> double<00:01:25.659> flaps<00:01:26.469> he's<00:01:26.829> got

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
notice the little double flaps he's got

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.910 
notice the little double flaps he's got
going<00:01:27.369> on<00:01:27.520> on<00:01:27.700> his<00:01:27.819> cheeks<00:01:28.209> yeah<00:01:29.109> that<00:01:29.530> this

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
going on on his cheeks yeah that this

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.679 
going on on his cheeks yeah that this
this<00:01:30.310> is<00:01:30.459> a<00:01:30.490> different<00:01:30.880> Hasbro<00:01:31.299> I<00:01:31.359> think

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
this is a different Hasbro I think

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.599 
this is a different Hasbro I think
they're<00:01:32.289> kind<00:01:32.770> of<00:01:32.829> getting<00:01:33.100> rid<00:01:33.249> of<00:01:33.310> some<00:01:33.579> of

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
they're kind of getting rid of some of

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:35.459 
they're kind of getting rid of some of
the<00:01:33.729> complexity<00:01:34.329> which<00:01:34.479> I<00:01:34.630> don't<00:01:34.689> mind<00:01:35.049> and

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
the complexity which I don't mind and

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.179 
the complexity which I don't mind and
going<00:01:36.459> for<00:01:36.819> better<00:01:37.539> paint<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.319> just<00:01:38.409> better

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
going for better paint and just better

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.169 
going for better paint and just better
look<00:01:40.319> era<00:01:41.319> does<00:01:41.709> come<00:01:41.979> with<00:01:42.130> two<00:01:42.189> accessories

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
look era does come with two accessories

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.419 
look era does come with two accessories
first<00:01:43.420> off<00:01:43.719> is<00:01:43.959> the<00:01:44.139> combiner<00:01:44.560> port<00:01:44.920> or

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
first off is the combiner port or

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.209 
first off is the combiner port or
combiner<00:01:45.850> part<00:01:46.179> which<00:01:46.359> is<00:01:46.539> just<00:01:46.779> to

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
combiner part which is just to

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.889 
combiner part which is just to
missile-like<00:01:48.219> things<00:01:48.639> and<00:01:49.090> then<00:01:49.450> he<00:01:49.630> comes

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
missile-like things and then he comes

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.160 
missile-like things and then he comes
with<00:01:50.229> a<00:01:50.529> double-barreled<00:01:51.520> gun<00:01:51.609> which<00:01:52.240> is<00:01:52.270> just

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
with a double-barreled gun which is just

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.489 
with a double-barreled gun which is just
a<00:01:53.289> white<00:01:53.679> repaint<00:01:54.429> of<00:01:54.579> the<00:01:55.569> exact<00:01:55.990> same<00:01:56.259> gun

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:56.499 
a white repaint of the exact same gun

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:58.440 
a white repaint of the exact same gun
that<00:01:56.560> one<00:01:56.920> of<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.069> other<00:01:57.310> figures<00:01:57.880> comes<00:01:58.209> with

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
that one of the other figures comes with

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.199 
that one of the other figures comes with
there's<00:01:59.229> no<00:01:59.679> difference<00:02:00.189> here<00:02:00.429> it's<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.999> same

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
there's no difference here it's the same

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:04.199 
there's no difference here it's the same
dang<00:02:01.509> thing<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.549> instead<00:02:03.549> of<00:02:03.669> telling<00:02:04.090> you

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
the plane mode a lot you can even do the

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.990 
the end of the day air raid is just
another<00:03:52.990> aerial<00:03:53.530> bot<00:03:53.740> and<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:54.430> really<00:03:54.790> hate

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
another aerial bot and I really hate

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.760 
another aerial bot and I really hate
saying<00:03:55.420> that<00:03:55.810> but<00:03:55.960> it's<00:03:56.140> true

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
saying that but it's true

saying that but it's true
he<00:03:57.310> is<00:03:57.580> just<00:03:58.510> another<00:03:58.840> one<00:03:59.050> because<00:03:59.260> let's

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
he is just another one because let's

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.650 
he is just another one because let's
face<00:03:59.770> it<00:03:59.950> they're<00:04:00.700> all<00:04:00.850> kind<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.300> the<00:04:01.420> same

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
face it they're all kind of the same

all pretty much the same okay that's
kind<00:04:21.790> of<00:04:21.820> a<00:04:21.910> lot<00:04:22.120> they<00:04:22.750> do<00:04:22.810> have<00:04:23.500> they<00:04:24.040> are<00:04:24.220> a

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
kind of a lot they do have they are a

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.560 
kind of a lot they do have they are a
little<00:04:24.490> bit<00:04:24.700> unique<00:04:24.850> in<00:04:25.180> some<00:04:25.360> of<00:04:25.479> their

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
little bit unique in some of their

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.980 
little bit unique in some of their
mouldings<00:04:26.080> but<00:04:26.350> their<00:04:26.830> basic<00:04:27.340> structure

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
mouldings but their basic structure

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.710 
mouldings but their basic structure
is<00:04:28.229> exactly<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:29.490> same<00:04:29.669> on<00:04:29.970> all<00:04:30.360> of<00:04:30.509> them

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
is exactly the same on all of them

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.529 
is exactly the same on all of them
there's<00:04:31.259> nothing<00:04:31.889> really<00:04:32.580> different<00:04:33.360> about

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
there's nothing really different about

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.760 
there's nothing really different about
them<00:04:34.490> structure-wise<00:04:35.960> but<00:04:36.960> that's<00:04:37.440> not<00:04:37.680> to

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
them structure-wise but that's not to

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.040 
them structure-wise but that's not to
say<00:04:37.919> it's<00:04:38.130> a<00:04:38.220> bad<00:04:38.460> figure<00:04:38.819> it's<00:04:39.479> just<00:04:39.780> not<00:04:40.020> a

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
say it's a bad figure it's just not a

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.219 
say it's a bad figure it's just not a
unique<00:04:40.620> figure<00:04:41.310> there's<00:04:42.210> nothing<00:04:42.960> really

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
unique figure there's nothing really

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.730 
unique figure there's nothing really
wrong<00:04:43.410> with<00:04:43.860> that<00:04:44.069> but<00:04:44.630> I'm<00:04:45.630> just<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:46.470> picky
