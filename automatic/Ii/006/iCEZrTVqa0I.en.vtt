00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
through here you know as usual you know

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.150 
through here you know as usual you know
the<00:03:58.050> best<00:03:58.170> way<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.319> get<00:03:58.530> through<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.680> stage<00:03:58.860> is

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
the best way to get through a stage is

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.650 
the best way to get through a stage is
sneaking<00:03:59.610> this<00:04:00.270> is<00:04:00.450> Miller<00:04:00.720> solid<00:04:01.140> after<00:04:01.380> all

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.770 

so<00:04:07.230> we'll<00:04:07.380> go<00:04:07.470> ahead<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.770> get<00:04:07.980> through<00:04:08.190> here

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.210 

and<00:04:14.780> you'll<00:04:15.079> notice<00:04:15.230> from<00:04:15.469> this<00:04:15.620> load<00:04:15.860> screen

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
and you'll notice from this load screen

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.159 
and you'll notice from this load screen
as<00:04:16.370> well<00:04:16.489> you<00:04:16.940> know<00:04:17.060> lo<00:04:17.299> times<00:04:17.539> are<00:04:17.750> fairly

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
as well you know lo times are fairly

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.569 
as well you know lo times are fairly
short<00:04:18.470> we've<00:04:18.979> been<00:04:19.100> trying<00:04:19.280> to<00:04:19.340> keep<00:04:19.459> it<00:04:19.549> down

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
short we've been trying to keep it down

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.729 
short we've been trying to keep it down
and<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.509> UI<00:04:20.660> has<00:04:20.930> been<00:04:21.079> redone<00:04:21.289> here<00:04:21.500> as<00:04:21.590> well

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
and the UI has been redone here as well

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.950 
and the UI has been redone here as well
so<00:04:22.039> the<00:04:22.250> maps<00:04:22.400> look<00:04:22.550> really<00:04:22.789> nice<00:04:22.910> all<00:04:23.870> the

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
so the maps look really nice all the

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:36.600 
so the maps look really nice all the
icons<00:04:24.199> have<00:04:24.350> been<00:04:24.380> redrawn

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.309 

all<00:04:37.150> right<00:04:37.300> so<00:04:37.539> we're<00:04:37.689> getting<00:04:37.780> close<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.259> the

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
all right so we're getting close to the

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.990 
all right so we're getting close to the
end<00:04:38.349> of<00:04:38.560> stage<00:04:38.740> here<00:04:39.039> as<00:04:39.759> mentioned

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
end of stage here as mentioned

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.580 
end of stage here as mentioned
previously<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.960> best<00:04:41.110> way<00:04:41.229> to<00:04:41.259> get<00:04:41.439> through

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
previously the best way to get through

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.080 
previously the best way to get through
the<00:04:41.650> stage<00:04:41.860> is<00:04:42.099> to<00:04:42.280> sneak<00:04:42.520> it's<00:04:42.909> the<00:04:42.970> most

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
the stage is to sneak it's the most

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.730 
the stage is to sneak it's the most
efficient<00:04:43.389> way<00:04:43.479> to<00:04:43.509> do<00:04:43.689> it<00:04:43.810> but<00:04:44.439> you<00:04:44.620> know

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
efficient way to do it but you know

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.809 
efficient way to do it but you know
there<00:04:44.860> are<00:04:44.949> people<00:04:45.069> who<00:04:45.280> want<00:04:45.400> to<00:04:45.460> run<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.610> gun

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
there are people who want to run a gun

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.790 
there are people who want to run a gun
and<00:04:46.060> also<00:04:46.840> it's<00:04:46.960> inevitable<00:04:47.349> that<00:04:47.409> at<00:04:47.590> some

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
and also it's inevitable that at some

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.990 
and also it's inevitable that at some
point<00:04:47.830> you're<00:04:48.400> probably<00:04:48.580> going<00:04:48.849> to<00:04:48.939> get

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
point you're probably going to get

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.939 
point you're probably going to get
spotted<00:04:49.300> so<00:04:49.719> another<00:04:50.560> thing<00:04:50.620> that<00:04:50.710> I'd<00:04:50.889> like

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
spotted so another thing that I'd like

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.469 
spotted so another thing that I'd like
to<00:04:51.009> point<00:04:51.219> out<00:04:51.340> is<00:04:51.520> how<00:04:51.639> battle<00:04:52.030> works<00:04:52.240> so

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
to point out is how battle works so

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:59.969 
to point out is how battle works so
let's<00:04:52.629> go<00:04:52.750> ahead<00:04:52.840> and<00:04:53.110> run<00:04:53.379> out<00:04:53.500> here<00:04:58.979> gameplay

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
let's go ahead and run out here gameplay

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.559 
let's go ahead and run out here gameplay
is<00:05:00.069> pretty<00:05:00.099> smooth<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:01.300> know<00:05:01.330> we've<00:05:01.539> actually

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
is pretty smooth you know we've actually

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.140 
is pretty smooth you know we've actually
remap<00:05:02.229> the<00:05:02.469> buttons<00:05:02.860> on<00:05:03.189> the<00:05:03.460> ps3<00:05:03.699> and<00:05:04.000> 360

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
remap the buttons on the ps3 and 360

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.640 
remap the buttons on the ps3 and 360
version<00:05:04.689> to<00:05:04.780> take<00:05:04.930> advantage<00:05:05.289> of<00:05:05.409> the<00:05:05.500> right

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
version to take advantage of the right

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.629 
version to take advantage of the right
analog<00:05:05.889> stick<00:05:06.090> so<00:05:08.009> the<00:05:09.009> face<00:05:09.190> buttons<00:05:09.430> to

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
analog stick so the face buttons to

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.369 
analog stick so the face buttons to
control<00:05:09.729> your<00:05:10.030> camera<00:05:10.210> here<00:05:10.719> you<00:05:10.930> can<00:05:11.080> use<00:05:11.229> the

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
control your camera here you can use the

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:12.869 
control your camera here you can use the
right<00:05:11.500> analog<00:05:11.770> in<00:05:12.039> green<00:05:12.219> too<00:05:12.430> similar<00:05:12.639> to

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:12.879 
right analog in green too similar to

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.300 
right analog in green too similar to
even<00:05:13.629> extra<00:05:14.020> cash<00:05:14.379> out<00:05:14.469> for<00:05:14.770> those<00:05:15.099> who<00:05:15.219> are

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
even extra cash out for those who are

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.830 
even extra cash out for those who are
probably<00:05:15.520> more<00:05:15.759> accustomed<00:05:16.300> to<00:05:16.360> that<00:05:16.599> fella

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
probably more accustomed to that fella

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.719 
probably more accustomed to that fella
gameplay<00:05:17.289> and<00:05:17.530> really<00:05:18.099> you<00:05:18.219> know<00:05:18.250> like<00:05:18.490> any
