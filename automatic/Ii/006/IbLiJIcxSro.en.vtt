00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:22.500
 good Sunday to all the boys are 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.150
 medina and welcome back with the 30 transmits 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.099
 top five place of the week sodium 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.390
 today the last episode before the beginning 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.140
 of the school as tomorrow will be the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.820
 my first day 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.949
 we start immediately at the fifth place of the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.110
 mute sniper bubi who is playing on 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.050
 loop down in veteran domain albis 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.180
 adaptive and will do 20 kills in one thing 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.829
 like 50 seconds the thing that is me the most 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.290
 liked, however, this clip that was 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.540
 carried out not in the main spot o 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.540
 precisely in the spot to do 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.609
 check but he was we say to manage 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.460
 the back spawn or in any case the center 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.260
 map to then be able to make enemies play 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.010
 on the other side to what was inside 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.839
 the spawn 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.879
 will succeed in carrying out all of them 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.589
 these killings then die at 20 in one 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.940
 very stupid way however it is me 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.500
 liked it a lot especially because it is 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.300
 very original compared to the classic ones 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.159
 that you see the clashes up on newton 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.369
 so I compliment the sniper 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.720
 bubu then guys I wanted it now 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.729
 take these five seconds to 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.619
 thank you for the 7 thousand subscribers who 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.490
 we have reached we are already 7,100 therefore 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.500
 really 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.149
 thanks a lot to everyone you see supported 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.189
 always and always give me a hand then 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.680
 thanks then a special will come now 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.240
 I do not tell you what still will be there 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.340
 see on the channel I do n't know how many 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.170
 however I hope that then will like it 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.290
 anyway here poor guy dies at 20 e 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.049
 we immediately pass to fourth place at 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.820
 fourth place I think we find paoli 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.469
 from who is playing with on the 2000 will see 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.479
 this time however with a back tor 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.759
 I don't know if he was alone or not 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.530
 who is playing on hi jack and starts 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.780
 thus making a double then recharging 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.850
 quietly his vector kills a third 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.469
 enemy and so far so good until one 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.750
 normal clip then watch what it does now 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.479
 kills one comes out is conquering 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.670
 everyone makes a quintuple and therefore it is 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.500
 by no means already like 8 kills then do the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.450
 ninth and thus closes with the tenth 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.579
 unfortunately it was impact and no one was seen 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.109
 fidh anyway really fantastic clip of 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.100
 poles from fourth place 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.590
 well deserved 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.739
 third lights area lights a quick step 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.200
 2 quick stop break weeks cop4 quick 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.820
 purpose for the five men on screen 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.079
 if you look at the first one it was in fact 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.570
 collateral is playing on houston 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.160
 with a bartender with a metal sight 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.660
 aim that I am not able anyway 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.030
 to use so I compliment him 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.919
 really makes this beautiful feed that 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.950
 concludes precisely with last whose coop se 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.480
 had killed 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.790
 first the enemy his right would be 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.830
 could have been maybe a 6 but not a screen 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.780
 however it was not so compliments it 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.260
 same great nice clip 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.450
 in second place among jump shows that stands 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.069
 playing on ray of the enemy arrival 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.580
 behind it does not want to kill him normal 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.830
 look what's booming not with not 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.140
 comment you comment 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.730
 then unfortunately there was not the volume of the 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.950
 clip and therefore there was no reaction 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.299
 however I imagine there was one 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.310
 great reaction because you want 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.739
 something doesn't have to have a thing 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.780
 fantastic over 100 really beautiful 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.060
 so compliments jump second place 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.430
 well deserved for you, we pass now 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.940
 the first position the highest step 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.860
 of the podium where we find the tax z legend 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.200
 who makes a first quiz coop with xpr then 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.940
 re-enter kill him whose ab23 r while 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:26.890
 tactical infiltration conceals an enemy 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:30.370

 really beautiful entrusts already done the 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.739
 double triple then quadruple continues 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.959
 so then with the former for not seen 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.060
 so many trust some bars given that yes 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.799

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.359

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.850
 also made the triple 18 but on speed 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.620
 split on its own so let's leave it alone 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.120
