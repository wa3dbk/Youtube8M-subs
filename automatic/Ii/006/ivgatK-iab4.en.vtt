 an extravagant woman needs to find a person 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.460
 nor does it require the help of an important detectives 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.460
 it's a statement 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.869

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.510
 for the mayor 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.240
 according 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.150

 Detective begins the search for God 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.980
 the truth that this network 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.980
 as in this case salgado 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.300
 in particular at the same time that things do not give you arcs a real puppet disaster 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 this unit will then be in Spain 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.140
 Scenic version there is nothing good direction 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.140
 both ccoo and ugt expressed these fascists 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.539
 it's about the puppet play he took the strings 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.630
 a bet made by theater approaching ipi puppets let's go to cabrera 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.170
 the story is a representation of the police cinema of the 40s 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.610
 using irony 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.070
 this work will also be presented in morelia guadalajara and federal district 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.420
 Miguel Cdeyk 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.580
 the work of rafael furchi is well known over there 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.090
 especially in Argentina in Spain and also in their villages 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.460
 The work that is the second to fix it to see them 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.500
 public 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.220
 we hope that this reality happens nothing to the sidewalks so far science for 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.790
 what 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.100
 VÃ¡zquez after reappearing 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.659
 according to the protagonists the puppetry show currently 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:51.990
 It is very abandoned 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.799
 and needs diffusion is to have a proper and accurate handling 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.020
 in that day lies in the problem are on this slope not because 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.100
 there are many groups many people who make puppets but good is not the same 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.110
 good handling and interaction have to be noted that in other 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.110
 countries like South America this type of works are a reality 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.109
 in Argentina for example from primary 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:21.049
 the teachers have this committed life that there are people and there 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.589
 there is a confluence of all plastic puppet music actions 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:26.899
 performance 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.509
 then this one would allow them 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:33.519
 and that's why Argentina is like that, it's still going very well for Latin America 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.489
 Little by little, the aim is to disseminate the puppet plays in Puebla 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.709
 that can not only entertain children but also great for themselves with 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:41.869
