this<00:01:55.210> side<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:56.200> I'll<00:01:56.380> flip<00:01:56.620> them<00:01:56.830> two<00:01:57.040> minutes

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
this side and I'll flip them two minutes

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.840 
this side and I'll flip them two minutes
move<00:01:58.150> them<00:01:58.330> up<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.720> second<00:01:59.140> great<00:01:59.410> and

medium-rare we're looking for about 125

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:41.010 
medium-rare we're looking for about 125
to<00:02:23.730> 130<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:37.540> I've<00:02:37.690> got<00:02:37.900> both<00:02:38.080> Jim<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:40.020> we're

to 130 and I've got both Jim and we're

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.600 
to 130 and I've got both Jim and we're
gonna<00:02:41.110> let<00:02:41.320> that<00:02:41.350> go<00:02:41.739> for<00:02:41.980> about<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.160> half<00:02:42.459> an

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
gonna let that go for about a half an

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.530 
gonna let that go for about a half an
hour<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.989> then<00:02:44.170> check<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.530> but<00:02:45.360> this<00:02:46.360> will

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
hour and then check it but this will

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.979 
hour and then check it but this will
probably<00:02:46.750> get<00:02:47.140> up<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.560> around<00:02:47.890> 350<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.510> work

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
probably get up to around 350 and work

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.330 
probably get up to around 350 and work
its<00:02:50.200> way<00:02:50.380> down<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:51.550> about<00:02:51.760> 300<00:02:52.600> 275<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.650> 300<00:02:53.890> by

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
its way down to about 300 275 to 300 by

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.479 
its way down to about 300 275 to 300 by
the<00:02:54.400> end<00:02:54.640> of<00:02:54.790> 30<00:02:55.030> minutes<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.920> I'll<00:02:56.920> check<00:02:57.310> it

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
the end of 30 minutes and I'll check it

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.580 
the end of 30 minutes and I'll check it
but<00:02:57.700> what<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.120> found<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.750> after<00:02:59.080> that<00:02:59.260> timeframe

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
but what I found is after that timeframe

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.650 
but what I found is after that timeframe
I'm<00:03:00.040> getting<00:03:00.340> about<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.549> hundred<00:03:00.880> and<00:03:00.940> anywhere

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
I'm getting about a hundred and anywhere

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.039 
I'm getting about a hundred and anywhere
from<00:03:01.810> 125<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.860> 130<00:03:03.570> internal<00:03:04.570> temperature

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
from 125 to 130 internal temperature

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.449 
from 125 to 130 internal temperature
which<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.440> way<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.709> we<00:03:05.860> like<00:03:06.100> them<00:03:06.370> if

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
which is the way that we like them if

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.490 
which is the way that we like them if
you<00:03:06.489> like<00:03:06.790> them<00:03:06.970> more<00:03:07.120> done<00:03:07.360> than<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.750> just

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
you like them more done than that just

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.949 
you like them more done than that just
let<00:03:08.709> them<00:03:08.860> sit<00:03:09.160> up<00:03:09.340> there<00:03:09.549> longer<00:03:09.970> but<00:03:10.209> I<00:03:10.420> found

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
let them sit up there longer but I found

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.810 
let them sit up there longer but I found
that<00:03:11.170> just<00:03:11.230> letting<00:03:11.709> them<00:03:11.830> rest<00:03:12.010> up<00:03:12.310> there<00:03:12.549> and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
that just letting them rest up there and

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.410 
that just letting them rest up there and
letting<00:03:13.390> them<00:03:13.480> heat<00:03:13.690> so<00:03:14.019> they<00:03:15.010> come<00:03:15.250> off<00:03:15.459> just

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
letting them heat so they come off just

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.890 
letting them heat so they come off just
cooked<00:03:16.920> very<00:03:17.920> thoroughly<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:19.390> temperature

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
cooked very thoroughly the temperature

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.660 
cooked very thoroughly the temperature
that<00:03:19.930> we<00:03:20.110> like<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.500> texture<00:03:21.190> is<00:03:21.250> great<00:03:21.430> and

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
that we like the texture is great and

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.490 
that we like the texture is great and
they're<00:03:21.760> very<00:03:21.940> very<00:03:22.209> juicy<00:03:22.570> having<00:03:23.140> gotten

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
they're very very juicy having gotten

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.070 
they're very very juicy having gotten
them<00:03:23.590> seared<00:03:24.299> beforehand<00:03:25.299> it's<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.750> little<00:03:25.959> bit

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
them seared beforehand it's a little bit

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.680 
them seared beforehand it's a little bit
longer<00:03:26.350> than<00:03:26.769> you<00:03:26.830> might<00:03:26.920> be<00:03:27.220> used<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.690> cooking

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
longer than you might be used to cooking

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.120 
longer than you might be used to cooking
steaks<00:03:28.959> like<00:03:29.200> this<00:03:29.380> maybe<00:03:29.620> you're<00:03:29.860> used<00:03:30.040> to

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
steaks like this maybe you're used to

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.310 
steaks like this maybe you're used to
six<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.580> nine<00:03:30.760> minutes<00:03:31.150> aside<00:03:31.480> but<00:03:31.870> if<00:03:32.019> you<00:03:32.140> got

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
six to nine minutes aside but if you got

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.380 
six to nine minutes aside but if you got
the<00:03:32.380> extra<00:03:32.890> time<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:33.459> you've<00:03:34.030> got<00:03:34.209> the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
the extra time and you've got the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.050 
the extra time and you've got the
ability<00:03:34.870> with<00:03:35.829> a<00:03:35.860> cooker<00:03:36.250> like<00:03:36.400> this<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.910> let

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
ability with a cooker like this to let

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.569 
ability with a cooker like this to let
them<00:03:37.209> heat<00:03:37.660> soak<00:03:38.019> we<00:03:38.650> found<00:03:38.980> that<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.310> flavor

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
them heat soak we found that the flavor

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.350 
them heat soak we found that the flavor
is<00:03:39.910> just<00:03:40.090> outstanding

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.380 

okay<00:03:44.140> so<00:03:44.200> it's<00:03:44.650> been<00:03:44.740> right<00:03:45.220> at<00:03:45.430> 30<00:03:45.940> minutes

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
okay so it's been right at 30 minutes

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.470 
okay so it's been right at 30 minutes
and<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:46.720> can<00:03:46.870> see<00:03:47.200> I'm<00:03:47.560> just<00:03:47.830> about<00:03:48.480> 290

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
and you can see I'm just about 290

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.410 
and you can see I'm just about 290
degrees<00:03:49.600> I<00:03:50.260> did<00:03:50.890> open<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.370> once<00:03:51.700> because<00:03:52.210> I

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
degrees I did open it once because I

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.930 
degrees I did open it once because I

I threw those on I did stick a
thermometer<00:03:57.010> in<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:58.240> meat<00:03:58.450> so<00:03:58.900> we're<00:03:59.020> going

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
to open it up here and see temperature

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.260 
to open it up here and see temperature
we've<00:04:05.590> got<00:04:06.420> stay<00:04:07.420> and<00:04:08.220> don't<00:04:09.220> put<00:04:09.850> in<00:04:09.970> close
