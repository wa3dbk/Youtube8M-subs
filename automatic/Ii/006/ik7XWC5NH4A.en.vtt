up to 40 degrees on it but I suggest you
look<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.670> at<00:00:38.790> ESA<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:39.930> she<00:00:40.050> said<00:00:40.290> that's

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
look on at ESA because she said that's

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.430 
look on at ESA because she said that's
not<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.740> good<00:00:40.860> idea<00:00:41.160> because<00:00:41.580> you<00:00:41.790> had<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.440> tad

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
not a good idea because you had a tad

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.100 
not a good idea because you had a tad
bad<00:00:44.190> experience<00:00:44.970> with<00:00:45.330> I'm<00:00:45.540> putting<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
bad experience with I'm putting the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.050 
bad experience with I'm putting the
curling<00:00:46.350> iron<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.890> hair<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.430> she<00:00:47.490> suggests

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
curling iron to the hair so she suggests

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.480 
curling iron to the hair so she suggests
that<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.840> degrees<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.470> much<00:00:49.710> lower<00:00:50.010> than<00:00:50.310> that

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
that the degrees be much lower than that

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.390 
that the degrees be much lower than that
like<00:00:50.840> 200<00:00:51.840> degrees<00:00:51.870> or<00:00:52.500> less<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.920> guess<00:00:53.160> but

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
like 200 degrees or less I guess but

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.560 
like 200 degrees or less I guess but
