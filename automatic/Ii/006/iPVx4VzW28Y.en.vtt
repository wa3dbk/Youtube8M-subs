00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:08.700
 hello today acquired 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.240
 different places brandt knives to this 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.929
 filmed 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.139
 unknown author fell into the hands of the second 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:22.289
 not less interesting knife with a little 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.710
 defect our machine leave it 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.439
 pretty frisky 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.900
 the construction itself as I said before 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.829
 This on this 0 spring type with 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.500
 she is outside 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.960
 very uncomfortable here are these sharp corners 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.270
 who will have to grind 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:47.579
 look blue paint was favorites 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:52.739
 the design is very similar 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:56.219
 plate which is bent here 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.750
 interesting knife blade carbon 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.750
 become 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.520
 here here comes this paste do not know that's 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.520
 Now you can see from the org glass not from the org 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:11.640
 glass on the lumen of the arm can be seen on the very 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.270
 interesting pattern apparently this 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.270
 etching 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:28.190
 just from two sides it is made here 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:32.229
 here are such utes and notches such 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.490
 pretty predatory spring cuts 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.969
 practically comes up against itself 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:43.180
 button how is she 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:44.939
 the guts are not particularly visible cost 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.579
 to me 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.579
 130 rubles about four dollars 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.299
 the information here is also pretty sharp 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.299
 part 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.149
 This form of sharpening is very personal to me 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.190
 like can bring to mind 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:14.160
 change the lining here are ordinary 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:18.410
 screws if this is a video of what else 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.690
 one knife by an unknown author collection 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.569
 The first time I meet seems like a product 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:31.230
 more carbon steel generally 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:33.420
 were made of stainless steel in the hand of convenience 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.330
 relatively doubtful made 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.870
 notches do not know what the author wanted 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:45.890
 apparently at that time he has a fantasy 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.890
 It was a stormy very such device 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.090
 this is the previous one with paint 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.060
 about too the only difference is twisted 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.340
 spring here you know so do not shoot 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.030
 time alone hour 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:08.410
 the weekend turned out to sharpen yet 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.320
 time so here now looks like a pen with 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.380
 after processing without inset leather yet 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.430
 I will hope and finish a little bit 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.430
 slightly riveted 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:26.800
 generally looks like a razor now 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:30.950
 so in my opinion it is quite interesting 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.730
 where does it not slide especially one of 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.280
 still have to be at the expense of points finish 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.830
 so it was nice to choose only 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.830
 and so it turned out 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.200
 what is your quite comfortable pen 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.660
 which is very pleased to purchase 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.330
 how did he give me 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.050
