00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello my name is own I am 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.769
 hairdresser and my colleague marie jo va 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.719
 show you how we do a 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.790
 natural drying on long hair that 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.900
 are a bit flexible to proceed to a 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.300
 natural drying 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:24.869
 we need a hair dryer a 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:28.980
 diffuser a comb a group n for them 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.219
 unraveled we need a peÃ±a that if we want 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.290
 to make a small tie after 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.800
 small pliers for the small attaches the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.090
 foam to properly define the curls and 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.760
 CCAA possibly for all 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.489
 fixed and if we want we can add 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.920
 also serum on the tips 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.930
 there we untangle the hair so that they 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.320
 have more to know than one 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.480
 hair that we will dry naturally 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.680
 will have loops we can not 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.170
 to recoat after so it's important to 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.770
 well the trouble so there we will squeeze 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.770
 in the hair 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.380
 once you have dried your hair 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.590
 marie jo will put the broadcaster on his 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.450
 hair and will finish leaving me at home 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.560
 so I'm going to lower my head down to 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.560
 have a maximum of volume 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.549
 there they are not quite dry yet 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.119
 before we finish drying them we go 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.680
 So add foam monsoon 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.900
 may in the palm of the hand 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:54.130
 it is put in both hands voila and 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.130
 metal almost everywhere 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.050
 one puts on more lengths when 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.520
 roots if necessary we add one 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.310
 once we have it and it is everywhere 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:15.230
 we will wrinkle the hair with the hands 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:18.370
 and we're going to put it back up and there we 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.370
 will finish drying your hair 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.120
 here is the natural drying so as we 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.780
 can see it there is still a lot 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.270
 of volume there is a flexibility so 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.700
 this drying also applies to the hair 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.770
 curly the real loop there is a 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.960
 flexibility that I have here we will proceed to 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.820
 a small tie so it's a 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:54.930
 hairstyle that can be made every 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:58.680
 days so marie-jo selects two 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.540
 wicks actually on the top and there we 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:09.780
 puts a little simple clip in 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:14.190
 do we add a bun clip a 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.310
 few of these Roma we do not put too much 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.310
 huh 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.740
 and once you finish your hair 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.740
 we can finish with the lacc 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.510
 that's how we can style the 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.970
 soft hair to curl ona at 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.240
 daily on the other hand do not iron 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.670
 hardly because it will break the loop so 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.860
 wet your hair crinkle with 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.209
 your hands do not use a brush or 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.030
 comb once you've been 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.410
 rehashed in the day if you 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.800
 recoiffer in the day by and that's 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.150
 that fingers and if not if you want 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.709
 you really unravel the 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.569
 hair well when will have to redo a 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.220
 shampoo because the loop otherwise will 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.790
 completely broken you would not have 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.790
 that component
