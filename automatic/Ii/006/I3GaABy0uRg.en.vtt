 hi diego how are you I hope that great 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:13.779
 in today's video I bring you what I believe 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.850
 what were you waiting for and that is my look to go 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.500
 to the wedding of marta that you had told me 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.570
 much in instagram about the dress 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.029
 about the hairstyle on the headband on 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.349
 everything and today what I'm going to do is recreate 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:28.419
 the look you wear that day that was 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.909
 amazing that I got sick to mourn such 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.910
 which and it was super exciting because I 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:36.969
 He gave his bridal bouquet and it was a day of 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.949
 truly precious and I really am going to 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.629
 always remember not to wait for anything 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.539
 in the romance for me a surprise 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.899
 giant because I'm also the only one in the 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.789
 7 friends who does not have a boyfriend so I 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.789
 I imagine Algeria out there the thing was very 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:54.280
 very funny then I roll up 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.469
 as of blind as I wanted to bring this 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.050
 headband that I took that was a purchase like that 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.210
 last minute 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.340
 I wanted you to believe it was important 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.760
 Wear your hair pretty and well enough 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.170
 curled from above because the style 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.409
 it was simple then I had to 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.330
 compensate a bit with the look and the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.450
 accessories when leaving home 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.610
 it was spectacular you imagine us the mess 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.960
 because Maria came with her boyfriend because 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.720
 I had to iron the dress that 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.490
 I had played in the suitcase and nothing in a 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.070
 moment with him with the master ballet as well 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.470
 with steam I did not have it but had to 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.300
 fix my mother also the dress that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.509
 it's a bit big with one side like that 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.950
 of emergency and late eyes over for 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.929
 the most important thing to have hair 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.240
 so very nice because if not with the 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.520
 headband is not going to fit me well 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.289
 that makeup 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.119
 do not pay so much attention I was 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.610
 recreated and threw him a little bit more 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.470
 worked for you to see and we are going to 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.600
 start 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.490
 and these are the two things that I use 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.340
 usually to make my hair that 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.120
 is the tenacious and the prospective and the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.610
 iron is elisa with this is fine 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.910
 because it 's like two in one can come out 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.759
 late you can lizarte the hair and is the 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.800
 This mechanism of turning the wrist and 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.990
 let me know what they have said that I 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.330
 I really like that we are more more stereo 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.980
 looser and it's cool the result what 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.600
 what happens that requires a little more than 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.959
 time in this case they were pretty 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.320
 Hurry and you also need a little more 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.320
 of practice but god is like that I tell you the 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.430
 truth of thanks I'm 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.260
 in love are the ones he always used and 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.270
 use at least once a week have 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.070
 a system to be able to hoist the hair to 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.110
 less temperature and get the same 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.240
 result so the hair is not 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.030
 tense look so much I am that in love 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.370
 because the ones I had before I could 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.770
 use once every six months and these 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.760
 if you used it as at least once to the 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.040
 week and not less 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.409
 that the hair is handled resentfully or nothing 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.510
 of this agree my graduation that I 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.430
 my hair is scorched and disgusting and 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.379
 scouring with the tongs that I 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.000
 had before they needed the temperature 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.700
 much higher for me to stay on 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.349
 curl you have to endure all day 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.590
 the good change this with the system this 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.810
 Well you do not have to get to the 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.720
 extreme temperature so that the rest 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.970
 it is marked and it lasts you and now we go 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.180
 with the makeup that, as I say, was 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.489
 a little bit fast because I decided to invest my 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.799
 time mostly in the hair and 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.440
 I used some of my favorite products 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.569
 who has spent years using and have long 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.370
 Menezes time is all we have 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.610
 incorporated is a palette of shadows of 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.100
 canning line that I just received 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.740
 I'm in love with them from the abode of 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.960
 the texture of those shadows and pretty 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.840
 simple with pink tones and give it a 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.910
 touch of gold and social as a basis 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.530
 take it mac studios fix that is my 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.180
 favorite base from the beginning of the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.490
 times still not found any that I 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.370
 like it more and as a proofreader the pro longer 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.200
 of mac that although it is a corrector that does not 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.150
 I put in every day because it dries a little 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.420
 yes that is the one that I have that covers the most and 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.540
 that lasts longer and as a bronzer carries this 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.220
 what is the mosaic of avn de france and 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.560
 it leaves a very beautiful tone because it has 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.240
 as there is a mixture of various shades and 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.920
 lieuwe then this condemning the 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.620
 cheekbones a little bit in the nose 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.780
 here a little bit now and now we go with the 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.390
 shadows shadow here and shadow already at the base 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.840
 It was pink with lovely golden sparkles 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.810
 and I put a purple eggplant tone 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.630
 dark on the outside of the eye and what 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.770
 he said all right to the basin a 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.380
 little white in the arch of the eyebrow 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.970
 to illuminate and this golden shadow that 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.070
 it seems really lovely to me that in 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.750
 camera does not appreciate how beautiful it is and 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.249
 I put it here that is not even the center of 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.499
 eye is not animal 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:42.509
 to one third and diffuse it well so with 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.889
 the finger this was a last minute fix 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.619
 that I saw the shadow very dark and 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.259
 so I put this on so that I would give a 

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:51.059
 highlight and tear it in 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.899
 light pink tone instead of white 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:53.899
 which is always done 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.180
 and wings of the lower lashes I put 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.180
 a blue shadow with greenish flashes 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.970
 the eyeliner with this marker 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.530
 maybelline that when I bought it I and 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.730
 I go at the beginning a disappointment I do not 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.640
 I liked it a lot but the end has ended 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.530
 to love I use it almost every day and 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.000
 for the eyelashes the mask that is 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.170
 using more lately that is the 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.170
 wake me up the river 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.430
 a bit of illuminator in the high zone 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.430
 of the cheekbone and in the arch of the eyebrow 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.620
 and my lipstick prosperity the 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.390
 history of the world world which is the 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.390
 number 17 of sunland 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:57.050
 and we're done with makeup 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.050
 we just need the little princess detail 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.640
 all right 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.640
 the residue that you have asked a lot 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.230
 in instagram is of cases I think not what 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.270
 They have in various colors I bought it 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.880
 about a month ago but yes that staying in 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.690
 all sizes but some are left and 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.340
 I do not know I was indecisive until the last 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.580
 moment that you really liked in Instagram 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.750
 I did not have anything clear and until the 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.730
 last day 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.130
 two days before I was looking 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:41.910
 alternatives and some that I loved 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:44.040
 for example this rose I loved but 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:47.220
 I thought it was too much 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.620
 open and too low cut so I 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.660
 I stayed with the one I had at the end and now 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.340

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.130
