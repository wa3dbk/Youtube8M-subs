00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
the idea of it however i believe the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.420 
the idea of it however i believe the
shape<00:02:27.989> could<00:02:28.230> have<00:02:28.319> been<00:02:28.470> more<00:02:28.829> traditional

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
shape could have been more traditional

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.160 
shape could have been more traditional
like<00:02:29.579> a<00:02:29.610> regular<00:02:29.819> mouthed<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.269> then<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.959> make<00:02:31.140> a

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
like a regular mouthed it then it make a

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.920 
like a regular mouthed it then it make a
lot<00:02:31.380> more<00:02:31.410> sense<00:02:32.060> as<00:02:33.060> far<00:02:33.299> as<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.480> taste<00:02:33.660> goes
