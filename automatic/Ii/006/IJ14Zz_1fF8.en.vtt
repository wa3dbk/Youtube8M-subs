and the crank sensor and the cam sensor

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.800 
and the crank sensor and the cam sensor
are<00:00:20.580> their<00:00:20.730> angle<00:00:21.029> position<00:00:21.180> sensors

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
are their angle position sensors

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.150 
are their angle position sensors
whatever<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.199> want<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.439> call<00:00:22.619> them<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.920> crank

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
whatever you want to call them the crank

in the cam whatever what happens to

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.339 
in the cam whatever what happens to
these<00:00:26.310> things<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.820> lot<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.029> times<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.810> lot<00:00:28.289> of

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
these things a lot of times a lot of

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.740 
these things a lot of times a lot of
people<00:00:28.470> are<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:28.920> aware<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.539> once

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
people are not aware of this but once

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.380 
people are not aware of this but once
they<00:00:30.900> change<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.529> timing<00:00:32.009> belt<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:32.880> one<00:00:33.149> they

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
they change the timing belt on one they

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.540 
they change the timing belt on one they
may<00:00:33.570> notice<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.500> runs<00:00:34.800> good<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.399> all

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
may notice that it runs good and it all

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.510 
may notice that it runs good and it all
sudden<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.300> stops<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:37.040> don't<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.250> why

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
sudden it just stops I don't like why

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.850 
sudden it just stops I don't like why
this<00:00:39.149> my<00:00:39.480> car<00:00:39.719> stop<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.350> got<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> brand<00:00:40.829> new

well<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> first<00:00:44.730> things<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> check<00:00:45.239> is

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
well one of the first things to check is

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.959 
well one of the first things to check is
this<00:00:46.680> right<00:00:46.890> here<00:00:47.070> which<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.489> reluctor

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
this right here which is the reluctor

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.290 
this right here which is the reluctor
wheel<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.629> how<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.800> designed<00:00:53.300> this

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
wheel and how this is designed this

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
wheel and how this is designed this
thing<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:55.230> rides<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> crank<00:00:56.070> wheel

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
thing just just rides on the crank wheel

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.910 
thing just just rides on the crank wheel
and<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:57.360> cam<00:00:57.600> shaft<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.020> rides<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> crank

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
and the cam shaft and rides on the crank

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.459 
and the cam shaft and rides on the crank
I'm<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> cam<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.840> end<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.109> camel

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
I'm in on the cam the end of the camel

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.280 
I'm in on the cam the end of the camel
and<00:01:01.649> how<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.760> works<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:04.049> there's<00:01:04.229> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and how it works is this see there's a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.179 
and how it works is this see there's a
little<00:01:04.500> magnet<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:06.650> see<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.830> little

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
little magnet in here see a little

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.310 
little magnet in here see a little
magnet<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.240> every<00:01:09.600> time<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.869> wheel<00:01:10.020> turns

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
magnet so every time the wheel turns

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.460 
magnet so every time the wheel turns
around<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:11.310> passes<00:01:11.909> through<00:01:12.119> there<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.780> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
around it passes through there and it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.520 
around it passes through there and it
causes<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:14.310> current<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.390> come<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.140> come<00:01:16.290> off

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
causes a current to come on and come off

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.350 
causes a current to come on and come off
and<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:16.950> notice<00:01:17.400> there's<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> little<00:01:17.850> tiny

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and you notice there's a little tiny

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.420 
and you notice there's a little tiny
mark<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.110> see<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:20.479> well<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.740> computer<00:01:23.340> is

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
mark on it see it well the computer is

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.880 
mark on it see it well the computer is
able<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.790> isolate<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.750> position<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
able to isolate the position of the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.710 
able to isolate the position of the
crank<00:01:26.189> and/or<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> cam<00:01:27.000> there<00:01:27.330> before<00:01:27.630> it

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
crank and/or the cam there before it

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.530 
crank and/or the cam there before it
knows<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.080> cars<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.530> time<00:01:29.119> well<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.450> of

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
knows the cars and time well if one of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.999 
knows the cars and time well if one of
these<00:01:30.659> little<00:01:30.869> rollers<00:01:31.200> brake<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.950> this

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
these little rollers brake and this

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.010 
these little rollers brake and this
thing<00:01:32.220> slips<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:32.759> bit<00:01:33.180> instead<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.930> it

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
thing slips a little bit instead of it

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.840 
thing slips a little bit instead of it
being<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.350> time<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.189> computer<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
being in time the computer is going to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.340 
being in time the computer is going to
completely<00:01:36.210> shut<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> car<00:01:36.780> down<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.170> think

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
completely shut the car down and think

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.929 
completely shut the car down and think
that<00:01:37.470> nothing's<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.890> time<00:01:38.509> that's<00:01:39.509> because

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
that nothing's in time that's because

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.880 
that nothing's in time that's because
this<00:01:41.939> sensor<00:01:42.390> right<00:01:42.600> here<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:42.990> what<00:01:43.200> tells<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
this sensor right here is what tells the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.039 
this sensor right here is what tells the
gas<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.939> cut<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.420> tells<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.810> fuel

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
gas to cut on it tells the fuel

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.170 
gas to cut on it tells the fuel
injectors<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.680> fire<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.250> tells<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> coils<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
injectors to fire it tells the coils to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.560 
injectors to fire it tells the coils to
fire<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.780> tells<00:01:49.070> these<00:01:50.070> two<00:01:50.460> sensors<00:01:50.880> there's

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
fire it tells these two sensors there's

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.480 
fire it tells these two sensors there's
tons<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.079> information<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.740> car<00:01:52.950> gets<00:01:53.280> from

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
tons of information the car gets from

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.160 
tons of information the car gets from
these<00:01:53.640> two<00:01:53.790> sensors<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.689> tells<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.140> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
these two sensors that tells it to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.270 
these two sensors that tells it to
operate<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.490> one<00:01:56.729> slips<00:01:57.590> game<00:01:58.590> over<00:01:59.040> and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
operate so if one slips game over and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.389 
operate so if one slips game over and
it's<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> exact<00:02:00.479> same<00:02:00.570> wheel<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.950> camp

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
it's the exact same wheel for the camp

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.160 
it's the exact same wheel for the camp
I'm<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.640> bet<00:02:02.850> it'd<00:02:02.969> be<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> exact<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.079> know

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
I'm a bet it'd be the exact but you know

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.899 
I'm a bet it'd be the exact but you know
what<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.290> mean<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.799> operates<00:02:05.189> exactly<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.729> same

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
what I mean it operates exactly the same

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.180 
what I mean it operates exactly the same
the<00:02:06.390> cam<00:02:06.630> has<00:02:06.930> one<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.469> it's<00:02:07.590> right<00:02:07.770> here<00:02:08.039> let

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
the cam has one and it's right here let

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.010 
the cam has one and it's right here let
me<00:02:08.250> show<00:02:09.259> it's<00:02:10.259> located<00:02:11.690> right<00:02:12.690> where<00:02:12.750> my

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
me show it's located right where my

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.950 
me show it's located right where my
fingers<00:02:13.379> pointing

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
fingers pointing

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.660 
fingers pointing
you<00:02:14.290> could<00:02:14.470> if<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.680> took<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:14.890> cam<00:02:15.280> off<00:02:15.490> you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
you could if you took that cam off you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.640 
you could if you took that cam off you
would<00:02:15.820> see<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.420> that's<00:02:17.080> where<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.440> cam

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
would see it and that's where the cam

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.110 
would see it and that's where the cam
sensor<00:02:17.950> goes<00:02:18.310> okay<00:02:18.640> that's<00:02:18.820> where<00:02:19.000> it's

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
sensor goes okay that's where it's

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.270 
sensor goes okay that's where it's
located<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.810> where<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.560> crank<00:02:20.830> sensor<00:02:21.070> is

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
located and where the crank sensor is

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.920 
located and where the crank sensor is
located<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.940> right<00:02:22.150> down<00:02:22.330> here<00:02:22.360> see<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.780> two

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
located is right down here see the two

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.390 
located is right down here see the two
screw<00:02:23.200> holes<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:26.770> would<00:02:26.950> just<00:02:26.980> sit<00:02:27.280> in

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
screw holes and it would just sit in

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.670 
screw holes and it would just sit in
there<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.730> would<00:02:27.790> be<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:29.290> would<00:02:29.410> just<00:02:29.560> be

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
there it would be the it would just be

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.580 
there it would be the it would just be
sitting<00:02:29.890> right<00:02:30.010> there<00:02:30.430> on<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:30.670> back<00:02:31.920> now

time and you could actually get these

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.520 
time and you could actually get these
rollers<00:03:34.330> out<00:03:34.510> of<00:03:34.720> here<00:03:34.930> which<00:03:35.110> I<00:03:35.230> had<00:03:35.380> no

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
rollers out of here which I had no

rollers out of here which I had no
problem<00:03:35.860> with<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.070> first<00:03:36.370> one<00:03:36.810> but<00:03:37.810> the

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
problem with the first one but the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.500 
problem with the first one but the
second<00:03:38.440> one<00:03:38.470> oh<00:03:41.520> well<00:03:42.520> not<00:03:43.180> going<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.420> waste

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
second one oh well not going to waste

second one oh well not going to waste
too<00:03:43.690> much<00:03:43.720> time<00:03:43.870> on<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:44.380> but<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.650> get<00:03:44.800> the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
too much time on it but you get the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.390 
too much time on it but you get the
picture<00:03:46.050> now<00:03:47.050> once<00:03:47.290> this<00:03:47.440> wheel<00:03:47.680> is<00:03:47.920> beat<00:03:48.160> up

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
picture now once this wheel is beat up

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.710 
picture now once this wheel is beat up
like<00:03:49.270> this<00:03:51.030> okay<00:03:52.030> forget<00:03:52.270> that<00:03:52.450> one<00:03:52.570> for<00:03:52.690> a

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
like this okay forget that one for a

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.350 
like this okay forget that one for a
second<00:03:53.310> once<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.460> wheels<00:03:54.640> beat<00:03:54.910> up<00:03:55.060> here's

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
second once the wheels beat up here's

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.550 
second once the wheels beat up here's
the<00:03:55.480> problem<00:03:55.960> you<00:03:57.150> see<00:03:58.150> inside<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.810> sensor

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
the problem you see inside the sensor

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.180 
the problem you see inside the sensor
it's<00:04:00.130> only<00:04:00.280> got<00:04:00.520> so<00:04:00.760> much<00:04:00.880> of<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:01.120> clearance<00:04:01.510> and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
it's only got so much of a clearance and

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.710 
it's only got so much of a clearance and
so<00:04:03.190> it's<00:04:03.370> going<00:04:03.520> to<00:04:03.580> start<00:04:03.820> beating<00:04:04.270> it<00:04:04.570> and

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
so it's going to start beating it and

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.690 
so it's going to start beating it and
beating<00:04:05.320> it<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.500> beating<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.220> it's<00:04:06.400> going<00:04:06.640> to

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
beating it and beating it it's going to

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.200 
beating it and beating it it's going to
break<00:04:07.090> this<00:04:07.840> sensor<00:04:08.290> now<00:04:09.130> you're<00:04:09.340> down<00:04:09.490> 150
