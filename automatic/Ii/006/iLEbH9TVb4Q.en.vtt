 area with another game point and come here 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.009

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.650
 fatalities run the game commands 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.660

 xisco ball spinning in our 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.920
 because it seems that now the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.920
 producer decided to think about the players 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.289
 let's say less skilled 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.050
 it looks like it will not be all but some 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.410
 of classic fatalities will be more 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.170
 easy to do with fewer commands but the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.840
 players need this to unlock 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.640
 these fatalities in some challenges 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.800
 Who is old should remember the time 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.200
 that the guys had to buy the magazine 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.840
 video game to see the commands of 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.600
 Neither battalions nor bock times until 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.149

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.059
 Legend zelda proind river game now 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.430
 in an interview the producer of the game 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.199
 stated that the promised date for the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.890
 launch of the game that was for the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.930
 end of 2015 is no longer worth 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.810
 to make matters worse he even said that neither 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.580
 you want to show nothing of the game in the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.590
 e3 this year 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.450
 currently working to bring 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.270
 the best game possible for guys 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.850
 he said so that this postponement 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.740
 Too bad, but that's the way we see it. 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.869
 it's also no use rushing and bringing 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.310
 something bad badly finished and full of 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.350
 problems 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.560

 The shadowy two industry was in phase 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.460
 of pre-production and did not come into 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.680
 production, the responsible team is 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.180
 small group with about five to ten people 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.219

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.369
 cooperative offline with one player 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.270

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.119
 conventional 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.520

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.580
 revealed five waiters finally won 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.540

 See now if you do not remember the game is 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.370
 focused only on multiplayer matches 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.400
 online and will leave for now only in 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.010
 russia it will enter beta phase soon 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.440
 logo and uses a modified version of 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.300
 Kingdom 3 graphics engine to run on 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.760
 I need simpler 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.040
 Come here, you're angry by playing a 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.470
 online multiplayer of some game is 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.600
 normal, sometimes even upsetting 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.459
 the other players only in the states 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.220
 united in some cases people 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.890
 will follow more than normal what 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.200
 happened the following was a player of 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.380
 13 years I was there with good friends 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.630
 playing minecraft then the friend did something 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.180
 that he did not like it and knows what he did 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.580
 simply called the police and did 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.820
 a false report of something very serious 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.739
 however, the police mobilized several 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.030
 and ran to find out the 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.610
 what was going on 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.590
 as there was no real crime whatsoever 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.080
 The guy who made the false report was 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.030
 he had already done this with more 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.980
 two people 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.900
 the worst thing is that this practice has already happened 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.800
 some other times recently 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.200
 popular 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.250
 already thought and if this return even in the 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.110

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.900

 Mario is there running around the scene. 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.480
