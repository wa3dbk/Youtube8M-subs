lung itself with this new approach we

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.010 
lung itself with this new approach we
use<00:02:15.260> small<00:02:15.650> one<00:02:16.280> 2-centimeter<00:02:16.850> incision<00:02:17.210> and

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
use small one 2-centimeter incision and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.960 
use small one 2-centimeter incision and
insert<00:02:18.650> surgical<00:02:19.160> instruments<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:19.790> the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
insert surgical instruments so the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.730 
insert surgical instruments so the
surgeon<00:02:20.150> can<00:02:20.420> actually<00:02:20.750> see<00:02:20.990> inside<00:02:21.530> the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
surgeon can actually see inside the

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.560 
surgeon can actually see inside the
chest<00:02:22.010> without<00:02:22.310> dividing<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:23.060> chest<00:02:23.330> wall

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
chest without dividing the chest wall

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.510 
chest without dividing the chest wall
and<00:02:23.600> spreading<00:02:24.260> those<00:02:24.380> ribs<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:25.190> get<00:02:25.370> their

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
and spreading those ribs to get their

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.430 
and spreading those ribs to get their
fingers<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.150> chest<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:26.990> it's<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.230> major

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
fingers in the chest so it's a major

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.160 
fingers in the chest so it's a major
advancement<00:02:28.190> in<00:02:28.280> terms<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.730> less<00:02:29.540> trauma<00:02:29.930> to

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
advancement in terms of less trauma to

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.260 
advancement in terms of less trauma to
the<00:02:30.200> patient<00:02:30.680> less<00:02:30.890> postoperative<00:02:31.160> pain<00:02:31.880> and

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
the patient less postoperative pain and

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.020 
the patient less postoperative pain and
early<00:02:32.660> return<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.320> full<00:02:33.560> active<00:02:34.010> lifestyle<00:02:34.490> so

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
early return to full active lifestyle so

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.870 
early return to full active lifestyle so
you're<00:02:35.209> able<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.840> remove<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:37.160> diseased<00:02:37.340> part

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
you're able to remove the diseased part

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.240 
you're able to remove the diseased part
of<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.060> lung<00:02:38.240> rather<00:02:39.080> than<00:02:39.290> having<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:40.160> know

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
of the lung rather than having to I know

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.460 
of the lung rather than having to I know
you<00:02:41.000> always<00:02:41.150> heard<00:02:41.420> people<00:02:41.450> say<00:02:41.870> crack<00:02:42.260> the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
you always heard people say crack the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.170 
you always heard people say crack the
ribs<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.010> do<00:02:43.220> not<00:02:43.340> have<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.700> do<00:02:43.820> that<00:02:44.000> any

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
ribs so you do not have to do that any

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.640 
ribs so you do not have to do that any
longer<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.690> do<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:44.959> all<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.530> it's

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
longer you do this all and it's

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.860 
longer you do this all and it's
video-assisted<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.910> was<00:02:47.030> correct<00:02:47.360> through

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
video-assisted that was correct through

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.020 
video-assisted that was correct through
small<00:02:48.170> incisions<00:02:48.200> without<00:02:49.160> any<00:02:49.430> retractors

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
small incisions without any retractors

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.300 
small incisions without any retractors
were<00:02:50.209> able<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.690> go<00:02:51.290> between<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.739> ribs<00:02:52.130> and

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
were able to go between the ribs and

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.550 
were able to go between the ribs and
remove<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.390> diseased<00:02:53.540> segments<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.380> lung

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
remove the diseased segments of the lung

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.030 
remove the diseased segments of the lung
without<00:02:55.370> dividing<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.600> chest<00:02:56.870> wall<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.320> so

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
without dividing the chest wall and so

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.860 
without dividing the chest wall and so
tell<00:02:58.430> me<00:02:58.459> I<00:02:58.580> would<00:02:58.910> imagine<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.360> patients

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
tell me I would imagine that patients

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.720 
tell me I would imagine that patients
are<00:02:59.959> able<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.590> go<00:03:01.190> back<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.520> their<00:03:01.640> normal

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
are able to go back to their normal

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.300 
are able to go back to their normal
activities<00:03:01.970> a<00:03:02.420> lot<00:03:02.540> faster<00:03:02.900> they<00:03:03.620> it's<00:03:03.980> less

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
activities a lot faster they it's less

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.949 
activities a lot faster they it's less
trauma<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:04.970> patient<00:03:05.450> what<00:03:05.660> would<00:03:05.810> you

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
trauma to the patient what would you

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.440 
trauma to the patient what would you
that<00:03:06.620> is<00:03:06.739> correct<00:03:06.950> all<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.580> studies<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.180> these

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
that is correct all the studies on these

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.090 
that is correct all the studies on these
types<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.989> procedures<00:03:09.170> are<00:03:09.620> shown<00:03:09.830> there's

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
types of procedures are shown there's

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.160 
types of procedures are shown there's
less<00:03:10.340> postoperative<00:03:10.580> pain<00:03:11.300> less

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
quicker return to full function and

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.539 
quicker return to full function and
oftentimes<00:03:18.320> patients<00:03:18.680> are<00:03:18.980> able<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.280> go<00:03:19.370> back

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
oftentimes patients are able to go back

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.520 
oftentimes patients are able to go back
to<00:03:19.730> work<00:03:19.880> or<00:03:20.360> start<00:03:20.840> their<00:03:20.989> chemo<00:03:21.350> or

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
radiation therapy one week after surgery

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.600 
radiation therapy one week after surgery
as<00:03:23.930> opposed<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.739> traditional<00:03:24.890> four<00:03:25.489> to

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
as opposed to the traditional four to

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.490 
as opposed to the traditional four to
six<00:03:25.850> weeks<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:26.299> takes<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.690> recover<00:03:26.810> from<00:03:27.290> a

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
six weeks it takes to recover from a

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.830 
six weeks it takes to recover from a
major<00:03:27.709> thoracotomy<00:03:28.310> incision<00:03:28.580> that's<00:03:29.420> huge

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
major thoracotomy incision that's huge

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.330 
major thoracotomy incision that's huge
so<00:03:30.170> you<00:03:30.230> mean<00:03:30.440> before<00:03:30.830> they<00:03:31.010> would<00:03:31.160> have<00:03:31.310> to

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
so you mean before they would have to

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.740 
so you mean before they would have to
wait<00:03:31.549> four<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.880> six<00:03:32.090> weeks<00:03:32.150> before<00:03:32.360> they<00:03:32.690> could

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
wait four to six weeks before they could

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.690 
wait four to six weeks before they could
even<00:03:32.870> start<00:03:33.320> their<00:03:33.650> chemotherapy<00:03:33.950> that<00:03:34.580> is

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
even start their chemotherapy that is

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.449 
even start their chemotherapy that is
correct<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.420> now<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.560> course<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:37.310> sooner

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
correct and now and of course the sooner

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.890 
correct and now and of course the sooner
you<00:03:37.730> can<00:03:37.880> start<00:03:37.940> your<00:03:38.330> treatment<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.870> better

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
you can start your treatment the better

think<00:04:42.919> that's<00:04:43.039> a<00:04:43.129> very<00:04:43.279> important<00:04:43.759> question

all<00:04:44.419> the<00:04:44.900> data<00:04:45.110> shows<00:04:45.469> the<00:04:46.629> efficacy<00:04:47.629> of<00:04:47.659> this

better than the traditional open

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.990

approaches<00:04:53.229> what<00:04:54.229> we<00:04:54.379> find<00:04:54.650> is<00:04:54.919> I<00:04:55.129> draw<00:04:55.939> an

without making a large incision that's

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:13.990
