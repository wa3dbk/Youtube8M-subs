00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
can just plug that in from the charger

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.100 
can just plug that in from the charger
which<00:02:26.320> days<00:02:26.560> all<00:02:26.980> those<00:02:27.130> days<00:02:27.460> mounted<00:02:28.180> so

which days all those days mounted so
that's<00:02:30.040> probably<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.490> better<00:02:30.640> solution<00:02:31.330> I'd
