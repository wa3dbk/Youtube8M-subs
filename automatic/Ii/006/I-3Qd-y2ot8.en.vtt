00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
it into like a triangle then flatten

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.170 
it into like a triangle then flatten
that<00:02:43.350> triangle<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.160> kind<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.670> give<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.060> a

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
that triangle and kind of give it a

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.879 
that triangle and kind of give it a
little<00:02:45.209> bend<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:48.810> will<00:02:49.139> be<00:02:49.410> part<00:02:49.769> of

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
little bend to it this will be part of

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:57.920 
little bend to it this will be part of
the<00:02:50.040> ear<00:02:51.260> will<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.349> first<00:02:52.620> ear<00:02:56.000> then<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.569> will

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
the ear will the first ear then you will

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:14.760 
the ear will the first ear then you will
start<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.470> work<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.889> in<00:02:59.280> to<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:01.500> head

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.220 

so<00:03:15.770> that<00:03:16.100> will<00:03:16.280> be<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.520> first<00:03:16.730> year<00:03:17.210> then<00:03:18.020> do

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
so that will be the first year then do

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:44.069 
so that will be the first year then do
the<00:03:18.440> same<00:03:18.680> exact<00:03:19.100> thing<00:03:19.250> for<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.760> other<00:03:19.880> gear

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.160 

so<00:03:45.079> this<00:03:45.290> is<00:03:45.469> what<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:45.769> looks<00:03:45.980> like<00:03:46.659> next<00:03:47.659> you

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
so this is what it looks like next you

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.259 
so this is what it looks like next you
will<00:03:48.319> get<00:03:48.500> another<00:03:48.799> piece<00:03:49.099> of<00:03:49.129> clay<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:49.879> roll

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
will get another piece of clay and roll

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:57.129 
will get another piece of clay and roll
it<00:03:50.599> into<00:03:50.840> a<00:03:52.030> ball<00:03:53.030> kind<00:03:53.659> of<00:03:54.280> then<00:03:55.719> roll<00:03:56.719> it<00:03:56.930> into

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
it into a ball kind of then roll it into

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:01.629 
it into a ball kind of then roll it into
a<00:03:57.439> thinner<00:03:57.950> kind<00:03:58.670> of<00:03:59.000> sausage<00:04:00.250> then<00:04:01.250> make<00:04:01.489> it

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
a thinner kind of sausage then make it

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.349 
a thinner kind of sausage then make it
look<00:04:01.670> like<00:04:02.030> this<00:04:02.239> by<00:04:02.510> flattening<00:04:03.049> that<00:04:03.109> part

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
look like this by flattening that part

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:25.570 
look like this by flattening that part
do<00:04:05.359> the<00:04:05.480> same<00:04:05.689> thing<00:04:05.959> with<00:04:06.109> the<00:04:06.230> other<00:04:06.349> one

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.939 

then<00:04:26.270> make<00:04:26.539> other<00:04:26.810> ones<00:04:27.110> I<00:04:29.110> need<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.259> make<00:04:30.379> the

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
then make other ones I need to make the

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.550 
then make other ones I need to make the
front<00:04:31.129> legs<00:04:31.250> a<00:04:31.520> little<00:04:31.669> longer<00:04:31.819> than<00:04:32.389> the<00:04:32.539> back

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.899

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.490

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
so far it looks kind of weird might need

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.300 
so far it looks kind of weird might need
to<00:05:35.150> make<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.420> ears<00:05:35.630> a<00:05:35.720> slight<00:05:36.050> bit<00:05:36.260> bigger<00:05:36.500> as

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
to make the ears a slight bit bigger as

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.390

you<00:05:38.090> can<00:05:38.300> see<00:05:38.570> here<00:05:39.050> my<00:05:39.500> wolf<00:05:39.770> looks<00:05:40.040> a<00:05:40.160> little

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
you can see here my wolf looks a little

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:49.120 
you can see here my wolf looks a little
bit<00:05:40.730> better<00:05:42.190> next<00:05:43.570> you<00:05:44.570> make<00:05:44.900> a<00:05:45.850> thin<00:05:46.850> line<00:05:48.130> so

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
bit better next you make a thin line so

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.350 
bit better next you make a thin line so
that<00:05:49.270> it<00:05:51.040> will<00:05:52.040> make<00:05:52.400> sure<00:05:52.580> that<00:05:52.730> it's<00:05:52.940> not<00:05:53.060> too

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
that it will make sure that it's not too

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.040 
that it will make sure that it's not too
thin<00:05:53.630> but<00:05:53.840> at<00:05:53.930> least<00:05:54.080> that's<00:05:54.710> it<00:05:55.300> then<00:05:56.300> stick

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
thin but at least that's it then stick

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.100 
thin but at least that's it then stick
it<00:05:57.080> to<00:05:57.440> the<00:05:57.590> bottom<00:05:57.800> of<00:05:58.280> the<00:05:58.850> of<00:05:59.390> your<00:05:59.750> dog

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:21.690 

then<00:06:16.320> it<00:06:17.320> look<00:06:17.890> it'll<00:06:18.550> look<00:06:18.760> like<00:06:19.030> this<00:06:19.570> and<00:06:20.700> it

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
then it look it'll look like this and it

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.220
