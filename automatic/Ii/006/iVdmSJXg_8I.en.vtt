 beautiful we continue with a little craven me 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.149
 will always think of the animated pokemon 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.549
 very early when sasha and kraby sensors 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.749

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.340
 a little crush every time 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:13.560
 the voice followed by piaf with always has a 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.569
 dragon pokemon and in addition the evolution of the 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.770
 previous it is dia mat 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.230
 followed by a bone halt to his pokemon 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.750
 does not inspire great confidence in 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.830

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.020

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.270

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.500
 booster not very famous for once 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.120
 but that's normal it must 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.480
