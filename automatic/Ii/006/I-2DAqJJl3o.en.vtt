 You see, that's where it could reveal the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.140

 thomas hot what a difficult thing that thing 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.810
 It's hard not to say that you give 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.570
 a lesson in overcoming opium and opium 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:15.130
 at the same time I feel obliged to 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.500
 obvious because I see so many people doing 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.720
 Such bullshit of your life. 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.900

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:44.680
 It's a slap in the face of people know that 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:46.600
 he touched is tight the firm hand that 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.300
 God alone can give this condition to 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.660
 paper or someone else is not 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.729
 What happens is that I was traveling only 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.520

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:24.129
 jonathan and cowards at 0 here with you 

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:28.369
 because you live with this deficiency 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:30.409
 and every day of your life and here all 

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:34.360
 world gets bib for you but I go 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.360
 You get a serious problem as a jury. 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:39.559
 in my position he did not miss 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.599
 me the worst of the competition 

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:43.429
 I will never'll turn on you 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.119
 no candidate here is better than 

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:45.949

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:49.059

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:52.339
 who like motoca better than 32 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:53.329
 I know what I'm talking about is difficult 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:57.289
 to study 

00:05:53.329 --> 00:06:02.149
 Only, as I said here, even 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:04.459
 I do not know if it's working. 

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:06.860
 going down by the music itself 

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:11.379
 So you 're a candidate for a 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:16.009
 quality and this is scary for me 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:18.499

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.259

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:54.259
