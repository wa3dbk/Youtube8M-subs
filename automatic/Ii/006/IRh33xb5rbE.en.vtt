00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.310
 Trains in the changing metropolitan area railways 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:12.460
 It is metropolitan area rail topics 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:17.470
 The theme of this time is fresh This is a teacher for a variety of reasons although there is a plan 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:23.250
 A large number of existing railway routes exist in the Tokyo metropolitan area 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.250
 This time, I interviewed one of them the new airport line Tama Kana game 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:35.260
 It has come to Oda ward Shibata station There is a route where the plan which has been in the past has been ruined actually 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:39.470
 This new airport SenKabanoKabano line of its railway lines 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.579
 We proceed today that it happens to propose you I line 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.660
 is 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.290
 Yes 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.670
 It has been from long time ago that story 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:54.289
 I'd have heard in what or rumor 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:58.699
 Connect the approximately 800 meters Tokyu Kamata Station and Keikyu Kamata Station in the underground 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:02.960
 We plan to improve the convenience of access to Haneda Airport 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:06.430
 But since the survey started in 1987 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.430
 Plan is the middle of the state 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.190
 It is from the time there is a place where the investigation according to Ota Ward was good, but it is the whole well 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.160
 Go 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:24.840
 As what maintenance plans did not hold well and how to do business corps from then 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.500
 And there is such a problem 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.860
 a 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.970
 There is a limited express that has not been progressing much 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:38.280
 Since the railway and Keikyu Railway real Hano line width is different 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:47.759
 There the situation can not be mutual entry is now planning Nee 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:49.760
 We will make Tokyu Railway and Keikyu Railway in the basement of Tokyu Shibata Station, and make a mutual relationship. 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:56.090
 I am planning to 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:02:01.030
 For example, in the future, something like a free gauge train will be technically developed. 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:04.930
 If so, there may be a possibility to consider including such a thing 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.940
 Do you think you become your own convenient and can KabanoKabano line 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.710
 I can not hear you and keep going from there again 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.900
 I also feel 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.500
 It was 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.819
 I wonder if the one who will continue is good 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.240
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:25.380
 I'm going to go to a bald place 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:30.570
 You should come in Abe, because there are so many here to Tou Haneda 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:33.480
 But I was able to pass to a little but I came out of gas only one candidate in one hour 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:40.770
 I'd been reduced or far from matching the force because it is not 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.370
 One is up to now Keikyu Electric Railway pattern Tote a ridge throwing was not connected 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.440
 Because 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:50.420
 Traffic network is in Ota ward, too 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.380
 There is a situation that was separated, but it is one more than Ota ward by it being connected 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.940
 It's really 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.750
 There is that the movement becomes very convenient at midnight, and another one is thinking like this 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.440
 More 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:05.460
 a Considering strengthening of airport access 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:09.990
 It is Saitama area, and it is one by one from Shibuya area train is connected 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:14.520
 Do you think whether there is an advantage in many of the benefits that 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:21.360
 Various future plans of Ota ward over new route seem to be expanding 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:24.350
 However, although the name of the railway line of the New Airport Line Sakai Line has been decided, the formal start is still 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.350
 Not decided
