00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.700
 Hello everyone! ! 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.980
 This time I did soft smoky eye makeup using brown red (maroon color). 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.080
 I think this eye makeup is perfect for the current season. 

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:19.955
 If you want to know how to make this eye makeup see 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.100
 The fande has already painted 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.740
 After mounting the eye shadow base, put an eye shadow called Limit from the Naked 3 palette onto the crease. 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.360
 Next, I will apply Barely Branded on Mayvelin's color tattoo (color ink in Japan?). 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.420
 Apply a spray of MAC Fix + to the brush and take the maroon color of the streak palette. 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.600
 I will put it on the color tattoo 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.140
 I go back to my naked eye and brush my eye shadow Nouner. 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.340
 I will blur from the end of the eye to the middle. 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.560
 I will blend with a beautiful brush 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.480
 Then put the black heart on the buttocks 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.960
 Also blur with a clean brush 

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:03.755
 I will give you an eye shadow called Strange 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.600
 Wipe the eyeshadow that fell below your eyes and put on a concealer. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.820
 I will pull the eyeliner as usual 

00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:55.295
 I will wear a black heart along the lower eyelashes. 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.100
 In my eye form it's better than putting it all below 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.700
 Because it becomes thinner around the middle, it stops there 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.320
 Return to the Sleek palette and place the black eye shadow on the eyeliner. 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.280
 I wanted to show the eyeliner a little bit softer. 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.280
 I will put a little on my eyes 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.040
 Furthermore blend lightly with Nouner 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.240
 Use champagne-colored eye shadows as highlights for the eyes 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.820
 It will be over soon 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.380
 Add missing eye shadow as touch up 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.180
 Then put on a mascara and eyelashes! 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.860
 Thank you very much for seeing it! ! 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.440
 See you in the next video! Ba ~ i
