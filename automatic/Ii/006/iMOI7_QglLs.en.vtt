00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
it in 50 but I would imagine something

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.390 
it in 50 but I would imagine something
like<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.850> Aurora<00:01:30.350> 510<00:01:31.350> flying<00:01:31.710> shoe<00:01:32.009> boxes

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
still I passed on the 350 are it just

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.150 
still I passed on the 350 are it just
seemed<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.570> little<00:02:24.720> big<00:02:24.960> for<00:02:24.990> my<00:02:25.260> taste<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.800> also

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
seemed a little big for my taste I also

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.130 
seemed a little big for my taste I also
pass<00:02:26.490> on<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.730> m50<00:02:27.270> even<00:02:27.510> though<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.660> liked<00:02:27.990> it

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.560 
pass on the m50 even though I liked it
more<00:02:28.260> than<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.470> 350<00:02:29.160> but<00:02:29.970> I've<00:02:30.090> had<00:02:30.270> my<00:02:30.390> eye<00:02:30.420> on

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
more than the 350 but I've had my eye on

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.030 
more than the 350 but I've had my eye on
another<00:02:30.960> ship<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.440> believe<00:02:31.710> would<00:02:31.830> make<00:02:31.890> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
another ship that I believe would make a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.550 
another ship that I believe would make a
decent<00:02:32.280> racer<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:33.780> I'd<00:02:33.930> like<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.200> get<00:02:34.290> y'all's

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
decent racer so I'd like to get y'all's

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.710 
decent racer so I'd like to get y'all's
opinion<00:02:34.710> because<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.910> also<00:02:36.060> think<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.570> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
opinion because I also think it's the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.410 
opinion because I also think it's the
best<00:02:36.930> looking<00:02:37.610> single-seat<00:02:38.610> ship<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.330> the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
best looking single-seat ship in the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.300 
best looking single-seat ship in the
whole<00:02:39.570> game<00:02:39.750> damn<00:02:40.380> that's<00:02:40.590> hard<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.860> say<00:02:41.040> and

whole game damn that's hard to say and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.910 
whole game damn that's hard to say and
here<00:02:42.120> she<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.570> damn<00:02:43.470> that's<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.890> good-looking

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.760 
size matters and as far as size goes the
m50<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.690> smallest<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.260> lightest<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.650> the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
m50 is the smallest and lightest of the

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.730 
m50 is the smallest and lightest of the
three<00:03:14.070> but<00:03:14.580> in<00:03:14.700> my<00:03:14.730> opinion<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:16.080> avenger<00:03:16.560> has

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
three but in my opinion the avenger has

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.370 
three but in my opinion the avenger has
an<00:03:16.890> advantage<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.580> 350<00:03:18.330> are<00:03:18.510> now<00:03:19.140> she's

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
an advantage of the 350 are now she's

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.530 
an advantage of the 350 are now she's
five<00:03:19.650> meters<00:03:20.010> shorter<00:03:20.430> two<00:03:20.820> meters<00:03:21.150> narrower

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
five meters shorter two meters narrower

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.840 
five meters shorter two meters narrower
and<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:22.320> meter<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.890> half<00:03:22.920> lower<00:03:23.400> in<00:03:23.580> height

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
and a meter and a half lower in height

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.449 
and a meter and a half lower in height
now<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.720> small<00:03:25.110> size<00:03:25.440> looks<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.130> be<00:03:26.250> better

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
now the small size looks to be better

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.979 
now the small size looks to be better
with<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.910> racetrack<00:03:27.390> that<00:03:27.540> they<00:03:27.630> showed<00:03:27.840> us

the two dedicated racers but rather I

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.380 
the two dedicated racers but rather I
believe<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.680> will<00:04:10.830> be<00:04:10.980> competitive<00:04:11.549> now<00:04:12.330> the

only problem I see right now with my

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.710 
only problem I see right now with my
idea<00:04:14.459> is<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.790> engine<00:04:15.150> compartment<00:04:15.269> on<00:04:15.660> the

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
idea is the engine compartment on the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.710 
idea is the engine compartment on the
Avenger<00:04:16.260> looking<00:04:17.160> at<00:04:17.310> my<00:04:17.459> max<00:04:17.760> with<00:04:18.000> its<00:04:18.150> TR

fours<00:04:19.080> I'm<00:04:19.380> trying<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.280> imagine<00:04:20.519> an<00:04:20.850> even

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
fours I'm trying to imagine an even

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.510 
fours I'm trying to imagine an even
bigger<00:04:21.419> engine<00:04:21.870> in<00:04:22.020> my<00:04:22.500> little<00:04:22.740> Avenger<00:04:23.310> and

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
bigger engine in my little Avenger and

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.950 
bigger engine in my little Avenger and
it<00:04:23.729> has<00:04:23.880> me<00:04:24.090> wondering<00:04:24.210> if<00:04:24.539> it's<00:04:24.690> even

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
it has me wondering if it's even

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.840 
it has me wondering if it's even
possible<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.500> stuff<00:04:25.919> that<00:04:25.950> much<00:04:26.340> engine

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
possible to stuff that much engine

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.810 
possible to stuff that much engine
in<00:04:26.910> that<00:04:27.540> little<00:04:27.750> of<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.110> ship<00:04:28.550> so<00:04:29.550> I'm

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
in that little of a ship so I'm

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.100 
in that little of a ship so I'm
wondering<00:04:30.030> if<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.420> specs<00:04:30.690> are<00:04:30.810> going<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:30.990> be

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
wondering if the specs are going to be

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.770 
wondering if the specs are going to be
changed<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.710> a<00:04:31.740> TR<00:04:32.310> three<00:04:32.670> or<00:04:32.970> four<00:04:33.390> when<00:04:33.660> it's

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
changed to a TR three or four when it's

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.400 
changed to a TR three or four when it's
actually<00:04:33.990> flyable<00:04:34.610> of<00:04:35.610> course<00:04:35.970> CI<00:04:36.810> g<00:04:37.140> could

actually flyable of course CI g could

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.380 
actually flyable of course CI g could
give<00:04:37.650> us<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:37.950> racing<00:04:38.310> very<00:04:38.520> end<00:04:38.670> of<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:38.760> Avenger

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
give us a racing very end of the Avenger

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.080 
give us a racing very end of the Avenger
you<00:04:40.080> could<00:04:40.230> stack<00:04:40.470> twin<00:04:40.800> TR<00:04:41.160> 4s<00:04:41.490> vertically<00:04:42.000> in

you could stack twin TR 4s vertically in

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.390 
you could stack twin TR 4s vertically in

badass<00:04:44.760> little<00:04:45.180> boat<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:45.750> mean<00:04:46.320> we<00:04:46.470> have<00:04:46.680> two

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
badass little boat I mean we have two

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.680 
badass little boat I mean we have two
races<00:04:47.280> but<00:04:47.430> we<00:04:47.580> need<00:04:47.760> a<00:04:47.790> few<00:04:48.060> more<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:48.390> throw<00:04:48.570> in

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
races but we need a few more to throw in

the<00:04:48.780> mix<00:04:48.930> even<00:04:49.710> though<00:04:49.830> we<00:04:49.950> know<00:04:50.100> we<00:04:50.250> have<00:04:50.280> a

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
the mix even though we know we have a
