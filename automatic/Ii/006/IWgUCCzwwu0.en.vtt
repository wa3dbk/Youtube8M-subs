this week we're going to hit on filter
socks<00:00:15.990> we'll<00:00:16.590> talk<00:00:16.830> about<00:00:17.010> why<00:00:17.279> reefers<00:00:17.789> use

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
socks we'll talk about why reefers use

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.179 
socks we'll talk about why reefers use
them<00:00:18.180> why<00:00:18.570> some<00:00:18.840> reefers<00:00:19.230> don't<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.710> how<00:00:20.130> to

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
them why some reefers don't and how to

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.830 
them why some reefers don't and how to
clean<00:00:20.490> them<00:00:20.670> filter<00:00:21.060> socks<00:00:21.420> are<00:00:21.630> pretty

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840

free<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.010> suspended<00:00:26.550> particles<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.420> water

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
free of suspended particles so the water

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.810

waste it goes down the overflow
capturing<00:00:49.739> all<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.070> will<00:00:50.280> prevent<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.760> from

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
capturing all this will prevent it from

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.850 
capturing all this will prevent it from
being<00:00:51.090> recycled<00:00:51.570> back<00:00:51.989> into<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.320> tank<00:00:52.620> by<00:00:52.800> the

being recycled back into the tank by the

column<00:00:55.289> will<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.590> much<00:00:55.890> clearer<00:00:56.280> which<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
column will be much clearer which is the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.180 
column will be much clearer which is the
primary<00:00:57.239> reason<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.020> use<00:00:58.230> them<00:00:58.440> personally<00:00:59.010> if

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
primary reason I use them personally if

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.709 
primary reason I use them personally if
you're<00:00:59.579> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> swapping<00:01:00.210> them<00:01:00.329> out<00:01:00.480> they

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
you're going to swapping them out they

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.540 
you're going to swapping them out they
can<00:01:00.870> also<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> really<00:01:01.710> solid<00:01:01.920> nutrient

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
can also be a really solid nutrient

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.759 
can also be a really solid nutrient
export<00:01:02.670> method<00:01:03.300> as<00:01:03.420> well<00:01:03.600> since<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> sock<00:01:04.530> is

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
export method as well since the sock is

trapping<00:01:05.250> all<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> food<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.119> fish<00:01:06.330> turds<00:01:06.630> you

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
trapping all the food and fish turds you

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.359 
trapping all the food and fish turds you
can<00:01:07.229> remove<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> sock<00:01:07.890> which<00:01:08.220> will

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
can remove the sock which will

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.100 
can remove the sock which will
effectively<00:01:08.790> remove<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.450> waste<00:01:09.630> before<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
effectively remove the waste before it

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.570 
effectively remove the waste before it
has<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> chance<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.740> break<00:01:10.979> down<00:01:11.340> into

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
has a chance to break down into

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340 
has a chance to break down into
nutrients<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.240> nitrates<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.840> phosphate

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
nutrients like nitrates and phosphate

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.410 
nutrients like nitrates and phosphate
now<00:01:13.740> there's<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.010> caveat<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.360> you

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
now there's a caveat to this if you

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.690 
now there's a caveat to this if you
leave<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.930> socks<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.439> too<00:01:16.650> long<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.220> organic

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
leave the socks in too long the organic

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.340 
leave the socks in too long the organic
matter<00:01:17.850> will<00:01:18.150> break<00:01:18.390> down<00:01:18.420> within<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> filter

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
matter will break down within the filter

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.859 
matter will break down within the filter
sock<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.040> add<00:01:20.159> nutrients<00:01:20.700> anyways<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.720> how

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
sock and add nutrients anyways so how

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.990 
sock and add nutrients anyways so how
long<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.259> too<00:01:22.290> long<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:23.189> depends<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.759> what

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
long is too long really depends on what

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.640 
long is too long really depends on what
you're<00:01:24.150> feeding<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.720> type<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:24.960> livestock<00:01:25.350> you

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
you're feeding the type of livestock you

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
you're feeding the type of livestock you
have<00:01:26.009> if<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.640> change<00:01:26.939> them<00:01:27.180> every<00:01:27.299> day<00:01:27.600> would

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
have if you change them every day would

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.140 
have if you change them every day would
likely<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.409> very<00:01:28.770> effective<00:01:29.159> however<00:01:29.909> most

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
likely be very effective however most

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.850 
likely be very effective however most
people<00:01:30.270> wouldn't<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.049> diligent<00:01:31.619> about

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
people wouldn't be that diligent about

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.740 
people wouldn't be that diligent about
it<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.490> change<00:01:32.759> them<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.060> couple<00:01:33.360> times<00:01:33.600> a

it if you change them a couple times a
week<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.200> would<00:01:34.290> likely<00:01:34.560> still<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:35.009> pretty

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
week it would likely still be pretty

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.850 
week it would likely still be pretty
effective<00:01:35.729> once<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.600> week<00:01:36.810> somewhat<00:01:37.320> effective

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
effective once a week somewhat effective
