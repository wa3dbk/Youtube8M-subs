thing<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.450> fully<00:01:52.079> fully<00:01:52.290> loaded<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.009> I

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
thing is fully fully loaded so like I

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.819 
thing is fully fully loaded so like I
said<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.430> does<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:54.000> blu-ray<00:01:54.750> drive<00:01:54.829> which

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
said it does have a blu-ray drive which

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.950 
said it does have a blu-ray drive which
is<00:01:55.950> also<00:01:56.189> doubles<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.880> full<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.450> DVD

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
is also doubles as a full on DVD

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.719 
is also doubles as a full on DVD
supermulti<00:01:58.320> drive<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:58.979> going<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.159> burn<00:01:59.340> all

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
supermulti drive it's going to burn all

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.789 
supermulti drive it's going to burn all

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
your DVDs your plus R is your minus R is

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.530 
your DVDs your plus R is your minus R is
your<00:02:01.920> Rams<00:02:02.130> your<00:02:02.310> problems<00:02:02.610> your<00:02:02.729> RW<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.390> your
