neoprene<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.390> actually<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:40.049> wind

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
neoprene and this actually is wind

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.950 
neoprene and this actually is wind
resistant<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.700> also<00:01:41.850> repels<00:01:42.150> water<00:01:42.509> so

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
resistant and it also repels water so

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.870 
resistant and it also repels water so
water<00:01:43.079> considered<00:01:43.590> repels<00:01:43.920> off<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.520> helps

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
water considered repels off this helps

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.880

of it is what's called a fluid flexing a
parade<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.810> that's<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.409> new

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
parade and that's this new

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.580

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
here in the upper body where you need

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.500 
here in the upper body where you need
all<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.220> moment<00:01:58.580> of<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.850> momentum<00:01:59.300> in<00:01:59.420> the

all the moment of the momentum in the
movement<00:01:59.930> you<00:02:00.440> have<00:02:00.560> no<00:02:00.740> seams<00:02:01.070> underneath

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460

movement you have no seams underneath
the<00:02:01.580> arm<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.390> food<00:02:02.930> flex<00:02:03.260> here<00:02:03.530> is

actually maximizing the areas that you

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.529 
actually maximizing the areas that you

down the side body of the wetsuit as
well<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.080> then<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.770> other<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.430> material<00:02:17.180> use

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
well and then the other of material use

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.690 
well and then the other of material use
the<00:02:17.750> other<00:02:17.870> type<00:02:18.050> of<00:02:18.080> neoprene<00:02:18.530> is<00:02:18.770> a<00:02:18.800> is<00:02:19.070> an

the other type of neoprene is a is an

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.330 
the other type of neoprene is a is an

ultra fact ultraflex DS neoprene and
that's<00:02:22.760> actually<00:02:22.940> down<00:02:23.270> here<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.630> lower

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
that's actually down here in the lower

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.510 
that's actually down here in the lower
part<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.230> body<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.740> little<00:02:25.010> bit<00:02:25.130> different

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
part of the body a little bit different

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.810 
part of the body a little bit different
Sheen<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:26.330> little<00:02:26.840> bit<00:02:26.930> more<00:02:27.050> durable<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:28.580> this

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
Sheen a little bit more durable and this

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.240 
Sheen a little bit more durable and this
is<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.090> thicker<00:02:29.330> neoprene<00:02:29.840> as<00:02:30.020> well<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:30.770> these

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
is the thicker neoprene as well so these

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.250 
is the thicker neoprene as well so these
areas<00:02:31.880> were<00:02:32.090> more<00:02:32.420> stationary<00:02:32.959> use<00:02:33.620> the

areas were more stationary use the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.140 
areas were more stationary use the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
drain hole gear so that actually keeps

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.960 
drain hole gear so that actually keeps

couple other things I'll show you on the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.930 
couple other things I'll show you on the
interior<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.660> have<00:03:17.780> a<00:03:17.810> glide<00:03:18.170> skin<00:03:18.709> neck<00:03:19.310> that

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
interior you have a glide skin neck that

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.390 
interior you have a glide skin neck that
actually<00:03:20.239> is<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.540> nice<00:03:20.720> roll<00:03:21.170> neck<00:03:21.739> too<00:03:22.160> so

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
actually is a nice roll neck too so

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.949 
actually is a nice roll neck too so
there's<00:03:22.549> two<00:03:22.700> pieces<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.030> neoprene<00:03:23.420> here<00:03:23.750> and

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
there's two pieces of neoprene here and

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.680 
there's two pieces of neoprene here and
that<00:03:24.500> actually<00:03:24.890> allows<00:03:25.100> you<00:03:25.820> not<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.150> get<00:03:26.630> a

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
that actually allows you not to get a

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.750 
that actually allows you not to get a
rash<00:03:27.079> around<00:03:27.350> your<00:03:27.650> neck<00:03:27.799> because<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.459> rolls

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
rash around your neck because it rolls

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.060 
rash around your neck because it rolls
and<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.480> also<00:03:29.600> creates<00:03:30.019> a<00:03:30.079> seal<00:03:30.410> between<00:03:30.739> your

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
and it also creates a seal between your
