it's<00:02:44.740> it's<00:02:45.010> not<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.220> perfect<00:02:45.520> game<00:02:45.940> but<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.660> is

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
it's it's not a perfect game but it is

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.900 
it's it's not a perfect game but it is
the<00:02:47.020> measuring<00:02:47.500> stick<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:48.010> which<00:02:48.190> i<00:02:48.430> measure

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
the measuring stick to which i measure

all other call of duty titles I i'm
going<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.810> objectively<00:02:53.320> say<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.740> probably

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
going to objectively say that probably

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.160 
going to objectively say that probably
not<00:02:54.490> fair<00:02:56.040> but<00:02:57.040> it's<00:02:57.820> just<00:02:58.120> how<00:02:58.570> it<00:02:58.720> is<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:59.050> me

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170
