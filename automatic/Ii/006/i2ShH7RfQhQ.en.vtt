know the value-added would be gone
because<00:04:44.640> of<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.420> travel

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
because of the travel

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.600 
because of the travel
you<00:04:46.969> know<00:04:47.089> wouldn't<00:04:47.449> be<00:04:47.599> affordable<00:04:48.610> for

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
you know wouldn't be affordable for

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.450 
you know wouldn't be affordable for
people<00:04:49.669> to<00:04:50.059> be<00:04:50.180> able<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.529> swing<00:04:51.529> their<00:04:51.770> firm<00:04:52.009> I

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
people to be able to swing their firm I

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.499 
people to be able to swing their firm I
think<00:04:53.240> that<00:04:53.689> that<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.439> drive<00:04:54.969> from<00:04:55.969> people

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
think that that the drive from people

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.989 
think that that the drive from people
looking<00:04:56.749> for<00:04:56.990> local<00:04:57.710> food<00:04:57.919> is<00:04:58.099> driving<00:04:58.669> the

00:04:58.989 --> 00:04:58.999 
looking for local food is driving the

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:02.469 
looking for local food is driving the
the<00:04:59.210> beef<00:04:59.360> industry<00:05:00.339> you<00:05:01.339> know<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.669> there's

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
the beef industry you know the there's

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.839 
the beef industry you know the there's
definitely<00:05:03.050> more<00:05:03.319> demand<00:05:04.189> than<00:05:04.610> there<00:05:04.669> is

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
definitely more demand than there is

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.649 
definitely more demand than there is
supply<00:05:05.710> but<00:05:06.710> as<00:05:06.860> more<00:05:07.219> farmers<00:05:07.639> diversify<00:05:08.330> and

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:08.659 
supply but as more farmers diversify and

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.610 
supply but as more farmers diversify and
get<00:05:08.839> into<00:05:09.169> raising<00:05:09.949> more<00:05:10.099> beef<00:05:10.279> cattle<00:05:11.229> then<00:05:12.229> I

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
get into raising more beef cattle then I

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.159 
get into raising more beef cattle then I
think<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:13.009> that<00:05:13.279> it's<00:05:13.490> going<00:05:13.729> to<00:05:14.089> be<00:05:14.779> able<00:05:14.870> to

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
think that that it's going to be able to

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.559 
think that that it's going to be able to
supply<00:05:15.469> the<00:05:15.559> demand<00:05:15.770> here<00:05:16.460> in<00:05:16.580> Vermont<00:05:16.909> more

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
supply the demand here in Vermont more

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.350 
supply the demand here in Vermont more
that<00:05:17.870> that<00:05:18.349> the<00:05:18.559> farmers<00:05:19.009> realize<00:05:19.699> how

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
that that the farmers realize how

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.899 
that that the farmers realize how
important<00:05:21.080> inspection<00:05:21.529> is<00:05:21.649> to<00:05:22.219> their<00:05:22.370> market

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
important inspection is to their market

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:25.320 
important inspection is to their market
the<00:05:23.389> more<00:05:23.629> they<00:05:24.080> support<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:24.979> slaughter

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
the more they support the slaughter

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.209 
the more they support the slaughter
industry<00:05:26.330> which<00:05:26.839> then<00:05:27.110> supports<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:27.919> local

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:28.219 
industry which then supports the local

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:33.159 
industry which then supports the local
industry<00:05:28.699> and<00:05:28.729> so<00:05:29.270> on<00:05:29.389> and<00:05:29.569> so<00:05:29.689> forth<00:05:32.169> there's

at dinner time I think that sort of it's
ironic<00:06:06.529> that<00:06:06.709> slaughterhouses<00:06:07.430> and<00:06:07.819> meat

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:08.209 
ironic that slaughterhouses and meat

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:10.089 
ironic that slaughterhouses and meat
