to 1972 now we have nine days away from
kickoff<00:00:21.150> there's<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.110> lot<00:00:22.259> of<00:00:22.380> young<00:00:22.500> guys<00:00:22.710> on

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
kickoff there's a lot of young guys on

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.499 
kickoff there's a lot of young guys on
this<00:00:23.040> team<00:00:23.099> what<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.700> they<00:00:23.849> expect<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.450> that

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
this team what can they expect in that

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.109 
this team what can they expect in that
first<00:00:24.840> game<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.439> think<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> first<00:00:26.640> game<00:00:26.850> is

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
first game I think the first game is

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.090 
first game I think the first game is
it's<00:00:27.900> going<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.140> be<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> tough<00:00:28.500> game<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.740> think

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
it's going to be a tough game I think

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.980 
it's going to be a tough game I think
we've<00:00:29.490> we've<00:00:29.789> drawn<00:00:30.270> a<00:00:30.300> very<00:00:30.449> tough<00:00:30.840> opponent

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
we've we've drawn a very tough opponent

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.680 
we've we've drawn a very tough opponent
and<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:32.400> think<00:00:32.669> they'll<00:00:32.820> grow<00:00:32.970> up<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.180> lot<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
and I think they'll grow up a lot and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.720 
and I think they'll grow up a lot and
you'll<00:00:34.500> see<00:00:34.680> probably<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.129> most<00:00:35.370> improvement

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
you'll see probably the most improvement

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.549 
you'll see probably the most improvement
between<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.210> first<00:00:36.660> game<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.080> second<00:00:37.410> game

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
between the first game and second game

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.400 
between the first game and second game
so<00:00:37.830> I<00:00:38.090> expect<00:00:39.090> good<00:00:39.239> things<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.870> what

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
so I expect good things out of it what

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.750 
so I expect good things out of it what
do<00:00:40.470> you<00:00:40.559> think<00:00:40.769> about<00:00:40.860> what<00:00:41.160> head<00:00:41.370> coach<00:00:41.400> Butch

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
Jones is doing with this program I think

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.340
