that<00:03:55.409> you<00:03:55.560> could<00:03:55.739> shine<00:03:55.919> a<00:03:55.979> light<00:03:56.220> through

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:56.689 
that you could shine a light through

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.479 
that you could shine a light through
however<00:03:57.689> quite<00:03:58.049> honestly<00:03:58.470> this<00:03:58.859> works

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
however quite honestly this works

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.509 
however quite honestly this works
dubiously<00:04:00.359> to<00:04:00.689> some<00:04:00.870> extent<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:02.069> it's<00:04:02.370> not

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
dubiously to some extent so it's not

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.270 
dubiously to some extent so it's not
really<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.060> feature<00:04:03.359> that<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.689> miss<00:04:04.049> and<00:04:04.349> though

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
really a feature that I miss and though

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.309 
really a feature that I miss and though
I<00:04:05.310> really<00:04:05.639> do<00:04:05.879> like<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.269> orange<00:04:06.479> sword<00:04:06.870> here<00:04:07.169> I

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
I really do like the orange sword here I

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.439 
I really do like the orange sword here I
do<00:04:07.709> like<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.220> accuracy<00:04:08.819> of<00:04:08.849> this<00:04:09.000> guy<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.209> bit

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
do like the accuracy of this guy a bit

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.689 
do like the accuracy of this guy a bit
better<00:04:09.659> another<00:04:10.439> major<00:04:10.680> difference<00:04:10.859> as<00:04:11.340> well

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
better another major difference as well

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.229 
better another major difference as well
in<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.509> actual<00:04:12.930> mold<00:04:13.349> is<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.370> cut<00:04:15.090> this

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
in the actual mold is that I cut this

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.330 
in the actual mold is that I cut this
off<00:04:15.449> on<00:04:15.689> my<00:04:15.900> Hasbro<00:04:16.440> one<00:04:16.620> but<00:04:16.949> there<00:04:17.159> is<00:04:17.310> a

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
off on my Hasbro one but there is a

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.539 
off on my Hasbro one but there is a
little<00:04:17.639> peg<00:04:17.909> here<00:04:18.419> if<00:04:18.650> you<00:04:19.650> look<00:04:19.859> closely<00:04:20.190> you

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
little peg here if you look closely you

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.069 
little peg here if you look closely you
can<00:04:20.579> see<00:04:20.909> where<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.120> cut<00:04:21.359> it<00:04:21.510> there's<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.900> little

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
can see where I cut it there's a little

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.810 
can see where I cut it there's a little
pig<00:04:22.380> which<00:04:22.620> is<00:04:22.770> used<00:04:23.039> here<00:04:23.190> in<00:04:23.520> order<00:04:23.700> to

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
pig which is used here in order to

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.150 
pig which is used here in order to
connect<00:04:24.389> the<00:04:24.479> two<00:04:24.659> truck<00:04:24.930> halves<00:04:25.169> together

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
connect the two truck halves together

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.060 
connect the two truck halves together
it<00:04:26.340> is<00:04:26.960> completely<00:04:27.960> unnecessary<00:04:28.200> for<00:04:28.980> the

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
it is completely unnecessary for the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.100 
it is completely unnecessary for the
mold<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.640> actually<00:04:30.240> hold<00:04:30.510> together<00:04:30.720> in

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
mold to actually hold together in

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.610 
mold to actually hold together in
vehicle<00:04:31.590> mode<00:04:31.940> but<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.660> main<00:04:33.870> problem<00:04:34.500> with

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
vehicle mode but the main problem with

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.830 
vehicle mode but the main problem with
it<00:04:34.800> is<00:04:34.830> that<00:04:35.010> if<00:04:35.670> you<00:04:35.940> look<00:04:36.150> here<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:36.600> actually

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
it is that if you look here it actually

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.620 
it is that if you look here it actually
impedes<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:37.800> shoulder<00:04:38.190> movement<00:04:38.640> because

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
impedes the shoulder movement because

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.090 
impedes the shoulder movement because
then<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:39.930> can<00:04:40.050> only<00:04:40.170> get<00:04:40.350> about<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:40.860> much

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
then you can only get about this much

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.730 
then you can only get about this much

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
range of the stroller clapping the peg

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.100 
range of the stroller clapping the peg
allows<00:04:44.130> for<00:04:44.520> full<00:04:44.790> range<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.240> motion<00:04:45.300> in<00:04:45.780> this

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
allows for full range of motion in this

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.960 
allows for full range of motion in this
figure<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:46.620> what<00:04:47.100> is<00:04:47.250> full<00:04:47.520> range<00:04:47.760> of<00:04:47.910> motion

you<00:04:48.390> might<00:04:48.570> ask<00:04:48.780> well<00:04:49.500> it's<00:04:49.800> a<00:04:49.950> very<00:04:50.340> poseable

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
you might ask well it's a very poseable

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.050 
you might ask well it's a very poseable
figure<00:04:51.270> like<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.840> original<00:04:52.350> it's<00:04:53.070> got<00:04:53.430> swivel

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
figure like the original it's got swivel

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
as a ball jointed head so it is most

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.490 
as a ball jointed head so it is most
definitely<00:05:09.240> more<00:05:09.840> poseable<00:05:10.260> than<00:05:10.410> the

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
definitely more poseable than the

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.680 
definitely more poseable than the
original<00:05:10.980> which<00:05:11.220> those<00:05:12.060> still<00:05:12.360> a<00:05:12.390> fairly

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
original which those still a fairly

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.370 
original which those still a fairly
poseable<00:05:13.200> figure<00:05:13.560> today<00:05:13.770> is<00:05:14.600> quickly<00:05:15.600> kind<00:05:16.260> of

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
poseable figure today is quickly kind of

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.650 
poseable figure today is quickly kind of
becoming<00:05:16.770> obsoleted<00:05:17.700> by<00:05:17.700> some<00:05:18.300> of<00:05:18.390> the<00:05:18.450> newer

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.890 
becoming obsoleted by some of the newer
transformers<00:05:19.550> but<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.880> neatest<00:05:21.270> part<00:05:21.630> of<00:05:21.810> the

transformers but the neatest part of the
pose<00:05:22.050> ability<00:05:22.470> here<00:05:22.770> is<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:24.000> wrist<00:05:24.360> here<00:05:24.690> the

wrist is on a ball joint but a swivel as
well<00:05:27.450> which<00:05:28.260> means<00:05:28.530> you<00:05:28.680> can<00:05:28.800> get<00:05:29.010> all<00:05:29.220> sorts
