00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
at the base set this aside it's good

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.210 
at the base set this aside it's good
idea<00:02:37.630> now<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.110> tip<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> compressor<00:02:38.980> on<00:02:39.040> its

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
idea now to tip the compressor on its

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.760 
idea now to tip the compressor on its

end just to remove any beads that may

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.680 
end just to remove any beads that may

our kit I mean sir a filter from our kit
so<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.450> sensor<00:04:10.730> I'll<00:04:11.730> kick<00:04:11.970> one<00:04:12.150> come<00:04:12.390> with

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
so the sensor I'll kick one come with

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.890 
so the sensor I'll kick one come with
the<00:04:12.810> center<00:04:13.530> hole<00:04:13.710> so<00:04:14.700> what<00:04:15.240> we<00:04:15.390> need<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.570> do

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
the center hole so what we need to do

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.690 
the center hole so what we need to do
put<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.500> o-ring<00:04:17.010> bound<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:17.520> here<00:04:19.610> put<00:04:20.610> the

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
put the o-ring bound to here put the

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.560 
put the o-ring bound to here put the
faceplate<00:04:20.970> back<00:04:21.510> on<00:04:26.000> make<00:04:27.000> sure<00:04:27.210> it's<00:04:27.390> nice

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
faceplate back on make sure it's nice

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.270 
faceplate back on make sure it's nice
and<00:04:27.600> center<00:04:28.200> and<00:04:28.380> you<00:04:28.500> can<00:04:28.680> see<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.980> o-ring

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
and center and you can see the o-ring

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.200 
and center and you can see the o-ring
all<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.520> way<00:04:29.640> around

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
all the way around

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.940 
all the way around
that's<00:04:30.480> going<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.720> sit<00:04:30.930> flush<00:04:31.200> to<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.500> inside

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
that's going to sit flush to the inside

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.090 
that's going to sit flush to the inside
of<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.280> filter<00:04:32.520> wall<00:04:33.320> stop<00:04:34.320> any<00:04:34.560> air<00:04:34.680> bypass

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
of the filter wall stop any air bypass

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.370 
of the filter wall stop any air bypass
on<00:04:35.280> without<00:04:35.370> going<00:04:35.700> through<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:35.940> filter<00:04:36.390> okay

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
on without going through the filter okay

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.890 
on without going through the filter okay
so<00:04:38.190> once<00:04:38.340> you've<00:04:38.460> got<00:04:38.550> that<00:04:38.640> nice<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.270> sensor

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
so once you've got that nice and sensor

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.310 
so once you've got that nice and sensor
we<00:04:40.110> can<00:04:40.140> then<00:04:40.410> take<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:41.300> small<00:04:42.300> screwdriver<00:04:42.660> and

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
we can then take a small screwdriver and

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.430 
we can then take a small screwdriver and
just<00:04:43.500> create<00:04:44.310> that<00:04:44.430> hole<00:04:44.670> for<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.000> middle<00:04:45.440> now

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
just create that hole for the middle now

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.440 
just create that hole for the middle now

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
you can either rivet these two parts

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.610 
you can either rivet these two parts
together<00:04:48.570> as<00:04:49.020> per<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.440> original<00:04:51.560> using<00:04:52.560> a

filter<00:05:33.800> that<00:05:34.370> we<00:05:34.490> just<00:05:34.670> made<00:05:34.910> we<00:05:35.210> will<00:05:35.930> the

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
filter that we just made we will the

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.880 
filter that we just made we will the
bolt<00:05:36.230> points<00:05:36.560> in<00:05:36.650> outwards<00:05:38.560> digging<00:05:39.560> into<00:05:39.680> the

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
bolt points in outwards digging into the

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.330 
bolt points in outwards digging into the
filter<00:05:40.340> push<00:05:40.550> down<00:05:40.910> gently<00:05:41.240> to<00:05:41.980> hard<00:05:42.980> on<00:05:43.250> the

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
filter push down gently to hard on the

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:50.200 
filter push down gently to hard on the
beads<00:05:43.580> fly<00:05:44.300> out<00:05:45.190> okay<00:05:46.190> that's<00:05:46.400> nice<00:05:49.090> take<00:05:50.090> the

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
beads fly out okay that's nice take the

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.510 
beads fly out okay that's nice take the
spring<00:05:51.370> and<00:05:52.370> the<00:05:52.460> center<00:05:52.880> of<00:05:52.970> the<00:05:53.090> filter

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
spring and the center of the filter

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:04.660 
spring and the center of the filter
simply<00:05:55.520> this<00:05:55.940> cover<00:05:56.320> and<00:05:57.320> push<00:05:57.590> it<00:05:57.830> in<00:06:03.670> push

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.670 
simply this cover and push it in push

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.120 
simply this cover and push it in push
down<00:06:04.940> on<00:06:04.970> that<00:06:05.320> put<00:06:06.320> a<00:06:06.350> couple<00:06:06.620> of<00:06:06.710> bolts<00:06:06.890> in

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
down on that put a couple of bolts in

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:15.280 
down on that put a couple of bolts in
just<00:06:07.340> return<00:06:07.790> the<00:06:07.970> head<00:06:13.840> in<00:06:14.840> it's<00:06:15.020> good<00:06:15.200> to

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
just return the head in it's good to

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:24.040 
just return the head in it's good to
remember<00:06:15.440> the<00:06:15.710> orderlies<00:06:16.130> go<00:06:16.430> in<00:06:22.840> there<00:06:23.840> we<00:06:23.900> go

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
remember the orderlies go in there we go

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.550
