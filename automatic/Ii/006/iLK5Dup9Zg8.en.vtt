00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
has a nice base to sit into we think

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.020 
has a nice base to sit into we think
that<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.900> device<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.170> obviously<00:02:49.879> going<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:50.940> be

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
that the device is obviously going to be

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.520 
that the device is obviously going to be
placed<00:02:51.299> on<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.599> countertop<00:02:52.079> but<00:02:52.230> for<00:02:52.409> those

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
placed on the countertop but for those
