00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.300 

okay<00:00:16.850> we<00:00:17.060> start<00:00:17.300> with<00:00:17.510> two<00:00:17.780> layers<00:00:18.020> a<00:00:18.500> skull

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
okay we start with two layers a skull

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.540 
okay we start with two layers a skull
and<00:00:19.640> a<00:00:19.760> face<00:00:20.529> bring<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:21.680> opacity<00:00:21.950> of<00:00:22.340> the

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
and a face bring the opacity of the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.769 
and a face bring the opacity of the
skull<00:00:22.970> layer<00:00:23.150> down<00:00:23.420> to<00:00:23.630> 50%<00:00:24.170> or<00:00:24.619> so<00:00:25.540> you<00:00:26.540> see

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
skull layer down to 50% or so you see

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.220 
skull layer down to 50% or so you see
our<00:00:26.900> already<00:00:27.320> modified<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:28.220> skull<00:00:28.490> to<00:00:28.670> match

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
our already modified the skull to match

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.570 
our already modified the skull to match
the<00:00:30.230> dimensions<00:00:30.529> of<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.039> face<00:00:33.430> I'll<00:00:34.430> make<00:00:34.550> a

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
the dimensions of the face I'll make a

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.110 
the dimensions of the face I'll make a
duplicate<00:00:35.210> of<00:00:35.330> the<00:00:35.510> face<00:00:35.750> layer<00:00:36.080> and<00:00:36.850> on<00:00:37.850> that

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
duplicate of the face layer and on that

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.660 
duplicate of the face layer and on that
duplicate<00:00:39.790> we'll<00:00:40.790> go<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:41.350> on<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.860> menu<00:00:43.160> colors

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
duplicate we'll go to on the menu colors

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.390 
duplicate we'll go to on the menu colors
value<00:00:44.330> invert<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.320> that'll<00:00:45.680> create<00:00:45.949> a<00:00:46.040> glow

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
value invert and that'll create a glow

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.939 
value invert and that'll create a glow
effect<00:00:47.530> and<00:00:49.780> we'll<00:00:50.780> get<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.110> opacity<00:00:51.409> just

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
effect and we'll get the opacity just

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:01.840 
effect and we'll get the opacity just
right<00:00:54.400> and<00:00:56.170> in<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:58.010> skull<00:00:58.400> there<00:00:58.820> we'll<00:01:00.790> go<00:01:01.790> to

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
right and in the skull there we'll go to

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.049 
right and in the skull there we'll go to
dodge<00:01:02.540> mode<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:03.409> adjust<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:04.159> opacity<00:01:04.460> and

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
dodge mode and adjust the opacity and

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.789 
dodge mode and adjust the opacity and
that'll<00:01:05.510> blend<00:01:06.320> in<00:01:06.650> with<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:08.440> face<00:01:09.440> copy

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
that'll blend in with the face copy

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.280 
that'll blend in with the face copy
layer<00:01:11.020> now<00:01:12.020> we<00:01:12.080> can<00:01:12.380> merge<00:01:12.650> down<00:01:13.960> merge<00:01:14.960> down

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
layer now we can merge down merge down

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.140 
layer now we can merge down merge down
on<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.560> skull<00:01:15.830> layer<00:01:16.040> into<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.520> face<00:01:16.790> copy

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
on the skull layer into the face copy

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.459 
on the skull layer into the face copy
layer<00:01:18.250> and<00:01:19.329> then<00:01:20.329> with<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.600> face<00:01:20.780> copy<00:01:21.109> layer

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
layer and then with the face copy layer

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:33.550 
layer and then with the face copy layer
we<00:01:22.009> can<00:01:23.829> have<00:01:24.829> to<00:01:25.070> put<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:28.240> layer<00:01:29.240> mask<00:01:32.380> click<00:01:33.380> on

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
we can have to put a layer mask click on

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.319 
we can have to put a layer mask click on
the<00:01:33.740> layer<00:01:33.890> mask<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:34.729> make<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:34.909> selection

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
the layer mask and make a selection

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.209 
the layer mask and make a selection
across<00:01:36.109> the<00:01:36.500> face<00:01:36.710> like<00:01:37.359> this<00:01:38.359> and<00:01:38.979> we'll<00:01:39.979> fill

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
across the face like this and we'll fill

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.279 
across the face like this and we'll fill
that<00:01:40.250> in<00:01:40.729> with<00:01:41.590> white<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.990> that'll<00:01:44.990> be<00:01:45.109> for

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
that in with white and that'll be for

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.980 
that in with white and that'll be for
the<00:01:45.380> layer<00:01:45.560> mask<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.689> that'll<00:01:47.689> create<00:01:47.810> a

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
the layer mask and that'll create a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.380 
the layer mask and that'll create a
transparent<00:01:48.799> area<00:01:51.789> and<00:01:52.789> we'll<00:01:53.600> click<00:01:53.899> the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
transparent area and we'll click the

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.760 
transparent area and we'll click the
transparent<00:01:56.390> area<00:01:56.719> and<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.200> up<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:57.590> down

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
transparent area and the up and down

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.029 
transparent area and the up and down
arrow<00:01:58.100> keys<00:01:58.219> on<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.909> keyboard<00:01:59.590> to<00:02:00.590> move<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.920> up

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
arrow keys on the keyboard to move it up

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.590 
arrow keys on the keyboard to move it up
and<00:02:01.249> down<00:02:03.159> now<00:02:04.159> we<00:02:04.219> need<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.670> make<00:02:04.789> frames<00:02:05.210> for

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
and down now we need to make frames for

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.639 
and down now we need to make frames for
the<00:02:05.689> animation<00:02:07.210> so<00:02:08.210> go<00:02:08.539> ahead<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:08.840> merge<00:02:09.289> the

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
the animation so go ahead and merge the

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.809 
the animation so go ahead and merge the
two<00:02:09.800> layers<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:11.170> go<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.230> copy<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.920> menu

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.709 

and<00:02:17.739> open<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.829> new<00:02:18.980> project<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:21.219> paste<00:02:22.219> as<00:02:22.719> new

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:23.719 
and open a new project and paste as new

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.979 
and open a new project and paste as new
layer<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.939> this<00:02:25.939> will<00:02:26.120> be<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.359> first<00:02:26.629> frame

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
layer and this will be the first frame

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.410 
layer and this will be the first frame
of<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.409> animation<00:02:30.670> go<00:02:31.670> back<00:02:31.879> to<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.180> first

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
of the animation go back to the first

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.199 
of the animation go back to the first
project<00:02:33.730> undo<00:02:34.730> undo<00:02:35.090> things<00:02:36.099> and<00:02:37.099> to<00:02:37.760> get<00:02:37.939> both

project undo undo things and to get both
of<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:39.170> frames<00:02:39.590> back<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.780> we'll<00:02:41.780> do<00:02:41.989> the

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
of the frames back and we'll do the

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:55.780 
of the frames back and we'll do the
second<00:02:43.189> frame<00:02:50.170> like<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:54.010> mert<00:02:55.040> merged

and back to the animation project and

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.729 
and back to the animation project and
paste<00:03:10.459> as<00:03:10.730> new<00:03:10.969> layer<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:13.540> we<00:03:14.540> have<00:03:14.780> two

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
paste as new layer and we have two

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.500 
paste as new layer and we have two
frames<00:03:18.010> here<00:03:19.010> I<00:03:19.040> created<00:03:19.760> all<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.180> frames

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
frames here I created all the frames

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:29.110 
frames here I created all the frames
already<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.590> there's<00:03:22.579> about<00:03:23.379> 27<00:03:24.379> and<00:03:26.950> you<00:03:28.120> can

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
already and there's about 27 and you can

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.030 
already and there's about 27 and you can
see<00:03:29.299> how<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.510> animation<00:03:29.930> is<00:03:30.290> is<00:03:30.620> going<00:03:30.980> to

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
see how the animation is is going to

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.119 
see how the animation is is going to
look<00:03:31.250> like<00:03:31.280> here<00:03:32.920> now<00:03:33.920> go<00:03:34.099> to<00:03:34.159> filter

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
look like here now go to filter

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.990 
look like here now go to filter
animation<00:03:37.989> playback<00:03:39.159> and<00:03:40.159> we'll<00:03:40.669> see<00:03:40.849> what<00:03:40.970> it

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
animation playback and we'll see what it

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.599 
animation playback and we'll see what it
looks<00:03:41.269> like<00:03:41.530> press<00:03:42.530> play<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:48.340> we<00:03:49.340> have<00:03:49.489> an

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
looks like press play and we have an

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:55.330 
looks like press play and we have an
animation<00:03:50.060> with<00:03:50.359> a<00:03:50.469> repeating<00:03:51.469> loop

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.920 

let's<00:03:56.340> go<00:03:56.610> ahead<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:56.940> turn<00:03:57.300> this<00:03:57.480> into<00:03:57.540> an

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
let's go ahead and turn this into an

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.240 
let's go ahead and turn this into an
animated<00:03:58.530> gif<00:03:58.940> file<00:04:03.170> but<00:04:04.170> first<00:04:04.500> let's<00:04:04.800> scale

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
animated gif file but first let's scale
