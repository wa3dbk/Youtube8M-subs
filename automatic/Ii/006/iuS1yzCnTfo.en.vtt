00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 and we will start with economic issues the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.059
 The price of coffee has varied due to the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.340
 crisis that has occurred in the south of the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.070
 continent in brazil this because of 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.910
 climatic factors this translates into 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.859
 an improvement in the price of coffee 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.160
 Nicaraguan at this time costs 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.400
 quintal 205 dollars this indicates that the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.619
 item has recovered substantially 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.480
 during the presentation of results of 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.430
 the volumes traded in the stock exchange 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.890
 Nicaraguan values ​​carried out by 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.540
 invercasa stock exchange said that 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.489
 the price of coffee had a spike 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.620
 due to the climatic situation of 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.650
 Brazil raising the price of coffee 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.620
 Nicaraguan at $ 205 per quintal 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.110
 but on the other hand we have to sue 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.360
 in indonesia and in places in the middle 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.400
 East are increasing then 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.280
 this is also something positive for the 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.900
 coffee prices between more demand and 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.750
 same offer in prices increase 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.320
 then it is like hitting the 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.200
 technical analysis with the fundamental or 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.570
 be at least that there is some surprise 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.159
 and that the harvest has not really been 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.170
 so affected then the prices 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.299
 they could potentially fall but the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.369
 oriented outlook is positive for 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.320
 prices and continue to increase according to 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.510
 regulates mature vice president of 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.310
 invercasa brokerage said that the 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.500
 producers should take advantage of this 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.960
 situation to fix the sale price 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.490
 of coffee in the future we do not speculate that 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.520
 let's keep these prices for a 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.619
 long time 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.619
 now with respect to affectations 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.570
 climatological as the child is very 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.670
 difficult to defend against that let's say 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.969
 that there is a very strong drought 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.130
 there are enough rains then there are 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.659
 to be simply prepared and have 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.270
 contingencies that's why we tell them but 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.090
 we set them at these prices because what 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.189
 if productivity or not a 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.310
 affectation as the boy or the girl 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.469
 let's say that it will affect the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.060
 harvest that is going to fall as is 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.189
 happening in Brazil that falls very 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.569
 early because it blossomed very early and 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.569
 we do not have time to harvest the
