from australia it's to my knowledge this

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.080 
from australia it's to my knowledge this
i'd<00:00:19.380> say<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:19.830> probably<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.189> four-door<00:00:20.640> camaro

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
i'd say it's probably a four-door camaro

i'd say it's probably a four-door camaro
basically<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.439> what<00:00:22.590> i<00:00:22.740> would<00:00:22.980> say<00:00:23.220> it

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
basically this is what i would say it

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.410
