that<00:01:13.770> one<00:01:13.979> side<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.340> map<00:01:14.520> where<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that one side of the map where it is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.880 
that one side of the map where it is
right<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.509> because<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.530> easy<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.799> go

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
right now just because it's easy to go

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.179 
right now just because it's easy to go
back<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.310> forth<00:01:17.490> from<00:01:17.700> C<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.950> it<00:01:19.950> just

back and forth from C to a and it just

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.770 
back and forth from C to a and it just
makes<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.520> most<00:01:20.549> sense<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.150> terms<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.540> where

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
makes the most sense in terms of where

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.990 
makes the most sense in terms of where
they<00:01:21.960> spawn<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:23.009> how<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:23.640> get<00:01:23.820> them

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
they spawn and just how I can get them

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.340 
they spawn and just how I can get them
you'll<00:01:24.270> see<00:01:24.479> what<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> mean<00:01:24.869> throughout<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
you'll see what I mean throughout the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.560 
you'll see what I mean throughout the
gameplay<00:01:25.710> oh<00:01:25.920> yeah<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.850> 6<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:27.360> 6

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
gameplay oh yeah this is 6 for 6

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.469 
gameplay oh yeah this is 6 for 6
domination<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.579> either<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.880> play<00:01:30.090> style<00:01:30.299> is

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
domination and either the play style is

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.660 
domination and either the play style is
a<00:01:30.509> lot<00:01:30.840> different<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.159> go<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> lot

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
a lot different so you go it's a lot

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.370 
a lot different so you go it's a lot
slower<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.119> when<00:01:33.990> you're<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.170> for

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
slower but when you're going for

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.740 
slower but when you're going for
headshots<00:01:34.500> which<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.070> what<00:01:35.189> I'm<00:01:35.280> doing<00:01:35.310> today

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
headshots which is what I'm doing today

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
headshots which is what I'm doing today
it's<00:01:36.750> pretty<00:01:37.200> good<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.979> there's<00:01:38.189> an<00:01:38.310> afk

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
it's pretty good so I see there's an afk

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.490 
it's pretty good so I see there's an afk
guy<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> go<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> guy<00:01:39.900> taking<00:01:40.170> C

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
guy there so I go for the guy taking C

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.590 
guy there so I go for the guy taking C
turn<00:01:41.400> around<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> guy<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.540> know

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
turn around get the a guy that I know

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.850 
turn around get the a guy that I know
they're<00:01:42.930> gonna<00:01:43.049> spawn<00:01:43.259> around<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.590> corner

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
they're gonna spawn around this corner

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.130 
they're gonna spawn around this corner
so<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.070> get<00:01:44.280> them<00:01:44.490> aim<00:01:44.729> for<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.149> head<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.570> get

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
so I get them aim for the head and get

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.469 
so I get them aim for the head and get
them<00:01:46.290> off<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.729> that<00:01:47.729> was<00:01:47.820> quite<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.030> shot<00:01:48.299> feed

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
them off so that was quite a shot feed

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.870 
them off so that was quite a shot feed
and<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.320> think<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:49.829> only<00:01:50.009> 3<00:01:50.340> players<00:01:50.640> on

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
and I think there was only 3 players on

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.550 
and I think there was only 3 players on
the<00:01:50.970> enemy<00:01:51.210> team<00:01:51.240> when<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> got

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
the enemy team when I got that so I got

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.160 
the enemy team when I got that so I got
that<00:01:52.740> entire<00:01:53.100> team<00:01:53.340> plus<00:01:53.610> one<00:01:53.850> guy<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.020> is

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
that entire team plus one guy so that is

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.590 
that entire team plus one guy so that is
pretty<00:01:55.320> cool<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.799> ask<00:01:56.009> me<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.790> think<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.509> my

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
pretty cool if you ask me I think in my

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.789 
pretty cool if you ask me I think in my
montage<00:01:57.960> I'm<00:01:58.079> gonna<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.530> somehow

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
montage I'm gonna have to like somehow

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.190 
montage I'm gonna have to like somehow
bring<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> scoreboard<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.780> can

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
bring up the scoreboard so that I can

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.959 
bring up the scoreboard so that I can
show<00:02:01.500> there<00:02:01.680> was<00:02:01.740> only<00:02:01.920> like<00:02:02.040> 3<00:02:02.549> players<00:02:02.790> on

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
that makes it a lot more impressive oh

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.410 
that makes it a lot more impressive oh
yeah<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.020> had<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> quad<00:02:07.409> headshot<00:02:07.740> feed<00:02:07.950> there

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.630 
yeah I had a quad headshot feed there
that<00:02:10.420> was<00:02:10.569> kind<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:10.840> just<00:02:11.049> that<00:02:11.980> was<00:02:12.129> that<00:02:12.519> was

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
that was kind of just that was that was

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.339 
that was kind of just that was that was
lucky<00:02:13.000> kind<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.390> because<00:02:13.750> there<00:02:13.959> was<00:02:14.049> an<00:02:14.140> afk

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
lucky kind of because there was an afk

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.699 
lucky kind of because there was an afk
guy<00:02:14.739> there<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.340> obviously<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:16.379> shot<00:02:17.379> the<00:02:17.560> guy

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
guy there so obviously I shot the guy

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.130 
guy there so obviously I shot the guy
that<00:02:17.950> was<00:02:18.069> not<00:02:18.220> afk<00:02:18.790> because<00:02:19.360> he<00:02:19.689> was<00:02:19.810> more<00:02:20.049> of

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
that was not afk because he was more of

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.020 
that was not afk because he was more of
a<00:02:20.200> threat<00:02:20.439> and<00:02:20.680> then<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.920> can<00:02:21.159> get<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.459> afk<00:02:21.849> guy

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
a threat and then I can get the afk guy

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.580 
a threat and then I can get the afk guy
after<00:02:22.390> because<00:02:22.720> what's<00:02:23.170> he<00:02:23.230> gonna<00:02:23.319> do<00:02:23.470> he's

not gonna shoot at me or anything so

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.330 
not gonna shoot at me or anything so
it's<00:02:25.659> a<00:02:25.810> that's<00:02:26.709> what<00:02:26.859> you<00:02:26.920> want<00:02:27.069> to<00:02:27.129> do<00:02:27.220> when

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
it's a that's what you want to do when

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.160 
it's a that's what you want to do when
you<00:02:27.430> see<00:02:27.549> afk<00:02:27.849> people<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.390> then<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.750> just<00:02:29.049> knew

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
you see afk people and then I just knew

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.360 
you see afk people and then I just knew
they<00:02:29.290> were<00:02:29.379> gonna<00:02:29.500> spawn<00:02:29.739> around<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:30.099> corner

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
they were gonna spawn around that corner

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.880 
they were gonna spawn around that corner
because<00:02:30.659> that<00:02:31.659> is<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:32.079> how<00:02:32.319> this<00:02:32.530> map<00:02:32.709> is

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
because that is just how this map is

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.770 
because that is just how this map is
it's<00:02:33.220> pretty<00:02:33.370> spawns<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.329> this<00:02:34.420> map<00:02:34.569> aren't

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
it's pretty spawns on this map aren't

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.030 
it's pretty spawns on this map aren't
great<00:02:35.049> but<00:02:35.260> once<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.560> know<00:02:35.680> them<00:02:35.859> they're

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
great but once you know them they're

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.080 
great but once you know them they're
very<00:02:36.069> easy<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.579> control<00:02:37.200> but<00:02:38.200> also<00:02:38.349> I<00:02:38.879> am<00:02:39.879> using

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
very easy to control but also I am using

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.660 
very easy to control but also I am using
a<00:02:40.390> tactical<00:02:40.989> insertion<00:02:41.109> this<00:02:41.500> game<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.430> try

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
a tactical insertion this game and I try

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.860 
a tactical insertion this game and I try
and<00:02:42.730> do<00:02:42.849> that<00:02:43.000> always<00:02:43.359> when<00:02:43.540> I'm<00:02:43.629> playing

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
and do that always when I'm playing

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.259 
and do that always when I'm playing
domination<00:02:44.609> just<00:02:45.609> cuz<00:02:45.730> it's<00:02:45.879> easier<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.180> get

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
domination just cuz it's easier to get

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.009 
domination just cuz it's easier to get
from<00:02:46.450> place<00:02:46.629> to<00:02:46.659> place

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
from place to place

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.599 
from place to place
even<00:02:47.409> though<00:02:47.530> missions<00:02:47.920> such<00:02:48.129> a<00:02:48.159> small<00:02:48.430> map

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
even though missions such a small map

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.250 
even though missions such a small map
and<00:02:48.879> probably<00:02:49.209> be<00:02:49.299> easier<00:02:49.599> for<00:02:49.629> headshots<00:02:50.079> by

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
and probably be easier for headshots by

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.890 
and probably be easier for headshots by
its<00:02:50.409> stuns<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:50.920> just<00:02:51.129> oh<00:02:51.400> my<00:02:52.329> god<00:02:52.359> is<00:02:52.780> my

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
gonna obviously make my way over here I

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.720 
gonna obviously make my way over here I
see<00:03:19.060> also<00:03:19.629> in<00:03:20.139> in<00:03:20.500> domination<00:03:20.919> but<00:03:21.549> what's

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
see also in in domination but what's

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.400 
see also in in domination but what's
even<00:03:21.849> more<00:03:22.030> important<00:03:22.660> than<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.900> actual

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
even more important than the actual

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.589 
even more important than the actual
flags<00:03:23.709> that<00:03:23.949> are<00:03:24.010> captured<00:03:24.699> is<00:03:24.879> the

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
flags that are captured is the

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.030 
flags that are captured is the
positioning<00:03:26.199> of<00:03:26.319> your<00:03:26.349> teammates<00:03:26.859> because

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
positioning of your teammates because

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.659 
positioning of your teammates because
it's<00:03:27.370> only<00:03:27.519> six<00:03:27.760> four<00:03:27.940> six<00:03:28.889> so<00:03:29.889> if<00:03:30.190> one<00:03:30.519> of<00:03:30.579> your

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
it's only six four six so if one of your

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.670 
it's only six four six so if one of your
teammates<00:03:30.970> pushes<00:03:31.359> I<00:03:31.540> guess<00:03:32.169> it<00:03:32.290> doesn't

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
teammates pushes I guess it doesn't

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.860 
teammates pushes I guess it doesn't
really<00:03:32.769> matter<00:03:32.919> at<00:03:33.190> 66<00:03:33.699> but<00:03:33.909> what's<00:03:34.720> more

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
really matter at 66 but what's more

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.420 
really matter at 66 but what's more
important<00:03:35.290> is<00:03:35.440> if<00:03:35.590> someone<00:03:35.859> pushes<00:03:36.040> cuz<00:03:36.310> as

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
important is if someone pushes cuz as

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.619 
important is if someone pushes cuz as
soon<00:03:36.609> as<00:03:36.730> someone<00:03:36.879> pushes<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.389> spawn

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
soon as someone pushes the spawn

just go to the next flag move on that's

just go to the next flag move on that's
what<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.519> want<00:03:51.669> to<00:03:51.729> do<00:03:51.819> so<00:03:52.479> the<00:03:52.629> teammates

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
what you want to do so the teammates

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.960 
what you want to do so the teammates
positioning<00:03:53.590> is<00:03:53.769> very<00:03:53.889> very<00:03:54.489> important<00:03:54.879> in

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
positioning is very very important in

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.500 
positioning is very very important in
domination<00:03:55.769> so<00:03:56.769> kind<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.489> look<00:03:57.849> at<00:03:58.000> look<00:03:58.419> at

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
domination so kind of look at look at

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.270 
domination so kind of look at look at
the<00:03:58.659> mini-map<00:03:58.959> as<00:03:59.169> I'm<00:03:59.290> playing<00:03:59.560> here<00:03:59.769> just<00:04:00.190> so

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
the mini-map as I'm playing here just so

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.000 
the mini-map as I'm playing here just so
you<00:04:00.310> can<00:04:00.519> understand<00:04:01.000> maybe<00:04:01.840> like<00:04:02.169> why<00:04:02.530> I<00:04:02.560> move

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
you can understand maybe like why I move

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.369 
you can understand maybe like why I move
to<00:04:03.220> places<00:04:03.609> even<00:04:04.599> though<00:04:04.840> we<00:04:04.989> might<00:04:05.139> not<00:04:05.319> have

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
to places even though we might not have

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.500 
to places even though we might not have
that<00:04:05.769> flag<00:04:06.040> if<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:06.340> know<00:04:06.430> what<00:04:06.519> I<00:04:06.549> mean<00:04:06.760> but

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
that flag if you know what I mean but

that flag if you know what I mean but
anyways<00:04:07.780> on<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.169> a<00:04:08.199> flag<00:04:08.530> here<00:04:08.859> this<00:04:09.159> is<00:04:09.250> where

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
a flag that they always run down that's

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
the other main spawn point so those are

the three main ones for a I think I

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.220 
the three main ones for a I think I

touched on the ones that are SE

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.930 
touched on the ones that are SE
obviously<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.010> place<00:04:31.580> where<00:04:31.730> I<00:04:31.760> got<00:04:31.910> that

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
is scoped in already up and then either

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.730 
is scoped in already up and then either
move<00:05:15.770> down<00:05:16.100> to<00:05:16.700> their<00:05:16.850> head<00:05:17.000> or<00:05:17.290> maybe<00:05:18.290> it'll

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
move down to their head or maybe it'll

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.950 
move down to their head or maybe it'll
already<00:05:18.980> be<00:05:19.190> on<00:05:19.430> their<00:05:19.640> head<00:05:19.790> because<00:05:19.960> it's

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
already be on their head because it's

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.840 
already be on their head because it's
much<00:05:21.230> more<00:05:21.440> like<00:05:21.770> you're<00:05:22.100> much<00:05:22.340> more<00:05:22.490> likely<00:05:22.820> a

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
much more like you're much more likely a

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.220 
much more like you're much more likely a
head<00:05:23.060> hit<00:05:23.510> head<00:05:23.690> shot<00:05:23.900> if<00:05:23.990> you're<00:05:24.110> already

aimed up and you're going slightly down

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.450 
aimed up and you're going slightly down

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
rather than scoping it at the body and

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.620 
rather than scoping it at the body and
like<00:05:28.580> rushing<00:05:28.940> it<00:05:29.060> if<00:05:29.210> you<00:05:29.300> know<00:05:29.360> what<00:05:29.450> I<00:05:29.480> mean

because<00:05:58.130> that's<00:05:58.280> the<00:05:58.430> most<00:05:58.580> common<00:05:58.700> spawn<00:05:59.240> i

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
because that's the most common spawn i

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.070 
because that's the most common spawn i
from<00:06:00.800> my<00:06:00.919> experience<00:06:01.570> but<00:06:02.570> the<00:06:02.720> gameplay<00:06:02.900> is

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
from my experience but the gameplay is

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.270 
from my experience but the gameplay is
coming<00:06:03.350> to<00:06:03.440> an<00:06:03.530> end<00:06:03.620> right<00:06:03.860> here<00:06:04.010> I<00:06:04.070> actually

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
coming to an end right here I actually

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.880 
coming to an end right here I actually
do<00:06:04.550> hit<00:06:04.760> another<00:06:05.270> headshot<00:06:05.480> clip<00:06:05.930> so<00:06:06.680> that's<00:06:06.830> a

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
do hit another headshot clip so that's a

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.050 
do hit another headshot clip so that's a
good<00:06:07.040> way<00:06:07.160> to<00:06:07.220> end<00:06:07.310> the<00:06:07.430> game<00:06:07.580> it<00:06:07.850> could<00:06:07.970> have

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
good way to end the game it could have

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.030 
good way to end the game it could have
been<00:06:08.120> a<00:06:08.180> triple<00:06:08.419> headshot<00:06:08.840> cam<00:06:09.260> in<00:06:09.560> the<00:06:09.800> air
