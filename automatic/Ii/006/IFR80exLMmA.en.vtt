flawlessly windows thinks it's running
on<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> pc<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.189> part<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.460> its<00:01:14.580> been

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
on a pc and so that part of its been

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.969 
on a pc and so that part of its been
very<00:01:14.970> very<00:01:15.210> good<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:16.290> what<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.439> really<00:01:16.770> want<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
very very good but what I really want to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.039 
very very good but what I really want to
show<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.970> called<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> coherence

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
show you is what is called the coherence

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.340 
show you is what is called the coherence
mode<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:20.310> coherence<00:01:20.939> mode<00:01:21.210> what<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> does

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
mode and in coherence mode what it does

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.170 
mode and in coherence mode what it does
is<00:01:22.650> take<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.130> individual<00:01:23.850> window

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
is take that individual window

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.690 
is take that individual window
eliminates<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.259> now<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.890> application

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
eliminates it and now the application

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.100 
eliminates it and now the application
itself<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:28.170> running<00:01:28.380> inside<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
itself is just running inside and on the

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.340 
itself is just running inside and on the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.399 
the slideshow and start taking people
through<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.530> slides<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.280> showing<00:01:41.820> us<00:01:42.409> how

through the slides and showing us how

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.330 
through the slides and showing us how
this<00:01:43.710> works<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:45.110> then<00:01:46.110> i<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.409> also<00:01:46.619> at<00:01:46.979> the

this works but then i can also at the
same<00:01:47.520> time<00:01:47.820> i<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.630> run<00:01:49.020> an<00:01:49.409> existing<00:01:50.250> mac<00:01:51.149> OS

at this point hopefully with an upgrade
it'll<00:02:52.799> it'll<00:02:53.069> catch<00:02:53.370> up<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.239> do<00:02:54.540> run

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
it'll it'll catch up so I do run

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
applications really are over here in the

applications really are over here in the
OSX<00:03:04.920> world<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.370> found<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.480> has<00:03:06.630> been<00:03:06.750> very

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
OSX world I found that it has been very

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.009 
OSX world I found that it has been very
easy<00:03:07.349> to<00:03:08.099> pick<00:03:08.310> up<00:03:08.459> Mac<00:03:08.819> OS<00:03:09.150> X<00:03:09.329> it's<00:03:09.750> been<00:03:09.989> very

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
easy to pick up Mac OS X it's been very

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.000 
easy to pick up Mac OS X it's been very
easy<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.739> understand<00:03:11.250> their<00:03:11.489> programs<00:03:13.010> the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
easy to understand their programs the

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.379 
easy to understand their programs the
navigation<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.239> very<00:03:15.390> very<00:03:16.940> easy<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.239> natural

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
navigation is very very easy and natural

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.569 
navigation is very very easy and natural
it<00:03:18.900> was<00:03:19.049> easy<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.319> pick<00:03:19.560> up<00:03:19.590> wasn't<00:03:20.250> hard<00:03:20.459> at

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
it was easy to pick up wasn't hard at

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.610 
it was easy to pick up wasn't hard at
all<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.060> I've<00:03:21.690> really<00:03:22.049> really<00:03:22.290> enjoyed<00:03:22.590> it

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
all and I've really really enjoyed it

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.500 
all and I've really really enjoyed it
but<00:03:23.040> if<00:03:23.370> you're<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.700> thinking<00:03:24.030> of<00:03:24.120> making<00:03:24.299> the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
but if you're the thinking of making the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.470 
but if you're the thinking of making the
transition<00:03:24.930> from<00:03:25.139> pc<00:03:25.859> to<00:03:25.889> mac<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.400> i<00:03:26.459> spent<00:03:26.790> 27

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
transition from pc to mac and i spent 27

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.500 
transition from pc to mac and i spent 27
years<00:03:27.630> in<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.870> pc<00:03:28.290> world<00:03:28.500> parallel<00:03:29.370> 6<00:03:29.880> really

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
years in the pc world parallel 6 really

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.379 
years in the pc world parallel 6 really
helps<00:03:30.750> make<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:30.959> transition<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.739> lot<00:03:32.010> easier

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
helps make the transition a lot easier

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.900 
helps make the transition a lot easier
so<00:03:33.389> that's<00:03:33.750> my<00:03:34.290> little<00:03:34.440> review<00:03:34.799> on<00:03:34.829> parallel<00:03:35.609> 6

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
so that's my little review on parallel 6

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.270 
so that's my little review on parallel 6
running<00:03:36.359> instead<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.720> mac<00:03:36.840> OS<00:03:37.109> x<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.500> i<00:03:38.160> hope

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
running instead of mac OS x and i hope

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.420 
running instead of mac OS x and i hope
you<00:03:38.400> found<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.639> useful<00:03:38.700> thanks
