00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello everyone introduce you how 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.519
 to make a patator and the rules to 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.099
 respect for it to be successful 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.200
 du manceau and so it's 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.759
 usually presented the patator so 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.480
 here you have the combustion chamber 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:23.609
 the stopper the 140 mm reducer here the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.740
 cannon so now in detail 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.769
 so here you have the room of 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.439
 burning with the plug the if 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.020
 the combustion chamber adapter on 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.559
 can you good the general tube the cork 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.079
 another adapter for the red 8h so 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.440
 the tube here is 100 mm in diameter 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.170
 and if it's 40mm in diameter then 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.289
 the gun so then with a seducer 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.719
 chronic preferences for 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.870
 welcome the barrel that makes a meter of 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.280
 long any battery and 40 mm in diameter has 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.510
 so because with the chamber of 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.829
 combustion in fact it would have been necessary 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.199
 is a cannon pretty much they do 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.430
 them four meters long so already that 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.890
 nothing what it is finding at this 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.280
 convenient to carry so we did 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.140
 small holes out for 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.110
 when the potato actually happens to 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.909
 the air that remains to be chased by you by 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.330
 the holes and papin in front so that the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.790
 potato all over the sides and saw that 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.009
 the potatoe 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.750
 when the potato leaves rather than seen our 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.549
 gun is too small which remains a gas 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.259
 pushed to prevent them from continuing to 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.790
 push the potato and that apart from 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.259
 right or left she that evacuate 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.110
 through the holes so that the potato 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.540
 will go back further and then come 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.659
 the dimensions respect because it takes 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.000
 know that a patator his ratio is in 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.810
 general the reassuring of the best patator 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.470
 7 to make this ratio can calculate the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.290
 volume of the combustion chamber / the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.290
 gun volume so we our ratio of 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.890
 small boat is legal at 2.87 if I 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.450
 remember well so it does not get closer 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.159
 too many two sets but hey we're going 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.250
 show all this if the powers is 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.550
 very good so to have a good 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.870
 ratio you have to cut the tube more than 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:16.080
 700 mm to 45 mm so from here to here next 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.920
 you add the two adapters for 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.209
 the cap and the reduction sleeve 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.690
 you colleague there that the pvc well 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.640
 heard here you have the last singing 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.560
 so we preferred to fix with four 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.769
 screw here believe because there is no 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.510
 a lot of glue surface see the 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.610
 cap it sinks of that so we 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.690
 prefer to hold it considering the power that it 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.269
 here we lie lying fixed here like 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.860
 the pb is that pvc then here you 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.110
 have the little piezoelectric a 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.370
 lighter so it's not difficult to 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.959
 find that here you extend both 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.310
 terminals of the water foot so what we 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.360
 call the mass that side and two 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.150
 talking little sons confess the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.220
 extend here you get them into 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.510
 the firebox makes you a 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.400
 small hole with a hot iron spike 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.650
 as it does not damage the pvc 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.560
 then you put some early colo that 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.810
 it's waterproof you make the entry the 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.790
 two and a year the two little bits of yarn 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.650
 from Kiev in front of the window so I 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:19.950
 do not know if we will see so it's good 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:24.290
 here then we will proceed to the test 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.290
 we'll show you that right now 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.769
 other now show you how 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.909
 load the patator so that's very 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.849
 simple know you can take a 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.129
 plain potato make it possible to sit 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:41.079
 resume a good big paw are 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:45.109
 you cut it and 1,2 of presence at perth 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:48.920
 you put it on the floor where you take 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:50.419
 the patator good we have a bit like we 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.549
 could say honed sharpened at the end 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.930
 for it to be well cut in more 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:04:00.439
 easy to get in easy to get into 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:02.060
 this game you take like that then you 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.370
 remove what will interest you northeast 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.389
 who surround me you take your iphone 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.849
 you were so like that it's 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.299
 because it's cleaner these little ones 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.879
 roosters 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.319
 we made a flurry are barely 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.370
 of love in metal where you take 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.419
 any material what is 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.959
 you want them to go into 40 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:21.709
 mm the feint firing father for that when 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.289
 we just stuff size at the end of the barrel 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.840
 like that there is no problem 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:29.080
 the potato would go well right then 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.080
 in you 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.470
 the potato and then put 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.020
 the 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.150
 the oxidizer so you can take 10 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.760
 deodorants or CCAA any 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.860
 no matter what it imports 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.020
 bomb if you want what it takes 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.470
 that in there is butane and 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.450
 propane 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.620
 we can see in the ingredients here 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.270
 so you call it the minibus that this 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.060
 will be to take the mark pay that 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:07.280
 fifty thousand euros 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:09.710
 you take the inside you do not put me 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.960
 not without putting me too much in a hurry often 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.160
 the true experience and the dosage is 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.120
 the experience made of objects like that 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.180
 is largely sufficient 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.930
 so here I'm going to show you to 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.690
 butchers right away it would be nice for you 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:30.950
 here to show you right away 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.450
 how to shoot with the patator here we have 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.370
 loaded the potato into the gun on 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.780
 plowed to the end we will put the 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.780
 back in the field responds to shoot 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.010
 so here you have seen the power of the 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.670
 patator so it's gone very very very 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.080
 rare there is not the killings can 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.330
 allah it's true everyone more than this 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.950
 we did so here is if you have 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.380
 liked this video and explanations 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.610
 you can could put a little 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.390
 green thumb on the video you can the 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.280
 share also 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.330
 and if you have comments from 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.980
 questions to ask ourselves 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.470
 information sealed in the 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.390
 comments and an accountant for you 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.320
 subscribe to our channel also here is 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.980
 thank you very much see you soon 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.980
 Hi 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.790
 here is the power of the patator she is 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:48.450
 party behind the trees you see 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:51.419
 there in the bonus level with a 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.750
 small as in the gun instead 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.750
 a potato 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:05.240
 I think he exposes the perfect bomb 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.240
 I do not know, see you soon 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.200
 hello to all we will you 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.200
 present how to make a pastor
