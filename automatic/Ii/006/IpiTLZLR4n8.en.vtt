00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.289
 Today I'll show you what I'm from 

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:13.000
 training I eat it reform trim white 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.219
 that's basmati because that's enough 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.529
 reality of bass matic 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.900
 other types of rice is best 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:26.460
 I also taste what I have to say 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.460
 makes best of the circle I'll open 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:37.260
 now I have 200 grams of basmati rice 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:41.980
 Put in the rice cooking bowl 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:45.579
 as you know you do rice 12 so 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.540
 do when we lined 200 grams rice 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:52.750
 we need 400 400 milliliters of water 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:56.800
 do it clean enough to cook 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:01.800
 So, if you do a glass of white wine 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:06.880
 then you do two glasses of water just like that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:15.790
 400 400 grams do we or 400 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:18.780
 Milliliters of water are 400 pour 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.580
 we just go in too 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.670
 So I have been drinking for almost 30 years 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.920
 and I have at least 56 so far 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.049
 Rice cooker destroys the go 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.020
 some time broke because I'm in the day 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.390
 Sometimes I cook up to 23 times rice 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.430
 I want it to be fresh and I think 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.710
 Ideal for bodybuilders a rice cooker 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.420
 because you do not have to be careful 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.000
 whether you go to the shower or something 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.280
 By the way rice cooker does it differently if 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.420
 the button is ready the button jumps up 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:53.729
 and 30 done so ideal invention too 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:57.070
 Not just frequent reading for bodybuilders 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.259
 is on and when done 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.259
 cooked the button jumps up and 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:06.250
 we finished our white so now 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.979
 we need our meat out of that 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.720
 as with steak media germany i leg 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.809
 now also worth what I eat and 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.150
 where it comes from, we should believe too 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:18.180
 even if I buy fish now, etc 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.299
 that no aqacur 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.969
 only is in free-living fish 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.739
 we can not prevent that 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:28.650
 we are little there but at least 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:36.200
 take a little consideration for the environment 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.200
 this is now like steak tor out 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.269
 if I buy a greasy stick then 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.760
 I do not put any oil in the pan 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.980
 the fat from the bridge becomes this 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.200
 That 's really crispy too 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.109
 I do not fry any more 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.730
 But what I do I have salad 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.489
 As you know, I'm not prepared 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.159
 big fan of vegetables I do but 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:08.510
 a little bit of vinegar I put in 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:12.409
 and very little cold pressed olive oil 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.269
 very important also the quality of the oil 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.480
 by a bit pure on the tomatoes 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.189
 At first it tastes good 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.680
 Secondly, I also have it through and also 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:23.760
 a little more energy 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.780
 Now we wait until the pan is hot 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:32.849
 is and clap to because I stand 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:38.669
 pure and after that we eat now we do 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.750
 Now he is wearing a bridge so you should 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.310
 do not turn so often 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.250
 That's why we wait until the bottom side 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.790
 is now really brown 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.549
 I like to eat medium so half 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.439
 bloody so if only once 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:58.040
 or twice at most and then is for 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:04:00.810
 me enough now the question how to 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.530
 should eat if you lose weight 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.229
 want 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.509
 low carb or low fat so that must 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:11.310
 everyone to find out for myself i have one 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:14.040
 also low carb and a lot of fat eaten it 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.329
 also worked only i had him 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:22.800
 with fiber and with stomach problems 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:24.810
 I personally think so minimize 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.110
 do not completely abandon but minimize 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.000
 and you can control carbs 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.950
 do with the body what you want 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.550
 if one time 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.530
 okay that can be just as fat 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.050
 keep slightly higher than carbohydrates 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.330
 then he should try that too 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.830
 there is no rule everyone needs for 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.680
 to find the best 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:51.840
 I eat about one body weight 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:54.720
 grams of fat carbs three to four 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.550
 gramm and get along with it very well 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.750
 have enough energy and my shape is 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:05.430
 reasonably okay then when diet comes 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:09.570
 reduced how could of course down 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.810
 and then around 100 works properly 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.220
 percent so I find with carbohydrates 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.330
 the body works 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:22.320
 much better like fat fatty mostly 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:26.360
 Low so about three minutes 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:29.850
 if I then my steak as I said without 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.150
 Oil to or without fat to your own 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.670
 rich in fat for this short 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.500
 to reach prix surface without on 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:44.130
 burn 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:46.470
 Now my steak is finished sound out 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:50.010
 Rice cook is the ideal man can rice 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.910
 Keep warm as long as you are not out 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:56.100
 and that's how it stays off 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.390
 everything was but I'm out of trouble because of me 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:03.270
 synonymous take something out now 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:08.060
 rice is also finished 200 grams we have 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.060
 I will eat 100 grams now 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:20.220
 the approximately 100 grams of rice to 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:24.740
 I have prepared just mine 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:27.510
 tomato salad with vinegar and olive oil only 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.370
 I do not need any more and then I leave 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.290
 I'm starting to train now too 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.120
 therefore basmati rice because it is easier 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.320
 is digestible and faster 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.320
 Carbohydrates are also available
