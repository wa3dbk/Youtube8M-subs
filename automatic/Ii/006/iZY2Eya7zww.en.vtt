00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
thing about it that you know if you find

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.180 
thing about it that you know if you find

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
one of those games

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.070 
one of those games
you<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:14.430> leave<00:02:14.580> that's<00:02:14.970> what<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.120> do<00:02:15.240> but

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
other than that it's a short map with a

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.730 
other than that it's a short map with a
middle<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:22.110> two<00:02:23.030> lanes<00:02:24.030> on<00:02:24.360> both<00:02:24.540> sides<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
middle to two lanes on both sides on the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.310 
middle to two lanes on both sides on the
right<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.400> know<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.820> upper<00:02:27.270> right<00:02:27.480> lanes<00:02:27.750> to

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
right you know to upper right lanes to

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.490 
right you know to upper right lanes to
lower<00:02:28.860> lanes<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.520> middle<00:02:29.730> lane<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.500> the

lower lanes in the middle lane and the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.710 
lower lanes in the middle lane and the
thing<00:02:31.680> about<00:02:31.710> this<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.690> a

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
thing about this is is that this is a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.100 
thing about this is is that this is a
good<00:02:33.960> map<00:02:34.140> for<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.560> MSMC<00:02:35.810> because<00:02:36.810> it's<00:02:36.960> high

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
good map for the MSMC because it's high

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.510 
good map for the MSMC because it's high
damage<00:02:37.640> it's<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.730> highest<00:02:38.880> damage<00:02:39.800> SMG<00:02:40.800> so

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
damage it's the highest damage SMG so

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.650 
damage it's the highest damage SMG so
you're<00:02:41.640> going<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.790> get<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:41.970> lot<00:02:42.210> of<00:02:42.240> short

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
once people figure it out and get to

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.330 
once people figure it out and get to
know<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:40.050> I<00:03:40.230> have<00:03:40.620> been<00:03:40.739> playing<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:41.010> lot<00:03:41.100> more
