00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.520

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.440
 forget clear that you are not my assistant 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.060
 happy star I have sage salvia 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.890
 we use a little but as the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.600
 Times of Thanksgiving and square days 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.100
 party exactly and the sage is 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.050
 start using you want me to know her 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.060
 we use it very little in Mexico 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.070
 the taste is a bit different strange 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.070
 for us it is a European 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.650
 a few chilito flakes 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.660
 tree and I'll bother you heart 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.290
 otherwise your foot is up to your 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.990
 chips that admit a reflector not to 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.760
 350 degrees fahrenheit per hour of 180 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.320
 degrees felt and I'll tell you by 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.300
 how much they approximate dust until 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.620
 we have footsteps about 15 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.620
 20 minutes 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.010
 this mixture 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.010
 let's go perfectly what I'm going to sanction 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.379
 with salt and pepper 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.300
 ready we can take this so that paris 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.300
 can take very well 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.689
 I do not want to know anything about my name what 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.519
 we mix everything perfectly and I have a 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.200
 mold for bread that like all 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.190
 we have at home that is a refractory 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.980
 rectangular 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.210
 and our meatloaf is ready if 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.460
 you do not find a bank in the market 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.070
 you can substitute it for breadcrumbs 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.940
 what happens is the one that the bank absorbs 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.460
 less fat and I like the texture that 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.970
 leave especially when it is a frying 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.410
 we are ready ready now 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.030
 our onion soup is cooking 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.440
 we spinach are ready 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.830
 our pan has to be passed over there 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.170
 and olga sana is going to put here in this 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.510
 mix in the bread pan that is going to be 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.490
 a delicious meatloaf that 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.290
 let's go with spinach and these 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.890
 lists 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.780
 and for chips and now what else makes us 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.940
 50 degrees is missing 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.550
 factory and 180 you'll feel for 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.680
 approximately one hour is very 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.780
 important that blackbirds as they are called 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.370
 English meat pies or the 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.310
 let's stop handcuffing after they leave

 coming soon about 15 minutes before 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.540
 slice them if you do not go cold 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.160
 will win perfectly if you do not 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.830
