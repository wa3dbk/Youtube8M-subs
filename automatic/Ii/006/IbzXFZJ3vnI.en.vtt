to<00:01:34.470> get<00:01:34.560> more<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.100> don't<00:01:35.340> think<00:01:35.400> or<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
to get more of it I don't think or is it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.370 
to get more of it I don't think or is it
just<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.630> exactly<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> same<00:01:37.200> as

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
just going to be exactly the same as

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.840 
just going to be exactly the same as
that<00:01:37.710> pretty<00:01:37.920> much<00:01:38.040> everything<00:01:38.579> else<00:01:38.670> that

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
that pretty much everything else that

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.600 
that pretty much everything else that
they<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.150> go<00:01:39.299> bodom<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.920> dyno<00:01:41.189> chart<00:01:41.460> I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
they you go bodom like the dyno chart I

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.819 
they you go bodom like the dyno chart I
think<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.450> super<00:01:42.960> energy<00:01:43.320> chases

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
think so this be super energy chases

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.149 
think so this be super energy chases
that's<00:01:44.250> gonna<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> thing<00:01:45.090> super<00:01:45.930> energy<00:01:46.680> at

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
that's gonna be a thing super energy at

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
quite a lot of stuff when it comes to

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.210 
quite a lot of stuff when it comes to
and<00:04:41.080> power<00:04:42.080> rangers<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:42.650> super<00:04:42.949> power

it's kind of weird i think it's going to
be<00:04:47.060> a<00:04:47.120> good<00:04:47.330> show<00:04:47.539> and<00:04:47.750> i'm<00:04:48.169> probably<00:04:48.860> watch<00:04:49.039> it

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
be a good show and i'm probably watch it

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.469 
be a good show and i'm probably watch it
i<00:04:49.280> didn't<00:04:49.490> really<00:04:49.580> like<00:04:49.759> it<00:04:49.789> but<00:04:50.060> step<00:04:50.270> but

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
i didn't really like it but step but

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.810 
i didn't really like it but step but
this<00:04:50.930> is<00:04:51.110> going<00:04:51.320> to<00:04:51.380> be<00:04:51.500> something<00:04:51.979> cool<00:04:52.160> as<00:04:52.699> i

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
this is going to be something cool as i
