00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello you tube friends in this video I bring you how to create a server 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.870
 metin2 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.650
 since other drones that do it and upload it to YouTube or speak as if they 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.079
 they were getting 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:14.019
 ohl speak good credit point or speak with music put and you do not understand a 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.019
 prick 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.429
 good let's start 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:22.339
 first you have to download these files 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:23.630
 nabi cat 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.749
 by sea 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.310
 install server 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.369
 and finally a metin2 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.439
 that opens with the face of the south to 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.710
 and have an mc file 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.710
 to appear with the notes blog icon 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.520
 you have to unzip the installation file see 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.070
 the counter seal 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.320
 mcm mc dotcom 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.140
 and they will have a file with Chinese letters 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.140
 or I do not know what putada is that 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.100
 well here is the folder that will be left 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.860
 but I already passed the files that we are going to occupy to another xd 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.570
 well I'll pass them so they can see what they are 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.710
 good are those that are called server and mt2 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.660
 those files will come with another name but 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.770
 you will pass those files to another folder with destination to where you 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.520
 want 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.330
 they are passed to the folder 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.590
 and they change the name to how I already have them changed 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.630
 server 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.120
 and mt2 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.950
 since changed the name 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.850
 open the file that weighs 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.780
 13 or 12 kilos and ex 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.900
 but you give them right click and open with 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.370
 and blog notes 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.440
 good looking for the bar that says 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.810
 absolute street 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.280
 and relative and pipe 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.290
 where it says supra will come Chinese letters that erase them and put the name of their 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.170
 server 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.800
 as I did not put it overcomes 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.080
 and where it says server will come more Chinese letters 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.090
 they delete them they put server 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.240
 server 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.450
 it's nothing else, no more server 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.580
 open the file called mt2 with virtual pc 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.650
 they give it in configuration and where memory says 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.620
 will be the ram that will be put into your server 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.930
 if your pc is windows xp 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.479
 and with a 75 revolved ips of ram I recommend 900 megawatts 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.329
 to run more or less quickly 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.109
 and your pc is normal 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:17.790
 now they go where network says and where adapter says one they give in to change and 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:18.989
 they change it for 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.059
 amachi net or org inter felix 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:22.619
 and they give in to accept 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.099
 now they give right click and open with 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.659
 and virtual pc 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.339
 the virtual pc 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:30.319
 will come in the folder where 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.649
 unzipped the install server 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:38.169
 will be compressed in huinca and will be called airplane under virtual pc 200 sp1 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.879
 guionbajo set aimed decompresses nobody 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.849
 they open the folder and give problems li ka virtual pc 2007 sp1 and that is the 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:46.729
 installer 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.959
 and now they open the file this 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.919
 of 12 or 13 kilos and ex 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:55.819
 with the virtual pc and ready wait where ss says hd 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:01.369
 give him to start and wait for lovin 'out 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.219
 this takes a bit 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.289
 so create and part 2 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:17.019
 how to create the server 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.379
 I tell them something 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.799
 I saw an idea of ​​how to make the server because live from goku 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.889
 but he did not speak he played music 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.379
 and skip the porma pine step they looked and explained well 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.539
 I know that nobody is perfect but if you have any doubt 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:44.019
 by claim or question I will be happy to answer 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.090
 since all the videos of how to create the server is a slop 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.339
 they do not explain well or see the letter you have to make great the 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.299
 youtube window to see what shit he wrote 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.309
 well there's how they saw it came out ssh from 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:00.309
 After that, some letters and login will come out 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:10.399
 well this has been the first part of the server she the rest is more or less 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:11.379
 easy 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.299
 x they must to the second part I assure you that they will have their private server
