00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.310
 and in this game he also told me 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.830
 walters was going to define another classified 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.059
 the quarterfinals the kind of man 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.120
 of gustavo quinteros 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.949
 emelec now visited in presi lake and 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.750
 the Ecuadorian team had won 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:19.510
 the one- to-one free throw 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.850
 by pedro quiñones contains renan no 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.820
 it could be for visitors to 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.480
 emelec 19 minutes and opened the 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.880
 marker 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.740
 so the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.450
 evidence 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.990
 esquerdinha 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:38.670
 the weather faces hooks before johnny and 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:41.600
 narvaez ends up defeating the goalkeeper 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.629
 emelec in excellent way less days 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.600
 effect the hitch leaves on the road to 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.559
 emelec player and the weather ends 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.510
 putting 1 to 0 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.070
 for goiás one by one like this in the global 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.719
 the two goals had been for those who 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.760
 they made of premises at the time we are 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.549
 speaking no 1 to 0 emelec 1 to 0 goiás 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.570
 this result forced the definition by 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:08.149
 penalties would have ended up happening in 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.590
 the second time that here as I said 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.380
 started in this way with auctions 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.680
 Crusaders of Tiago Mendes between the start 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.680
 to enter 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.240
 an archer who was protagonist so we 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.240
 liked it 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.460
 Quinteros attentive to what happened with 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.460
 with your team 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.950
 was to hold the head 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.030
 I could not convert 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.480
 for good 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.480
 a chance 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.119
 very clear clear from goiás 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.860
 again esquerdinha is the one who attends 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.860
 Mineiro good bail of the goalkeeper 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.680
 greeting emelec 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.220
 well the archer comes the archer with the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.340
 Bilge and emelec 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.200
 if it saves from holes that with one more goal 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.000
 the next instance advanced 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.830
 obviously the one who made a goal was the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.959
 that progressed well things were without 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.150
 forehand counterattack Bolanos 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.049
 it finishes fast renan 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.250
 look what erik eric lima does is going alone 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:34.610
 escapes from the exit of the arch 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.190
 incredible what is lost 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.470
 the chance of emelec and then this 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.940
 counterattack that could have ended 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.800
 in the classification of the Brazilian team 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.760
 from here on over to the definition by 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.040
 criminal 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.010

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.380
 scoreboard miller bolaños try 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.520
 with 1 to 1 in the series 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.000
 emelec equals in this way the turn of 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.510
 goias 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.530

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:12.030

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.900

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.660
 crosspiece that said no the turn of 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.330
 today I aspire 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.130
 the picture of mineiro ends up being 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.780
 rejected for wanting the Argentine 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.630
 mondaini converts for ml things 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.870
 they were matched now 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.370
 jackson shows to shake moments 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.850
 swollen but ended up turning to 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.650
 the goiás hit oscar bagüí and put the 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.090
 things 3 to 3 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.430

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.790
 becomes a goi player and returns 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.620
 now emelec to have the possibility of 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.409
 equalize the shares with gaibor 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.049
 fails here Pedro enrique and the things that 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.799
 they were 5-5 if I turned the 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.320
 emelec player 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.690
 emelec passed and he did fernando giménez 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.580
 beat renan and achieve classification 6 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.600
