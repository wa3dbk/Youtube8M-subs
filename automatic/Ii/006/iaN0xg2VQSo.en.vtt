let's not beat around the bush you know
you've<00:00:04.920> thought<00:00:04.950> about<00:00:05.250> it<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.609> today<00:00:06.029> we're

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
you've thought about it and today we're

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.450 
you've thought about it and today we're
going<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.509> answer<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:06.899> could<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.770> fart<00:00:08.340> your

going to answer it could you fart your

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.310 
going to answer it could you fart your
way<00:00:08.610> through<00:00:08.880> space<00:00:14.389> if<00:00:15.389> space<00:00:15.780> suits<00:00:16.020> didn't

but for the sake of this episode let's

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.359 
but for the sake of this episode let's
take<00:00:21.600> some<00:00:21.779> biological<00:00:21.990> license<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.859> pretend

you prefer pretend you have a suit with

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.429 
you prefer pretend you have a suit with
special<00:00:27.449> valves<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.960> would<00:00:28.080> allow<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.320> to

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
you then propel yourself with farts and

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
ball in this picture you represent the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.979 
ball in this picture you represent the
rocket<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.879> ball<00:01:00.059> represents<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> fuel

rocket and the ball represents the fuel
now<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.469> push<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.070> ball<00:01:02.219> forward<00:01:02.250> hard

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
now if you push the ball forward hard

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.179 
now if you push the ball forward hard
the<00:01:03.449> ball<00:01:03.629> also<00:01:04.110> pushes<00:01:04.470> backward<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the ball also pushes backward on you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.039 
the ball also pushes backward on you
giving<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> skateboard<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.630> backward

that's<00:01:09.180> how<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> rocket<00:01:09.659> works<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.560> throws

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that's how a rocket works as it throws

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.890 
that's how a rocket works as it throws
fuel<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.580> direction<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.299> fuel<00:01:12.510> pushes

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
fuel in one direction the fuel pushes

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.719 
fuel in one direction the fuel pushes
back<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> rocket<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.040> accelerate<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.670> in

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
back on the rocket to accelerate it in

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.219 
back on the rocket to accelerate it in
the<00:01:14.790> opposite<00:01:15.090> direction<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:15.689> unlike<00:01:16.020> me<00:01:16.200> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the opposite direction but unlike me a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.499 
the opposite direction but unlike me a
rocket<00:01:16.619> has<00:01:16.860> no<00:01:17.100> arms<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.820> how<00:01:18.030> does<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.240> throw

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
rocket has no arms so how does it throw

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.270 
rocket has no arms so how does it throw
the<00:01:18.540> fuel<00:01:18.990> well<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.409> conventional<00:01:19.979> Rockets

the<00:07:42.350> moon<00:07:42.470> be<00:07:42.530> seen<00:07:42.890> all<00:07:43.100> day<00:07:43.250> long<00:07:43.490> from

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:43.760 
the moon be seen all day long from

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.730 
the moon be seen all day long from
termina<00:07:44.090> you'd<00:07:44.600> seem<00:07:44.870> to<00:07:44.990> need<00:07:45.140> the<00:07:45.230> moon<00:07:45.440> to

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:45.740 
termina you'd seem to need the moon to

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.410 
termina you'd seem to need the moon to
orbit<00:07:46.040> around<00:07:46.340> the<00:07:46.610> planet<00:07:46.640> at<00:07:47.000> the<00:07:47.090> same<00:07:47.270> rate

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:47.420 
orbit around the planet at the same rate

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.850 
orbit around the planet at the same rate
that<00:07:47.450> the<00:07:47.630> planet<00:07:47.900> spins<00:07:48.110> on<00:07:48.260> its<00:07:48.290> axis<00:07:48.710> which

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:48.860 
that the planet spins on its axis which

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.050 
that the planet spins on its axis which
I<00:07:48.950> agree<00:07:49.280> is<00:07:49.400> not<00:07:49.550> something<00:07:49.850> this<00:07:49.940> should

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:50.060 
I agree is not something this should

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.370 
I agree is not something this should
happen<00:07:50.210> if<00:07:50.480> the<00:07:50.570> moon<00:07:50.660> is<00:07:50.720> also<00:07:51.020> gradually

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:51.380 
happen if the moon is also gradually

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.080 
happen if the moon is also gradually
getting<00:07:51.650> closer<00:07:51.920> it's<00:07:52.250> a<00:07:52.400> major<00:07:52.580> inaccuracy

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.090 
getting closer it's a major inaccuracy

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.880 
getting closer it's a major inaccuracy
in<00:07:53.300> the<00:07:53.390> game<00:07:53.570> and<00:07:53.870> as<00:07:54.110> I<00:07:54.230> said<00:07:54.290> I<00:07:54.620> don't<00:07:54.740> have

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:54.890 
in the game and as I said I don't have

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.620 
in the game and as I said I don't have
