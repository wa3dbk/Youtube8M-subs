00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.770
 Hello everyone 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:13.100
 It is a gull of the world rubber market . 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.730
 I think today's theme is to go to people who say they can't drive faster 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.920
 I will 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:21.600
 This is for beginners and intermediates who are not good at driving or 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.160
 Or it is said Toka sphere is slow 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:30.150
 If you want to increase the speed of the ball Please try to refer to this way by all means 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.470
 If you can get the speed is better if this method is more speed drive 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.100
 You can add speed so try it if you like 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:41.000
 After all the power during the game is not enough 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.510
 You may have to wait in the game, but you just hit your own dry beat on the opponent's block 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.010
 Even if I hit it I was just blocked 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:52.410
 It is very regrettable to lose to blocks, but according to the driveman, it divides between blocks 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:57.239
 Is returned I Purapura and easy good block to have to say that hard 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.829
 As it is the most painful of losing being moved , the drive speed is faster 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.789
 If it becomes 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.449
 You can shoot through the book and invite block mistakes by giving the fore 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.049
 I can 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:12.630
 So the chagrin of when everyone's is losing in such a lock bar 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:15.720
 Please do it by all means as you can improve it this way this time 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.820
 There are plenty of ways to speed up the drive 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.720
 Use the body to hit the correct form, etc. 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.030
 Well I think the person who is often doing a lot of things, but still quite a drive 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:31.390
 After all there are many who do not understand speed 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:35.500
 In where people approach that did not change even doing a pretend how to do that sort of at this time 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:41.260
 I 'll do a little bit about the ways that can change 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.540
 Focusing on this three fingers were Tei masu doing in the fact that it is here page one 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.680
 Please do something to 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:53.080
 Mast drive everyone's like to say that if this is what it 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.760
 Squeeze crowded I do not have this racket body still in the sense that say hit a drive 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:01.930
 I think it is general 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:06.250
 At this time, if you hit it with two fingers on the two fingers in the movie before and hit it, it will take strong rotation 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.179
 I introduced the thing, but this time is this, but it is a sum Sanbon 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.310
 This refers to the day 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.670
 Say ring finger middle finger 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.770
 The moment of impact this Smits Tteyuu 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.230
 Please put the jerk To Power 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.870
 The moment a jerk to drive such is the feeling 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.420
 Good 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.510
 Grinded it feels it 's 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:30.510
 When this force is applied, speed will come out 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.440
 This is also difficult to explain in theory, but when you put pressure on these three fingers, the ball 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.220
 like this 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.220
 To play 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.230
 Will be 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.980
 good Incopan is included 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.510
 It is a woman Japan 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:50.680
 It said that refrain to 1 and three fingers that are written 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:56.400
 So it's close to this drive Speed ​​drive loop drive 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:03:02.879
 This is the old style for all drives after regular drives 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:05.400
 After all , if you put a force on the three fingers you 've just done, the force to play will become stronger at once. 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:12.000
 Speed ​​is a point in the drive 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:14.220
 It feels less stable than just those two fingers, but I have a meeting from behind 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.390
 Toka If you want to skip the ball in 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.100
 After all, the game in place and want to go to shoot one shot 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:25.780
 So if you keep training this speed drive speed 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.640
 During the game you can give fear to your opponent Don't let that drive stop talking 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.350
 is 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:35.270
 Since May I miss you show Berg Which one early 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:38.500
 But I didn't get in There is still such a fast driver 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:42.010
 You can think in the wind that say beware 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:46.030
 Because there is Arai drive, receive is cautious 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.569
 The other party receives a mistake because the pressure is applied and it remembers and receives. 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:53.370
 Or 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:53.370
 Even if not taken constant directly in the drive, and the speed of the Fu say to Saab was nice 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:12.450
 ki to myself here till a line school player 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.660
 It's not too early, so something 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.769
 Is jumpy Shino even wanna afraid of was the idea 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.949
 It is doing the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:25.289
 So there is no chance that the speed of the drive is fast . 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:30.000
 Also who we are together also pen people of pen and press with a jerk to put a force on the finger of the back three 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:31.689
 The Tteyuu If Knuckles is the force becomes stronger pan and speed dot Kaa riding drive 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.619
 You will be able to 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:40.059
 Than it is difficult Tteyuu difficult Uchikata how to catch sense 

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:46.389
 It is quite easy to just put some effort on the postpartum finger to think about such a side 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:49.040
 I think that it is easy to take in immediately in the play video is a force on this day and three fingers 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:53.170
 I put it in and hit a speed drive 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.170
 Please try to vibrate when you got on the speed 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.900
 Hmm 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.900
 Hmm 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.630
 Hmm 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.630
 Hmm 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.139
 th 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.139
 pr 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.510
 I will 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.950
 It is
