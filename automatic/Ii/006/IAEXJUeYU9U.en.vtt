00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.219
 residents of the Donetsk region are watching 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.400
 the work of the miracle of the amphibian excavator 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.320
 volvo which protects the river bed dry 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.450
 butt river clearing program was 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.160
 approved by the district administration in 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.560
 late 2010 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.270
 and the implementation of the works themselves started 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.460
 late last year project 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.410
 provides for clearing 13 7 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.419
 kilometers at the moment already 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.610
 cleaned about eight kilometers 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.169
 technique that is used here 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.750
 and technology is advanced world 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.830
 technology based on tender results 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.570
 bidding conducted by management 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.790
 capital construction 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.310
 dry end cleaning agreement 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.860
 received Kramatorsk and enterprise spec 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.950
 nonsense construction machinery several tracked 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.260
 volvo excavators help clean 15 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.500
 kilometers of a dry end to then 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.300
 create a water intake on the river 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.210
 we started last year on 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.230
 Today have already passed the order 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.059
 half of the plot cleared the course 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.180
 made cleaning grew only in those 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.909
 places where it was possible to perform 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.990
 traditional technique that is 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.170
 excavator dragline backhoe 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.590
 which can move along durable 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.710
 ground in where to do it 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.120
 impossible this swampy floodplain 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.950
 it was decided our management 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.890
 acquisition enterprise 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.210
 excavator and he will tell you according to the main 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.579
 enterprise engineer 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.570
 project implementation time 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.729
 are shrinking 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.130
 thanks to the use of such advanced 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.619
 technology given the positive experience 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.630
 use of similar machines contractor 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.350
 planning to complete clearing first 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.179
 plot before the end of this year as 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.789
 known leadership of the Slavic region 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.280
 many years trying to solve the problem 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.020
 establishing the river bed that freed and 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.659
 would be significant territories from 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.090
 flooding improved the quality of life 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.490
 the population of adjacent villages screams and 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.020
 settlements the problem of flooding the village 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.819
 Free diver one of the global 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.670
 problems over the years 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.179
 literally well about 50 years old it's a problem 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.170
 acutely 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.480
 for clearing the river for excavating the fall even 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.140
 we already see results fell level 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.360
 water 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.079
 precisely in the areas of flooding this street 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.900
 adjacent to the floodplain decreased and 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.819
 flood danger we have from already even 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.299
 this year the total amount of work 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.060
 is 265 thousand cubic meters 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.609
 this is the excavation of sediments and expansion 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.069
 riverbed will also be carried out 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.260
 the arrangement of coastal zones of width 25 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.600
 meters on both sides of the river will 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
 held land cultivation and planted 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.170
 the trees 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.209
 and bottom sediments will be good 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.700
 mineral fertilizer work will be completed 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.340
 on clearing the bed of the dry end will 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.790
 together it flows into the state breech 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.530
 butt 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.380
 this will solve the problems of flooding 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.190
 Slavic territory and river rehabilitation 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.190
