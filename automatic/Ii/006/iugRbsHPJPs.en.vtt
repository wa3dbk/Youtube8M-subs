00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.910
 david who ask you how are you there 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.319
 it's going so far so good 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.889
 it's a bit like the guy who falls from a 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.019
 floor there are nicolas they ask you 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.340
 is playing really well 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.940
 of the guitar it gives in practice 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.359
 martial 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.490
 it's yeah it's your fingers 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.279
 to press the points is good 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.539
 ccc army music or arts 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.840
 martial it's the same principle as these 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.330
 same ccc complementary researches say 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.780
 indulge me who asks you when there 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.130
 do you come back to brittany or 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.200
 next year next season 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.190
 so there is already a scheduled date on 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.809
 February 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.579
 I think we all have 23 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.350
 February there will be a second internship in 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.350
 Brittany in the same season normally 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.989
 league level rivals league 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.450
 of karate bretagne do you 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.370
 would know 1,500 in Algeria because 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.930
 graphic he would like afic and 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.379
 unfortunately we pick the I 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.339
 do not know at the level of Algeria 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.970
 no I could not lorient it to 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.680
 sorry dose and so otherwise that's how 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.390
 we can learn the principles of 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.790
 kyushu 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:19.369
 it's waiting to have a teacher 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:23.390
 will come to do an internship or who he 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.040
 he has to buy an acupuncture book 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.050
 I always advise the atlas 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.850
 acupuncture because pictures of 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.880
 and begin by targeting 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.200
 points and seville is spotted then the 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.700
 better to start with one or two 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.259
 points start with a little points 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.250
 brave a point on the wrist a 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.920
 point at the elbow 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.429
 she was coming up gradually and but 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.320
 especially be careful so points do not 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.910
 will not be in force 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.740
 so when we want to work to make a 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.780
 personal work it takes extremely 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.479
 be careful so did not put any 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.850
 power in the east in the strikes 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.289
 to test this light and 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.180
 just look at the eyes of the 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.850
 partner if the eyes blink is that 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.040
 the typing is a bit more push will be 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.200
 okay so is made after careful 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.759
 there is Julian who asks in what 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.780
 direction would have you killed the practice 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.230
 this is more and more towards the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.970
 internal practices between is so I 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.760
 has begun to interest me already since 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.110
 some time tai chi chuan 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.420
 now or lichuan oatei tiken 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.800
 there I had the chance to meet ian 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.840
 callum barca few weeks and 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.940
 practice very interesting so it's 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.930
 I think that as I go 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.950
 will point me to something 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.170
 more in Belgium relentlessly and a 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.370
 notch that will practice basic but 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.050
 try to recover these principles 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.450
 internally to deliver its own 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.940
 practical years so if you want to see 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:48.420
 a small size if you have dvd 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.709
 with thierry alibert 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.610
 yeah I get them an internship 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.530
 precisely for them to show me 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.260
 some principles of chi chuan pit 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.400
 of which the twelve certainly who are very 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.300
 interesting and the famous the famous 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.520
 principle of the earth and of the man who 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.780
 monte dvd and just for the 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.340
 applications that can show in these 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.230
 three dvd there since now there is 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.480
 three I think it's well worth 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.550
 investment but beyond beyond 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.010
 largely if these same nothing because 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.420
 everything is so rich in agreement and 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.670
 for Lithuania you have to 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.290
 a documentary on beach volleyball 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.870
 that's where I started to discover 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.410
 school and I knew a little the 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.850
 take the position of the tree and thanks 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.170
 at this documentary there I have info and 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.170
 that's where I started looking for a 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.400
 new internship of tai chi kane and 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.630
 look around so what are you 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.799
 see it's thanks to you that I 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.799
 I'm interested in you 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:47.110
 the July question and they did 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.970
 normally I know the break 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.739
 after if I am invited for an internship I 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.959
 am still present but in general I 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.570
 am a nico break that puts the 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.400
 what matter who took them 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.580
 confrontation and civilizations and the 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.500
 Far Eastern culture 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.550
 the way we live our habits 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.070
 in way 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.880
 g and his relations with human beings 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:13.450
 I did not understand anything 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.400
 nico whip and he decorates studies and 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.250
 simple tips to apply in our 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.769
 daily that could help us to be 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.440
 better in our body and mind this 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.080
 angle there yes yes there are enough things 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.150
 simple but like for example 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.860
 rub the kidney area the mornings get 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.270
 massage the soles of the feet is just 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.550
 very very simple to learn to breathe 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.020
 correctly its not amending it takes 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.770
 not much time but it was 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.200
 Very important 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.060
 so there are little things very very 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.280
 nice to do and that keep us in 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.420
 good health while you massage the 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.510
 soles of the feet for example in you 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.330
 looking up in the morning you already feel 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.970
