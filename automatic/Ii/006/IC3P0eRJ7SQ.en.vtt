targets enough times I will earn the
Navi<00:01:30.630> rounds<00:01:31.550> and<00:01:32.550> I<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.940> use<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> Navi

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
around during the multi balls to really

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.310 
around during the multi balls to really
bank<00:01:36.120> in<00:01:36.330> big<00:01:36.690> boy

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.790 

so<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.520> Navi<00:01:41.670> put<00:01:41.970> Navi<00:01:42.330> round<00:01:42.630> has<00:01:42.750> begun<00:01:43.050> and

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
so the Navi put Navi round has begun and

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.470 
so the Navi put Navi round has begun and
now<00:01:43.890> my<00:01:44.070> goal<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.490> start<00:01:44.760> one<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.330> two

now my goal is to start one of the two

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.280 
now my goal is to start one of the two
multi<00:01:45.810> balls

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
these before the time runs out and so

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.640 
these before the time runs out and so
unfortunately<00:01:59.910> if<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.020> shooting<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.470> off

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
unfortunately if the shooting is off

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.000 
unfortunately if the shooting is off
it's<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.610> case<00:02:02.820> where<00:02:03.350> you're<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.560> hurry<00:02:04.770> up

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
it's a case where you're in a hurry up

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.860 
it's a case where you're in a hurry up
situation<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.850> goal<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.300> get<00:02:06.450> something

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
situation the goal is to get something

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.320 
situation the goal is to get something
going<00:02:07.140> as<00:02:07.440> quick<00:02:07.620> as<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.830> can<00:02:07.860> until<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:09.119> time

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
going as quick as you can until the time

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.300 
going as quick as you can until the time
runs<00:02:09.360> out<00:02:09.720> at<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.020> time<00:02:10.229> runs<00:02:10.440> out<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.740> you<00:02:10.860> too

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
runs out at the time runs out on you too

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.760 
runs out at the time runs out on you too
bad<00:02:11.570> but<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:12.660> can<00:02:12.810> still<00:02:13.020> play<00:02:13.140> both<00:02:13.410> multi

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
bad but I can still play both multi

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.440 
bad but I can still play both multi
balls<00:02:14.010> together<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.760> there's<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.120> amplitude

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
balls together so there's the amplitude

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.940 
balls together so there's the amplitude
shot<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.900> should<00:02:16.110> have<00:02:16.200> made<00:02:16.410> about

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
shot that I should have made about

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.580 
shot that I should have made about
twenty<00:02:17.459> seconds<00:02:17.880> ago<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:19.110> gonna<00:02:19.230> release

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
twenty seconds ago it's gonna release

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.430 
twenty seconds ago it's gonna release
three<00:02:20.310> balls<00:02:20.550> into<00:02:20.790> play<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.290> see

three balls into play and you can see

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.840 
three balls into play and you can see
six<00:02:23.370> shots<00:02:23.610> are<00:02:23.850> lit<00:02:24.030> for<00:02:24.330> jackpots<00:02:25.550> each<00:02:26.550> shot

start<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:46.250> link<00:02:47.250> multi<00:02:47.580> ball<00:02:47.760> while

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
start the the link multi ball while

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:57.580 
start the the link multi ball while
putting<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.410> ball<00:02:49.590> into<00:02:49.769> play

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.620 

so<00:02:58.069> now<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.250> multi<00:02:58.760> balls<00:02:58.940> are<00:02:59.120> running<00:02:59.420> and

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
so now to multi balls are running and

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.150 
so now to multi balls are running and
just<00:02:59.810> all<00:03:00.110> hell<00:03:00.319> is<00:03:00.440> kind<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.680> breaking<00:03:00.980> loose

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
just all hell is kind of breaking loose

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.400 
just all hell is kind of breaking loose
the<00:03:01.730> super<00:03:02.030> jackpot<00:03:02.239> for<00:03:02.480> lamp<00:03:02.900> stood<00:03:03.050> is<00:03:03.230> lit

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
the super jackpot for lamp stood is lit

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.380 
the super jackpot for lamp stood is lit
and<00:03:03.560> I've<00:03:03.650> just<00:03:03.800> collected<00:03:03.980> it

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.410 

I<00:03:07.860> think<00:03:08.860> I've<00:03:08.950> got<00:03:09.130> another<00:03:09.640> super<00:03:10.000> jackpot

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
I think I've got another super jackpot

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.690 
I think I've got another super jackpot
there<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.900> second<00:03:11.200> one<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:12.070> I<00:03:12.190> think<00:03:12.250> that

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
there the second one and I think that

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.100 
there the second one and I think that
puts<00:03:12.880> me<00:03:13.000> back<00:03:13.150> around<00:03:13.450> in<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.750> regular

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
puts me back around in the regular

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.530 
puts me back around in the regular
scoring<00:03:14.590> on<00:03:14.740> the<00:03:14.920> am<00:03:15.040> suit<00:03:15.310> ground<00:03:18.540> don't

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
scoring on the am suit ground don't

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.290 
scoring on the am suit ground don't
completely<00:03:20.260> know<00:03:20.620> how<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:20.950> run<00:03:21.910> these<00:03:22.000> games

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
completely know how to run these games

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.320 
completely know how to run these games
but<00:03:22.590> Ozzy<00:03:23.590> just<00:03:23.860> heard<00:03:24.040> in<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.310> replay<00:03:24.670> at<00:03:24.880> a

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
but Ozzy just heard in the replay at a

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.960 
but Ozzy just heard in the replay at a
high<00:03:25.600> score<00:03:26.020> a<00:03:26.320> decent<00:03:27.130> score<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:27.640> I<00:03:27.670> must<00:03:27.910> be

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
high score a decent score so I must be

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.630 
high score a decent score so I must be
doing<00:03:28.120> something<00:03:28.270> right<00:03:29.100> I'm<00:03:30.100> not<00:03:30.280> sure<00:03:30.460> what

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
doing something right I'm not sure what

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.670 
doing something right I'm not sure what
exactly<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:31.270> is<00:03:31.300> but<00:03:31.720> whatever<00:03:32.320> it<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.590> just

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
exactly it is but whatever it is I just

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.600 
exactly it is but whatever it is I just
can't<00:03:32.950> keep<00:03:33.430> doing<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:38.010> looks<00:03:39.010> like<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.400> link

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
can't keep doing it looks like the link

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.540 
can't keep doing it looks like the link
is<00:03:39.760> lit<00:03:39.940> for<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.209> super<00:03:40.510> jackpot<00:03:42.840> I'm<00:03:43.840> not<00:03:43.990> sure

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
is lit for a super jackpot I'm not sure

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.100 
is lit for a super jackpot I'm not sure
all<00:03:45.550> million<00:03:45.940> points<00:03:46.300> for<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.510> double<00:03:46.810> super

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
all million points for the double super

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.740 
all million points for the double super
there<00:03:47.290> that's<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.739> nice<00:03:47.860> combination<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.910> you

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
there that's a nice combination and you

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.490 
there that's a nice combination and you
get<00:03:49.900> some<00:03:50.050> big<00:03:50.200> points<00:03:50.380> rolling<00:03:50.860> now<00:03:50.980> I<00:03:51.010> think

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
get some big points rolling now I think

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.430 
get some big points rolling now I think
so<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:54.489> can<00:03:54.640> see<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.940> object<00:03:55.690> here<00:03:56.170> was<00:03:56.350> to

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
so you can see the object here was to

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.140 
so you can see the object here was to
try<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:56.680> get<00:03:56.860> to<00:03:57.190> multi<00:03:57.489> balls<00:03:57.700> running<00:03:58.030> at

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
try and get to multi balls running at

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.229 
try and get to multi balls running at
one<00:03:58.330> school<00:03:58.570> to<00:03:58.720> stack<00:03:59.050> and<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:01.000> get<00:04:01.120> the

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
one school to stack and you get the

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.970 
one school to stack and you get the
opportunities<00:04:01.870> that<00:04:02.080> are<00:04:02.230> present<00:04:02.680> with<00:04:02.800> both

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
opportunities that are present with both

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.210 
opportunities that are present with both
of<00:04:03.160> those<00:04:03.250> multi<00:04:03.670> balls<00:04:04.080> and<00:04:05.080> some<00:04:05.739> real<00:04:05.950> big

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
of those multi balls and some real big

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.680 
of those multi balls and some real big
advantages<00:04:06.760> happen<00:04:07.150> when<00:04:07.239> that<00:04:07.360> starts

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
advantages happen when that starts

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.900 
advantages happen when that starts
happening<00:04:07.840> see<00:04:08.290> how<00:04:08.380> my<00:04:08.620> score<00:04:09.130> went<00:04:09.310> from<00:04:09.640> a

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
happening see how my score went from a

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.420 
happening see how my score went from a
very<00:04:09.970> small<00:04:10.510> amount<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.380> pretty<00:04:11.860> huge<00:04:12.040> score

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
world on this game but it's pretty

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.840 
world on this game but it's pretty
decent<00:04:19.919> and<00:04:20.919> we'll<00:04:21.160> just<00:04:21.280> continue<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.700> play

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
decent and we'll just continue to play

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.500 
decent and we'll just continue to play
this<00:04:21.940> out<00:04:22.380> so<00:04:23.380> we<00:04:23.680> send<00:04:24.580> everything<00:04:24.669> here<00:04:25.180> get

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
this out so we send everything here get

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.740 
this out so we send everything here get
back<00:04:25.750> in<00:04:25.930> their<00:04:26.080> control<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:27.479> begin<00:04:28.479> to<00:04:28.570> think

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
back in their control and begin to think

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.120 
back in their control and begin to think
about<00:04:28.930> what<00:04:29.080> else<00:04:29.169> I<00:04:29.410> could<00:04:29.560> be<00:04:29.680> playing<00:04:29.890> for

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
about what else I could be playing for

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.340 
about what else I could be playing for
in<00:04:30.220> this<00:04:30.310> game

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
in this game

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.180 
in this game

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
so there's the amp suit rounds and the

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.700 
so there's the amp suit rounds and the
link<00:04:35.400> rounds<00:04:36.320> there<00:04:37.320> are<00:04:37.410> these<00:04:37.470> other

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
link rounds there are these other

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.290 
link rounds there are these other
objectives<00:04:38.280> in<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.520> game<00:04:38.670> two<00:04:38.910> smaller

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
objectives in the game two smaller

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
objectives like the Banshee rounds the

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.400 
objectives like the Banshee rounds the
Valkyrie<00:04:41.760> round<00:04:42.000> which<00:04:42.120> corresponds<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.720> the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
Valkyrie round which corresponds to the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
spinners the seeds round which

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.400 
spinners the seeds round which

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
corresponds these targets on the right

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.520 
corresponds these targets on the right
side<00:04:47.330> unless<00:04:48.330> a<00:04:48.510> secondary<00:04:48.930> goal<00:04:49.170> in<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.350> game

and<00:04:49.890> worth<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:50.640> lot<00:04:50.760> of<00:04:50.880> points<00:04:51.090> if<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.210> get

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
and worth a lot of points if you get

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.550 
and worth a lot of points if you get
there<00:04:51.510> but<00:04:51.600> it's<00:04:51.720> very<00:04:51.810> difficult<00:04:52.320> to

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
there but it's very difficult to

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.960 
there but it's very difficult to
complete<00:04:52.860> all<00:04:53.010> six<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.340> those<00:04:53.460> lights<00:04:53.730> on<00:04:53.910> the

complete all six of those lights on the

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.440 
complete all six of those lights on the
same<00:04:54.240> turn<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:55.830> can<00:04:56.100> play<00:04:56.250> Banshee<00:04:56.760> or<00:04:57.030> I<00:04:57.060> can

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
same turn so I can play Banshee or I can

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.900 
same turn so I can play Banshee or I can
play<00:04:57.570> Navi<00:04:57.900> out<00:04:58.200> to<00:04:58.410> completion<00:04:58.950> I<00:04:59.130> can<00:04:59.790> get

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
play Navi out to completion I can get

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.409 
play Navi out to completion I can get
another<00:05:00.090> one<00:05:00.270> of<00:05:00.300> those<00:05:00.450> lights<00:05:00.980> banshee

Valkyrie as well two more to go the

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.920 
Valkyrie as well two more to go the
seeds<00:05:35.159> and<00:05:35.399> the<00:05:35.490> Navi<00:05:37.339> the<00:05:38.360> seeds<00:05:39.360> of<00:05:39.569> Navi<00:05:39.779> are

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
seeds and the Navi the seeds of Navi are

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.989 
seeds and the Navi the seeds of Navi are
pretty<00:05:40.229> difficult<00:05:40.469> to<00:05:40.800> get<00:05:40.979> at<00:05:41.099> times<00:05:41.339> because

00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:41.999 
pretty difficult to get at times because

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:43.790 
pretty difficult to get at times because
they<00:05:42.270> shut<00:05:42.509> off<00:05:42.539> during<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.139> round<00:05:43.409> the<00:05:43.680> other

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
they shut off during the round the other

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.409 
they shut off during the round the other
round<00:05:44.069> so<00:05:44.249> I<00:05:44.309> can't<00:05:44.580> collect<00:05:44.819> Navi<00:05:45.240> and<00:05:45.270> I

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
round so I can't collect Navi and I

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.119 
round so I can't collect Navi and I
can't<00:05:45.629> collect<00:05:45.839> seeds<00:05:46.110> right<00:05:46.349> now<00:05:46.559> some

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:47.129 
can't collect seeds right now some

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:48.619 
can't collect seeds right now some
players<00:05:47.339> just<00:05:47.430> sit<00:05:47.909> here<00:05:48.089> and<00:05:48.240> they<00:05:48.300> wait

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:48.629 
players just sit here and they wait

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:51.199 
players just sit here and they wait
because<00:05:49.439> they<00:05:49.589> are<00:05:49.919> my<00:05:50.399> opportunity<00:05:50.939> to<00:05:50.999> score

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:51.209 
because they are my opportunity to score

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:52.510 
because they are my opportunity to score
points

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
points

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.469 
points
well<00:05:53.520> wait<00:05:54.360> until<00:05:55.169> that<00:05:55.769> round<00:05:56.069> times<00:05:56.430> out<00:05:56.729> and

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
well wait until that round times out and

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.029 
well wait until that round times out and
you<00:05:57.809> know<00:05:57.899> timing<00:05:58.169> out<00:05:58.379> is<00:05:58.499> probably<00:05:58.800> a<00:05:58.860> very

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
you know timing out is probably a very

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.739 
you know timing out is probably a very
good<00:05:59.099> strategy<00:05:59.459> in<00:05:59.819> a<00:05:59.939> real<00:06:00.089> tournament<00:06:00.569> here

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:00.749 
good strategy in a real tournament here

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:02.959 
good strategy in a real tournament here
but<00:06:01.289> nobody<00:06:01.860> wants<00:06:02.069> to<00:06:02.099> see<00:06:02.279> a<00:06:02.309> time<00:06:02.580> out<00:06:02.759> on

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
but nobody wants to see a time out on

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.059 
but nobody wants to see a time out on
the<00:06:03.059> video<00:06:03.179> so<00:06:03.689> I'm<00:06:04.229> not<00:06:04.289> gonna<00:06:04.529> do<00:06:04.679> that<00:06:04.709> here

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.069 
the video so I'm not gonna do that here
