materia assimilating ability now what
this<00:00:58.920> means<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.820> pretty<00:01:00.390> much<00:01:00.690> again<00:01:01.260> as<00:01:01.440> an

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
to actually crush and turn into materia

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.929 
to actually crush and turn into materia
so<00:01:15.990> first<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.470> all<00:01:16.590> how<00:01:17.009> do<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.460> an<00:01:17.580> item

percent<00:01:40.650> mark<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:42.060> then<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.630> crushed<00:01:43.500> into

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
percent mark it can then be crushed into

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.940 
percent mark it can then be crushed into
pieces<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.790> materia<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.689> they<00:01:46.290> will<00:01:46.470> come<00:01:46.770> in

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
