00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
rails this is a glitch in the game job

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.440 
rails this is a glitch in the game job
quick<00:00:29.960> going<00:00:30.259> to<00:00:30.410> this<00:00:30.619> is<00:00:30.890> quite<00:00:31.099> simple<00:00:31.460> I

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
quick going to this is quite simple I

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.110 
quick going to this is quite simple I
think<00:00:32.989> this<00:00:33.230> was<00:00:33.410> first<00:00:33.739> discovered<00:00:34.160> by<00:00:34.309> OS<00:00:34.910> x

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
think this was first discovered by OS x

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.100 
think this was first discovered by OS x
25<00:00:35.719> I<00:00:36.020> believe<00:00:36.610> I<00:00:37.610> had<00:00:38.570> a<00:00:38.600> look<00:00:38.780> for<00:00:39.020> his

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
25 I believe I had a look for his

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.140 
25 I believe I had a look for his
original<00:00:39.559> video<00:00:39.800> and<00:00:39.950> can<00:00:40.100> find<00:00:40.370> it<00:00:40.610> but<00:00:41.120> i

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
original video and can find it but i

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.230 
original video and can find it but i
think<00:00:41.810> this<00:00:41.990> by<00:00:42.260> OS<00:00:42.560> x<00:00:42.740> 25<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:43.579> i<00:00:43.610> want<00:00:44.060> to<00:00:44.090> give

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240 
think this by OS x 25 so i want to give

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.790 
think this by OS x 25 so i want to give
that<00:00:44.420> give<00:00:44.660> him<00:00:44.810> credit<00:00:45.020> for<00:00:45.260> making<00:00:45.350> it<00:00:45.650> i

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
that give him credit for making it i

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.740 
that give him credit for making it i
could<00:00:46.579> be<00:00:46.700> wrong<00:00:46.730> it<00:00:47.210> might<00:00:47.480> be<00:00:47.600> something

else but i believe is this guy here so

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.330 
else but i believe is this guy here so
basically<00:00:51.890> what<00:00:52.070> it<00:00:52.100> is<00:00:52.190> is<00:00:53.050> we<00:00:54.050> have<00:00:54.920> down<00:00:55.130> two

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
basically what it is is we have down two

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.030 
basically what it is is we have down two
tracks<00:00:55.670> of<00:00:56.200> powered<00:00:57.200> rails<00:00:57.500> that<00:00:57.680> you<00:00:57.770> can<00:00:57.860> see

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
tracks of powered rails that you can see

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.700 
tracks of powered rails that you can see
here<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:59.390> Pistons<00:00:59.630> that<00:00:59.989> stick<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.530> it

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
here and the Pistons that stick to it

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.530 
here and the Pistons that stick to it
basically<00:01:01.550> i<00:01:01.579> played<00:01:01.850> really<00:01:02.059> really<00:01:02.180> quickly

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
basically i played really really quickly

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.459 
basically i played really really quickly
and<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:05.479> block<00:01:05.689> doesn't<00:01:06.140> act<00:01:06.259> doesn't

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:06.469 
and and the block doesn't act doesn't

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.789 
and and the block doesn't act doesn't
know<00:01:07.390> which<00:01:08.390> which<00:01:08.689> block<00:01:08.899> the<00:01:09.049> power<00:01:09.439> rail<00:01:09.619> is

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
know which which block the power rail is

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.210 
know which which block the power rail is
on<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.219> do<00:01:10.460> place<00:01:10.729> them<00:01:10.969> and<00:01:11.210> is<00:01:12.049> you<00:01:12.979> just<00:01:13.130> get

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
on so do place them and is you just get

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.039 
on so do place them and is you just get
loads<00:01:13.430> loads<00:01:14.030> freedom<00:01:14.450> out<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:14.780> I'll<00:01:14.870> quickly

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
loads loads freedom out so I'll quickly

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.959 
loads loads freedom out so I'll quickly
show<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:15.409> what<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.190> does<00:01:16.400> and

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.450 

okay<00:01:19.969> so<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:20.270> can<00:01:20.390> see<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:20.719> working<00:01:21.619> away<00:01:21.860> 15

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
okay so you can see it working away 15

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.569 
okay so you can see it working away 15
loads<00:01:22.610> of<00:01:22.789> rails<00:01:22.939> out<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:25.130> can<00:01:25.159> literally

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
loads of rails out and you can literally

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.639 
loads of rails out and you can literally
within<00:01:25.939> a<00:01:26.149> few<00:01:26.570> minutes<00:01:26.780> build<00:01:27.229> up<00:01:27.350> quite<00:01:27.590> a

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
within a few minutes build up quite a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.529 
within a few minutes build up quite a
few<00:01:27.799> stacks<00:01:28.070> of<00:01:28.219> this<00:01:28.310> stuff<00:01:28.549> so<00:01:29.210> it's<00:01:29.329> quite<00:01:29.479> a

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
few stacks of this stuff so it's quite a

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.350 
few stacks of this stuff so it's quite a
handy<00:01:29.899> little<00:01:30.969> quite<00:01:31.969> handy<00:01:32.210> little

handy little quite handy little

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.419 
handy little quite handy little
duplication<00:01:33.049> glitch<00:01:33.079> and<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.070> can<00:01:34.189> kind<00:01:34.399> of

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
duplication glitch and you can kind of

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.550 
duplication glitch and you can kind of
see<00:01:34.640> there<00:01:35.049> what's<00:01:36.049> happening<00:01:36.380> is<00:01:36.470> the

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
see there what's happening is the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.160 
see there what's happening is the
Pistons<00:01:37.009> about<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.850> rail<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:38.720> quickly<00:01:39.079> in

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
Pistons about the rail so quickly in

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.469 
Pistons about the rail so quickly in
fitted<00:01:39.439> back<00:01:39.619> in<00:01:39.770> place<00:01:39.979> that<00:01:40.819> game<00:01:41.240> doesn't

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
fitted back in place that game doesn't

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.450 
fitted back in place that game doesn't
know<00:01:41.539> where<00:01:41.689> the<00:01:41.719> block<00:01:41.929> is<00:01:42.140> whether<00:01:42.469> whether

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
know where the block is whether whether

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.330 
know where the block is whether whether
L<00:01:43.759> is<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.350> when<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.439> push<00:01:45.560> back<00:01:45.710> in<00:01:45.979> it<00:01:46.159> was

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
L is and when to push back in it was

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.540 
L is and when to push back in it was
wonderful

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
ladies and those rails and you can see

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.070 
ladies and those rails and you can see
here<00:01:55.410> like<00:01:55.620> um<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.730> kind<00:01:56.940> of<00:01:56.970> pissing<00:01:57.840> speech

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
now because of the glitch rights are

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.580 
now because of the glitch rights are
pretty<00:02:02.820> pretty<00:02:03.420> simple<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.960> make<00:02:04.110> awkwardly

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
pretty pretty simple to make awkwardly

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.100 
pretty pretty simple to make awkwardly
quick<00:02:05.400> you're<00:02:05.610> not<00:02:05.820> together<00:02:05.970> here<00:02:06.300> there<00:02:07.020> is

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
quick you're not together here there is

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.380 
quick you're not together here there is
one<00:02:07.440> slight<00:02:07.800> problem<00:02:08.009> with<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.850> that<00:02:09.149> is

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
one slight problem with it and that is

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.960 
one slight problem with it and that is
that<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:10.440> can<00:02:10.590> only<00:02:10.770> make<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.400> piston<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.940> the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
that you can only make the piston in the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.449 
that you can only make the piston in the
east-west<00:02:12.660> direction<00:02:12.860> which<00:02:13.860> if<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.250> press

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
east-west direction which if you press

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.360 
east-west direction which if you press
f3<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.330> if<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.560> look<00:02:16.680> on<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.920> left<00:02:16.950> hand<00:02:17.250> side

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
f3 and if you look on the left hand side

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.010 
f3 and if you look on the left hand side
the<00:02:18.090> fourth<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.380> fourth<00:02:20.250> number<00:02:20.520> down<00:02:21.020> f3

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
the fourth the fourth number down f3

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.990 
the fourth the fourth number down f3
there<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.100> direction<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.520> face<00:02:23.760> and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
there that is the direction of face and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.340 
there that is the direction of face and
you<00:02:24.060> can<00:02:24.150> see<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.390> changes<00:02:24.810> f1<00:02:25.230> f2<00:02:25.590> f3<00:02:25.950> f4<00:02:27.350> f0

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
you can see it changes f1 f2 f3 f4 f0

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.670 
you can see it changes f1 f2 f3 f4 f0
and<00:02:28.680> f1<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:30.480> need<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.840> do<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.530> either

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
and f1 and you need to do it either

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.150 
and f1 and you need to do it either
facing<00:02:32.070> f1<00:02:32.760> or<00:02:32.790> f3<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:34.170> won't<00:02:34.380> work<00:02:34.560> in<00:02:34.890> there

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
facing f1 or f3 it won't work in there

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.080 
facing f1 or f3 it won't work in there
in<00:02:35.430> two<00:02:35.790> or<00:02:35.970> zero<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.959> must<00:02:37.290> be<00:02:37.410> facing<00:02:37.970> f1<00:02:38.970> on

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
in two or zero so must be facing f1 on

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.060 
in two or zero so must be facing f1 on
f3<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.870> that's<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.500> that's<00:02:40.739> your<00:02:40.920> only

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
f3 and that's the that's your only

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.540 
f3 and that's the that's your only
problem<00:02:41.280> with<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:44.040> yeah<00:02:44.220> i'll<00:02:44.370> quickly

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
problem with it so yeah i'll quickly

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.030 
problem with it so yeah i'll quickly
sure<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:45.000> make<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.300> what<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.350> need<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.770> to

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
sure to make this what you need is to

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.300 
sure to make this what you need is to
block<00:02:47.520> space<00:02:48.260> placed<00:02:49.260> one<00:02:49.590> block<00:02:49.770> apart<00:02:50.040> like

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
block space placed one block apart like

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.870 
block space placed one block apart like
so<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:51.870> want<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.080> piston<00:02:52.739> in<00:02:52.920> front<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.760> them

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
so you want to piston in front of them

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.130 
so you want to piston in front of them
like<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:56.480> another<00:02:57.480> one<00:02:57.660> block<00:02:57.870> space

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
like that and another one block space

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.759 
like that and another one block space
and<00:02:59.150> two<00:03:00.150> rails<00:03:00.390> I'm<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.110> get<00:03:01.230> up<00:03:01.350> another<00:03:01.620> one

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
and two rails I'm you get up another one

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.729 
and two rails I'm you get up another one
internet<00:03:02.340> throw<00:03:02.940> on<00:03:03.060> another<00:03:03.090> one<00:03:03.420> as<00:03:03.600> well

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
internet throw on another one as well

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.699 
internet throw on another one as well
having<00:03:04.739> runs<00:03:04.890> like<00:03:05.810> this<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:06.959> really<00:03:07.110> this<00:03:07.260> way

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
having runs like this is really this way

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.830 
having runs like this is really this way
if<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.400> leave<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.640> for<00:03:08.910> too<00:03:09.060> long<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.269> can<00:03:09.480> you

if you leave it for too long you can you

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.509 
if you leave it for too long you can you
join<00:03:10.019> up<00:03:10.260> back<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.709> came<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.130> i<00:03:11.220> recommend

join up back in you came so i recommend

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.970 
join up back in you came so i recommend
staying<00:03:12.060> near<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.510> prolly<00:03:13.380> standing<00:03:13.769> near

a little whatever lag okay and just

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.910 
a little whatever lag okay and just
quickly<00:03:23.280> for<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.640> circuitry<00:03:24.620> if<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.709> want<00:03:25.860> to

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.110 
block with a repeat that's facing way i
would<00:03:39.780> just<00:03:39.900> curl<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.470> rest<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.459> answers<00:03:41.910> put

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
would just curl the rest of answers put

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.370 
would just curl the rest of answers put
another<00:03:42.269> bit<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.510> reading<00:03:42.690> on<00:03:42.959> top<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.290> that

another bit of reading on top of that

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.610 
another bit of reading on top of that
block<00:03:43.650> there<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:45.150> if<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.930> wanted<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.440> can

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
block there and if you wanted you can

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.759 
block there and if you wanted you can
put<00:03:46.799> in<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.310> button<00:03:48.299> here<00:03:48.480> just<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.290> override<00:03:49.739> it

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
put in a button here just to override it

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.580 
put in a button here just to override it
off<00:03:50.070> with<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.340> on<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.459> one<00:03:50.730> just

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
off with it on that one just

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.530 
off with it on that one just
just<00:03:52.099> stops<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.370> from<00:03:52.430> working<00:03:52.700> or<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.390> can

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
just stops it from working or you can

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.080 
just stops it from working or you can
take<00:03:53.750> out<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:54.250> bit<00:03:55.250> reticent<00:03:55.430> while<00:03:55.760> whatever

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
take out a bit reticent while whatever

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.650 
take out a bit reticent while whatever
you<00:03:56.180> want<00:03:56.709> so<00:03:57.709> let's<00:03:57.860> put<00:03:58.040> up<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:59.030> you<00:03:59.269> can<00:03:59.420> see

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660

you want so let's put up and you can see
it's<00:03:59.780> extended<00:04:00.230> there<00:04:00.410> in<00:04:01.340> order<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.910> get<00:04:02.060> it

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
it's extended there in order to get it

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.449 
it's extended there in order to get it
working<00:04:02.269> all<00:04:02.810> you<00:04:02.959> need<00:04:03.080> to<00:04:03.110> do<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.560> get<00:04:04.280> rid<00:04:04.340> of

quickly and place one down so just
select<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:09.410> read<00:04:09.560> similar

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.120 

knock<00:04:13.140> out<00:04:13.349> with<00:04:13.739> me<00:04:13.890> and<00:04:14.129> place<00:04:14.849> if<00:04:15.030> I<00:04:15.090> found

knock out with me and place if I found
and<00:04:17.130> you'll<00:04:17.430> see<00:04:17.579> that<00:04:17.609> starts<00:04:18.150> creating<00:04:18.690> a

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
and you'll see that starts creating a

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.300 
and you'll see that starts creating a
pulse<00:04:19.049> which<00:04:19.829> now<00:04:20.220> see<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:22.590> resume<00:04:22.919> that

which is the Rosen to you became so
simple<00:04:31.320> as<00:04:31.380> that<00:04:31.410> and<00:04:32.720> they<00:04:33.720> be<00:04:33.900> berated<00:04:34.139> here

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
simple as that and they be berated here

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.930 
simple as that and they be berated here
like<00:04:34.830> i<00:04:34.919> said<00:04:35.070> before<00:04:35.160> they'll<00:04:35.490> be<00:04:35.580> worried<00:04:35.850> if

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
like i said before they'll be worried if

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.840 
like i said before they'll be worried if
your<00:04:36.120> air<00:04:36.380> pistons<00:04:37.380> are<00:04:37.530> this<00:04:37.800> they<00:04:38.039> still

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
your air pistons are this they still

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.740 
your air pistons are this they still
were<00:04:39.169> breaking<00:04:40.169> up<00:04:40.229> the<00:04:40.380> same<00:04:41.509> it's<00:04:42.509> just<00:04:42.690> that

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
were breaking up the same it's just that

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.730 
were breaking up the same it's just that
it's<00:04:43.050> just<00:04:43.139> a<00:04:43.289> click<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.620> animation<00:04:44.599> and

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
it's just a click the animation and

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.200 
it's just a click the animation and
finally<00:04:46.740> just<00:04:47.070> do<00:04:47.220> you<00:04:47.490> know<00:04:47.580> this<00:04:47.789> is<00:04:47.849> in<00:04:48.060> one

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
finally just do you know this is in one

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.719 
finally just do you know this is in one
point<00:04:48.449> two<00:04:48.570> point<00:04:48.750> five<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.410> i<00:04:50.009> think<00:04:50.639> the

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
point two point five and i think the

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:51.920 
point two point five and i think the
splits<00:04:50.970> has<00:04:51.060> been<00:04:51.210> around<00:04:51.360> since<00:04:51.539> at<00:04:51.780> least

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
splits has been around since at least

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.129 
splits has been around since at least
one<00:04:52.259> point<00:04:52.500> one<00:04:52.849> i<00:04:53.849> don't<00:04:54.509> think<00:04:54.930> i'll<00:04:55.110> be

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
one point one i don't think i'll be

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.230 
one point one i don't think i'll be
fixed<00:04:55.560> in<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.740> next<00:04:55.770> update<00:04:56.039> but<00:04:56.729> i<00:04:56.759> will

I<00:05:09.389> did<00:05:09.539> it<00:05:09.660> and<00:05:09.810> I<00:05:09.870> thought<00:05:10.500> up<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.770> chest<00:05:11.340> um<00:05:11.729> I

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
I did it and I thought up a chest um I

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.230 
I did it and I thought up a chest um I
think<00:05:12.240> I<00:05:13.009> try<00:05:14.009> not<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.190> cheat<00:05:14.430> in<00:05:14.610> my<00:05:14.669> games<00:05:14.880> but

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
think I try not to cheat in my games but

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.000 
think I try not to cheat in my games but
I<00:05:15.389> kind<00:05:15.690> of<00:05:15.780> think<00:05:15.900> maybe<00:05:16.289> a<00:05:16.380> duplication

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
I kind of think maybe a duplication

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.240 
I kind of think maybe a duplication
glitch<00:05:17.190> is<00:05:18.080> something<00:05:19.080> kind<00:05:19.800> of<00:05:19.889> bending<00:05:20.130> the

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
glitch is something kind of bending the

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.680 
glitch is something kind of bending the
rules<00:05:20.430> but<00:05:20.610> you<00:05:20.760> can<00:05:20.880> kind<00:05:21.150> of<00:05:21.270> get<00:05:21.389> away<00:05:21.419> with

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
rules but you can kind of get away with

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.969 
rules but you can kind of get away with
it<00:05:22.729> but<00:05:23.729> yeah<00:05:24.389> I<00:05:24.659> don't<00:05:24.990> know<00:05:25.260> where<00:05:25.500> I<00:05:25.680> don't
