00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.639
 no current engineering runs the risk of disappearing by this reform 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.330
 On the contrary, engineering as regulated professions 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.939
 have already established the framework in which universities 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.269
 they have to establish 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.889
 the planning of their study plans 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.260
 nine technical engineering and 8 engineering as professions 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.670
 they already have the agreements of the council of ministers and the ministerial orders 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.290
 for universities to design 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.290
 in their study plans 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.080
 in the case of computer technical engineering 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.390
 computer engineering 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.830
 and chemical engineering 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.830
 for not having the consideration of a regulated profession 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.610
 have been the subject of debate in the council of universities 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.300
 and an agreement has been established 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.640
 in terms of recommendations to universities 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.700
 so that they design the curricula 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.360
 in the same way as in the case of regulated engineering 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.670
 always fulfilling the minimum that guarantees the necessary training 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.720
 to practice that profession 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.380
 therefore the differentiations 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.680
 illÃ¡n in matters that are not mandatory to be fulfilled until now 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.679
 Traditionally it has been called elective or specific to the university itself 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.640
 p the current titles on disappear what appear are by the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.680
 grade iii master 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.829
 what the ejido is that for 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.950
 the design of qualifications that qualify for the exercise of the profession 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.069
 technical industrial engineer 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.569
 the universities 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.759
 establish 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:13.649
 a degree title 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.489
 and for doubts 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.169
 qualifications that qualify for the exercise 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:23.489
 of the engineering profession the gesink universities will design 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.400
 other titles
