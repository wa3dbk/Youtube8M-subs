our t-rex in the shot and getting all
the<00:01:09.970> right<00:01:10.150> settings<00:01:10.689> so<00:01:10.900> you<00:01:10.930> can<00:01:11.140> see<00:01:11.320> here's

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
the right settings so you can see here's

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.880 
the right settings so you can see here's
the<00:01:11.619> t-rex<00:01:12.010> in<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.369> corner<00:01:12.729> if<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:13.240> press<00:01:13.479> play

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the t-rex in the corner if I press play

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.730 
the t-rex in the corner if I press play
you'll<00:01:14.890> start<00:01:15.189> walking<00:01:15.549> across<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.780> you'll

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
you'll start walking across and you'll

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.730 
you'll start walking across and you'll
see<00:01:17.950> that<00:01:18.159> it's<00:01:18.429> a<00:01:18.579> little<00:01:18.700> bit<00:01:19.140> laggy<00:01:20.140> it's<00:01:20.619> a

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
see that it's a little bit laggy it's a

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.469 
see that it's a little bit laggy it's a
little<00:01:20.950> bit<00:01:21.070> slow<00:01:21.460> but<00:01:21.880> that's<00:01:21.969> because<00:01:22.359> the

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
little bit slow but that's because the

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.330 
little bit slow but that's because the
shot<00:01:22.689> hasn't<00:01:23.049> been<00:01:23.200> rendered<00:01:23.409> out<00:01:23.740> yet<00:01:24.039> so

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
shot hasn't been rendered out yet so

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.950 
shot hasn't been rendered out yet so
this<00:01:24.460> is<00:01:24.549> just<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:24.850> give<00:01:25.030> us<00:01:25.119> a<00:01:25.240> rough<00:01:25.450> idea<00:01:25.630> of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
this is just to give us a rough idea of

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.709 
this is just to give us a rough idea of
where<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.289> t-rex<00:01:26.590> is<00:01:26.770> going<00:01:27.039> to<00:01:27.159> work<00:01:27.659> ok<00:01:28.659> so

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
where the t-rex is going to work ok so

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:30.870 
where the t-rex is going to work ok so
that<00:01:28.960> looks<00:01:28.990> good<00:01:29.350> so<00:01:29.590> now<00:01:30.070> let's<00:01:30.340> say<00:01:30.520> we<00:01:30.700> want

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
that looks good so now let's say we want

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.450 
that looks good so now let's say we want
to<00:01:30.909> position<00:01:31.390> him<00:01:31.509> in<00:01:31.539> our<00:01:32.020> shot<00:01:32.439> first<00:01:33.130> of<00:01:33.340> all

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
to position him in our shot first of all

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.789 
to position him in our shot first of all
we<00:01:33.640> want<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:33.880> choose<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.090> backdrop<00:01:34.659> we'll<00:01:35.590> go<00:01:35.740> to

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
we want to choose a backdrop we'll go to

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.060 
we want to choose a backdrop we'll go to
open<00:01:36.369> video<00:01:36.579> and<00:01:36.789> it<00:01:37.630> comes<00:01:37.869> with<00:01:37.960> samples<00:01:38.590> so

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
open video and it comes with samples so

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.440 
open video and it comes with samples so
in<00:01:39.189> this<00:01:39.280> case<00:01:39.520> we're<00:01:39.700> going<00:01:39.819> to<00:01:39.880> use<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.119> sample

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
in this case we're going to use a sample

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.660 
in this case we're going to use a sample
tripod<00:01:41.289> backdrop<00:01:41.829> and<00:01:42.039> it's<00:01:42.399> a<00:01:42.490> video

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
tripod backdrop and it's a video

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.609 
tripod backdrop and it's a video
backdrop<00:01:43.270> and<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.479> comes<00:01:43.659> with<00:01:43.780> this<00:01:44.079> app<00:01:44.319> so

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
backdrop and it comes with this app so

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.719 
backdrop and it comes with this app so
that's<00:01:44.740> great<00:01:45.069> so<00:01:45.219> we<00:01:45.310> use<00:01:45.460> sample<00:01:45.909> 1<00:01:47.429> and<00:01:48.429> it's

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
that's great so we use sample 1 and it's

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.910 
that's great so we use sample 1 and it's
just<00:01:48.939> loading<00:01:49.299> that<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:49.569> now<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:50.049> you<00:01:50.469> can<00:01:50.649> see

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
just loading that in now and you can see

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.480 
just loading that in now and you can see
it's<00:01:51.520> Times<00:01:52.420> Square<00:01:52.780> in<00:01:53.020> New<00:01:53.380> York<00:01:53.409> and<00:01:53.979> that's

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
it's Times Square in New York and that's

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.830 
it's Times Square in New York and that's
where<00:01:54.700> we're<00:01:54.819> gonna<00:01:54.909> party<00:01:55.359> right<00:01:55.539> so<00:01:55.659> at<00:01:55.749> the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
where we're gonna party right so at the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.569 
where we're gonna party right so at the
moment<00:01:56.109> our<00:01:56.170> t-rex<00:01:56.439> is<00:01:56.590> floating<00:01:57.039> over<00:01:57.130> here

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
moment our t-rex is floating over here

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.450 
moment our t-rex is floating over here
so<00:01:58.270> we'll<00:01:58.450> move<00:01:58.630> him<00:01:58.810> down<00:01:59.109> onto<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.189> ground

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
so we'll move him down onto the ground

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.359 
so we'll move him down onto the ground
and<00:02:01.859> we'll<00:02:02.859> scale<00:02:03.219> him<00:02:03.399> up<00:02:03.579> so<00:02:04.030> sue<00:02:04.359> Minter<00:02:04.569> him

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
and we'll scale him up so sue Minter him

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.460 
and we'll scale him up so sue Minter him
well<00:02:06.369> now<00:02:06.520> he's<00:02:06.670> humongous<00:02:07.050> so<00:02:08.050> maybe<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.289> want

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
well now he's humongous so maybe I want

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.410 
well now he's humongous so maybe I want
to<00:02:08.500> scale<00:02:08.800> him<00:02:08.950> down<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.190> bit<00:02:09.310> there<00:02:09.670> we<00:02:09.759> go<00:02:09.970> and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
to scale him down a bit there we go and

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.300 
to scale him down a bit there we go and
we'll<00:02:10.899> just<00:02:11.050> position<00:02:11.470> him<00:02:11.560> on<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.800> road<00:02:12.010> and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
we'll just position him on the road and

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.300 
we'll just position him on the road and
you<00:02:13.060> can<00:02:13.209> also<00:02:13.360> change<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.990> rotation<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:15.220> if

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
you can also change the rotation so if

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.980 
you can also change the rotation so if
you<00:02:15.400> go<00:02:15.520> into<00:02:15.640> this<00:02:15.819> side<00:02:16.090> bit<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:16.420> can<00:02:16.600> scroll

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
you go into this side bit you can scroll

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.380 
you go into this side bit you can scroll
and<00:02:17.650> go<00:02:17.770> into<00:02:17.920> rotation<00:02:18.580> mode<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:19.030> now<00:02:19.120> we<00:02:19.180> can

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
and go into rotation mode and now we can

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.260 
and go into rotation mode and now we can
rotate<00:02:19.570> him<00:02:19.990> around<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.970> let's<00:02:21.970> say<00:02:22.120> we're

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
rotate him around and let's say we're

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.060 
rotate him around and let's say we're
happy<00:02:22.540> with<00:02:22.720> them<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:23.140> can<00:02:23.320> even<00:02:23.530> change<00:02:23.890> the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
happy with them you can even change the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.140 
happy with them you can even change the
light

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
light

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.420 
light
so<00:02:25.780> we<00:02:25.900> can<00:02:26.020> change<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.500> light<00:02:26.920> coming<00:02:27.190> from

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
so we can change the light coming from

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.400 
so we can change the light coming from
