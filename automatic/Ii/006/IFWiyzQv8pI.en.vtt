this<00:03:57.740> yet<00:03:57.980> I<00:03:58.010> probably<00:03:58.280> should<00:03:58.580> wash<00:03:58.760> it

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940

before<00:03:59.030> I<00:03:59.240> wear<00:03:59.510> it<00:03:59.660> because<00:03:59.750> it's<00:04:00.230> not<00:04:00.440> stiff

but it feels like there's kind of a

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.780 
but it feels like there's kind of a
coding<00:04:02.540> sort<00:04:02.840> of<00:04:02.960> on<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.230> fabric<00:04:03.920> but<00:04:04.640> it's

down the front and it's a little bit

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.950 
down the front and it's a little bit
longer<00:04:51.680> in<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.040> front<00:04:52.120> so<00:04:53.120> that<00:04:53.150> way<00:04:53.450> you<00:04:53.840> know

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
longer in the front so that way you know

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.710 
longer in the front so that way you know
