whatever it's this song is really hard
to<00:01:43.119> find<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.509> strum<00:01:43.750> pattern<00:01:44.049> for<00:01:44.289> it's<00:01:45.100> just<00:01:45.220> I

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
to find a strum pattern for it's just I

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.060 
to find a strum pattern for it's just I
think<00:01:46.210> it's<00:01:46.450> mostly<00:01:46.780> because<00:01:46.869> it's<00:01:47.080> a<00:01:47.140> drum

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
think it's mostly because it's a drum

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.240 
think it's mostly because it's a drum
based<00:01:48.399> song<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.180> key<00:01:49.799> element<00:01:50.799> and<00:01:50.950> this<00:01:51.100> is

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
based song the key element and this is

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.770 
based song the key element and this is
drum<00:01:51.580> so<00:01:51.820> it's<00:01:51.970> kind<00:01:52.210> of<00:01:52.270> like<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.570> don't<00:01:52.630> know

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
drum so it's kind of like I don't know

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.389 
drum so it's kind of like I don't know
it's<00:01:52.960> just<00:01:53.020> awkward<00:01:53.740> for<00:01:53.950> some<00:01:54.070> reason<00:01:54.340> the

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
it's just awkward for some reason the

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.430 
it's just awkward for some reason the
strum<00:01:54.640> pattern<00:01:54.909> is<00:01:55.000> awkward<00:01:55.420> so<00:01:55.479> main<00:01:56.170> reason

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
strum pattern is awkward so main reason

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.419 
strum pattern is awkward so main reason

you<00:02:04.840> need<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.140> C<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:06.810> minor<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:09.399> that<00:02:10.239> order

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
you need a C a minor and in that order

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.250 
you need a C a minor and in that order
alright<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.370> so<00:02:12.430> for<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.850> verse<00:02:13.260> it's

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
alright and so for the verse it's

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.170 
alright and so for the verse it's
actually<00:02:14.650> not<00:02:14.769> really<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.459> much<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.880> strum

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
actually not really so much that strum

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.210 
actually not really so much that strum
pattern<00:02:16.540> it's<00:02:16.720> just<00:02:16.900> kind<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.110> like<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.319> alright

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
pattern it's just kind of like a alright

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.440 
pattern it's just kind of like a alright
I<00:02:18.280> guess<00:02:18.489> they<00:02:18.610> kind<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.090> put<00:02:19.299> that

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
I guess they kind of you can put that

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.699 
I guess they kind of you can put that
strum<00:02:19.660> pattern<00:02:19.959> in<00:02:20.080> there<00:02:20.200> but<00:02:20.350> it's<00:02:20.470> kind<00:02:20.530> of

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
strum pattern in there but it's kind of

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.000 
strum pattern in there but it's kind of
like<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.370> way<00:02:21.489> I<00:02:21.519> do<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:21.970> calm<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.630> lot

home heating is you just put your palm

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.069 
home heating is you just put your palm
down<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:27.120> when<00:02:28.120> you're<00:02:28.209> playing<00:02:28.510> as<00:02:28.810> you're

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
down and when you're playing as you're

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.390 
down and when you're playing as you're
playing<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.380> chord<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.829> it<00:02:29.920> kind<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.130> mutes

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
playing the chord and it kind of mutes

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400 
playing the chord and it kind of mutes
it<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.760> makes<00:02:30.910> its<00:02:31.090> time<00:02:31.570> warm<00:02:31.870> up<00:02:31.989> percussive

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
it and makes its time warm up percussive

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.410 
it and makes its time warm up percussive
sound<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.769> little<00:02:32.920> bit<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.310> kind<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.549> give<00:02:34.269> the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
sound a little bit and kind of give the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.170 
sound a little bit and kind of give the
core<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.630> different<00:02:34.989> sound<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.519> this<00:02:37.120> is

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
core a different sound so so this is

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.400 
core a different sound so so this is
kind<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.510> what<00:02:37.630> its<00:02:37.750> gonna<00:02:37.810> sound<00:02:38.049> like<00:02:38.230> for

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
kind of what its gonna sound like for

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:55.949 
kind of what its gonna sound like for
the<00:02:38.470> verse

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.270 

so<00:02:56.959> you<00:02:57.049> just<00:02:57.170> go<00:02:57.290> back<00:02:57.439> to<00:02:57.469> this<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:58.040> see

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
so you just go back to this that see

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.729 
so you just go back to this that see
after<00:02:58.700> so<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.569> do<00:02:59.750> that<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.900> couple<00:02:59.959> times<00:03:00.200> for

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
after so you do that a couple times for

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.890 
after so you do that a couple times for
the<00:03:00.890> for<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.459> verse<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.390> that's<00:03:02.540> kind<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.780> it

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
the for the verse and that's kind of it

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.809 
the for the verse and that's kind of it

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
like I said strum patterns a little

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.449 
like I said strum patterns a little
weird<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:06.260> just<00:03:06.439> kind<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.620> make<00:03:06.680> your<00:03:06.890> own<00:03:06.950> or

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
it and you feel like it's right but the

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:13.509 
it and you feel like it's right but the
main<00:03:12.530> reason<00:03:12.560> does<00:03:12.889> not<00:03:12.920> actually<00:03:13.159> give<00:03:13.370> you

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
main reason does not actually give you

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.020
