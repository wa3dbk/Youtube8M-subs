this<00:01:34.500> church<00:01:36.500> some<00:01:37.500> time<00:01:37.740> ago<00:01:39.470> almost<00:01:40.470> five

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
years now I don't know how long I'll

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.210 
years now I don't know how long I'll
keep<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.900> it<00:01:45.900> was<00:01:46.080> fun<00:01:46.320> making<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.860> thing

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220

keep it but it was fun making this thing
it<00:01:47.430> probably<00:01:48.060> took<00:01:48.240> about<00:01:50.990> mmm<00:01:52.250> 20<00:01:53.250> hours

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:01.130 
it probably took about mmm 20 hours
maybe<00:01:54.390> more<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:55.740> make<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:59.869> anyway<00:02:00.869> that's

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
maybe more to make this anyway that's

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.920 
maybe more to make this anyway that's
the<00:02:02.270> structure<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.300> made<00:02:03.630> with<00:02:03.810> American
