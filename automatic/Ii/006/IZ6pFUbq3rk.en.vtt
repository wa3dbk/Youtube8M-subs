be very strong but I wouldn't recommend

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.340 
be very strong but I wouldn't recommend
bashing<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.270> truck<00:00:45.539> because<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.020> simply

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
bashing this truck because it is simply

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.049

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.299 
too small and seems heavy for its size
which<00:00:48.870> will<00:00:49.050> cause<00:00:49.260> parts<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> break<00:00:49.890> from<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
which will cause parts to break from the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.899 
because all of the thread lock used on
them<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:43.290> flaw<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.920> did<00:01:44.159> find<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
them one flaw that I did find with the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.639 
them one flaw that I did find with the
buggy<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> steering<00:01:45.780> servo<00:01:46.229> which<00:01:46.470> is

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
buggy is the steering servo which is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.249 
buggy is the steering servo which is
weak<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.130> breaks<00:01:47.369> very<00:01:47.670> easily<00:01:48.049> upgrade<00:01:49.049> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
weak and breaks very easily upgrade that

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.350 
weak and breaks very easily upgrade that
to<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> metal<00:01:49.860> geared<00:01:50.100> servo<00:01:50.460> for<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> best

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to a metal geared servo for the best

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.170 
to a metal geared servo for the best
long-lasting<00:01:51.840> performance<00:01:52.640> it<00:01:53.640> appears<00:01:54.000> to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
long-lasting performance it appears to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.209 
long-lasting performance it appears to
be<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.299> standard<00:01:54.720> sized<00:01:54.960> servo<00:01:55.439> but<00:01:55.979> I'm<00:01:56.070> not

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
be a standard sized servo but I'm not

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.990 
be a standard sized servo but I'm not
entirely<00:01:56.549> sure<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.860> would<00:01:58.860> recommend<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.399> one

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
entirely sure I would recommend this one

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.810 
entirely sure I would recommend this one
anybody<00:02:00.300> who<00:02:00.840> wants<00:02:01.170> something<00:02:01.530> small<00:02:01.860> just

I would not recommend you to run it in
too<00:02:08.160> much<00:02:08.310> dirt<00:02:08.610> though<00:02:08.789> because<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.179> can

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
too much dirt though because I can

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.300 
too much dirt though because I can
easily<00:02:09.539> penetrate<00:02:09.899> into<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> differentials
