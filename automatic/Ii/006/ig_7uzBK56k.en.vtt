00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729 
hit 3000 subscribers but by the looks of

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:54.890 
hit 3000 subscribers but by the looks of
it<00:03:53.819> i'll<00:03:53.970> be<00:03:54.060> hitting<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.419> while<00:03:54.599> i'm<00:03:54.690> gone

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
it i'll be hitting that while i'm gone

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.449 
it i'll be hitting that while i'm gone
so<00:03:55.260> i'll<00:03:55.440> just<00:03:55.470> go<00:03:55.709> ahead<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:55.919> do<00:03:56.099> it<00:03:56.220> open

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
so i'll just go ahead and do it open

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.369 
so i'll just go ahead and do it open
lobby<00:03:56.609> when<00:03:56.849> i<00:03:56.879> get<00:03:57.030> back<00:03:57.180> from<00:03:57.239> vacation<00:03:57.449> from

there<00:03:58.560> i'll<00:03:58.739> probably<00:03:58.949> just<00:03:59.159> do<00:03:59.459> lobbies

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
there i'll probably just do lobbies

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.969
