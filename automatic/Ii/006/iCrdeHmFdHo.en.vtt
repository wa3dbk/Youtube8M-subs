00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello to all and all the friends that me 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.009
 It's a pleasure to meet you 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.960
 today so for a little test 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.510
 souls and so today leaves this 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.240
 will be on the famous cube and mojito of 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.769
 at fantasia so I think you in 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.790
 have heard a lot about me 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.500
 a tobacco that I love 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.289
 especially because simply 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.350
 it's a state so prefer to level 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.029
 simply cutting like you 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.800
 you can see it below we have 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.539
 really just cutting out some 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.310
 very fine petals not a lot of 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.820
 branches as you can see at 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.380
 Damascus very red and his future so we 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.969
 has a very nice cuts on the part 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:43.350
 rags Tasiast really outstanding 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:45.960
 so at the top on this level there side smell on 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.850
 really find something 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.059
 similar to mojito so you 're really 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.190
 not skimped on it we find the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.699
 little touch of Rome that really passes 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.750
 very well 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.449
 this mante pretty nice not very 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.300
 strong but quite friendly with a 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.100
 very good out of lime 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.549
 really very peppy we are very very 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.960
 good smell of lime 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.049
 so we're really a lime who 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.860
 fart nostrils with this little 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.659
 touch of rome 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.970
 it's really fun and this little 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.549
 touch asks so we really have a 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.940
 tobacco representing the mojito with the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.460
 touch of alcohol that goes very well 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.500
 the smell so at the level of the make up 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.590
 today we are left with the focus 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.970
 put to jumbo with a trekking 33 mm for 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.159
 the small constations in the evening all 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.929
 simply 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.159
 with massey leaves as you can 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:41.020
 see that I adorned with an Inuit chi cat 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.280
 simply to look pretty because that 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.200
 does not matter any more 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.450
 unstable simply because it is 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.759
 already pretty cool so I'll get you 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.270
 test this and I tell you my impressions 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.270
 high level 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.620
 so at the level of without skimping on 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.190
 find exactly what you smell 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.410
 be one of the lime peppers 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.810
 in the mouth with this touch of rome 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.459
 really very friendly and so this 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.440
 mantis also that will give a little bit of 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.450
 freshness to this tobacco so we really 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.440
 something really top really 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.250
 something that is reminiscent of 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.230
 Mojito cocktail 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.560
 there is really nothing to say at this level 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.340
 there we find exactly the taste of a 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.130
 Mojito cocktail 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.000
 however this tobacco is not very sweet 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.060
 I want to clarify 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.840
 so we have a tobacco really focused on 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.750
 the acidity of lime on the 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.330
 power of taste of Rome everything 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.190
 simply with this little touch of 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.019
 mint to refresh a little everything 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.540
 has a tobacco at his expense but very very 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.459
 little sweet so a taste all 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.380
 simply I personally adore 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.690
 not especially low state fan on 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.340
 sweet it's to bala I really was 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.450
 quite regularly there it was 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.680
 a long time that I had not done so 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.620
 I thought why not do you 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.819
 a little ego so at the level of the smoke 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.230
 as you have seen but I think 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.750
 there is not much to say smoke 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.310
 is rather correct so at the level of 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.750
 notes if I had to note single increases 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.200
 noticeable simply at the level of 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.420
 the smell 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.880
 personally I will give a 4 4 and 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.459
 half in five because I really love this 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.150
 smell i love the smell of mojito i love 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.849
 the lime so 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.030
 really a top smell what I put in 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.129
 positive point especially in advance and that 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.989
 so this mojito tobacco tastes of Rome 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.269
 who is present so that's pretty rare 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.790
 on tobacco and so in the mouth 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.829
 find exactly the same smell so 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.150
 be me I can not m below 4 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.650
 enemies because it's a metal a 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.920
 favorite as I said to you for me 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.030
 he gets into my top top 3 so I 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.590
 do not really have but a ship that's 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.150
 really a tobacco fabulous eyes so I 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.090
 highly recommend it for those 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.590
 who for those who love mojito they 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.030
 will simply find their happiness 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:17.200
 so we're going to shoot 2 3 bars for the smoke 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.200
 and we will leave Switzerland 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.850
 so a smoke really very very 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.940
 thick very very white 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.160
 so at the level of the smoke frankly 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.380
 there is nothing to say about a tobacco that is 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.330
 hard enough matched the level of smoke 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.040
 personally I often do the most 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.930
 big smoke sessions on this tobacco 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.669
 there then on my fantasia I often do 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.680
 the most films possible is the same 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.060
 thing on the margaret she kamikaze who 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.430
 is really a crazy smoke at every 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.020
 times so honestly level I smoke 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.820
 nothing to say I m and half bursts so 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.570
 overall cat and a half for this tobacco I 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.210
 strongly recommend 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.600
 and what do you want me to do 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.510
 tell 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.220
 I advise you simply 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.860

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.030

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.530
 friends we will leave each other on it 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.960
