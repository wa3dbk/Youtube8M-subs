00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
yeah this is another video I'm just

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.919 
yeah this is another video I'm just
showing<00:00:02.730> you<00:00:02.790> some<00:00:02.850> more<00:00:03.060> project<00:00:03.449> I<00:00:03.570> made<00:00:03.750> on

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
showing you some more project I made on

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.410 
showing you some more project I made on
the<00:00:04.110> layout<00:00:04.470> right<00:00:04.500> here<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.790> grass<00:00:06.000> and

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
the layout right here and the grass and

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.509 
the layout right here and the grass and
I<00:00:06.839> guess<00:00:07.020> just<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.589> whole<00:00:07.740> field<00:00:08.069> area<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.340> got

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
I guess just the whole field area I got

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.730 
I guess just the whole field area I got
a<00:00:08.550> little<00:00:08.849> bit<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.120> yellow<00:00:09.269> left<00:00:09.630> there<00:00:09.870> but

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
a little bit of yellow left there but

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.220 
a little bit of yellow left there but
that'll<00:00:11.040> be<00:00:11.160> done<00:00:11.280> with<00:00:11.490> pretty<00:00:11.790> soon<00:00:12.230> I'm

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
that'll be done with pretty soon I'm

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.499 
that'll be done with pretty soon I'm
using<00:00:13.519> 1080p<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.730> time<00:00:14.940> on<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.299> video

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
using 1080p this time on the video

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.930 
using 1080p this time on the video
there's<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.379> little<00:00:16.560> bit<00:00:16.650> less<00:00:16.920> frames<00:00:17.670> per

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
there's a little bit less frames per

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.300 
there's a little bit less frames per
second<00:00:18.300> when<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.449> record<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:18.960> 1080p<00:00:19.080> but<00:00:19.890> I

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
second when I record in 1080p but I

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.769 
second when I record in 1080p but I
think<00:00:20.699> for<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:20.970> video<00:00:21.240> it's<00:00:21.390> good<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.750> I

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
think for this video it's good that I

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.599 
think for this video it's good that I
have<00:00:21.840> more<00:00:22.199> clarity<00:00:22.470> because<00:00:23.220> I'm<00:00:23.369> gonna<00:00:23.460> be

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
have more clarity because I'm gonna be

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.550 
have more clarity because I'm gonna be
going<00:00:23.789> over<00:00:23.880> ballast<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:25.080> think<00:00:25.320> it'd<00:00:25.410> be<00:00:25.529> a

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
going over ballast and I think it'd be a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.000 
going over ballast and I think it'd be a
good<00:00:25.740> thing<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:26.699> easy<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.269> see<00:00:28.010> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
good thing that it's easy to see the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.400 
good thing that it's easy to see the
detail<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.029> ballast<00:00:30.390> rather<00:00:30.990> than<00:00:31.230> use

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
detail of the ballast rather than use

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.870 
detail of the ballast rather than use
720p<00:00:32.510> just<00:00:33.510> let<00:00:33.630> me<00:00:33.690> know<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.960> think<00:00:34.079> so

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
720p just let me know what you think so

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.090 
720p just let me know what you think so
as<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.540> got<00:00:36.690> no<00:00:37.559> turf<00:00:37.860> and

as you can see here I got no turf and
stuff<00:00:40.579> got<00:00:41.579> bushes<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.149> all<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.420> over<00:00:42.629> here

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
stuff got bushes and all that over here

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.940 
stuff got bushes and all that over here
not<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.270> there<00:00:45.510> at<00:00:45.629> all<00:00:45.950> pretty

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
know the grass with the coarse turf fine

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.180 
know the grass with the coarse turf fine
turf<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.930> you<00:00:54.930> know<00:00:55.050> various<00:00:55.440> colors<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.980> that

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
still have the Rio Grande there I like

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.340 
still have the Rio Grande there I like
it<00:00:59.670> there<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.000> over<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.870> all<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
bushes and stuff still I think I'm gonna

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.810 
bushes and stuff still I think I'm gonna
put<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> decoder<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.650> one<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.280> proto

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
put a decoder in this one the proto

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.490 
put a decoder in this one the proto
2000rs<00:01:06.689> 27<00:01:10.790> yeah<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.900> video<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.290> you

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
2000rs 27 yeah I have a video that you

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.660 
2000rs 27 yeah I have a video that you
can<00:01:13.710> do<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.130> want<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.490> think<00:01:14.520> I'm

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
can do that if you want but I think I'm

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.789 
can do that if you want but I think I'm
gonna<00:01:14.760> get<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.970> decoder<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.450> finally<00:01:16.020> I've

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
gonna get a decoder and finally I've

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.039 
gonna get a decoder and finally I've
waited<00:01:17.070> long<00:01:17.340> enough<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.330> think<00:01:18.659> that's

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
waited long enough but I think that's

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.870 
waited long enough but I think that's
what<00:01:19.170> I'm<00:01:19.259> gonna<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.640> still<00:01:20.850> have

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
what I'm gonna do and then I still have

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.170 
what I'm gonna do and then I still have
the<00:01:21.180> Genesis<00:01:21.600> sd70ace<00:01:22.729> right<00:01:23.729> there<00:01:23.909> haven't

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the Genesis sd70ace right there haven't

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.030 
the Genesis sd70ace right there haven't
had<00:01:24.299> any<00:01:24.450> problems<00:01:24.900> except<00:01:25.350> sometimes<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
had any problems except sometimes in the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.819 
had any problems except sometimes in the
track<00:01:26.280> here<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:27.420> seems<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.259> lose<00:01:28.530> power

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
track here it seems like I lose power

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.160 
track here it seems like I lose power
and<00:01:29.220> it'll<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.880> stop<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.420> it'll<00:01:30.659> redo<00:01:31.020> all

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
and it'll just stop and it'll redo all

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.710 
and it'll just stop and it'll redo all
the<00:01:31.290> sound<00:01:31.560> it'll<00:01:31.799> start<00:01:32.100> up<00:01:32.159> again<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.720> then

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the sound it'll start up again and then

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.690 
the sound it'll start up again and then
it'll<00:01:33.900> start<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.320> again<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:34.979> I'm<00:01:35.189> not

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
it'll start going again but I'm not

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.240 
it'll start going again but I'm not
really<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.030> big<00:01:36.180> problem

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
really a big problem

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
really a big problem
my<00:01:39.030> biggest<00:01:39.270> question<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:39.990> video<00:01:40.259> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
my biggest question in this video is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.819 
my biggest question in this video is
ballast<00:01:41.720> but<00:01:42.720> most<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> time<00:01:43.470> I've<00:01:43.799> been

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
ballast but most of the time I've been

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.929 
ballast but most of the time I've been
using<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:45.079> this<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.200> where<00:01:46.579> this<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
using the this is where this is the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.200 
using the this is where this is the
medium<00:01:48.509> ballast<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.759> I<00:01:50.759> think<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.090> looks

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
medium ballast and I think it looks

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.929 
medium ballast and I think it looks
pretty<00:01:51.509> good<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.020> mean<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.280> big<00:01:53.729> deal

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
pretty good I mean it's not a big deal

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.550 
pretty good I mean it's not a big deal
over<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.509> definitely<00:01:54.869> looks<00:01:55.020> pretty

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
over here it definitely looks pretty

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.380 
over here it definitely looks pretty
good<00:01:55.740> right<00:01:55.799> there

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
good right there

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.130 
good right there
and<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:58.110> all<00:01:58.409> out<00:01:58.619> through<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.040> lab<00:01:59.219> there

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
and going all out through the lab there

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.780 
and going all out through the lab there
but<00:02:01.140> up<00:02:01.290> here<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> smaller<00:02:02.250> track<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.700> was

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
but up here on the smaller track I was

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.980 
but up here on the smaller track I was
experimenting<00:02:03.420> around<00:02:03.540> some<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> other

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
experimenting around some of the other

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.410 
experimenting around some of the other
cut<00:02:04.290> ballast<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.939> put<00:02:06.119> fine

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
cut ballast I have and I put fine

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.089 
cut ballast I have and I put fine
ballast<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.049> here<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.710> is

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
ballast in here this is

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.830 
ballast in here this is
I<00:02:08.129> don't<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.720> I'll<00:02:09.810> actually<00:02:09.989> know<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> color

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
I don't and I'll actually know a color

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.630 
I don't and I'll actually know a color
combination<00:02:12.840> this<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.409> I<00:02:13.890> have<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.549> a

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
combination this is it I have it in a

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.000 
combination this is it I have it in a
fine<00:02:14.879> turf<00:02:15.209> box<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:16.079> don't<00:02:16.709> really<00:02:16.890> know

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
fine turf box so I don't really know

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.890 
fine turf box so I don't really know
what<00:02:17.189> it<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.430> but<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.970> think<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.599> looks<00:02:18.840> really

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
what it is but I think that looks really

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.250 
what it is but I think that looks really
nice<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:20.269> I'm<00:02:21.269> gonna<00:02:21.390> continue<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.870> do<00:02:22.079> that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
nice so I'm gonna continue to do that

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.630 
nice so I'm gonna continue to do that
around<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.620> whole<00:02:22.769> rest<00:02:23.099> of<00:02:23.189> the<00:02:23.250> top<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.579> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
around the whole rest of the top of the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.869 
around the whole rest of the top of the
lap<00:02:24.799> now<00:02:25.799> I'm<00:02:25.920> probably<00:02:26.099> not<00:02:26.280> gonna<00:02:26.430> change<00:02:26.670> my

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
lap now I'm probably not gonna change my

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.220 
lap now I'm probably not gonna change my
mind<00:02:27.150> but<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.540> guys<00:02:27.750> can<00:02:27.900> let<00:02:27.959> me<00:02:28.019> know<00:02:28.079> what

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
mind but you guys can let me know what

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.440 
mind but you guys can let me know what
you<00:02:28.319> think<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.650> I'm<00:02:29.640> pretty<00:02:30.030> happy<00:02:30.239> with

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
you think of that I'm pretty happy with

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.500 
you think of that I'm pretty happy with
it<00:02:30.599> though<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:34.170> yeah<00:02:34.739> that's<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.359> and<00:02:36.359> I

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
it though so yeah that's that and I

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.660 
it though so yeah that's that and I
liked<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.260> much<00:02:37.319> that<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.890> decided<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.459> come

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
liked it so much that I decided to come

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.339 
liked it so much that I decided to come
down<00:02:38.730> here<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.329> experimented<00:02:39.810> around<00:02:40.260> a

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
down here and I experimented around a

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.949 
down here and I experimented around a
little<00:02:40.470> bit<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:41.390> put<00:02:42.390> fine<00:02:42.690> ballast<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:44.959> the

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
little bit I put fine ballast on the

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.490 
little bit I put fine ballast on the
track<00:02:46.790> screw<00:02:47.790> out<00:02:47.849> here<00:02:48.180> now<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.079> problem<00:02:49.440> I'm

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
track screw out here now the problem I'm

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.250 
track screw out here now the problem I'm
having<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:50.040> since<00:02:50.909> this<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.359> medium<00:02:51.930> ballast

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
having is since this is medium ballast

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.190 
having is since this is medium ballast
there<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:54.060> can<00:02:54.239> kind<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.569> tell<00:02:54.780> once<00:02:55.049> it

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
there you can kind of tell once it

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.289 
there you can kind of tell once it
switches<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.829> mean<00:02:56.370> it's<00:02:56.489> pretty<00:02:56.849> obvious<00:02:57.269> that

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
switches I mean it's pretty obvious that

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.220 
switches I mean it's pretty obvious that
that's<00:02:57.810> fine<00:02:58.579> or<00:02:59.579> not<00:02:59.730> there's<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.180> medium<00:03:00.510> so

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
that's fine or not there's the medium so

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.920 
that's fine or not there's the medium so
I<00:03:01.579> don't<00:03:02.579> know<00:03:02.670> if<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.030> guys<00:03:03.150> have<00:03:03.359> any<00:03:03.510> ideas

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
I don't know if you guys have any ideas

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.920 
I don't know if you guys have any ideas
how<00:03:04.109> I<00:03:04.139> can<00:03:04.440> transition<00:03:05.040> from<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.930> medium

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
how I can transition from the medium

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.330 
how I can transition from the medium
ballast<00:03:07.260> into<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.560> fine<00:03:07.799> because<00:03:08.040> right

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
ballast into the fine because right

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.710 
ballast into the fine because right
there<00:03:08.549> I<00:03:08.579> mean<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:08.879> pretty<00:03:09.030> obvious<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.540> can

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
there I mean it's pretty obvious you can

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.220 
there I mean it's pretty obvious you can
see<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.079> difference<00:03:10.470> right<00:03:11.159> there's<00:03:11.430> the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
see the difference right there's the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.599 
see the difference right there's the
medium<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.319> there's<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.590> fine<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:14.069> really

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
medium and there's the fine I really

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.689 
medium and there's the fine I really
like<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.120> fine<00:03:15.299> ballast<00:03:15.629> better<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:17.519> only

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:17.699 
like the fine ballast better the only

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.580 
like the fine ballast better the only
problem<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.120> have<00:03:18.419> one<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.290> didn't

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
problem that I have one that I didn't

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.159 
problem that I have one that I didn't
use<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.739> was<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.030> it's<00:03:21.359> hard<00:03:21.629> to<00:03:21.690> glue<00:03:21.989> down

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
use it was that it's hard to glue down

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.589 
use it was that it's hard to glue down
although<00:03:22.680> that's<00:03:23.129> been<00:03:23.639> taken<00:03:23.940> care<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.180> I

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
although that's been taken care of I

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.960 
although that's been taken care of I
just<00:03:24.930> need<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.319> use<00:03:25.530> more<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.549> wet<00:03:26.699> water

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
just need to use more of the wet water

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.069 
just need to use more of the wet water
combo<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:28.560> more<00:03:28.889> glue<00:03:29.540> but<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.569> think<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:30.959> looks

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
combo and more glue but I think it looks

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.170 
combo and more glue but I think it looks
pretty<00:03:31.319> nice<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:31.829> yeah<00:03:32.310> when<00:03:32.430> my<00:03:32.459> trains<00:03:32.910> going

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
pretty nice so yeah when my trains going

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:52.160 
pretty nice so yeah when my trains going
here

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.230 

-<00:03:53.170> all<00:03:54.130> right<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:54.520> here<00:03:54.670> we<00:03:54.760> go<00:03:54.880> this<00:03:55.150> is<00:03:57.240> what

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
- all right so here we go this is what

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.550 
- all right so here we go this is what
the<00:03:58.360> trains<00:03:58.660> look<00:03:58.930> like<00:03:59.110> when<00:03:59.290> they<00:03:59.410> go<00:03:59.530> over

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
the trains look like when they go over

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.280 
the trains look like when they go over
that<00:03:59.830> ballast<00:04:00.220> I<00:04:00.630> want<00:04:01.630> to<00:04:01.690> get<00:04:01.900> your<00:04:02.080> opinion

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
that ballast I want to get your opinion

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.570 
that ballast I want to get your opinion
what<00:04:02.560> do<00:04:02.620> you<00:04:02.680> guys<00:04:02.770> think<00:04:03.130> of<00:04:03.190> that<00:04:03.250> does<00:04:03.460> that

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
what do you guys think of that does that

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.540 
what do you guys think of that does that
look<00:04:03.730> pretty<00:04:03.940> uh<00:04:04.060> pretty<00:04:04.450> nice<00:04:05.020> or<00:04:05.490> do<00:04:06.490> you

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
look pretty uh pretty nice or do you

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.370 
look pretty uh pretty nice or do you
think<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:06.790> should<00:04:07.000> continue<00:04:07.300> vacu<00:04:08.050> I<00:04:08.170> haven't

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
think I should continue vacu I haven't

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.950 
think I should continue vacu I haven't
glued<00:04:08.440> any<00:04:08.650> of<00:04:08.770> this<00:04:08.830> down<00:04:09.180> so<00:04:10.180> I<00:04:10.510> can<00:04:10.750> always

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
glued any of this down so I can always

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.380 
glued any of this down so I can always
just<00:04:11.080> vacuum<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:11.740> back<00:04:11.890> up<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.280> go<00:04:13.090> back<00:04:13.120> to

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
just vacuum it back up and go back to

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.060 
just vacuum it back up and go back to
using<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.690> medium<00:04:14.020> although<00:04:14.380> I<00:04:14.590> kind<00:04:14.800> of<00:04:14.920> like

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
using the medium although I kind of like

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.150 
using the medium although I kind of like
how<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:16.660> fine<00:04:16.989> looks<00:04:17.260> there<00:04:17.500> especially

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
how the the fine looks there especially

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.380 
how the the fine looks there especially
when<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:18.489> add<00:04:18.640> some<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:18.850> this<00:04:18.940> underbrush

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
when you add some of this underbrush

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.290 
when you add some of this underbrush
stuff<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:19.930> just<00:04:20.109> looks<00:04:20.320> pretty<00:04:20.590> nice<00:04:21.180> so<00:04:22.180> let

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
stuff it just looks pretty nice so let

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.540 
stuff it just looks pretty nice so let
me<00:04:22.360> know<00:04:22.450> what<00:04:22.570> you<00:04:22.660> think<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.930> that

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
me know what you think of that

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
and also definitely more so

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.950 
and also definitely more so
transitioning<00:04:27.520> from<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.360> medium<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:28.870> the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
transitioning from the medium to the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.020 
transitioning from the medium to the
fine<00:04:29.140> right<00:04:29.410> here<00:04:29.680> I<00:04:29.710> kind<00:04:29.980> of<00:04:30.100> just<00:04:30.790> poured

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
fine right here I kind of just poured

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.110 
fine right here I kind of just poured
some<00:04:31.120> of<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.360> fun<00:04:31.630> over<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.110> medium<00:04:32.940> kind<00:04:33.940> of

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
some of the fun over the medium kind of

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.240 
some of the fun over the medium kind of
you<00:04:34.780> know<00:04:34.900> so<00:04:35.200> right<00:04:35.440> there<00:04:35.650> it's<00:04:35.830> a<00:04:35.890> mix<00:04:36.130> of

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
you know so right there it's a mix of

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.370 
you know so right there it's a mix of
the<00:04:36.310> both<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.970> little<00:04:37.540> mix<00:04:37.720> of<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.870> two<00:04:37.900> and

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
the both a little mix of the two and

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.980 
the both a little mix of the two and
right<00:04:39.100> there<00:04:39.280> it's<00:04:39.430> just<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.730> medium<00:04:40.120> right

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
right there it's just the medium right

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.010 
right there it's just the medium right
there<00:04:41.169> it's<00:04:41.260> just<00:04:41.380> a<00:04:41.530> fine<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:41.919> then<00:04:42.010> for<00:04:42.550> like

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
there it's just a fine and then for like

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.240 
there it's just a fine and then for like
from<00:04:44.400> in<00:04:45.400> between<00:04:45.430> there<00:04:45.940> it's<00:04:46.630> just<00:04:47.160> one<00:04:48.160> on

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
from in between there it's just one on

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.940 
from in between there it's just one on
top<00:04:48.430> of<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.610> other<00:04:48.700> so<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:50.350> think<00:04:50.470> that's<00:04:50.770> what

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
top of the other so I think that's what

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.880 
top of the other so I think that's what
I<00:04:50.980> would<00:04:51.160> do<00:04:51.870> but<00:04:52.870> up<00:04:52.990> here<00:04:53.020> I<00:04:53.440> think<00:04:53.770> that

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
I would do but up here I think that

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.230 
I would do but up here I think that
looks<00:04:54.160> really<00:04:54.220> nice<00:04:54.669> up<00:04:54.910> here<00:04:55.090> especially

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
looks really nice up here especially

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.560 
looks really nice up here especially
once<00:04:55.720> I<00:04:55.840> get<00:04:55.990> all<00:04:56.140> that<00:04:56.169> you<00:04:56.680> know<00:04:57.450> covered<00:04:58.450> in

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
once I get all that you know covered in

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.190 
once I get all that you know covered in
with<00:04:58.720> foliage<00:04:59.169> and<00:04:59.380> stuff<00:04:59.620> like<00:04:59.740> that<00:04:59.950> trees

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
with foliage and stuff like that trees

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.430 
with foliage and stuff like that trees
I'm<00:05:02.200> gonna<00:05:02.350> look<00:05:02.470> pretty<00:05:02.710> cool<00:05:04.050> what<00:05:05.050> I<00:05:05.080> used

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
I'm gonna look pretty cool what I used

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.810 
I'm gonna look pretty cool what I used
for<00:05:05.650> this<00:05:06.010> ballast<00:05:06.400> was<00:05:06.700> I<00:05:07.120> can<00:05:07.540> find<00:05:07.780> it<00:05:07.870> here

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
for this ballast was I can find it here

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.640 
for this ballast was I can find it here
um<00:05:10.140> just<00:05:11.140> used<00:05:11.410> a<00:05:11.530> paintbrush<00:05:12.900> very<00:05:13.900> like

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
um just used a paintbrush very like

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.090 
um just used a paintbrush very like
flying<00:05:15.130> out<00:05:15.310> here<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:15.640> I'm<00:05:16.300> like<00:05:16.419> this<00:05:17.100> the

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
flying out here you I'm like this the

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.120 
flying out here you I'm like this the
bristles<00:05:18.340> are<00:05:18.580> really<00:05:18.760> soft<00:05:19.030> on<00:05:19.240> it<00:05:20.040> and<00:05:21.040> I

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
bristles are really soft on it and I

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.260 
bristles are really soft on it and I
just<00:05:21.340> spread<00:05:21.520> it<00:05:21.669> around<00:05:21.760> like<00:05:22.030> that

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:37.839 

till<00:05:27.110> I<00:05:27.169> got<00:05:27.319> it<00:05:27.500> off<00:05:27.620> all<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:28.009> ties<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:36.849> then

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
till I got it off all the ties and then

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:55.350 
till I got it off all the ties and then
I<00:05:37.910> use<00:05:38.060> my<00:05:38.210> finger<00:05:38.539> just<00:05:39.669> scrape<00:05:42.069> the<00:05:43.069> rest<00:05:43.220> off

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.820 

and<00:05:56.360> I<00:05:56.449> think<00:05:56.509> when<00:05:56.810> it's<00:05:56.960> done<00:05:57.139> it<00:05:57.349> looks

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
and I think when it's done it looks

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.659 
and I think when it's done it looks
really<00:05:58.160> nice<00:05:59.949> no<00:06:00.949> what'd<00:06:01.069> you<00:06:01.190> guys<00:06:01.310> think<00:06:01.370> of

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
that that's about that's what it's gonna

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.800 
that that's about that's what it's gonna
be<00:06:04.490> like<00:06:04.610> on<00:06:04.729> the<00:06:04.759> top<00:06:04.970> track<00:06:05.210> and<00:06:05.449> I'd<00:06:05.539> really

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
be like on the top track and I'd really

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.290

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
not gonna look real messed up if from

not gonna look real messed up if from
transitioning<00:06:14.419> from<00:06:14.630> the<00:06:14.720> medium<00:06:15.139> over<00:06:15.349> here

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
transitioning from the medium over here

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.550 
transitioning from the medium over here
to<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:16.520> fine<00:06:16.909> and<00:06:17.210> I<00:06:17.840> don't<00:06:17.900> think<00:06:18.080> pulling

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
to the fine and I don't think pulling

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.260 
to the fine and I don't think pulling
the<00:06:18.650> mediums<00:06:18.979> up<00:06:19.159> it<00:06:19.340> the<00:06:19.520> medium<00:06:19.909> up<00:06:20.030> is<00:06:20.150> an

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
the mediums up it the medium up is an

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.309 
the mediums up it the medium up is an
option<00:06:20.630> because<00:06:22.659> it's<00:06:23.659> already<00:06:23.810> glued<00:06:24.139> down

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 
option because it's already glued down

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.460 
option because it's already glued down
and<00:06:24.590> I<00:06:24.620> don't<00:06:24.710> want<00:06:24.889> to<00:06:24.949> make<00:06:25.039> this<00:06:25.190> huge<00:06:25.610> mess

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
and I don't want to make this huge mess

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.920 
and I don't want to make this huge mess
that's<00:06:27.470> what<00:06:27.620> the<00:06:27.710> fine<00:06:27.919> looks<00:06:28.190> like<00:06:28.370> I<00:06:28.930> think

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
that's what the fine looks like I think

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.240 
that's what the fine looks like I think
it<00:06:30.169> looks<00:06:30.289> really<00:06:30.409> good<00:06:30.560> I<00:06:30.620> recommend<00:06:31.070> if<00:06:31.159> you

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
it looks really good I recommend if you

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.459 
it looks really good I recommend if you
guys<00:06:31.400> are<00:06:31.580> starting<00:06:31.789> your<00:06:32.030> layout<00:06:32.229> that<00:06:33.229> you

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:33.469 
guys are starting your layout that you

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:35.350 
guys are starting your layout that you
use<00:06:33.740> the<00:06:33.919> fine<00:06:34.130> ballast<00:06:34.550> I<00:06:34.639> think<00:06:35.060> it<00:06:35.150> looks<00:06:35.300> a

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
use the fine ballast I think it looks a

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.510 
use the fine ballast I think it looks a
lot<00:06:35.479> better<00:06:35.539> and<00:06:36.050> it's<00:06:36.259> more<00:06:36.409> realistic<00:06:36.949> if

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
lot better and it's more realistic if

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.730 
lot better and it's more realistic if
you<00:06:37.610> look<00:06:37.759> at<00:06:37.880> real<00:06:38.060> railroad<00:06:38.270> tracks<00:06:38.740> they

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
you look at real railroad tracks they

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.999 
you look at real railroad tracks they
there's<00:06:40.699> about<00:06:40.909> eight<00:06:41.240> stone<00:06:41.650> six<00:06:42.650> to<00:06:42.800> ten

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
there's about eight stone six to ten

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:43.570 
there's about eight stone six to ten
stones

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
stones

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.850 
stones
somewhere<00:06:43.969> around<00:06:44.120> there<00:06:44.599> between<00:06:45.409> each<00:06:45.590> tie

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
somewhere around there between each tie

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.499 
somewhere around there between each tie
and<00:06:46.219> when<00:06:46.460> you<00:06:46.550> use<00:06:46.699> the<00:06:46.849> medium<00:06:47.180> ballast<00:06:47.479> you

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:47.509 
and when you use the medium ballast you

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:50.260 
and when you use the medium ballast you
get<00:06:47.719> about<00:06:47.900> three<00:06:48.169> stones<00:06:48.500> on<00:06:48.889> the<00:06:49.370> model<00:06:49.699> but

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
get about three stones on the model but

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.939 
get about three stones on the model but
when<00:06:50.389> you<00:06:50.479> use<00:06:50.630> fine<00:06:51.400> looks<00:06:52.400> like<00:06:52.669> you<00:06:52.849> get

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:53.949 
when you use fine looks like you get

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:57.939 
when you use fine looks like you get
about<00:06:54.949> you<00:06:55.280> know<00:06:55.430> six<00:06:55.669> or<00:06:55.789> seven<00:06:56.150> so<00:06:56.659> I<00:06:56.949> think

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:57.949 
about you know six or seven so I think

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:02.200 
about you know six or seven so I think
it<00:06:58.069> just<00:06:58.219> looks<00:06:58.250> a<00:06:58.460> lot<00:06:58.610> better<00:07:01.030> that's<00:07:02.030> why

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
it just looks a lot better that's why

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.800 
it just looks a lot better that's why
I'd<00:07:02.330> like<00:07:02.360> to<00:07:02.479> continue<00:07:02.900> using<00:07:03.199> the<00:07:04.810> fine

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810 
I'd like to continue using the fine

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.780 
I'd like to continue using the fine
ballast

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:07.790 
ballast

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.760 
ballast
that's<00:07:08.780> that<00:07:09.080> just<00:07:09.320> let<00:07:09.440> me<00:07:09.500> know<00:07:09.590> what<00:07:09.680> you

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.160 
that's that just let me know what you
think<00:07:09.920> I<00:07:10.220> think<00:07:10.880> it<00:07:11.060> looks<00:07:11.270> pretty<00:07:11.390> good<00:07:11.660> but<00:07:11.930> I

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.170 
think I think it looks pretty good but I

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.740
