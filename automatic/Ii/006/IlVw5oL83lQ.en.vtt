if I told you you could eat the same
amount<00:00:13.910> of<00:00:14.420> food<00:00:14.690> that<00:00:14.990> you're<00:00:15.349> eating<00:00:15.559> right

well<00:00:25.130> we<00:00:25.340> can<00:00:25.610> with<00:00:25.849> fiber<00:00:26.149> and<00:00:26.480> let<00:00:26.840> me<00:00:26.989> share

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
well we can with fiber and let me share

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.519 
well we can with fiber and let me share
with<00:00:27.349> you<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:28.220> fourth<00:00:28.640> most<00:00:29.390> amazing<00:00:30.259> way

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
with you the fourth most amazing way

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.860 
with you the fourth most amazing way
that<00:00:31.340> fiber<00:00:31.820> helps<00:00:32.720> you<00:00:33.230> lose<00:00:33.680> weight<00:00:34.870> fiber

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
that fiber helps you lose weight fiber

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.000 
that fiber helps you lose weight fiber
actually<00:00:36.829> eliminates<00:00:38.109> calories<00:00:39.109> that<00:00:39.710> you've

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
actually eliminates calories that you've

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.139 
actually eliminates calories that you've
already<00:00:40.730> consumed<00:00:41.660> it<00:00:42.410> really<00:00:43.370> sounds<00:00:43.940> almost

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
already consumed it really sounds almost

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.900 
already consumed it really sounds almost
too<00:00:44.480> good<00:00:44.780> to<00:00:44.809> be<00:00:44.929> true<00:00:45.100> so<00:00:46.100> how<00:00:46.129> does<00:00:46.550> this

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
too good to be true so how does this

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.250 
too good to be true so how does this
work<00:00:48.039> people<00:00:49.039> who<00:00:49.280> eat<00:00:49.519> more<00:00:49.760> fiber<00:00:50.260> actually

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
work people who eat more fiber actually

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.650 
work people who eat more fiber actually
excrete<00:00:51.890> more<00:00:52.160> calories<00:00:52.760> in<00:00:52.940> their<00:00:53.089> stool<00:00:53.390> and

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
excrete more calories in their stool and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.079 
excrete more calories in their stool and
I<00:00:54.469> know<00:00:54.530> talking<00:00:55.160> about<00:00:55.339> bowel<00:00:55.550> movements<00:00:55.969> on

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
I know talking about bowel movements on

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.880 
I know talking about bowel movements on
TV<00:00:56.420> it's<00:00:56.629> not<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.899> most<00:00:57.079> pleasant<00:00:57.320> subject

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890

but<00:00:58.579> like<00:00:58.850> I<00:00:59.030> said<00:00:59.059> it's<00:00:59.989> never<00:01:00.199> going<00:01:00.409> to<00:01:00.469> stop

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
but like I said it's never going to stop

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.840 
but like I said it's never going to stop
me<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:02.719> technical<00:01:03.109> term<00:01:03.499> is<00:01:03.739> fecal<00:01:04.339> energy

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
me the technical term is fecal energy

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.970 
me the technical term is fecal energy
excretion<00:01:05.239> but<00:01:05.810> I've<00:01:05.960> changed<00:01:05.990> that<00:01:06.650> a<00:01:06.680> little

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
excretion but I've changed that a little

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.490 
excretion but I've changed that a little
bit<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:07.400> I'm<00:01:07.460> calling<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.540> fiber<00:01:08.990> flush

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
bit and I'm calling it the fiber flush

bit and I'm calling it the fiber flush
effect<00:01:10.070> studies<00:01:11.060> have<00:01:11.090> shown<00:01:11.299> that<00:01:11.829> with<00:01:12.829> each

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
you average the studies out you excrete

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.160 
you average the studies out you excrete
about<00:01:26.750> seven<00:01:27.439> calories<00:01:28.130> for<00:01:28.640> every<00:01:29.240> gram<00:01:29.719> of

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
about seven calories for every gram of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.029 
about seven calories for every gram of
fiber<00:01:31.509> this<00:01:32.509> means<00:01:32.960> if<00:01:33.290> you<00:01:34.009> just<00:01:34.460> consumed<00:01:36.039> 35

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
fiber this means if you just consumed 35

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.200 
fiber this means if you just consumed 35
grams<00:01:37.399> of<00:01:37.640> fiber<00:01:37.909> daily<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:39.770> would<00:01:39.920> actually

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
grams of fiber daily you would actually

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.459 
grams of fiber daily you would actually
eliminate<00:01:42.909> 245<00:01:43.909> calories<00:01:44.539> in<00:01:44.719> your<00:01:44.930> stool<00:01:45.229> and

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
eliminate 245 calories in your stool and

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.289 
eliminate 245 calories in your stool and
that's<00:01:46.039> with<00:01:46.310> no<00:01:46.850> exercise<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:48.609> call<00:01:49.609> this<00:01:50.000> the

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
that's with no exercise I call this the

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.060 
that's with no exercise I call this the
fiber<00:01:51.170> flush<00:01:51.890> formula<00:01:52.850> I<00:01:53.090> also<00:01:53.869> call<00:01:54.409> it<00:01:54.439> the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
fiber flush formula I also call it the

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.520 
fiber flush formula I also call it the
biggest<00:01:55.579> bonus<00:01:56.509> of<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:58.009> fiber<00:01:58.340> 35<00:01:59.299> plan<00:02:00.200> if

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
biggest bonus of the fiber 35 plan if

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.630 
biggest bonus of the fiber 35 plan if
you<00:02:01.430> only<00:02:01.609> get<00:02:02.000> one<00:02:02.210> thing<00:02:02.840> from<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:04.340> show

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
you only get one thing from this show

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.109 
you only get one thing from this show
today<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.359> hope<00:02:06.350> it's<00:02:07.070> this<00:02:07.340> fiber<00:02:07.640> flush

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
today I hope it's this fiber flush

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.960 
today I hope it's this fiber flush
formula<00:02:08.810> let<00:02:09.740> me<00:02:09.890> show<00:02:10.190> you<00:02:10.250> what<00:02:10.759> this<00:02:10.910> means

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
formula let me show you what this means

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.680 
formula let me show you what this means
to<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:12.010> I'm<00:02:13.010> going<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:13.580> use<00:02:13.790> an<00:02:13.940> example<00:02:14.540> of

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
to you I'm going to use an example of

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.550 
to you I'm going to use an example of
Mary<00:02:15.130> Mary<00:02:16.130> needs<00:02:16.430> about<00:02:16.840> 1,800<00:02:17.840> calories<00:02:18.020> a

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
Mary Mary needs about 1,800 calories a

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.470 
Mary Mary needs about 1,800 calories a
day<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:19.670> maintain<00:02:19.880> her

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
day to maintain her

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.009 
day to maintain her
current<00:02:20.780> weight<00:02:21.550> let's<00:02:22.550> just<00:02:22.909> look<00:02:23.239> at<00:02:23.569> what

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
current weight let's just look at what

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.059 
current weight let's just look at what
fiber<00:02:24.349> can<00:02:24.739> do<00:02:24.920> for<00:02:25.190> Mary<00:02:25.430> if<00:02:25.670> Mary<00:02:26.450> consumed

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
fiber can do for Mary if Mary consumed

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.160 
fiber can do for Mary if Mary consumed
1800<00:02:28.069> calories<00:02:28.310> in<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.790> day<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.269> she<00:02:29.870> regularly

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
1800 calories in a day and she regularly

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.039 
1800 calories in a day and she regularly
ate<00:02:30.620> about<00:02:30.799> 10<00:02:31.190> grams<00:02:31.459> of<00:02:31.700> fiber<00:02:31.940> she<00:02:32.870> would

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
ate about 10 grams of fiber she would

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.770 
ate about 10 grams of fiber she would
fiber<00:02:33.349> flush<00:02:33.739> out<00:02:33.980> about<00:02:34.310> 70<00:02:35.000> calories<00:02:35.269> in<00:02:35.690> her

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
day x 31 days it would equal 75 hundred

a total loss of over 26 pounds fiber is

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.849 
a total loss of over 26 pounds fiber is
