really effective for player displayer

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.150 
really effective for player displayer
servers<00:00:10.200> which<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.530> basically<00:00:10.860> if<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.040> guys

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
to know servers where you can kind of

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.780 
to know servers where you can kind of
have<00:00:13.320> like<00:00:13.380> wars<00:00:13.830> with<00:00:14.130> other<00:00:14.280> people<00:00:14.580> and

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
okay and then the second type we will be

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.310 
okay and then the second type we will be
using<00:00:56.460> redstone<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:57.270> remote<00:00:57.510> detonation<00:00:57.690> and

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
using redstone for remote detonation and

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.260 
using redstone for remote detonation and
you<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> same<00:00:59.250> thing<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.969> we're<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.210> to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you do the same thing so we're going to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.219 
you do the same thing so we're going to
take<00:01:00.329> three<00:01:00.510> down<00:01:02.750> will<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:03.899> work<00:01:04.049> better

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
take three down will not work better

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.399 
take three down will not work better
actually<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.830> think<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.960> put<00:01:07.170> one<00:01:07.320> at

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
actually I think about it and put one at

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.160 
actually I think about it and put one at
the<00:01:07.470> bottom<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.390> take<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> little<00:01:09.600> tunnel<00:01:09.869> this

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.080 
or something flip a switch and there you
go<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.009> pretty<00:01:59.159> effective<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.880> then

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
go so it's pretty effective and then

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.330 
go so it's pretty effective and then
obviously<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.439> read<00:02:01.770> style<00:02:02.040> but<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.250> can

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
obviously so just read style but you can

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
obviously so just read style but you can
come<00:02:02.399> over<00:02:02.579> here<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.759> collect<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.240> it's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
come over here and collect it so it's

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.620 
come over here and collect it so it's
not<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.509> big<00:02:03.570> deal<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:05.369> for<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.090> last<00:02:06.299> part

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
not a big deal and for the last part

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.719 
not a big deal and for the last part
this<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.799> combination<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.550> both<00:02:08.670> the

wanted to you don't have to do this but
I<00:04:04.510> could<00:04:05.510> work<00:04:05.799> fine<00:04:06.799> and<00:04:07.629> we'll<00:04:08.629> do<00:04:08.870> that<00:04:09.049> one

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
I could work fine and we'll do that one

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
now will do yeah well do that one just

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.190 
now will do yeah well do that one just
get<00:04:12.530> is<00:04:12.650> probably<00:04:13.459> more<00:04:13.579> confusing<00:04:14.200> so

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
get is probably more confusing so

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.270 
get is probably more confusing so
there's<00:04:15.379> many<00:04:15.470> ways<00:04:15.650> you<00:04:15.769> could<00:04:15.890> probably<00:04:16.100> do

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
there's many ways you could probably do

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.469 
there's many ways you could probably do
this<00:04:16.459> I'm<00:04:16.820> gonna<00:04:16.910> go<00:04:17.090> like<00:04:17.239> this<00:04:17.419> for<00:04:17.690> now<00:04:17.840> and

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
this I'm gonna go like this for now and

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.550 
this I'm gonna go like this for now and
three<00:04:20.479> over<00:04:20.810> and<00:04:20.930> then<00:04:21.019> it<00:04:21.169> sticks<00:04:21.410> straight

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
three over and then it sticks straight

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:31.180 
three over and then it sticks straight
up<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:22.669> get<00:04:22.820> out<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:27.789> good<00:04:29.080> show<00:04:30.080> k<00:04:30.350> knowing

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
up to get out and good show k knowing

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.230 
up to get out and good show k knowing
and<00:04:32.000> want<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.330> go<00:04:32.449> like<00:04:32.539> this<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:36.910> I<00:04:37.910> we<00:04:38.120> have

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
and want to go like this and I we have

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.000 
and want to go like this and I we have
the<00:04:38.360> Conte<00:04:38.720> one<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.169> you<00:04:39.590> can<00:04:39.620> just<00:04:39.800> flip<00:04:39.979> a

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
the Conte one and you can just flip a

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.159 
the Conte one and you can just flip a
switch<00:04:40.099> right<00:04:40.550> there<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.479> always<00:04:41.660> explode

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
switch right there and it always explode

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.990 
switch right there and it always explode
all<00:04:42.470> these<00:04:42.740> but<00:04:43.340> instead<00:04:43.669> we're<00:04:43.820> to<00:04:43.880> do

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
all these but instead we're to do

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.240 
all these but instead we're to do
something<00:04:44.240> different<00:04:44.620> let's<00:04:45.620> suit<00:04:45.830> with<00:04:46.070> the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
something different let's suit with the

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.000 
something different let's suit with the
make<00:04:47.090> sure<00:04:47.210> I<00:04:47.240> got<00:04:47.389> this<00:04:47.539> right<00:04:47.599> okay<00:04:50.800> so<00:04:51.800> put<00:04:51.919> a

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
make sure I got this right okay so put a

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.770 
make sure I got this right okay so put a
wooden<00:04:52.190> pressure<00:04:52.460> plate<00:04:52.729> down<00:04:52.880> and<00:04:53.120> normally

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
wooden pressure plate down and normally

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.779 
wooden pressure plate down and normally
it'll<00:04:54.080> only<00:04:54.199> be<00:04:54.380> one<00:04:54.590> explosion<00:04:54.860> but<00:04:55.250> this<00:04:55.639> is

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
it'll only be one explosion but this is

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.219 
it'll only be one explosion but this is
a<00:04:55.820> way<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.060> kind<00:04:56.330> of<00:04:56.419> connect<00:04:56.690> them<00:04:56.810> all<00:04:56.930> make<00:04:57.199> a

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
a way to kind of connect them all make a

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:58.510 
a way to kind of connect them all make a
bigger<00:04:57.650> one<00:04:57.830> I<00:04:57.860> mean<00:04:58.010> you<00:04:58.130> can<00:04:58.220> make<00:04:58.370> it<00:04:58.460> across

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
bigger one I mean you can make it across

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.510 
bigger one I mean you can make it across
the<00:04:58.789> whole<00:04:58.880> entire<00:04:59.240> moniker<00:04:59.599> than<00:04:59.960> one<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:01.220> i

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
the whole entire moniker than one and i

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.640 
the whole entire moniker than one and i
forgot<00:05:01.699> i<00:05:01.760> made<00:05:01.910> it<00:05:02.000> to<00:05:02.150> okay<00:05:02.900> well<00:05:03.080> i<00:05:03.320> was
