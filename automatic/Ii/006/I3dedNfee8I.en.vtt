kit lens that I got with the camera so

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.750 
kit lens that I got with the camera so
it's<00:04:31.150> essentially<00:04:32.160> something<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.430> I<00:04:33.580> am

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
it's essentially something that I am

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.970 
it's essentially something that I am
going<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:34.030> be<00:04:34.090> replacing<00:04:34.780> with<00:04:35.290> that<00:04:35.560> so<00:04:35.830> that

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
going to be replacing with that so that

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.870 
going to be replacing with that so that
I<00:04:36.190> can<00:04:36.490> use<00:04:36.669> it<00:04:36.850> for<00:04:37.120> street<00:04:37.840> photography<00:04:37.990> and

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
I can use it for street photography and

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.150 
I can use it for street photography and
that's<00:04:39.880> what<00:04:40.030> it<00:04:40.120> looks<00:04:40.150> like

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
that's what it looks like

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.150 
that's what it looks like
impressive<00:04:42.160> looking<00:04:42.460> lens<00:04:42.700> over<00:04:43.030> there<00:04:43.300> and

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
impressive looking lens over there and

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.550 
impressive looking lens over there and
as<00:04:45.160> soon<00:04:45.760> as<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:46.270> power<00:04:46.570> it<00:04:46.750> on<00:04:46.900> you<00:04:47.169> will<00:04:47.290> see

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
as soon as you power it on you will see

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.770 
as soon as you power it on you will see
the<00:04:47.710> difference<00:04:48.040> because<00:04:48.160> now<00:04:49.030> it<00:04:49.300> starts<00:04:49.660> to

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
the difference because now it starts to

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.040 
the difference because now it starts to
become<00:04:49.900> a<00:04:50.260> point-and-shoot<00:04:50.919> camera<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:52.050> you

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
become a point-and-shoot camera and you

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.110 
become a point-and-shoot camera and you
get<00:04:53.200> the<00:04:53.320> zoom<00:04:53.530> toggle<00:04:53.889> over<00:04:54.010> there<00:04:54.190> and<00:04:54.400> now

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
get the zoom toggle over there and now

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.200 
get the zoom toggle over there and now
you<00:04:55.180> can<00:04:55.300> control<00:04:55.750> your<00:04:55.990> zoom<00:04:56.880> using<00:04:57.880> this

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
you can control your zoom using this

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.810 
you can control your zoom using this
toggle

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.220 

so<00:05:05.510> the<00:05:06.320> camera<00:05:06.770> lens<00:05:07.330> now<00:05:08.330> becomes<00:05:08.720> a<00:05:08.870> powered

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
so the camera lens now becomes a powered

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.800 
so the camera lens now becomes a powered
zoom<00:05:09.500> lens<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:10.130> you<00:05:10.910> can<00:05:11.060> see<00:05:11.240> how<00:05:11.420> it<00:05:11.570> works

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
zoom lens and you can see how it works

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.160 
zoom lens and you can see how it works
over<00:05:12.110> there<00:05:12.880> is<00:05:13.880> a<00:05:14.030> fairly<00:05:14.330> good<00:05:14.480> job<00:05:14.510> and<00:05:14.990> you

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
over there is a fairly good job and you

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.200 
over there is a fairly good job and you
can<00:05:15.290> also<00:05:15.440> switch<00:05:15.740> from<00:05:16.250> auto<00:05:16.580> focus<00:05:17.030> to

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
can also switch from auto focus to

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.390 
can also switch from auto focus to
manual<00:05:17.360> focus<00:05:17.570> focus<00:05:18.500> using<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:18.980> toggle<00:05:19.160> as

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
manual focus focus using the toggle as

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.700 
manual focus focus using the toggle as
well<00:05:19.580> and<00:05:19.790> you<00:05:20.510> can<00:05:20.660> see<00:05:20.690> that<00:05:21.260> it<00:05:21.380> works<00:05:21.590> great

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
well and you can see that it works great

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.370 
well and you can see that it works great
and<00:05:22.250> it<00:05:22.820> can<00:05:23.090> kind<00:05:23.270> of<00:05:23.420> reduce<00:05:23.570> shake<00:05:24.020> as<00:05:24.200> well

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
and it can kind of reduce shake as well

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.810 
and it can kind of reduce shake as well
because<00:05:24.680> now<00:05:25.100> you<00:05:25.160> don't<00:05:25.460> have<00:05:25.520> to<00:05:25.610> move<00:05:25.760> your

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
because now you don't have to move your

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.630 
because now you don't have to move your
hand<00:05:26.180> around<00:05:26.900> to<00:05:27.080> focus<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:28.070> can<00:05:28.100> just<00:05:28.400> simply

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
hand around to focus you can just simply

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.870 
hand around to focus you can just simply
put<00:05:29.120> your<00:05:29.150> hand<00:05:29.420> on<00:05:29.510> the<00:05:29.570> side<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.670> use<00:05:31.670> the

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
put your hand on the side and use the

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.330 
put your hand on the side and use the
toggle<00:05:32.210> to<00:05:32.240> focus<00:05:32.740> it's<00:05:33.740> not<00:05:33.920> very<00:05:34.130> accurate

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
toggle to focus it's not very accurate

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.490 
toggle to focus it's not very accurate
it's<00:05:34.730> not<00:05:34.910> as<00:05:35.060> accurate<00:05:35.510> as<00:05:35.750> a<00:05:35.810> ring<00:05:36.290> would<00:05:36.470> be

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
it's not as accurate as a ring would be

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.820 
it's not as accurate as a ring would be
because<00:05:37.130> you<00:05:37.280> will<00:05:37.430> find<00:05:37.730> yourself<00:05:38.120> losing

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
because you will find yourself losing

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.160 
because you will find yourself losing
the<00:05:39.830> exact<00:05:40.250> focus<00:05:40.640> mark<00:05:40.850> but<00:05:41.690> you<00:05:41.870> can<00:05:42.020> see

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.170 
the exact focus mark but you can see

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.230 
the exact focus mark but you can see
that<00:05:42.320> it<00:05:42.440> works<00:05:42.650> great<00:05:42.770> and<00:05:43.190> you<00:05:43.910> can<00:05:44.030> quickly

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
that it works great and you can quickly

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.420 
that it works great and you can quickly
take<00:05:44.450> a<00:05:44.510> picture<00:05:44.870> I<00:05:45.080> don't<00:05:46.010> have<00:05:46.100> a<00:05:46.160> memory

card in there yet but that's what the

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.580 
card in there yet but that's what the
lens<00:05:49.310> looks<00:05:49.640> like<00:05:49.850> basically<00:05:50.240> and<00:05:50.510> I<00:05:51.290> will

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.180 
soon I'm going to be taking a lot of
pictures<00:05:55.850> in<00:05:56.090> video<00:05:56.510> with<00:05:56.690> this<00:05:56.870> I<00:05:57.050> also<00:05:57.740> have

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
pictures in video with this I also have

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.430 
pictures in video with this I also have
thought<00:05:58.550> of<00:05:58.790> installing<00:05:59.630> a<00:05:59.780> custom<00:05:59.990> firmware

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
thought of installing a custom firmware

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.520 
thought of installing a custom firmware
on<00:06:00.920> my<00:06:01.460> gf1<00:06:01.850> which<00:06:02.300> will<00:06:02.480> enable<00:06:02.720> full<00:06:03.110> HD

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
on my gf1 which will enable full HD

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.110 
on my gf1 which will enable full HD
video<00:06:03.860> and<00:06:04.070> I<00:06:04.370> would<00:06:04.550> like<00:06:04.670> to<00:06:04.790> see<00:06:05.000> the

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
video and I would like to see the

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.390 
video and I would like to see the
difference<00:06:05.510> in<00:06:05.750> video<00:06:06.530> quality<00:06:06.710> from<00:06:07.130> that

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
difference in video quality from that

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.470 
difference in video quality from that
versus<00:06:08.830> the<00:06:09.830> video<00:06:10.100> quality<00:06:10.550> of<00:06:10.790> the<00:06:11.240> stock

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.480 
versus the video quality of the stock

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.570 
versus the video quality of the stock
and<00:06:12.050> now<00:06:12.320> currently<00:06:12.740> it<00:06:12.890> records<00:06:13.190> only<00:06:13.490> at

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
and now currently it records only at

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.360 
and now currently it records only at
720p<00:06:14.180> but<00:06:14.510> I<00:06:15.350> believe<00:06:15.830> that<00:06:15.860> there<00:06:16.250> is<00:06:16.340> a

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
720p but I believe that there is a

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.550 
720p but I believe that there is a
slight<00:06:16.700> increase<00:06:16.910> in<00:06:17.540> quality<00:06:17.750> and<00:06:18.200> it<00:06:18.380> does

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
slight increase in quality and it does

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.910 
slight increase in quality and it does
record<00:06:18.830> a<00:06:18.950> 1080p<00:06:19.460> once<00:06:20.030> you<00:06:20.810> to<00:06:20.990> install<00:06:21.290> the<00:06:21.740> P

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:21.920 
record a 1080p once you to install the P

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.830 
record a 1080p once you to install the P
tool<00:06:22.100> customs<00:06:22.640> custom<00:06:23.360> firmware<00:06:23.540> so<00:06:23.780> I'm

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
tool customs custom firmware so I'm

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.080

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
going to be doing that but before I do

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.490
