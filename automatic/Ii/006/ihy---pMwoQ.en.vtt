00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.690 

hello

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
hello

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.190 
hello
today<00:00:10.210> I'm<00:00:10.330> going<00:00:10.510> to<00:00:10.599> be<00:00:10.660> showing<00:00:10.840> you<00:00:11.170> a

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
today I'm going to be showing you a

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.490 
today I'm going to be showing you a
reversible<00:00:12.070> piston<00:00:12.669> caterpillar<00:00:13.330> if<00:00:13.929> that

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
reversible piston caterpillar if that

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.780 
reversible piston caterpillar if that
would<00:00:14.679> be<00:00:14.769> its<00:00:14.919> name<00:00:15.070> I<00:00:15.129> don't<00:00:15.370> know

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790 
would be its name I don't know

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.830 
would be its name I don't know
so<00:00:16.600> yeah<00:00:17.110> this<00:00:17.260> works<00:00:17.500> is<00:00:18.130> it<00:00:18.940> looks<00:00:19.689> like<00:00:19.750> a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
so yeah this works is it looks like a

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.800 
so yeah this works is it looks like a
regular<00:00:20.130> caterpillar<00:00:21.130> so<00:00:22.060> if<00:00:22.510> you<00:00:22.570> don't<00:00:22.750> know

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
regular caterpillar so if you don't know

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.310 
regular caterpillar so if you don't know
how<00:00:22.929> those<00:00:23.080> work<00:00:23.349> basically<00:00:23.949> a<00:00:24.840> piston<00:00:25.840> and<00:00:26.019> a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
how those work basically a piston and a

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.060 
how those work basically a piston and a
sticky<00:00:26.529> piston<00:00:26.740> and<00:00:28.470> they<00:00:29.470> basically<00:00:29.769> keep

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
sticky piston and they basically keep

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.830 
sticky piston and they basically keep
repel<00:00:30.369> each<00:00:30.490> other<00:00:30.640> so<00:00:31.529> does<00:00:32.529> that<00:00:33.420> would<00:00:34.420> pull

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
repel each other so does that would pull

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
repel each other so does that would pull
that<00:00:35.200> there<00:00:35.590> and<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:37.180> forth<00:00:37.620> let's<00:00:38.620> play<00:00:38.800> see

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
that there and so forth let's play see

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.020 
that there and so forth let's play see
how<00:00:38.980> that<00:00:39.100> works<00:00:39.280> but<00:00:39.490> the<00:00:39.580> problem<00:00:39.880> with<00:00:40.000> that

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
how that works but the problem with that

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.660 
how that works but the problem with that
is<00:00:40.390> that<00:00:40.650> it<00:00:41.650> will<00:00:41.830> only<00:00:41.890> go<00:00:42.130> in<00:00:42.250> one<00:00:42.430> direction

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
is that it will only go in one direction

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.620 
is that it will only go in one direction
so<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.950> can't<00:00:45.220> it<00:00:45.580> can<00:00:45.700> go<00:00:45.790> this<00:00:45.880> way<00:00:45.940> but<00:00:46.540> it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
so it can't it can go this way but it

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.740 
so it can't it can go this way but it
not<00:00:46.960> go<00:00:47.080> this<00:00:47.230> way<00:00:47.440> so<00:00:48.370> this<00:00:48.550> is<00:00:48.760> different<00:00:49.270> in

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
not go this way so this is different in

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.230 
not go this way so this is different in
its<00:00:50.400> reversible<00:00:51.400> one<00:00:51.550> which<00:00:51.730> can<00:00:51.940> go<00:00:52.030> both

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
its reversible one which can go both

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.220 
its reversible one which can go both
ways<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:53.620> how<00:00:53.860> this<00:00:54.070> works<00:00:54.430> is<00:00:55.060> it's<00:00:56.050> got<00:00:56.200> a

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
ways it's how this works is it's got a

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.490 
ways it's how this works is it's got a
clock<00:00:56.670> some<00:00:57.670> redstone<00:00:58.000> and<00:00:58.600> pistons<00:00:59.380> and

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
clock some redstone and pistons and

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.050 
clock some redstone and pistons and
complicated<00:01:00.310> stuff<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.830> it's<00:01:02.830> seaton<00:01:03.790> action

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
complicated stuff so it's seaton action

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.910 
complicated stuff so it's seaton action
it's<00:01:07.060> quite<00:01:07.270> noisy<00:01:07.479> as<00:01:07.810> well<00:01:08.020> I<00:01:08.259> just<00:01:08.619> turned

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
it's quite noisy as well I just turned

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.039 
it's quite noisy as well I just turned
my<00:01:08.979> sound<00:01:09.310> out<00:01:09.460> about<00:01:09.869> one<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:13.450> gets<00:01:13.659> to<00:01:13.899> the

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
my sound out about one it gets to the

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.639 
my sound out about one it gets to the
end<00:01:14.259> and<00:01:15.689> other<00:01:16.689> moment<00:01:16.929> isn't<00:01:17.020> actually<00:01:17.380> way

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
end and other moment isn't actually way

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.099 
end and other moment isn't actually way
to<00:01:17.710> turn<00:01:18.700> it<00:01:18.729> off<00:01:19.030> but<00:01:19.329> you<00:01:19.659> know<00:01:19.689> you<00:01:19.840> could

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.109 
to turn it off but you know you could

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:24.209 
to turn it off but you know you could
probably<00:01:20.289> hook<00:01:20.679> up<00:01:20.890> a<00:01:21.070> bud<00:01:21.369> switch<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:23.219> stop

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
probably hook up a bud switch to stop

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.330 
probably hook up a bud switch to stop
the<00:01:24.490> clock<00:01:25.149> going<00:01:25.679> so<00:01:26.679> you<00:01:26.829> turn<00:01:27.009> that<00:01:27.130> off

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
the clock going so you turn that off

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.679 
the clock going so you turn that off
once<00:01:28.090> it<00:01:28.240> gets<00:01:28.450> to<00:01:28.539> the<00:01:28.630> end<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.460> over<00:01:31.450> here

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
once it gets to the end and over here

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.149 
once it gets to the end and over here
you<00:01:31.810> just<00:01:31.840> basically<00:01:32.259> got<00:01:32.619> a<00:01:32.649> mirror<00:01:32.859> of<00:01:33.039> the

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
you just basically got a mirror of the

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.039 
you just basically got a mirror of the
design<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:35.819> there<00:01:36.819> it<00:01:36.909> goes<00:01:37.060> back<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:37.990> the

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
design and there it goes back to the

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:38.580 
design and there it goes back to the
start

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
start

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.830 
start
basically<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.670> reason<00:01:39.880> this<00:01:39.969> works<00:01:40.299> as

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
basically the reason this works as

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.709 
basically the reason this works as
opposed<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.530> original<00:01:41.979> design<00:01:42.219> is

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
opposed to the original design is

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.629 
opposed to the original design is
because<00:01:43.719> both<00:01:43.960> of<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.259> mystic<00:01:44.560> Pistons<00:01:45.039> and

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:47.639 

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:50.249 

the<00:01:48.639> reason<00:01:49.060> they<00:01:49.479> can<00:01:49.630> push<00:01:49.840> them<00:01:50.049> without

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
the reason they can push them without

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.020 
the reason they can push them without
pulling<00:01:50.920> them<00:01:51.159> back<00:01:51.280> together<00:01:51.460> is<00:01:51.700> that<00:01:51.850> these

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
pulling them back together is that these

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.349 
pulling them back together is that these
are<00:01:52.270> very<00:01:52.979> short<00:01:53.979> signals<00:01:54.549> they're<00:01:54.759> just<00:01:54.909> tiny

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
are very short signals they're just tiny

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:56.999 
are very short signals they're just tiny
little<00:01:55.569> bursts<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.380> because<00:01:56.679> there's<00:01:56.859> such

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
little bursts and because there's such

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.239 
little bursts and because there's such
tiny<00:01:57.280> little<00:01:57.490> bursts<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:59.409> will<00:01:59.560> just<00:01:59.709> instead

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:00.249 
tiny little bursts it will just instead

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.699 
tiny little bursts it will just instead
of<00:02:00.310> them<00:02:00.749> retract<00:02:01.749> it<00:02:01.959> when<00:02:02.109> it<00:02:02.200> retracts<00:02:02.409> it

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
of them retract it when it retracts it

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.830 
of them retract it when it retracts it
when<00:02:02.829> it<00:02:02.889> pull<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.280> block<00:02:03.459> back<00:02:03.700> so<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:04.749> will

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
when it pull the block back so it will

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.109 
when it pull the block back so it will
just<00:02:04.990> lie<00:02:05.380> there<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.709> see<00:02:05.889> it's<00:02:06.520> just<00:02:06.609> pushing

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
just lie there you see it's just pushing

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.730 
just lie there you see it's just pushing
it<00:02:07.329> and<00:02:07.450> not<00:02:07.539> putting<00:02:07.689> it<00:02:07.869> back

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
it and not putting it back

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.020 
it and not putting it back
the<00:02:09.550> reason<00:02:09.850> this<00:02:09.970> works<00:02:10.210> and<00:02:11.610> it's<00:02:12.610> kind<00:02:12.880> of<00:02:12.940> a

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
the reason this works and it's kind of a

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.150 
the reason this works and it's kind of a
pointless<00:02:13.330> machine<00:02:13.810> but<00:02:14.170> it's<00:02:14.830> just<00:02:14.950> one<00:02:15.100> of

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
pointless machine but it's just one of

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.960 
pointless machine but it's just one of
those<00:02:15.250> things<00:02:15.550> are<00:02:15.880> cool<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.490> my<00:02:18.640> idea

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
those things are cool so so of my idea

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.360 
those things are cool so so of my idea
this<00:02:19.240> would<00:02:19.450> be<00:02:19.660> -<00:02:19.960> you<00:02:20.920> know<00:02:20.950> you're<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.310> a

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
this would be - you know you're in a

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.760 
this would be - you know you're in a
mine<00:02:21.640> or<00:02:21.910> something<00:02:22.090> or<00:02:22.500> anywhere<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.680> it's

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
mine or something or anywhere and it's

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.120 
mine or something or anywhere and it's
just<00:02:23.980> all<00:02:24.070> for<00:02:24.220> transport<00:02:24.790> blocks<00:02:25.270> so<00:02:26.130> this

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
just all for transport blocks so this

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.840 
just all for transport blocks so this
could<00:02:27.400> go<00:02:27.550> an<00:02:28.080> infinite<00:02:29.080> distance<00:02:29.260> well

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
could go an infinite distance well

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.940 
could go an infinite distance well
within<00:02:30.850> reason<00:02:31.150> obviously<00:02:31.330> it's<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.960> go<00:02:32.110> quite

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
within reason obviously it's to go quite

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.270 
within reason obviously it's to go quite
a<00:02:32.980> large<00:02:33.250> distance<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:35.410> know<00:02:35.500> push<00:02:35.920> some

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
a large distance and you know push some

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.610 
a large distance and you know push some
blocks<00:02:36.720> really<00:02:37.720> far<00:02:37.930> away<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.170> know<00:02:38.440> it's

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
blocks really far away I know it's

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.650 
blocks really far away I know it's
probably<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.580> most<00:02:39.700> inefficient<00:02:40.150> way<00:02:40.510> of

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
probably the most inefficient way of

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.750 
probably the most inefficient way of
doing<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:40.990> I<00:02:41.110> love<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.380> it's<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.340> cool<00:02:42.520> way<00:02:42.640> of

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
doing it I love that it's a cool way of

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.170 
doing it I love that it's a cool way of
doing<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:44.380> show<00:02:44.710> you<00:02:44.740> that<00:02:45.160> just<00:02:45.730> turn

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
doing it so to show you that just turn

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.000 
doing it so to show you that just turn
this<00:02:46.270> off<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.810> yeah<00:02:49.960> you<00:02:50.020> just<00:02:50.170> turn<00:02:50.620> this<00:02:50.800> on

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
this off so yeah you just turn this on

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.920 
this off so yeah you just turn this on
and<00:02:51.330> there<00:02:52.330> we<00:02:52.420> go

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
and there we go

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.110 
and there we go
pushes<00:02:53.380> them<00:02:53.560> away<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.340> know<00:02:54.520> this

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
pushes them away and that you know this

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.060 
pushes them away and that you know this
is<00:02:55.270> just<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.480> small<00:02:55.750> one<00:02:55.960> but<00:02:56.110> if<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.380> just<00:02:56.530> kept

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
is just a small one but if it just kept

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.370 
is just a small one but if it just kept
go<00:02:57.310> in<00:02:57.490> that<00:02:57.640> push<00:02:57.970> nice<00:02:58.150> blocks<00:02:58.360> quite<00:02:58.660> far<00:02:58.990> so

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
go in that push nice blocks quite far so

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.220 
go in that push nice blocks quite far so
yeah<00:03:00.250> that's<00:03:00.730> right<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.270> don't<00:03:01.840> normally<00:03:02.080> do

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
yeah that's right I don't normally do

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.990 
yeah that's right I don't normally do
redstone<00:03:02.650> stuff<00:03:02.950> but<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.430> thought<00:03:03.760> this<00:03:03.880> is

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
redstone stuff but I thought this is

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.310 
redstone stuff but I thought this is
quite<00:03:04.180> interesting<00:03:04.690> too<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:06.600> as<00:03:07.600> pointless<00:03:08.110> it

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
quite interesting too so as pointless it

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.560 
quite interesting too so as pointless it
might<00:03:08.530> be<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:09.430> yet<00:03:10.360> thank<00:03:11.020> you<00:03:11.050> for<00:03:11.230> watching
