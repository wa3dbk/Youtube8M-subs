 lean diana that diana lunar goddess in 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.340
 theory look here we have it the truth is 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.380
 I find no tonal design 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.780
 and seriously they always put a hole 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.980
 palexco of share can be all is 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.780

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.530

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.230
 control 3 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.160
 the dance I think is the same and the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.160
 other things I think that also 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.809
 control 4 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.909

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.759

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.970

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.970

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.439
 now the w 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.220
 which I think are more whitish like 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.220
 more translucent 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.470
