00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
discovered now because we had to figure

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.690 
discovered now because we had to figure
it<00:01:53.329> out<00:01:53.420> in<00:01:53.539> the<00:01:53.600> first<00:01:53.780> movie<00:01:54.049> and<00:01:54.460> see<00:01:55.460> what

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
it out in the first movie and see what

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.809 
it out in the first movie and see what
really<00:01:56.119> are<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.359> best<00:01:56.539> parts<00:01:56.990> of<00:01:57.109> him<00:01:57.170> and

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
really are the best parts of him and

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.730 
really are the best parts of him and
make<00:01:58.819> those<00:01:58.969> parts<00:01:59.240> richer<00:01:59.810> I'd<00:02:00.319> done<00:02:00.619> the

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
make those parts richer I'd done the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.959 
make those parts richer I'd done the
movie<00:02:00.950> once<00:02:01.100> before<00:02:01.249> so<00:02:01.549> I<00:02:01.609> knew<00:02:01.819> the

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
movie once before so I knew the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:03.999

fundamentals<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:03.049> romantic<00:02:03.499> aspect<00:02:03.649> was

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
fundamentals the romantic aspect was

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.620 
fundamentals the romantic aspect was
another<00:02:04.249> level<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:04.789> we<00:02:04.999> didn't<00:02:05.179> get<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.389> see
