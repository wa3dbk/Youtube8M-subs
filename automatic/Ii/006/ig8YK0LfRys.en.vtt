which is just over losing two pounds per
week<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:28.000> that<00:01:28.509> level<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:29.140> caloric<00:01:29.500> deficit

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
week so that level of caloric deficit

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.130 
week so that level of caloric deficit
required<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:31.060> lose<00:01:31.359> that<00:01:31.570> amount<00:01:31.869> of<00:01:31.960> weight

required to lose that amount of weight

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.349

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
if it is indeed all fat and it could be

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:35.969 
if it is indeed all fat and it could be
water<00:01:34.570> weight<00:01:34.750> loss<00:01:34.960> it<00:01:35.170> probably<00:01:35.590> is<00:01:35.710> some

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
water weight loss it probably is some

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.370 
water weight loss it probably is some
water<00:01:36.189> weight<00:01:36.399> loss<00:01:36.579> but<00:01:37.060> let's<00:01:37.270> just<00:01:37.509> say<00:01:37.840> for

water weight loss but let's just say for

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.690 
water weight loss but let's just say for
the<00:01:38.469> sake<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.710> argument<00:01:38.950> that<00:01:39.219> you<00:01:39.340> just<00:01:39.369> lost

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
the sake of argument that you just lost

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.599 
the sake of argument that you just lost
that<00:01:39.909> amount<00:01:40.210> of<00:01:40.329> fat<00:01:40.649> if<00:01:41.649> you<00:01:41.740> lost<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:42.369> much

that amount of fat if you lost that much

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.179 
that amount of fat if you lost that much
fat<00:01:42.789> you'd<00:01:42.939> be<00:01:43.090> running<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.570> 1,000<00:01:44.439> calorie<00:01:44.829> per

fat you'd be running a 1,000 calorie per
day<00:01:45.369> deficit<00:01:46.030> in<00:01:46.210> order<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:46.630> create<00:01:46.899> that

day deficit in order to create that

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.219 
day deficit in order to create that
level<00:01:47.469> of<00:01:47.710> fat<00:01:47.920> loss<00:01:48.100> now<00:01:48.759> that's<00:01:49.570> fine<00:01:49.960> if<00:01:50.200> you

about<00:01:57.189> this<00:01:57.340> for<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.579> moment<00:01:57.729> your<00:01:58.509> body<00:01:58.890> your

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
about this for a moment your body your

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.770 
about this for a moment your body your
your<00:02:00.159> body<00:02:00.369> is<00:02:00.700> so<00:02:00.939> starved<00:02:01.329> for<00:02:01.359> energy<00:02:01.749> that

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
your body is so starved for energy that

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.899 
your body is so starved for energy that
it's<00:02:01.990> breaking<00:02:02.530> down<00:02:02.560> two<00:02:03.219> pounds<00:02:03.609> of<00:02:03.700> fat

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
it's breaking down two pounds of fat

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.050 
it's breaking down two pounds of fat
every<00:02:04.899> week<00:02:05.079> just<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.590> fuel<00:02:05.890> itself<00:02:06.189> so<00:02:06.490> do<00:02:06.969> you

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
every week just to fuel itself so do you

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.580 
every week just to fuel itself so do you
really<00:02:07.329> think<00:02:07.569> it's<00:02:07.749> going<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.080> have<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.319> lot<00:02:08.560> of

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
really think it's going to have a lot of

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.059 
really think it's going to have a lot of
energy<00:02:08.890> left<00:02:09.399> over<00:02:09.670> just<00:02:10.540> to<00:02:10.630> make<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.930> Randy

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
energy left over just to make you Randy

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.459 
energy left over just to make you Randy
no<00:02:12.730> my<00:02:12.999> guess<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.599> it's<00:02:13.749> not<00:02:14.049> going<00:02:14.319> to

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:14.469 
no my guess is that it's not going to

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.339 
no my guess is that it's not going to
have<00:02:14.620> any<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.609> if<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.659> my<00:02:17.049> first

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
have any so if you my first

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.140 
have any so if you my first
recommendation<00:02:17.650> one<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.579> two<00:02:18.730> things<00:02:18.939> you

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
recommendation one of the two things you

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.330 
recommendation one of the two things you
can<00:02:19.269> try<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.540> stop<00:02:20.200> running<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.680> large<00:02:20.859> color<00:02:21.159> of

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
can try is stop running a large color of

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.250 
can try is stop running a large color of
deficit<00:02:21.760> if<00:02:21.879> you<00:02:22.030> indeed<00:02:22.329> are<00:02:22.629> and<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.959> assume

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
deficit if you indeed are and I assume

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.569 
deficit if you indeed are and I assume
you're<00:02:23.530> at<00:02:23.859> least<00:02:24.069> some<00:02:24.519> significant<00:02:25.469> calorie

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
you're at least some significant calorie

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.830 
you're at least some significant calorie
deficit<00:02:27.579> so<00:02:27.760> try<00:02:28.150> eating<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.629> weight

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
deficit so try eating a weight

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.020 
deficit so try eating a weight
maintenance<00:02:29.349> level<00:02:29.769> of<00:02:29.859> calories<00:02:30.280> for<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> few

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
maintenance level of calories for a few

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.059 
maintenance level of calories for a few
days<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.480> see<00:02:31.719> if<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:32.019> helps<00:02:32.379> aside<00:02:32.680> from

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
days and see if that helps aside from

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.089 
days and see if that helps aside from
the<00:02:33.310> caloric<00:02:33.819> issue<00:02:33.969> I<00:02:34.329> think<00:02:35.109> that<00:02:35.620> the

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
the caloric issue I think that the

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.099 
the caloric issue I think that the
majority<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.639> people<00:02:36.790> have<00:02:37.060> been<00:02:37.269> on<00:02:37.420> raw<00:02:37.870> food

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
majority of people have been on raw food

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.479 
majority of people have been on raw food
diets<00:02:38.469> for<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.680> long<00:02:38.829> time<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.280> who<00:02:39.370> are

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
diets for a long time and who are

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.550

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
maintaining their body fat levels are

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.159 
maintaining their body fat levels are
not<00:02:41.799> actively<00:02:42.459> losing<00:02:42.639> weight<00:02:42.999> are<00:02:43.749> going<00:02:44.079> to

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:44.169 
not actively losing weight are going to

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:46.800 
not actively losing weight are going to
have<00:02:44.379> the<00:02:44.980> issue<00:02:45.159> be<00:02:45.519> tied<00:02:45.760> down<00:02:45.939> to<00:02:46.000> fat

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
have the issue be tied down to fat

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.259 
have the issue be tied down to fat
intake<00:02:47.340> now<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:49.949> myself<00:02:50.949> when<00:02:51.579> it<00:02:51.639> comes<00:02:51.879> to<00:02:52.090> fat

I<00:05:04.300> have<00:05:04.840> worked<00:05:05.530> with<00:05:05.620> several<00:05:06.070> people<00:05:06.460> who

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
I have worked with several people who

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.320 
I have worked with several people who
have<00:05:06.820> told<00:05:07.000> me<00:05:07.150> that<00:05:07.270> their<00:05:08.880> libido<00:05:09.880> doesn't

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
have told me that their libido doesn't

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.969 
have told me that their libido doesn't
kick<00:05:10.479> in<00:05:10.509> until<00:05:10.750> they're<00:05:11.080> eating<00:05:11.349> about<00:05:11.440> 15%

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
kick in until they're eating about 15%

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.810 
kick in until they're eating about 15%
fat<00:05:12.520> or<00:05:12.729> 13<00:05:13.389> to<00:05:13.479> 15%<00:05:13.810> fat<00:05:14.320> range<00:05:14.590> and<00:05:14.949> I<00:05:15.220> see<00:05:15.669> no

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
fat or 13 to 15% fat range and I see no

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.270 
fat or 13 to 15% fat range and I see no
reason<00:05:16.090> why<00:05:16.300> they<00:05:16.780> shouldn't<00:05:17.169> do<00:05:17.409> it

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
reason why they shouldn't do it

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.520 
reason why they shouldn't do it
yeah<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:19.030> mean<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:19.479> certainly<00:05:19.720> would<00:05:20.110> if<00:05:20.259> it<00:05:20.409> was

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
yeah I mean I certainly would if it was

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.830 
yeah I mean I certainly would if it was
an<00:05:20.620> issue<00:05:20.740> for<00:05:21.009> me<00:05:21.190> personally<00:05:21.909> I<00:05:22.180> eat<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:22.330> less

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
an issue for me personally I eat a less

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.469 
an issue for me personally I eat a less
than<00:05:22.990> 10%<00:05:23.169> fat<00:05:23.710> but<00:05:24.009> I<00:05:24.370> don't<00:05:25.030> think<00:05:25.180> it's<00:05:25.270> all

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
than 10% fat but I don't think it's all

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.600 
than 10% fat but I don't think it's all
that<00:05:25.750> important<00:05:26.370> we're<00:05:27.370> primarily

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
that important we're primarily

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.339 
that important we're primarily
interested<00:05:28.030> in<00:05:30.780> regulating<00:05:31.780> blood<00:05:31.960> sugar

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
interested in regulating blood sugar

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.219 
interested in regulating blood sugar
intake<00:05:32.949> because<00:05:33.159> fat<00:05:33.909> generally<00:05:34.509> impedes<00:05:35.050> the

sugar<00:05:40.570> issues<00:05:40.720> so<00:05:41.469> that's<00:05:42.009> particularly

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
sugar issues so that's particularly

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.209 
sugar issues so that's particularly
because<00:05:42.849> we're<00:05:43.120> eating<00:05:43.479> a<00:05:43.750> fruit<00:05:44.620> based<00:05:44.860> sugar

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:45.219 
because we're eating a fruit based sugar

because we're eating a fruit based sugar
based<00:05:45.430> diet<00:05:45.699> we<00:05:45.940> don't<00:05:46.150> want<00:05:46.389> to<00:05:46.539> gum<00:05:47.380> up<00:05:47.409> the

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.620 
based diet we don't want to gum up the
works<00:05:47.680> with<00:05:48.099> fat<00:05:48.340> because<00:05:48.669> it's<00:05:48.820> gonna<00:05:48.969> cause

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
works with fat because it's gonna cause

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.469 
works with fat because it's gonna cause
us<00:05:49.870> problems<00:05:50.020> so<00:05:50.919> it's<00:05:51.729> important<00:05:52.300> to<00:05:52.360> keep

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
us problems so it's important to keep

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.089 
us problems so it's important to keep
that<00:05:52.659> in<00:05:52.719> mind<00:05:53.020> but<00:05:53.199> it's<00:05:53.380> also<00:05:53.530> important<00:05:54.039> not

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
that in mind but it's also important not

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.490 
that in mind but it's also important not
to<00:05:54.219> go<00:05:54.430> too<00:05:54.520> crazy<00:05:54.699> and<00:05:55.240> just<00:05:55.900> try<00:05:56.050> to<00:05:56.110> cut<00:05:56.380> out

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
to go too crazy and just try to cut out

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.990 
to go too crazy and just try to cut out
all<00:05:56.680> the<00:05:56.830> fat<00:05:56.860> because<00:05:57.280> there<00:05:57.430> really<00:05:57.460> isn't

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
all the fat because there really isn't

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.180 
all the fat because there really isn't
any<00:05:58.389> good<00:05:58.870> sign<00:05:59.139> saying<00:05:59.409> that<00:05:59.590> that<00:05:59.800> will<00:06:00.009> be

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
any good sign saying that that will be

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.719 
any good sign saying that that will be
highly<00:06:00.699> beneficial<00:06:00.729> now<00:06:01.719> I<00:06:02.190> personally<00:06:03.190> find

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
highly beneficial now I personally find

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.550 
highly beneficial now I personally find
that<00:06:03.789> my<00:06:03.969> athletic<00:06:04.360> performance<00:06:05.020> is<00:06:05.259> better

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
that my athletic performance is better

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.330 
that my athletic performance is better
when<00:06:06.340> I<00:06:06.370> am<00:06:06.789> eating<00:06:07.090> no<00:06:07.419> overt<00:06:07.870> fats<00:06:08.340> but

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
when I am eating no overt fats but

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.610 
when I am eating no overt fats but
generally<00:06:09.909> in<00:06:10.090> other<00:06:10.300> regards<00:06:10.900> I<00:06:11.050> think<00:06:11.320> that

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
generally in other regards I think that

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.890 
generally in other regards I think that
having<00:06:12.580> a<00:06:12.610> little<00:06:12.699> fat<00:06:13.030> in<00:06:13.060> my<00:06:13.270> diet<00:06:13.300> is

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
having a little fat in my diet is

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.260 
having a little fat in my diet is
besides<00:06:14.770> keeping<00:06:15.340> my<00:06:15.460> sex<00:06:15.699> drive<00:06:15.880> around

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
besides keeping my sex drive around

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.499 
besides keeping my sex drive around
which<00:06:16.509> I'm<00:06:17.020> a<00:06:17.080> big<00:06:17.110> fan<00:06:17.469> of<00:06:17.669> it<00:06:18.669> leaves<00:06:19.330> me

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:19.509 
which I'm a big fan of it leaves me

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:21.779 
which I'm a big fan of it leaves me
feeling<00:06:19.690> better<00:06:19.990> so<00:06:20.349> personally<00:06:21.310> I<00:06:21.370> would<00:06:21.610> say

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
feeling better so personally I would say

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.640 
feeling better so personally I would say
add<00:06:22.060> in<00:06:22.330> the<00:06:22.509> little<00:06:22.719> fat<00:06:22.930> and<00:06:23.199> see<00:06:23.409> how<00:06:23.590> that

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
add in the little fat and see how that

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.459 
add in the little fat and see how that
works<00:06:24.009> for<00:06:24.130> you<00:06:24.310> know<00:06:25.139> just<00:06:26.139> you<00:06:26.349> know

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469 
works for you know just you know

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.439 
works for you know just you know
gradually<00:06:26.919> increase<00:06:27.280> it<00:06:27.310> start<00:06:28.030> off<00:06:28.150> and<00:06:28.330> try

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
gradually increase it start off and try

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.270 
gradually increase it start off and try
to<00:06:28.509> aim<00:06:28.719> for<00:06:28.960> about<00:06:29.020> 10<00:06:29.650> percent<00:06:29.979> of<00:06:30.009> calories

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
to aim for about 10 percent of calories

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.029 
to aim for about 10 percent of calories
from<00:06:31.270> fat<00:06:31.570> and<00:06:31.810> then<00:06:32.289> if<00:06:32.500> that<00:06:32.650> doesn't<00:06:32.949> work

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
from fat and then if that doesn't work

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.670 
from fat and then if that doesn't work
go<00:06:33.310> all<00:06:33.430> the<00:06:33.520> way<00:06:33.610> up<00:06:33.699> to<00:06:33.820> 15<00:06:34.270> see<00:06:34.570> if<00:06:34.690> that<00:06:34.900> is

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
go all the way up to 15 see if that is

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.740 
go all the way up to 15 see if that is
a<00:06:35.740> solution<00:06:36.340> I<00:06:36.490> think<00:06:36.520> if<00:06:36.880> you<00:06:37.150> both<00:06:37.539> the

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
a solution I think if you both the

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.469 
a solution I think if you both the
caloric<00:06:38.470> solution<00:06:39.460> of<00:06:39.610> not<00:06:39.850> running<00:06:40.030> calorie

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 
caloric solution of not running calorie

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:43.020 
caloric solution of not running calorie
deficit<00:06:40.930> and<00:06:41.169> the<00:06:41.440> fat<00:06:42.070> solution<00:06:42.520> of<00:06:42.639> eating<00:06:43.000> a

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
deficit and the fat solution of eating a

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.050 
deficit and the fat solution of eating a
little<00:06:43.270> more<00:06:43.419> fat<00:06:43.690> can<00:06:44.590> play<00:06:44.830> into<00:06:45.340> this<00:06:45.639> and

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
little more fat can play into this and

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.240 
little more fat can play into this and
if<00:06:46.660> you<00:06:46.900> if<00:06:47.139> you<00:06:47.259> kind<00:06:47.470> of<00:06:47.500> tackle<00:06:47.860> both<00:06:48.039> those

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
if you if you kind of tackle both those

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.300 
if you if you kind of tackle both those
at<00:06:48.400> the<00:06:48.520> same<00:06:48.699> time<00:06:48.970> you'll<00:06:49.600> I<00:06:49.900> think<00:06:50.350> 85<00:06:51.130> to

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
at the same time you'll I think 85 to

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.920 
at the same time you'll I think 85 to
90%<00:06:51.580> of<00:06:51.880> the<00:06:51.970> people<00:06:52.210> who<00:06:52.330> have<00:06:52.419> problems<00:06:52.690> with

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
90% of the people who have problems with

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.110 
90% of the people who have problems with
their<00:06:53.229> sex<00:06:53.590> drives<00:06:53.860> will<00:06:54.190> no<00:06:54.639> longer<00:06:54.880> have<00:06:55.060> any

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
their sex drives will no longer have any

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.780 
their sex drives will no longer have any
problems
