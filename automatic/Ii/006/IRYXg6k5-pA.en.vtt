 in this case, however, this light 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.700
 the new that seems to me already going 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:15.210
 better than ours we are saying i 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:21.529
 components for a wasp that could 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:25.590
 being useful in this case is the candle 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.619
 a plastic candle holder and knots that 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.720
 because neither because otherwise the cardboard 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.270
 you can see that you in all four 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:40.649
 over time, thaci paintings 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:45.500

 well other things that you could be 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:58.079
 useful are the network disc injured parts 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.379
 in my opinion it is of no use but it was 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.619
 therefore already said then stages and therefore 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.470
 anything 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.680
 these things are the documents that 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:16.860
 oil and these things are important here 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.770

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:25.220
 not made gasoline are bitter cocks a 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.220

 walk so always remember to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:45.950
 get gas to make my 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:49.490
 the right mixture and be careful 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.380
