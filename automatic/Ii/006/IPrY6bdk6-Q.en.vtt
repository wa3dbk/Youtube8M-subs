00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:12.679
 Christmas Eve was married in Berlin once 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.140
 I will continue to watch this, but the NADA is against us 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.720
 Argentina qualified 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.340
 Handelsblatt s when he countered the 1 1 after a 1 2 defeat 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.769
 Eintracht Frankfurt 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.509
 the special of the mood in the central stadium also this is easy 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.350
 to be with the other people 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.270
 anyone at home expect the mood just do not worry 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.650
 we are completely gone 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.450
 the logistics 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.470
 good and beautiful 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.340
 that already have seven voices set they are just extras have invaded what 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.490
 we will sing it 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.580
 It almost remains like that and everyone must be fast now in any case 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.580
 Germany has voted 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.800
 3 1 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.250
 but stimulating two important second time for Germany 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.250
 2 1 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.240
 HF 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.720
 Hermann on request 1 &amp; 1 farmer Heinz MÃ¼ller against Argentina 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.180
 not always being the question but we are annoying ourselves we keep 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.200
 it's an ass 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.850
 a truck is parked and all three are still being picked up 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.290
 in children would have to close 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.290
 I think there will be a single evening 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.750
 Dr 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.850
 that's another question 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.879
 a fourth variant is therefore not always more market share 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.680
 how does my apple alone learn a way of using it and then 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.369
 mostly in an internet exchange 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.609
 the percent 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.689
 that's great 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.989
 has been expected 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.839
 12 percent 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:26.650
