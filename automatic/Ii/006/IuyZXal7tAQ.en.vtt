pretty much got the lift gate up there

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.560 
pretty much got the lift gate up there
and<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:52.320> use<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.070> basically<00:01:53.579> goes<00:01:54.119> up<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and we use that it basically goes up and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.080 
and we use that it basically goes up and
down<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> guys<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.590> load<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.520> sleds<00:01:56.850> up

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090
