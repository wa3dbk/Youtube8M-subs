00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.960 
real accent if I if I I just got an
email<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:24.350> have<00:02:24.860> received<00:02:25.400> an<00:02:25.520> email<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:25.940> the

phone<00:02:27.190> no<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:29.170> know<00:02:30.170> since<00:02:30.920> oh<00:02:32.650> my<00:02:33.650> first<00:02:33.920> the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
phone no I know since oh my first the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.460 
phone no I know since oh my first the
first<00:02:34.490> language<00:02:35.000> that<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.420> other<00:02:35.750> spoke<00:02:36.140> was

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
first language that the other spoke was

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.380 
first language that the other spoke was
English<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.280> guess<00:02:37.610> that's<00:02:37.880> why<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.150> don't
