00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.380
Kengo-san, I'd like to do the game today.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.989
You can control this.

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.169
This is the camera.
You can see on visual by iPhone.

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.170
I'll write the word.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.080
Behind the car. Here.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.710
You should try to read by AR Drone.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.630
I'd try to read the word to written on here.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.200
I'd write the simple word.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.180
I wrote the simple word on behind the car.
Could you try to read by AR Drone!

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.720
The AR Drone Challenge!

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.159
Connect by WiFi.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.760
We can use the camera.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.689
Sounds good, Kengo-san.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.210
Let try.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.080
Take off.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.700
Good good, better move.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.840
Let do slowly.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.450
Do again from start.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.440
You should control by to look the helicopter until here.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.150
From here by to use camera.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.120
Crash! The drone has upset.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.649
No broken. The tough helicopter AR Drone.

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.099
Flying too far.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.299
Look the helicopter.

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.349
It's difficult to control from there.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.469
From beside the car.

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:32.609
It's better. Easy to control, I guess so.

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:41.809
Where you go?

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:43.569
Come back.

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.029
Come back here.

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:49.729
Is the camera still rolling?

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:55.759
Can you see your face?

00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:00.349
Calm down. You can do this.

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.699
Rise up the first.

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.879
The helicopter can stay at there
if you release control.

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.709
You know? Come back here.

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.739
Come back here again.

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.289
Where are go?

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:20.019
Can you back to here?

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.359
It's reverse.

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:26.839
Where?

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:31.589
I got it.

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:35.149
Here here. Coming here.

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:41.589
You got it?

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:50.529
You release the control
then the helicopter be hovering.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.169
Slowly slowly...Kengo-san.

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.729
Come back.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.759
Crush..Crush...

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:07.790
Your body is moving. Your hand not move.
You couldn't to control.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.349
Where is?

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.349
On the tree.

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.090
Good good rise up...

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.669
Slowly...turn turn.

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.099
Reverse! Not that direction.

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.150
Okay so close.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.520
Turn head and move there.
Easy easy...

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.749
Good good...

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:48.279
No! Come here? Not here.
Dangerous.

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:51.849
Kengo-san!

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.099
What you doing?

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.949
Slowly rise up.

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.169
Okay that's enough.

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.360
Good good...

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.729
Turn turn...

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.569
Oh pretty good!

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.969
Do slide the helicopter.

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.490
Do slide.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.249
Moved to different direction.

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:16.860
Try again.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.740
You can do?

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.389
It's reverse! Kengo-san.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.629
Why did that?

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.219
First rise up...

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.279
You move the body.
Oh close close!

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:34.539
So close.

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.189
Can you see that?

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:44.399

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:45.939

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.789

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.789
Wow you did it.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.650
The word is "DOG".
