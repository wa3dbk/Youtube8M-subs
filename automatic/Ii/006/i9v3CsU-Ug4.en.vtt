00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:11.160
 Hank it easy or easy 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.259
 throw anchor into the water and you're done 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.120
 let's face it, many a skipper is with us 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.320
 the iron his anchor box in intimate 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.570
 connected with hate love 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.050
 The relationship could be so harmonious 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.930
 explain in our anchor journal 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.060
 we catch how to do it right 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.010
 So with the anchor types to the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.269
 selection of on can is huge because even 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.750
 we decided the five 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.280
 main anchor types to introduce 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.190
 the professional anchor recognizable by his 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.930
 sweeping three-winged spark features 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.969
 Over a high holding power when he is 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.739
 buried in soft ground for 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.800
 overgrown or stony ground 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.270
 is less suitable 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.190
 the handlebar anchor turns through his 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.260
 Ironing and the train always upright 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.000
 position back so that its 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.010
 single spark can dig in 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.250
 this works best when the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.899
 subsoil consists of sand or beats 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.730
 the air show anchor digs like that 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.309
 name already says like a flight in the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.049
 soft underground 1 1 as a way model 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.250
 that with many slight changes 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.909
 under different product names 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.920
 The plates anchor was marketed 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.659
 originally known as an anchor then 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.850
 and is also for most 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.380
 he was breaking ground 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.509
 a little easier than the flight 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.270
 slimmer for that is the flat and better 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.400
 to stow and as a fifth model 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.040
 we have the club anchor flanking him 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.659
 can edge up against the shank 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.880
 and points are intentionally dull 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.619
 what runs contrary to the flight 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.229
 stated especially on inflatable boats of 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.299
 The advantage is that the anchor is there alone 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.549
 still no guarantee that 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.899
 engagements tuned to the boat and 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.970
 to be in good condition 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.729
 there are three possibilities of 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.770
 Composition a chain bank alone 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.229
 with chains lead or pure anka 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.970
 leiner 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.710
 this applies the more chain on the floor 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.189
 more weight means that the boat 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.600
 better on position holds with chain 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.939
 should be at least 4 times 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.490
 water depth can be plugged out because 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.580
 one and chain sixfold and only 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.470
 when alone ten times if you so 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.620
 a magic has no chain but 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.150
 only unfortunately 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.890
 the normal leash but part of a 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.019
 then you can think about it 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.790
 into a riding weight that will 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.599
 then in front of the construction kit so to speak 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.849
 attached to the leash and that serves 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.400
 to that the leash continues altogether 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.579
 the soil is used and the train 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.360
 angle throw that charged him then 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.920
 A plane becomes a plane with the plane 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.599
 Anchor is not only showing 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.209
 its location but can also the 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.560
 facilitate recovery 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.290
 How do I know if my anchor 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.090
 the right size has a boot 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.160
 With two tons, the main anchor should be 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.220
 weigh at least 10.5 kilos 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.409
 at three tons twelve kilos at 5 tons 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.730
 13 5 kilos and at ten tons 19 kilo 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:00.609
 which anchor do we have today? 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.140
 board as anker crockery we have a 20 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.480
 kilogram heavy thanks to strong specifications 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.890
 book that's so universal anchor that too 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.989
 already this district here well suited 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.310
 and then in addition 40 more 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:14.140
 meter chain in chain box the search 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.519
 after the perfect anchorage begins 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.190
 always with the view in the waters 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.049
 There one learns from the map there 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.030
 Water depth over possible obstacles 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.400
 and marked areas in which of 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.760
 Anchoring is advised against or even where it is 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.650
 is officially prohibited 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.629
 in the turn or RevierfÃ¼hrer one experiences 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.000
 Often with personal experiences with the 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.910
 Ankerplatz and receives helpful tips 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.410
 from the author next you have to 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.720
 Influence of the elements in the back of the head 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.280
 to keep 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.010
 how do wind flow and behave? 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.040
 tide the current weather report with 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.169
 Prediction is therefore absolute duty 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.299
 determine if there is enough space 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.720
 the circles of all ships must be respected 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.150
 become 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.250
 then we can with anchor maneuver 1 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.959
 begin 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.730
 wind or stream is the approach 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.160
 on the targeted anchor 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.699
 The boat will only be directly above the 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.340
 desired position increased anchor 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:12.099
 maneuver 2 of the anchor is slow 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.660
 drained so far the floor touches the 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.329
 Boat drives with stopped machine 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.160
 Eighth out when wind or electricity is not 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.409
 You also have to go back shortly 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.430
 Engage so that it easily rides over 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:26.139
 the stern picks up anchor maneuver 3 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.240
 in the speed with which the 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.740
 boat is moved out of eighth 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.500
 remaining chains or linen length 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.180
 even further unplugged the 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.389
 outstretched chain can be through 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.039
 indicate colored markings 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.990
 if enough dishes on the floor 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.550
 it is secured and the anchor 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.860
 starts to be in the right position too 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.440
 rotate 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.210
 Anker maneuver 4 Now will be again 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.800
 Eighth from coupled the anchor 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.620
 slowly dragging over the ground 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.360
 and starts digging in as soon as the 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.280
 is deep enough and sufficient hold 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.750
 has developed force the boat in 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.550
 the chain a jerk and stand 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.500
 come 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.970
 if the anchor is really solid 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.490
 to be checked at the chain 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.110
 with little wind or electricity she should 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.539
 almost vertical and loose in the 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.460
 deep also lead very beautiful roads 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.110
 you have to have a so-called signal force 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.130
 when we put the other engine 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.620
 also know that we are here and 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.060
 not so easily can and away in 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.210
 this area so as I said the 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.729
 schiffer road 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.979
 is this the so-called convertible of 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.110
 explain as far as form 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.660
 formally black election day gives me that 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.500
 quite good alternative to at night would 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.150
 you then just to switch on the the 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.069
 Anke be recovered to get that 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.460
 dishes by hand or winch as far as one 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:42.009
 until it leads to the ground now 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.970
 The anchor is brought up 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.349
 at the latest when he reaches the surface 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.110
 will come out in which 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.940
 condition he is especially with loamy 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.620
 Reason the anchor should be cleaned 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.830
 The fire was brought on board and stowed away 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.110
 The anchor should not be able to be 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.509
 readily from the loose ground he is 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.870
 either deeply buried or has 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:04.430
 getting caught in an obstacle 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.660
 one possibility is now the 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.060
 anchor break out 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.610
 for that you have to engage in advance and 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.210
 if necessary give short gas if the 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:16.159
 If there is no success, there is a need for emotion 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.900
 An anchor Bowie has brought out 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.830
 try the anchor directly with the trip 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.139
 to leash 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.479
 because the leash is based on the shank and 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.039
 not attached to its end 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.690
 one another point and the 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.690
 spark will be forward under the 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.860
 obstacle 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.479
 You can also leash yourself 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.550
 sling keep the dishes up 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:36.770
 to the anchor is led and likewise 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:41.389
 the bottom of the shaft engages the anchor 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.979
 can be recovered upside down and why 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.050
 actually serves the vortex schickel 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:46.759
 between anchor and chain 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.110
 when the chain is lowered 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.639
 and being fetched, she turns around 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.500
 yourself and by doing this 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.449
 invertebrate Schickel since have built turns 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.819
 the anchor, so to speak, not with so 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:56.900
 do not get more expensive here we have one 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:58.759
 so-called anchor claw 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.840
 another handy tool 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:04.699
 is hinged here camp is and 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.650
 will be a bit short here now 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:08.720
 but usually handlebars then you can 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.330
 Here at the top of the string and prove 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:15.110
 then put pressure on the wish 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.460
 already the mechanics we hope 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.199
 at least that in ours 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.240
 engagement one or two tips 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:21.949
 have experienced the hatred to 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.419
 their anchor proverbially in depth 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:26.090
 connectedness 

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:29.050
 So much success in anchoring and much 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.050
 fun while scrubbing
