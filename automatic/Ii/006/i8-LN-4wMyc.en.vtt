00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
of that edge and as you can see it comes

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.679 
of that edge and as you can see it comes
down<00:02:25.439> because<00:02:25.560> that's<00:02:25.889> the<00:02:26.249> corner<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.480> was

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
down because that's the corner that was

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.660 
down because that's the corner that was
two<00:02:28.079> of<00:02:28.109> the<00:02:28.349> corners<00:02:28.799> so<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.040> sewed<00:02:29.459> it

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
two of the corners so I sewed it

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.270 
two of the corners so I sewed it
together<00:02:29.879> and<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.389> sort<00:02:30.629> of<00:02:30.659> gave<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.900> this

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
together and it sort of gave it this

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.940 
together and it sort of gave it this
tail<00:02:32.280> I've<00:02:33.000> stitched<00:02:33.480> another<00:02:33.959> medallion<00:02:34.829> and

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
received your present or I even thought

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.240 
received your present or I even thought
if<00:04:02.459> you're<00:04:02.699> inclined<00:04:03.299> you<00:04:03.919> could<00:04:04.919> on<00:04:05.040> this

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
if you're inclined you could on this

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.879 
if you're inclined you could on this
stitch<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.359> to<00:04:06.599> a<00:04:06.629> cushion<00:04:07.290> couldn't<00:04:07.739> be

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
stitch that to a cushion couldn't be

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.009 
stitch that to a cushion couldn't be
more<00:04:07.949> or<00:04:08.939> something<00:04:09.389> because<00:04:09.479> it's<00:04:09.719> quite

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
more or something because it's quite

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.890 
more or something because it's quite
pretty<00:04:10.349> but<00:04:10.829> I<00:04:11.819> guess<00:04:12.120> it's<00:04:12.329> up<00:04:12.509> to<00:04:12.539> whoever

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.249 
pretty but I guess it's up to whoever
receives<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.799> what<00:04:13.979> they<00:04:14.129> want<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:14.549> do<00:04:14.699> with<00:04:14.939> it

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:15.259 
receives it what they want to do with it
