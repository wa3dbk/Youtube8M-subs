00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
one of his favorite exercises for

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.950 
one of his favorite exercises for
building<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.380> pecs<00:01:12.730> was<00:01:13.730> the<00:01:14.030> parallel<00:01:14.540> bar

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
building the pecs was the parallel bar

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.390 
building the pecs was the parallel bar
dip<00:01:15.500> but<00:01:16.310> his<00:01:17.500> variation<00:01:18.500> of<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.920> dip<00:01:19.130> is<00:01:19.370> a

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
dip but his variation of the dip is a

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.040 
dip but his variation of the dip is a
little<00:01:19.790> bit<00:01:19.970> different<00:01:20.540> than<00:01:20.630> probably<00:01:20.810> what

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
little bit different than probably what

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.980 
little bit different than probably what
you've<00:01:21.350> done<00:01:21.730> he<00:01:22.730> the<00:01:23.150> wider<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:23.660> could<00:01:23.840> go

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
you've done he the wider you could go

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.490 
you've done he the wider you could go
the<00:01:24.200> better<00:01:24.440> because<00:01:24.650> he<00:01:25.010> dip<00:01:25.700> was<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:27.110> benefit

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
the better because he dip was to benefit

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.920 
the better because he dip was to benefit
the<00:01:27.650> pecs<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.250> benefit<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.760> chest<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:29.570> wider

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
the pecs to benefit the chest so wider

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.750 
the pecs to benefit the chest so wider
he<00:01:30.140> went<00:01:30.410> and<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.800> more<00:01:31.010> you<00:01:31.130> can<00:01:31.280> flare<00:01:31.610> your

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
he went and the more you can flare your

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.690 
he went and the more you can flare your
elbows<00:01:32.180> better<00:01:33.040> he<00:01:34.040> would<00:01:34.220> you're<00:01:34.520> going<00:01:34.640> to

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
elbows better he would you're going to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.670 
elbows better he would you're going to

chin into his chest his legs would stay

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.590 
chin into his chest his legs would stay
straight<00:01:40.130> he<00:01:40.370> would<00:01:40.490> point<00:01:40.760> us<00:01:40.910> toes<00:01:41.240> and

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
straight he would point us toes and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.290 
straight he would point us toes and
almost<00:01:41.900> pull<00:01:42.200> his<00:01:42.440> toes<00:01:42.830> forwards<00:01:43.790> that<00:01:44.090> they

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
almost pull his toes forwards that they

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.430 
almost pull his toes forwards that they
were

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
were

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.740 
were
perfectly<00:01:46.440> below<00:01:46.860> or<00:01:47.220> as<00:01:47.400> head<00:01:47.670> was<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.600> I'm

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
perfectly below or as head was so I'm

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.969 
perfectly below or as head was so I'm
going<00:01:48.870> to<00:01:48.900> go<00:01:48.990> ahead<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.560> several

going to go ahead and do several

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.800 
going to go ahead and do several
repetitions<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.940> you<00:01:51.120> can<00:01:51.390> kind<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.659> get<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
repetitions so you can kind of get a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.930 
repetitions so you can kind of get a
feel<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:52.409> what<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.920> Vince<00:01:53.159> Gironda
