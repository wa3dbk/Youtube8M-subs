00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
have a slightly different suggestion for

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.590 
have a slightly different suggestion for
that<00:04:44.680> well<00:04:45.010> our<00:04:45.670> theory<00:04:45.910> is<00:04:46.090> that<00:04:46.120> paper

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
that well our theory is that paper

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.500 
that well our theory is that paper
flowers<00:04:47.290> last<00:04:47.890> longer<00:04:48.400> than<00:04:48.430> natural<00:04:48.820> flowers
