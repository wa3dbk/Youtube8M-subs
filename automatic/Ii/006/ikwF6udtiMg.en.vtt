and<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.960> don't<00:01:52.140> drive<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.710> that's<00:01:53.280> what<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.460> think

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
and I don't drive so that's what I think

and I don't drive so that's what I think
is<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> really<00:01:54.090> good<00:01:54.210> solution<00:01:54.329> for<00:01:54.750> me<00:01:54.869> because

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
is a really good solution for me because

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.709 
is a really good solution for me because
you<00:01:55.950> don't<00:01:56.009> even<00:01:56.250> need<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.579> motorcycle<00:01:57.390> license

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
you don't even need a motorcycle license

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.109 
you don't even need a motorcycle license
for<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.049> because<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.500> only<00:01:58.619> 50<00:01:58.920> cc's<00:01:59.280> so<00:02:00.060> I'm

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
for it because it's only 50 cc's so I'm

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.880 
for it because it's only 50 cc's so I'm
planning<00:02:00.329> I'm<00:02:00.570> going<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:01.020> one<00:02:01.140> should<00:02:01.829> I
