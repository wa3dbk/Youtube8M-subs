a<00:03:20.169> little<00:03:20.500> bit<00:03:20.620> more<00:03:20.769> strength<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:21.370> feel<00:03:21.519> that

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
a little bit more strength I feel that

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.699 
a little bit more strength I feel that
he's<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.760> much<00:03:22.000> better<00:03:22.209> shooter<00:03:22.630> he<00:03:23.230> has<00:03:23.349> forced

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
of good things that are convenient as a

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.940 
of good things that are convenient as a
striker<00:03:28.239> but<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.540> want<00:03:28.870> Walcott<00:03:29.349> to<00:03:29.560> be<00:03:29.709> very

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
striker but I want Walcott to be very

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.349

heavily<00:03:30.220> involved<00:03:30.579> in<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.819> attack<00:03:31.150> and

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
heavily involved in the attack and

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.629 
heavily involved in the attack and
sometimes<00:03:32.049> if<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:32.620> use<00:03:32.829> them<00:03:33.010> as<00:03:33.160> an<00:03:33.310> outside

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
sometimes if I use them as an outside

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.009 
sometimes if I use them as an outside
midfielder<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.209> don't<00:03:34.510> feel<00:03:34.660> like<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:34.870> get

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
enough out of them and that's why it's

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.339 
enough out of them and that's why it's
okay<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.480> play<00:03:37.599> them<00:03:37.750> as<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:37.840> winger<00:03:38.169> because

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
okay to play them as a winger because

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.690 
okay to play them as a winger because
now<00:03:38.470> we<00:03:38.530> can<00:03:38.590> attack<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.099> can<00:03:39.250> do<00:03:39.340> threw<00:03:39.549> balls

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
there's a couple different options you

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.430

his<00:03:59.590> 4<00:03:59.799> stars<00:04:00.069> skill<00:04:00.129> moves<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.669> I<00:04:00.700> think<00:04:00.849> he's

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
his 4 stars skill moves and I think he's

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.280 
his 4 stars skill moves and I think he's
really<00:04:01.090> good<00:04:01.269> at<00:04:01.329> providing<00:04:01.599> and<00:04:01.900> he<00:04:01.959> seems<00:04:02.230> to

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
really good at providing and he seems to

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.830 
really good at providing and he seems to
dribble<00:04:02.590> inside<00:04:03.010> he's<00:04:03.190> not<00:04:03.340> as<00:04:03.459> quick<00:04:03.639> as<00:04:03.910> some

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
dribble inside he's not as quick as some

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.720 
dribble inside he's not as quick as some
of<00:04:04.930> your<00:04:04.989> other<00:04:05.109> options<00:04:05.230> but<00:04:05.980> I<00:04:06.010> felt<00:04:06.609> like

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
of your other options but I felt like

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.129 
of your other options but I felt like
it's<00:04:06.879> a<00:04:06.910> pretty<00:04:07.060> good<00:04:07.150> position<00:04:07.660> for<00:04:07.870> him

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
it's a pretty good position for him

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.170
