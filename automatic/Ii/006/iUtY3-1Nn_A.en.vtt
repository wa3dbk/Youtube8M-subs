tower<00:00:22.560> case<00:00:22.710> today<00:00:23.250> we're<00:00:23.430> looking<00:00:23.519> at<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
tower case today we're looking at the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.820 
tower case today we're looking at the
black<00:00:24.330> one<00:00:24.570> specifically<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> nice

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
black one specifically with a nice

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.070 
black one specifically with a nice
brushed<00:00:26.279> metallic<00:00:26.490> look<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:27.660> are<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
brushed metallic look here are the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.650 
brushed metallic look here are the
dimensions<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.429> an<00:00:29.670> aluminum<00:00:30.179> case<00:00:30.390> by

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
dimensions this is an aluminum case by

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.659 
dimensions this is an aluminum case by
the<00:00:30.720> way<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.260> very<00:00:31.410> lightweight<00:00:31.710> no<00:00:32.489> more

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the way so it's very lightweight no more

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.810 
the way so it's very lightweight no more
than<00:00:32.850> six<00:00:33.120> kilograms<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.340> it's<00:00:35.340> all<00:00:35.579> aluminum

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
than six kilograms and it's all aluminum

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.090 
than six kilograms and it's all aluminum
maybe<00:00:36.450> some<00:00:36.690> parts<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.140> there<00:00:37.320> are<00:00:37.500> plastic

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
maybe some parts in there are plastic

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.420 
maybe some parts in there are plastic
but<00:00:38.280> that's<00:00:38.940> high<00:00:39.180> quality<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.750> construction

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
but that's high quality and construction

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.240 
but that's high quality and construction
durable<00:00:41.430> there<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> two<00:00:42.510> front<00:00:43.290> 120

over<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> place<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:50.070> Lee<00:00:50.309> stands<00:00:50.700> for

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
over the place then Lee stands for

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.540 
over the place then Lee stands for
quality<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:52.440> shows<00:00:52.739> they're<00:00:53.340> not

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
quality and it shows they're not

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.029 
quality and it shows they're not
necessarily<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> cheapest<00:00:54.840> cases<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.739> the

necessarily the cheapest cases on the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.549 
necessarily the cheapest cases on the
market<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.719> this<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.899> another<00:00:58.109> reason<00:00:58.320> why

vibration washers that it comes with and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.580 
vibration washers that it comes with and
I've<00:01:41.549> already<00:01:41.820> installed<00:01:42.119> three<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.810> them<00:01:42.930> so

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
I've already installed three of them so

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.249 
I've already installed three of them so
here's<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.100> fourth<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:45.180> attach<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:45.990> in

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
here's the fourth just attach it in

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.469 
here's the fourth just attach it in
there

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
there

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.990 
there
and<00:01:48.020> then<00:01:48.200> just<00:01:48.409> slide<00:01:48.619> it<00:01:48.770> into<00:01:48.920> place<00:01:49.130> okay

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
and then just slide it into place okay

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.600 
and then just slide it into place okay
and<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:51.170> is<00:01:51.229> very<00:01:51.560> efficient<00:01:52.039> it<00:01:52.130> works<00:01:52.310> very

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
and this is very efficient it works very

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.700 
and this is very efficient it works very
well<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:52.909> it's<00:01:53.299> super<00:01:53.719> quiet<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.409> only<00:01:54.560> thing

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
well and it's super quiet the only thing

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.319 
well and it's super quiet the only thing
I<00:01:54.770> didn't<00:01:54.950> like<00:01:55.009> about<00:01:55.130> this<00:01:55.520> is<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:56.210> the

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
I didn't like about this is that the

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.749 
I didn't like about this is that the
drive<00:01:56.509> actually<00:01:56.719> faces<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:57.560> wrong<00:01:57.740> way<00:01:58.009> to<00:01:58.579> me
