00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.819
 well let's see the tuning of the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.919
 huasteca jarana that is this is very 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.030
 different to jarana jarocha as well 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.670
 you know now, I'm interested in getting them down 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.060
 an app that is precisely what we're going 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.800
 to use to fine tune between it and the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.400
 guitar let's fine tune our desire 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.630
 this is the app I hope you see it 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.179
 llama is this is called that tuner of 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.310
 all the way there I leave them in the down 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.070
 of good information then the 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.140
 we open and this is the one we're going to 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.110
 use to fine-tune our instrument 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.470
 it serves them for any instrument like that 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.230
 that we are going to fine tune our jarana because 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.510
 are five strings the channel is tuned 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.780
 in thirds we start from the sun 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.680
 and we will take reference to the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.620
 third guitar string 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.860
 that is the sun for our fifth string 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:05.070
 sun sun I'm going to help with my 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:09.630
 tuner is very easy to use then 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.010
 down here are ok there is already what 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.200
 I had tuned before to do it more 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.110
 fast when it turns green is that already 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:22.590
 the following string is fine tuned if 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.690
 the second string of the guitar 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.360
 fourth rope 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:34.240
 there is ok then third string 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.270
 second are the fifth and fourth 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.729
 good for the next what we're going to 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.640
 to do is a king that is in the second 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.640
 guitar string third fret king 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.150
 He is the king 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:55.340
 third face rope 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.750
 and the next string is a sharp F 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.820
 F sharp second fret of the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.000
 first guitar string fa 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.000
 sustained 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.710
 helped me with my application to see what 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.710
 pass 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.060
 and the next one is a fifth 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.120
 fret of the first string of the 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.120
 guitar 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.620
 the 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:27.380
 that's the first rope of the jarana ok 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:32.700
 now another very easy way is to remember 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:37.250
 of this 4343 as we apply it 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.250
 I have my sun I the ends 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:47.069
 ok I'm going to the bottom to fine tune the one 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:49.219
 follow the layer of the strings working 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.219
 a little 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.530
 3 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:03.230
 came back 4 came back 3 is coming down a bit 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:07.960
 4 343 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:13.000
 3 4 3 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:16.800
 and it's ready, remember, it's sun 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.800
 his third alone yes 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:24.270
 if they are re thirds re my fa fa 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.970
 held in this case the second string 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.370
 of sharp 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.940
 fa 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.940
 Sun 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.520
 and ready
