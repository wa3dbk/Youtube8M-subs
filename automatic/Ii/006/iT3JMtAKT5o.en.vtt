00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 The single braided edge of the braid stands out in three dimensions. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 A slightly unique hair accent. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Take the hair bundle from the surface of the hair and divide it into 3 pieces to make a braid. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 I always pick up the hair for knitting from under the hair bundle at one end. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 This time on the face side. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Align the hair with the hair on the face side and let it cross with the central hair tress. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 When crossing the hair bundle on the face side, always spread the braided hair from below. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Align the broad hair with the hair bundle on the face side and cross it to the center hair bundle. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 The hair bundle on the back side does not spread the hair, and it crosses the hair bundle at the center as it is. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 The hair below is spread only when crossing the hair bundle on the face side. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Align the hair with the hair on the face side and let it cross with the central hair tress. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 The hair bundle on the back side is just cross. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 The edge of the back is gradually rising. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 We will weave the hair on the face side along the growth and leave the back side in the same braid. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 From the foot to the other side, we will extend and weave the hair on one side as well. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 While the stitches are familiar to the hair, it is a unique braid that the edge of one side rises in three dimensions. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 It is a hairstyle that can be accented while keeping her hair compact.
