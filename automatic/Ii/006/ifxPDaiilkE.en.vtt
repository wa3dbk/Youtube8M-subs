with<00:03:29.480> iPhones<00:03:29.960> everybody<00:03:30.620> in<00:03:30.680> perspective

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
with iPhones everybody in perspective

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.650 
with iPhones everybody in perspective
the<00:03:31.460> iPhone<00:03:31.850> 5<00:03:32.240> had<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.510> 1440<00:03:33.440> milliamp<00:03:33.800> battery

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
the iPhone 5 had a 1440 milliamp battery

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.020 
the iPhone 5 had a 1440 milliamp battery
the<00:03:35.660> galaxy<00:03:36.260> s4<00:03:36.530> headed<00:03:36.860> 2600<00:03:37.820> milliamp

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
the galaxy s4 headed 2600 milliamp

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.390 
the galaxy s4 headed 2600 milliamp
battery<00:03:38.480> so<00:03:39.290> over<00:03:39.500> a<00:03:39.530> thousand<00:03:40.100> milliamp

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
battery so over a thousand milliamp

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.350 
battery so over a thousand milliamp
smore<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.810> galaxy<00:03:42.290> s3<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:43.370> old<00:03:43.670> generation

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
smore the galaxy s3 the old generation

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.990 
smore the galaxy s3 the old generation
had<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.570> 2100<00:03:45.380> milliamp<00:03:45.710> battery<00:03:45.770> and<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.580> HTC

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
had a 2100 milliamp battery and the HTC

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.890 
had a 2100 milliamp battery and the HTC
One<00:03:47.390> has<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.950> 2,300<00:03:48.950> milliamp<00:03:49.370> battery<00:03:49.810> in<00:03:50.810> the

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
One has a 2,300 milliamp battery in the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.680 
One has a 2,300 milliamp battery in the
end<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.140> iPhone<00:03:51.440> 5<00:03:51.650> had<00:03:51.860> 1440<00:03:52.760> so<00:03:53.210> a<00:03:53.240> pretty

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
end the iPhone 5 had 1440 so a pretty

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.180 
end the iPhone 5 had 1440 so a pretty
small<00:03:53.960> battery<00:03:54.350> but<00:03:54.500> that's<00:03:54.680> also<00:03:54.830> because<00:03:54.950> of

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
small battery but that's also because of

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.500 
small battery but that's also because of
the<00:03:55.280> small<00:03:55.700> form-factor

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
the small form-factor

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.060 
the small form-factor
battery<00:03:56.990> life<00:03:57.140> definitely<00:03:57.380> should<00:03:57.920> be

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
battery life definitely should be

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.600 
battery life definitely should be
improved<00:03:58.580> with<00:03:59.240> the<00:03:59.270> 5s<00:03:59.890> hopefully<00:04:00.890> again

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
improved with the 5s hopefully again

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.920 
improved with the 5s hopefully again
that's<00:04:01.970> one<00:04:02.150> of<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.300> problems<00:04:02.510> with<00:04:02.780> the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
that's one of the problems with the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.150 
that's one of the problems with the
battery<00:04:03.170> life's<00:04:03.410> never<00:04:03.530> been<00:04:03.680> particularly

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
battery life's never been particularly

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.050 
battery life's never been particularly
spectacular

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
spectacular

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.720 
spectacular
number<00:04:05.720> two<00:04:05.840> would<00:04:05.960> be<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.140> screen<00:04:06.500> now<00:04:07.310> Apple

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
number two would be the screen now Apple

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.360 
number two would be the screen now Apple
right<00:04:07.850> now<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.060> 5s<00:04:08.600> with<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:08.870> 4-inch<00:04:09.350> 11<00:04:09.800> 36<00:04:10.160> by

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
right now the 5s with a 4-inch 11 36 by

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.060 
right now the 5s with a 4-inch 11 36 by
640<00:04:11.030> resolution<00:04:11.060> screen<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.050> is<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.650> same<00:04:12.860> as

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
640 resolution screen and is the same as

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.520 
640 resolution screen and is the same as
the<00:04:13.340> iPhone<00:04:13.370> 5<00:04:14.150> now<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:14.900> put<00:04:15.290> that<00:04:15.320> in

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
the iPhone 5 now to put that in

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.050 
the iPhone 5 now to put that in
perspective<00:04:15.680> it<00:04:16.220> is<00:04:16.370> still<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.580> very<00:04:16.880> nice

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
perspective it is still a very nice

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.990 
perspective it is still a very nice
phone<00:04:17.420> however<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.200> iPhone<00:04:18.710> 4<00:04:19.130> still<00:04:19.580> has<00:04:19.760> the

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
phone however the iPhone 4 still has the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.320 
phone however the iPhone 4 still has the
same<00:04:20.390> resolution<00:04:20.660> of<00:04:21.200> 326<00:04:21.979> pixels<00:04:22.550> per<00:04:22.910> inch

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
same resolution of 326 pixels per inch

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.900 
same resolution of 326 pixels per inch
so<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:24.200> means<00:04:24.380> a<00:04:24.560> phone<00:04:24.830> from<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.280> few<00:04:25.669> years

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
so that means a phone from a few years

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.890 
so that means a phone from a few years
ago<00:04:26.060> has<00:04:26.540> a

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
ago has a

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.840 
ago has a
same<00:04:27.020> screen<00:04:27.350> resolution<00:04:27.860> as<00:04:27.979> a<00:04:28.040> new<00:04:28.520> iPhone

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
same screen resolution as a new iPhone

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.650 
same screen resolution as a new iPhone
5s<00:04:29.090> iPhone<00:04:29.750> 5<00:04:30.290> 4s<00:04:30.919> in<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.250> iPhone<00:04:31.550> 4<00:04:31.970> so<00:04:32.570> that

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
5s iPhone 5 4s in the iPhone 4 so that

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.749 
5s iPhone 5 4s in the iPhone 4 so that
means<00:04:32.870> Apple<00:04:33.050> has<00:04:33.290> not<00:04:33.500> improved<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.160> quality

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
means Apple has not improved the quality

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.700 
means Apple has not improved the quality
itself<00:04:35.570> they<00:04:35.960> have<00:04:36.080> improved<00:04:36.410> some<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:36.650> the

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
itself they have improved some of the

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.469 
itself they have improved some of the
colors<00:04:37.039> stuff<00:04:37.340> like<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.669> and<00:04:37.910> side<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.389> the

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
colors stuff like that and side of the

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.300 
colors stuff like that and side of the
screen<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:39.080> resolution<00:04:39.680> is<00:04:39.830> still<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:40.100> same

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
screen the resolution is still the same

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.029 
screen the resolution is still the same
so<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:41.090> two<00:04:41.300> things<00:04:41.570> I<00:04:41.750> was<00:04:41.870> hoping<00:04:42.139> for<00:04:42.199> one

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
so the two things I was hoping for one

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.560 
so the two things I was hoping for one
of<00:04:43.160> two<00:04:43.190> things<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.699> was<00:04:43.820> hoping<00:04:43.940> that<00:04:44.270> Apple

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
of two things I was hoping that Apple

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.020 
of two things I was hoping that Apple
would<00:04:44.660> do<00:04:44.840> with<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.470> iPhone<00:04:45.770> 5s<00:04:46.190> either<00:04:46.789> one

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
would do with the iPhone 5s either one

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.600 
would do with the iPhone 5s either one
give<00:04:47.419> it<00:04:47.449> a<00:04:47.570> bigger<00:04:47.750> screen<00:04:48.050> maybe<00:04:48.410> 4.5<00:04:49.039> inch<00:04:49.310> 5

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
give it a bigger screen maybe 4.5 inch 5

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.810 
give it a bigger screen maybe 4.5 inch 5
inch<00:04:49.639> screen<00:04:50.180> or<00:04:50.600> to<00:04:51.380> give<00:04:51.710> it<00:04:51.800> a<00:04:51.860> 1080p<00:04:52.310> on<00:04:52.639> the

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
inch screen or to give it a 1080p on the

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.430 
inch screen or to give it a 1080p on the
4<00:04:53.000> inch<00:04:53.120> screen<00:04:53.210> so<00:04:53.930> they<00:04:54.020> didn't<00:04:54.320> do<00:04:54.410> that

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
4 inch screen so they didn't do that

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.260 
4 inch screen so they didn't do that
obviously<00:04:55.130> they<00:04:55.250> didn't<00:04:55.400> do<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.550> bigger<00:04:55.970> screen

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
obviously they didn't do a bigger screen

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.110 
obviously they didn't do a bigger screen
but<00:04:56.900> if<00:04:57.020> they<00:04:57.139> want<00:04:57.320> to<00:04:57.380> put<00:04:57.500> a<00:04:57.650> 1080p<00:04:58.310> display

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
but if they want to put a 1080p display

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.250 
but if they want to put a 1080p display
which<00:04:59.389> they<00:04:59.539> could<00:04:59.660> have<00:04:59.750> called<00:04:59.930> super

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
which they could have called super

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.460 
which they could have called super
retina<00:05:00.590> on<00:05:00.770> a<00:05:00.830> 4-inch<00:05:01.400> screen<00:05:01.550> this<00:05:02.470> the

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
retina on a 4-inch screen this the

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.730 
retina on a 4-inch screen this the
iPhone<00:05:03.770> 5s<00:05:04.190> would<00:05:04.550> have<00:05:04.699> a<00:05:04.729> 500<00:05:05.720> plus<00:05:05.990> pixel

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
iPhone 5s would have a 500 plus pixel

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.640 
iPhone 5s would have a 500 plus pixel
per<00:05:06.949> inch<00:05:06.979> screen<00:05:07.639> 500<00:05:08.570> plus<00:05:08.810> pixels<00:05:09.260> per<00:05:09.620> inch

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
per inch screen 500 plus pixels per inch

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.830 
per inch screen 500 plus pixels per inch
now<00:05:10.310> that<00:05:10.460> is<00:05:10.580> crazy<00:05:10.729> I'd<00:05:11.060> be<00:05:11.210> by<00:05:11.630> far

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
now that is crazy I'd be by far

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.689 
now that is crazy I'd be by far
dominating<00:05:12.350> the<00:05:12.410> market<00:05:12.530> right<00:05:12.889> now<00:05:12.949> for

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
dominating the market right now for

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.279 
dominating the market right now for
screen<00:05:13.940> resolutions<00:05:14.510> and<00:05:14.720> that<00:05:15.020> would<00:05:15.139> just

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
screen resolutions and that would just
