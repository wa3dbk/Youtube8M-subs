00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.730 
use it again cats are very sensitive to
products<00:01:51.740> especially<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:53.399> they<00:01:54.740> experience

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
products especially if they experience

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.990

something traumatic like falling over in
a<00:02:00.060> box<00:02:00.299> or<00:02:00.540> whatever<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.229> kitten<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.219> much

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
a box or whatever a kitten not so much

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.539 
a box or whatever a kitten not so much
but<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.640> cat<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.299> pretty<00:02:03.689> offended<00:02:03.990> by<00:02:04.229> that

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
but a cat can be pretty offended by that

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.130 
but a cat can be pretty offended by that
so<00:02:05.549> it's<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.390> good<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.600> they<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:07.110> a

and some of the other advantages of the
caddy<00:02:55.500> stacks<00:02:55.980> or<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:58.140> cats<00:02:58.709> love<00:02:59.100> boxes

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
caddy stacks or that cats love boxes

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.280 
caddy stacks or that cats love boxes
they're<00:02:59.970> naturally<00:03:00.390> attracted<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.930> cardboard

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
they're naturally attracted to cardboard

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.690 
they're naturally attracted to cardboard
so<00:03:03.110> they're<00:03:04.110> want<00:03:04.350> they<00:03:04.830> use<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.310> play<00:03:05.459> in

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
so they're want they use it to play in

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.210 
so they're want they use it to play in
they<00:03:05.850> might<00:03:05.970> use<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.420> scratch<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:07.020> so<00:03:08.010> they

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
they might use it to scratch in so they

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.250 
they might use it to scratch in so they
end<00:03:08.459> up<00:03:08.580> using<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:09.150> boxes<00:03:09.570> for<00:03:09.780> scratching

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
end up using the boxes for scratching

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.110 
end up using the boxes for scratching
obviously<00:03:10.770> that's<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.280> lot<00:03:11.520> better<00:03:11.670> and

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
obviously that's a lot better and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.470 
obviously that's a lot better and
cheaper<00:03:12.660> than<00:03:12.690> them<00:03:13.140> using<00:03:13.500> your<00:03:13.620> furniture

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
cheaper than them using your furniture

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.020 
cheaper than them using your furniture

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
so it's easy to add or replace boxes

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.390 
so it's easy to add or replace boxes
over<00:03:18.300> time<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:19.320> also<00:03:19.560> as<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.070> can<00:03:20.190> tell<00:03:20.430> from<00:03:21.200> a

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
over time it also as you can tell from a

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.890 
over time it also as you can tell from a
trig<00:03:23.400> plane<00:03:23.730> with<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.209> piece<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.570> plastic
