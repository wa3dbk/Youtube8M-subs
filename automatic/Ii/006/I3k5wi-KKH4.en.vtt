00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.570 

I<00:00:02.600> guess<00:00:03.600> it's<00:00:03.780> been<00:00:03.899> an<00:00:04.890> opportunity<00:00:05.430> for

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
I guess it's been an opportunity for

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.480 
I guess it's been an opportunity for
everyone<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.970> voice<00:00:06.150> their<00:00:06.359> opinions<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:07.490> to

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
everyone to voice their opinions and to

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.200 
everyone to voice their opinions and to
hear<00:00:09.000> other<00:00:09.300> people's<00:00:09.630> opinions<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.349> in<00:00:11.210> some

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
hear other people's opinions and in some

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.970 
hear other people's opinions and in some
respects<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.719> think<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:13.110> giving<00:00:13.650> us<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.799> little

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
respects I think it's giving us a little

respects I think it's giving us a little
bit<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.250> progress<00:00:16.250> but<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.550> can't<00:00:18.150> help<00:00:18.449> but

where we sat in a circle kind of like

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.620 
where we sat in a circle kind of like
you<00:01:12.750> do<00:01:12.900> at<00:01:13.020> school<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.470> everybody<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:15.600> know

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
business review some of the things that

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.469 
business review some of the things that
were<00:01:19.229> said<00:01:19.290> we're<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:19.710> promising<00:01:20.479> some

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
were said we're really promising some

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.560 
were said we're really promising some
views<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.080> think<00:01:22.380> were<00:01:22.500> changed<00:01:23.240> not<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.330> our

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
views I think were changed not on our

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.330 
views I think were changed not on our
side<00:01:24.840> not<00:01:25.170> an<00:01:25.259> escape<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> skate

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
side not an escape not on the skate

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.850 
side not an escape not on the skate
committee<00:01:26.610> side<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> don't<00:01:27.150> think<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.869> much<00:01:28.110> but

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
committee side I don't think so much but

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.929 
committee side I don't think so much but
I<00:01:28.890> definitely<00:01:29.100> think<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.520> some<00:01:29.700> people<00:01:29.909> have

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I definitely think that some people have

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.460 
I definitely think that some people have
realized<00:01:30.299> now<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.780> undercroft<00:01:31.110> is

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
realized now that the undercroft is

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.530 
realized now that the undercroft is
something<00:01:32.100> worth<00:01:32.250> preserving<00:01:32.460> for<00:01:33.210> more<00:01:33.390> than

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
something worth preserving for more than

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.420 
something worth preserving for more than
just<00:01:33.600> skateboarding<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.960 

it<00:01:36.910> looks<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.450> me<00:01:37.480> like<00:01:38.280> even<00:01:39.280> if<00:01:39.400> even<00:01:39.610> if<00:01:39.820> the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
it looks to me like even if even if the

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.330 
it looks to me like even if even if the
relevant<00:01:40.360> people<00:01:40.510> don't<00:01:41.500> necessarily<00:01:41.620> get<00:01:42.190> it

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
relevant people don't necessarily get it

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.590 
relevant people don't necessarily get it
there's<00:01:42.490> so<00:01:42.610> many<00:01:42.730> people<00:01:42.910> that<00:01:43.090> do<00:01:43.300> get<00:01:43.450> it

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
there's so many people that do get it

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.010 
there's so many people that do get it
that<00:01:44.320> is<00:01:44.440> going<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.650> be<00:01:44.740> hard<00:01:44.980> for<00:01:45.190> them<00:01:45.280> now<00:01:45.460> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that is going to be hard for them now to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.930 
that is going to be hard for them now to
turn<00:01:47.020> their<00:01:47.200> back<00:01:47.350> on<00:01:47.380> us<00:01:47.560> completely<00:01:47.920> I<00:01:48.220> think

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
turn their back on us completely I think

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.180 
turn their back on us completely I think
that<00:01:49.120> once<00:01:50.080> given<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.710> chance<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.040> speak

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
that once given a chance to speak

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.410 
that once given a chance to speak
because<00:01:51.430> there<00:01:51.640> was<00:01:51.729> only<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:51.970> handful<00:01:52.300> of

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
because there was only a handful of

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.710 
because there was only a handful of
actual<00:01:52.690> skateboarders<00:01:53.260> there<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:55.600> couple

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
actual skateboarders there and a couple

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.780 
actual skateboarders there and a couple
of<00:01:55.990> skateboarders<00:01:56.470> there<00:01:56.740> had<00:01:57.430> been<00:01:57.640> there

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
of skateboarders there had been there

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.190 
of skateboarders there had been there
from<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:57.970> start<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.630> don't<00:01:58.960> think<00:01:59.050> they

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
from the start so I don't think they

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.840 
from the start so I don't think they
maybe<00:01:59.380> had<00:01:59.619> an<00:01:59.740> outside<00:02:00.130> view<00:02:00.369> from<00:02:00.610> some<00:02:00.760> of

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
maybe had an outside view from some of

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.850 
maybe had an outside view from some of
the<00:02:00.910> other<00:02:00.940> skateboarders<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:01.630> I<00:02:01.930> know<00:02:02.350> for<00:02:02.830> a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
the other skateboarders and I know for a

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.430 
the other skateboarders and I know for a
start<00:02:03.220> because<00:02:03.940> Jude<00:02:04.690> Kelly<00:02:04.960> actually<00:02:05.290> came

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
start because Jude Kelly actually came

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.020 
start because Jude Kelly actually came
and<00:02:05.650> said<00:02:05.800> to<00:02:05.830> me<00:02:06.010> herself<00:02:06.190> thank<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:06.880> for

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
and said to me herself thank you for

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.740 
and said to me herself thank you for
coming<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:07.450> didn't<00:02:07.810> realize<00:02:07.920> that

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
coming I didn't realize that

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.490 
coming I didn't realize that
skateboarders<00:02:10.750> were<00:02:10.840> necessarily<00:02:11.200> going<00:02:11.410> to

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
skateboarders were necessarily going to

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.250 
skateboarders were necessarily going to
be<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:12.610> way<00:02:12.730> that<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.970> are<00:02:13.000> it's<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:13.959> more

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
be the way that you are it's like more

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.479 
be the way that you are it's like more
one<00:02:14.440> for<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.739> team<00:02:14.890> because<00:02:15.010> i<00:02:15.190> think<00:02:15.250> that

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
one for the team because i think that

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.830 
one for the team because i think that
the<00:02:15.550> general<00:02:15.880> perception<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.330> skateboarding

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
the general perception of skateboarding

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.350 
the general perception of skateboarding
isn't<00:02:17.080> necessarily<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.830> positive<00:02:18.340> one<00:02:18.550> I<00:02:18.760> don't

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
isn't necessarily a positive one I don't

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.350 
isn't necessarily a positive one I don't
think<00:02:19.480> skateboarding's<00:02:20.380> perceived<00:02:21.209> in<00:02:22.209> a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
think skateboarding's perceived in a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.360 
think skateboarding's perceived in a
realistic<00:02:22.750> way<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.800> skateboarders

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
realistic way that the skateboarders

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.240 
realistic way that the skateboarders
perceive<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.300> I<00:02:25.720> hope<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:26.250> through

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
perceive it and I hope that through

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.940 
perceive it and I hope that through
meeting<00:02:27.610> some<00:02:27.820> of<00:02:27.850> us<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.270> from<00:02:28.360> hearing<00:02:28.950> you

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
meeting some of us and from hearing you

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.400 
meeting some of us and from hearing you
know<00:02:30.040> it's<00:02:30.220> not<00:02:30.340> just<00:02:30.400> about<00:02:30.640> tricks<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.750> all

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
know it's not just about tricks and all

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.600 
know it's not just about tricks and all
that<00:02:32.560> kind<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:32.830> stuff<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.130> definitely<00:02:33.550> about

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
that kind of stuff is definitely about

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.699 
that kind of stuff is definitely about
more<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.270> community<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.350> think<00:02:35.380> they're

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
more of a community and I think they're

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.229 
more of a community and I think they're
realizing<00:02:36.010> now<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.370> skateboarding<00:02:37.090> isn't

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
realizing now that skateboarding isn't

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.540 
realizing now that skateboarding isn't
just<00:02:37.570> about<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.989> know<00:02:38.160> anarchic<00:02:39.160> fighting

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
just about you know anarchic fighting

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.680 
just about you know anarchic fighting
against<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.850> power<00:02:40.060> it's<00:02:40.360> actually<00:02:40.630> about

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
against the power it's actually about

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.940 
against the power it's actually about
something<00:02:41.140> that's<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.290> bit<00:02:41.320> more<00:02:41.560> wholesome

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
something that's a bit more wholesome

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.030 
something that's a bit more wholesome
and<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.459> bit<00:02:42.610> more<00:02:42.730> real<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:44.019> I'm<00:02:44.650> hoping<00:02:44.980> that

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
and a bit more real so I'm hoping that

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.530 
and a bit more real so I'm hoping that
yeah<00:02:45.280> definitely<00:02:45.730> there<00:02:45.850> there'll<00:02:46.239> be<00:02:46.299> some

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
yeah definitely there there'll be some

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.640 
yeah definitely there there'll be some
people<00:02:46.780> in<00:02:46.870> there<00:02:46.989> that<00:02:47.019> kind<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.470> like

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
people in there that kind of like

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.550 
people in there that kind of like
reviewing<00:02:47.980> there<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:49.269> it<00:02:49.390> starts<00:02:49.750> but<00:02:50.410> it's

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
reviewing there and it starts but it's

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.289 
reviewing there and it starts but it's
difficult<00:02:50.950> because<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.549> don't<00:02:52.060> think<00:02:52.209> they

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
difficult because I don't think they

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.729 
difficult because I don't think they
want<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.510> come<00:02:52.630> across<00:02:52.720> as<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.989> bad<00:02:53.230> guys<00:02:53.470> and

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
want to come across as the bad guys and

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.620 
want to come across as the bad guys and
doing<00:02:54.310> certain<00:02:54.610> things<00:02:54.790> might<00:02:55.150> have<00:02:55.239> exposed

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
doing certain things might have exposed

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.620 
doing certain things might have exposed
certain<00:02:56.380> floors<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.920> their<00:02:57.040> approach<00:02:57.630> Dukey
