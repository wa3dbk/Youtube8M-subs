muff<00:00:42.120> Rams<00:00:42.450> head<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:43.559> did<00:00:44.160> not<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> ram

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
muff Rams head we did not have a ram

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.700 
muff Rams head we did not have a ram
said<00:00:45.030> Phil<00:00:45.270> had<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> triangle<00:00:46.170> knob<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.590> we

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
said Phil had a triangle knob so we

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.639 
said Phil had a triangle knob so we
figured<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.100> close<00:00:47.370> enough<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.539> there<00:00:49.530> may<00:00:49.620> be

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
figured a close enough so there may be

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.979 
figured a close enough so there may be
some<00:00:49.890> slight<00:00:50.039> variations<00:00:50.730> there<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.300> overall

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
some slight variations there but overall

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.470 
some slight variations there but overall
we<00:00:52.469> think<00:00:52.710> they<00:00:53.280> sound<00:00:53.430> pretty<00:00:53.579> good<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.360> it

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
we think they sound pretty good so on it

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.229 
we think they sound pretty good so on it
sound<00:00:54.719> great<00:00:54.870> yeah<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:56.430> got<00:00:56.579> them<00:00:56.699> dialed

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
sound great yeah so we got them dialed

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.540 
sound great yeah so we got them dialed
in<00:00:57.360> pretty<00:00:57.629> much<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:58.590> match<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:59.039> another<00:00:59.070> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
in pretty much to match one another and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.959 
in pretty much to match one another and
we're<00:01:00.030> gonna<00:01:00.120> start<00:01:00.449> with<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.829> big<00:01:02.489> muff<00:01:02.670> here

its<00:02:48.970> own<00:02:49.120> here's<00:02:49.540> some<00:02:49.780> in<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.230> lot<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.500> ways<00:02:50.770> I

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
its own here's some in a lot of ways I

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.140 
its own here's some in a lot of ways I
actually<00:02:51.280> like<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.730> better<00:02:51.760> than<00:02:52.090> this

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
actually like it better than this

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.360 
actually like it better than this
particular<00:02:52.510> month<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.140> brought<00:02:53.319> up<00:02:53.380> okay

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
particular month that I brought up okay

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.699 
particular month that I brought up okay
this<00:02:54.970> being<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.300> early<00:02:55.600> triangle<00:02:56.140> series<00:02:56.560> is

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
this being the early triangle series is

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.490 
this being the early triangle series is
more<00:02:57.070> on<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.790> little<00:02:58.600> more<00:02:58.720> temperamental<00:02:59.050> than

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
more on a little more temperamental than

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.710 
more on a little more temperamental than
the<00:02:59.590> other<00:02:59.739> ones<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.130> mean<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.610> 70s<00:03:01.150> black<00:03:01.510> and

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
the other ones I mean the 70s black and

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.930 
the other ones I mean the 70s black and
grey<00:03:01.840> ones<00:03:02.140> are<00:03:02.320> really<00:03:02.500> common<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:03.400> RAM<00:03:03.640> hats

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
grey ones are really common the RAM hats

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.310 
grey ones are really common the RAM hats
are<00:03:04.120> pretty<00:03:04.330> unique<00:03:04.660> -<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:04.900> know<00:03:05.050> there's

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
are pretty unique - I know there's

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.840 
are pretty unique - I know there's
probably<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.769> few<00:03:05.830> different<00:03:06.280> versions<00:03:06.640> of<00:03:06.730> the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
probably a few different versions of the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.120 
probably a few different versions of the
Rams<00:03:07.090> head<00:03:07.360> I<00:03:08.340> just<00:03:09.340> think<00:03:09.519> that<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:10.180> elements

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
Rams head I just think that the elements

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.390 
Rams head I just think that the elements
the<00:03:12.130> Maxon<00:03:12.850> is<00:03:13.209> really<00:03:14.019> holding<00:03:14.320> its<00:03:14.680> own<00:03:14.920> and

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
the Maxon is really holding its own and

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.550 
the Maxon is really holding its own and
doing<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.820> characteristic<00:03:16.660> of<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.140> muff<00:03:17.350> you

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
doing the characteristic of the muff you

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.080 
doing the characteristic of the muff you
know<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.769> big<00:03:17.920> muff<00:03:18.160> is<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.489> big<00:03:19.120> thick

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
know the big muff is that big thick

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.420 
know the big muff is that big thick
nasty<00:03:22.090> kind<00:03:22.360> of<00:03:22.510> sustaining<00:03:23.310> distortion<00:03:24.310> like

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
nasty kind of sustaining distortion like

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.190 
nasty kind of sustaining distortion like
I<00:03:24.519> was<00:03:24.640> always<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:24.880> big<00:03:25.090> Robert<00:03:25.420> Fripp<00:03:25.660> fan<00:03:25.900> yeah

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
I was always a big Robert Fripp fan yeah

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.600 
I was always a big Robert Fripp fan yeah
that<00:03:26.380> can<00:03:26.500> when<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:26.650> was<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.830> kid<00:03:27.070> he<00:03:27.250> was<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.400> guy

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
that can when I was a kid he was a guy

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.310 
that can when I was a kid he was a guy
using<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.209> stuff<00:03:28.450> yeah<00:03:28.660> it's<00:03:28.930> like<00:03:29.140> it's

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
using that stuff yeah it's like it's

the<00:03:33.360> sustain<00:03:33.810> factor<00:03:34.440> way

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.780 

it<00:03:53.110> almost<00:03:53.260> blossoms<00:03:53.890> into<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.280> Harmonia

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
it almost blossoms into the Harmonia

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.340 
it almost blossoms into the Harmonia
have<00:03:55.270> a<00:03:55.300> cup<00:03:55.540> of<00:03:55.660> coffee<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.050> a<00:03:56.110> cigarette

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
have a cup of coffee and a cigarette

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.020 
have a cup of coffee and a cigarette
come<00:03:56.740> back<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.160> things<00:03:57.280> still<00:03:57.580> ring<00:03:57.790> yeah

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
come back and things still ring yeah

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.810 
come back and things still ring yeah
awesome<00:03:58.930> yeah<00:03:59.260> big<00:03:59.680> monster<00:04:00.070> just<00:04:00.220> like<00:04:00.310> when

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
awesome yeah big monster just like when

really really common at the time but

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.870 
really really common at the time but
they<00:04:08.290> thinks<00:04:08.680> big<00:04:09.040> must<00:04:09.250> have<00:04:09.400> stood<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:09.670> test

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
they thinks big must have stood the test

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.610 
they thinks big must have stood the test
of<00:04:10.000> time<00:04:10.060> yeah<00:04:10.600> again<00:04:10.870> what<00:04:11.050> they<00:04:11.200> sound<00:04:11.500> great

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
of time yeah again what they sound great

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.470 
of time yeah again what they sound great
guitar<00:04:12.100> bass<00:04:12.460> everything<00:04:12.940> you<00:04:13.030> put<00:04:13.180> into<00:04:13.330> it

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
guitar bass everything you put into it

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.690 
guitar bass everything you put into it
yeah<00:04:13.660> you<00:04:14.260> know<00:04:14.290> I<00:04:14.410> you<00:04:14.650> know<00:04:14.710> I<00:04:14.830> feel<00:04:15.250> that<00:04:15.490> um

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
yeah you know I you know I feel that um

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.330 
yeah you know I you know I feel that um
because<00:04:16.480> it's<00:04:16.720> such<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.870> popular<00:04:17.170> sound<00:04:17.739> and

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
because it's such a popular sound and

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.640

years that that's a great way to go for

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.270 
years that that's a great way to go for
the<00:04:22.510> consistency<00:04:23.110> factor<00:04:23.500> yeah<00:04:23.740> you<00:04:24.130> know

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
the consistency factor yeah you know

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.030 
the consistency factor yeah you know
yeah<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.150> you<00:04:25.870> know<00:04:25.990> one<00:04:26.680> thing<00:04:26.710> we<00:04:26.890> were

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
yeah and you know one thing we were

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.650 
yeah and you know one thing we were
talking<00:04:27.130> about<00:04:27.280> earlier<00:04:27.400> which<00:04:27.850> is<00:04:27.880> you've

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
talking about earlier which is you've

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.050 
talking about earlier which is you've
got<00:04:28.870> these<00:04:29.080> vintage<00:04:29.260> pedals<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:30.070> basically

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
got these vintage pedals and basically

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.550 
got these vintage pedals and basically
you<00:04:31.450> know<00:04:31.540> back<00:04:31.720> in<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.990> day<00:04:32.140> they<00:04:32.350> weren't

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
you know back in the day they weren't

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.290 
you know back in the day they weren't
considered<00:04:33.010> these<00:04:33.160> these<00:04:33.520> high<00:04:33.700> collectibles

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
considered these these high collectibles

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.630 
considered these these high collectibles
they<00:04:34.420> were<00:04:34.480> utility<00:04:34.960> items<00:04:35.260> and<00:04:35.470> you<00:04:36.340> know<00:04:36.460> the

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
they were utility items and you know the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.430 
they were utility items and you know the
important<00:04:37.450> thing<00:04:37.570> for<00:04:37.720> these<00:04:37.810> companies<00:04:38.170> was

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
important thing for these companies was

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.680 
important thing for these companies was
to<00:04:38.650> keep<00:04:38.890> production<00:04:39.190> rolling<00:04:39.730> so<00:04:39.940> you<00:04:40.210> know

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
to keep production rolling so you know

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.180 
to keep production rolling so you know
if<00:04:40.810> they<00:04:40.930> ran<00:04:41.080> out<00:04:41.260> of<00:04:41.290> a<00:04:41.440> resistor<00:04:41.860> they<00:04:42.040> ran

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
if they ran out of a resistor they ran

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.220 
if they ran out of a resistor they ran
out<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.400> a<00:04:42.580> transistor<00:04:43.180> they<00:04:43.390> ran<00:04:43.570> out<00:04:43.720> of<00:04:43.750> you

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
out of a transistor they ran out of you

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.960 
out of a transistor they ran out of you
know<00:04:44.350> any<00:04:44.680> other<00:04:44.890> component<00:04:45.400> of<00:04:45.490> capacitor

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
know any other component of capacitor

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.700 
know any other component of capacitor
they<00:04:46.420> might<00:04:46.810> have<00:04:46.930> swapped<00:04:47.110> out<00:04:47.320> something

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
they might have swapped out something

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.820 
they might have swapped out something
close<00:04:48.220> but<00:04:48.700> not<00:04:48.850> identical<00:04:49.060> so<00:04:49.720> what<00:04:50.710> you're

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
close but not identical so what you're

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.170 
close but not identical so what you're
getting<00:04:50.980> if<00:04:51.250> you're<00:04:51.400> buying<00:04:51.580> you<00:04:51.700> know<00:04:51.820> I<00:04:52.030> I

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
getting if you're buying you know I I

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.520 
getting if you're buying you know I I
know<00:04:52.420> that<00:04:52.540> these<00:04:52.810> things<00:04:52.990> have<00:04:53.110> to<00:04:53.230> go<00:04:53.320> be

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
know that these things have to go be

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.720 
know that these things have to go be
going<00:04:53.680> first<00:04:53.890> item<00:04:54.370> 5<00:04:54.670> 500<00:04:55.150> to<00:04:55.480> 750<00:04:56.140> dollars

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
going first item 5 500 to 750 dollars

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.760 
going first item 5 500 to 750 dollars
maybe<00:04:57.730> more<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.390> I've<00:04:58.570> also<00:04:58.810> to<00:04:59.170> ontour<00:04:59.560> me

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
maybe more and I've also to ontour me

maybe more and I've also to ontour me
and<00:04:59.860> I've<00:04:59.950> used<00:05:00.130> a<00:05:00.310> lot<00:05:00.640> of<00:05:00.760> different

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
and I've used a lot of different

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.910 
and I've used a lot of different
versions<00:05:01.120> like<00:05:01.510> the<00:05:01.570> metals<00:05:02.170> so<00:05:02.350> then<00:05:02.680> I've

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
versions like the metals so then I've

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.040 
versions like the metals so then I've
actually<00:05:03.100> put<00:05:03.490> switches<00:05:04.210> cuz<00:05:04.360> I<00:05:04.450> stomp<00:05:04.750> on<00:05:04.930> my

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
actually put switches cuz I stomp on my

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.410 
actually put switches cuz I stomp on my
stuff<00:05:05.290> yeah<00:05:05.500> art<00:05:05.830> through<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.820> case<00:05:07.060> just

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
stuff yeah art through the case just

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.150 
stuff yeah art through the case just
like<00:05:07.510> yeah<00:05:07.960> and<00:05:08.110> there<00:05:08.260> you're<00:05:08.680> done<00:05:08.830> I<00:05:08.890> had<00:05:09.130> a

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
like yeah and there you're done I had a

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.400 
like yeah and there you're done I had a
stack<00:05:09.550> of<00:05:09.580> broken<00:05:10.480> big<00:05:10.660> MOS<00:05:10.870> and<00:05:11.020> back<00:05:11.170> then

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
stack of broken big MOS and back then

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.200 
stack of broken big MOS and back then
there<00:05:11.590> was<00:05:11.680> hardly<00:05:11.920> known<00:05:12.370> around<00:05:12.730> a<00:05:12.820> fixer

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
there was hardly known around a fixer

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.480 
there was hardly known around a fixer
yeah<00:05:13.420> yeah<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:14.050> know<00:05:14.170> so<00:05:14.470> um<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:15.220> other<00:05:15.310> thing
