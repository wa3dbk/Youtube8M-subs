00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.710
 hello together dear blogleser quicktipp 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.380
 time practice wartime and that is the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.110
 kick tip 2 we already had the first one 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.360
 about this softbox not software of 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.549
 screen monster in the background we go 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.450
 the second quicktipp and the will 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.799
 probably be much faster 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.350
 when we get into each other 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.179
 softbox look at the real softbox 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.520
 right here then we see one 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.579
 very special position and that though 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.039
 the right angle to the background as 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.560
 is also arranged for photography axis 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.539
 this softbox we used around 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.229
 both the background on the side 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.390
 lighten 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.700
 on which just the light is not set 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.410
 that is when these software towers of 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.819
 Of course, coming to the left will produce 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.739
 right in towards much darker 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.630
 background and around the background 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.000
 to hang up the right side again 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.549
 we have set this softbox there 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.330
 this software but another 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.620
 purpose of use and that we have the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.840
 so I had presented about it 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.160
 just talked that at the same time 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.959
 the background as well as the model 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.640
 So we have one here 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.980
 Light source both the background 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.200
 easy to discreet stops but also 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.060
 grazing light effect lights disconnect 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.340
 lights and highlights on the models 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.019
 generated and thus a cross sorry with the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.170
 guiding lightwave with these two 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.060
 Shielding forms two functions in one 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.950
 light wave can be made excellent 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.810
 just by looking at the angle to the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.790
 background opens a bit through it 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.260
 the background with illuminates and exactly 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.970
 a bit decency that this 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.459
 slight darkened by the not 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.359
 Garbage from the main light wave arises 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.720
 is slowed down and balanced again 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.430
 becomes 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.430
 you will notice number two quicktipp
