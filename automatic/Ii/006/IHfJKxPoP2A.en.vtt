00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.950
 Flavors I would never have 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.450
 I bought it but a few ago 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.830
 I was eating with friends 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.430
 invited here and there was to 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.680
 dessert these are green tea watches 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.990
 I think that's how you look 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.580
 and the ice is it 's all in it 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.500
 green tea 1 and outside is such a rum 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.990
 Benign consistency of this ice 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.940
 almost completely funny when you cover 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.229
 in there but shows super super delicious 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.060
 you can not imagine how 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.860
 you have not eaten it yet 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.240
 I bought these mochis because 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.789
 I know that they taste good 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.289
 Already allowed to try yes I believe that 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.660
 was my choice 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.370
 I was really bach from this store 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.440
 the one is it gives you the feeling 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.539
 Everything you buy no matter if it is 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.130
 Chocolate is healthy or not 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.630
 somehow make animals animal and good 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.070
 even if everything is organic I can 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.240
 do not imagine that it is so healthy 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.860
 I do not know what kind of 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.750
 agennix is ​​maybe you know more 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.240
 when it comes to whole foods so 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.270
 really the pick nuts still and 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.669
 all sorts of holes and holes 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.220
 I was really overwhelmed and overwhelmed 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.860
 the crass 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.610
 which is the prices New York 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.870
 Piggy no matter what related but so 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.400
 You can also go to normal supermarkets 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.540
 of course I will go too 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.980
 I only wanted it that way once 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.750
 I will definitely try it 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.260
 because otherwise I'm poor in one 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.280
 week but there the prices such a milk 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.320
 5 dollars 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.490
 dollar is about eur right now 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.850
 not at all to count 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.040
 5 euro hello the cheapest cornflakes 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.720
 partly 12 dollars I have already 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.630
 the cheapest with four dollars taken 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.690
 but that is just as blatant as I have 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:43.140
 never in my life so much money 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.160
 but paid for so little food 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.080
 that too is somehow part of this 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.340
 all experience and I know if 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.200
 I need something special I go to 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.610
 example there and find there normal 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.220
 I would not go shopping there at all 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.930
 make a case unless you are millionaire 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.460
 maybe you even have to be billionaire 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.750
 be but I can all this now 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.120

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.010
 noodles and guacamole make and rape 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.330
 did and so and exactly that is it 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.220
 good and I'm curious if it is not 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.540
