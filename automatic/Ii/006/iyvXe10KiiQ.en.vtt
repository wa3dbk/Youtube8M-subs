00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.970
 Hello and welcome to the times 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.790
 more 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.310
 Today I show you several techniques 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.480
 a bit more elaborate than the videos 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.090
 before that and live up-and-comers 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.060
 There are several magnolias here 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.890
 techniques speak negative technology me 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.129
 male white leaves in which I do not 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:38.680
 paint through the background and who one 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:41.350
 very refined foot technology with electricity 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.720
 that you already know the blood 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.410
 technique the dab and a let that 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.790
 technology in the leaves 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.320
 who are you already very curious? 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.320
 So start 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.230
 you need a good one again 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.090
 Water storage fight colors a plate 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.629
 and 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.320
 a very nice part is trick-free 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.320
 or we do that 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.310
 the leaves of the magnolia become 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.170
 get wet 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.550
 he is certainly back to this 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.770
 ask if you can do it for a short time 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.770
 Do not you have it because you can do it 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.770
 see 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.600
 and now we only need one 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.140
 special color 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.140
 here below 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.320
 the color in the cut apart 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.780
 look into it 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.800
 and paints the sheet by itself 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:48.580
 I do not come now I can do that 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.229
 can make a little panning 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.240
 I determine a bit the running 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.240
 but otherwise that is just like that 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.770
 similar second plate I wait 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.119
 either until it is completely dry or 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.119
 very careful 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.520
 the blanket for the color 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.870
 in the pub together would like 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.960
 I have no influence on that 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:39.420
 always happens differently but from the principle 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:45.620
 it always happens the same and a third 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.620
 actually wet again 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:56.490
 in the top was a special 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.490
 happy hot 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.440
 of course, likes to tell in the course 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.200
 Come on 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.450
 the leaves are now put under pressure 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.569
 the leaves grow after the white ones 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.700
 Flowers have come to prove fall 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.690
 and then the ball is heard before 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.569
 others bite and now everything has to be 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.250
 Dries that is very important to it 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.720
 the background and colored ball blue 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.760
 Contrasts can always be too early 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.720
 The blue color runs into it 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.370
 wet inside 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.870
 we just have the same effect with it 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.340
 the blue in the leaves 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.610
 that's what i want somebody i want yes 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.230
 white ladies so long with patience 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.230
 is dry goes down
