00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
for a long time it's just like it was

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.670 
for a long time it's just like it was
jarring<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.690> go<00:00:18.840> through<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.170> I'm

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680

latest<00:00:23.910> episode<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.449> particular<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.990> really

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
latest episode in particular I really

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.200 
latest episode in particular I really
really<00:00:25.980> love<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.340> content<00:00:26.760> from<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> manga

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
really love this content from the manga

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.120 
really love this content from the manga
and<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:28.109> think<00:00:28.320> for<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.500> most<00:00:28.619> part<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.859> anime

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
and I think for the most part the anime

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.800 
and I think for the most part the anime
did<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.400> justice<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:29.939> I'm<00:00:30.000> noticing<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.539> it

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
did it justice and I'm noticing that it

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.889 
did it justice and I'm noticing that it
seems<00:00:31.349> hopefully<00:00:32.130> to--we<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.820> backing<00:00:33.510> down<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
seems hopefully to--we is backing down a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.270 
seems hopefully to--we is backing down a
little<00:00:34.230> bit<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.530> some<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.860> bullshit<00:00:35.190> a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
little bit on some of the bullshit a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.770 
little bit on some of the bullshit a
pool<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.670> noticed<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> art<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.540> episode

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
pool I noticed the art in this episode

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.020 
pool I noticed the art in this episode
was<00:00:36.960> really<00:00:37.290> good<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.820> that's<00:00:38.820> speaking

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
was really good and that's speaking

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.180 
was really good and that's speaking
something<00:00:39.719> considering<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.559> travesty<00:00:41.070> they

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
something considering the travesty they

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.920 
something considering the travesty they
did<00:00:41.370> with<00:00:41.550> latest<00:00:42.059> fragment<00:00:42.510> super<00:00:42.719> episode

touched him so much and little low and
everything<00:01:10.560> although<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.860> was<00:01:11.010> weird<00:01:11.250> hearing

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
everything although it was weird hearing

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.899 
everything although it was weird hearing
laws<00:01:12.270> voice<00:01:12.720> because<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:13.920> if<00:01:14.159> you

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
laws voice because it's like if you

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.280 
laws voice because it's like if you
listen<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.390> him<00:01:15.420> he<00:01:15.630> sounds<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:16.200> really

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
listen to him he sounds really really

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.380 
listen to him he sounds really really
older<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> little<00:01:17.460> kid<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.180> thought

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
older for like a little kid so I thought

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.670 
older for like a little kid so I thought
they<00:01:18.509> should<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.750> maybe<00:01:18.869> got<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.080> female<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
they should have maybe got a female to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.380 
they should have maybe got a female to
come<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.040> play<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.400> role<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.180> aside

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
come in and play that role but aside

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.300 
come in and play that role but aside
from<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.720> mean<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.020> episode<00:01:22.409> very<00:01:22.920> brief

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
from that I mean the episode very brief

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.760 
from that I mean the episode very brief
it<00:01:23.610> was<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> very<00:01:23.880> good<00:01:24.210> episode<00:01:24.720> seeing<00:01:25.439> his

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it was a very good episode seeing his

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.710 
it was a very good episode seeing his
flipping<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.430> doflamingo<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.240> got<00:01:27.600> to

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
flipping on doflamingo and it got to

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.760 
flipping on doflamingo and it got to
make<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.960> wonder<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.259> little<00:01:28.350> bit<00:01:28.590> more<00:01:28.710> about

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
make you wonder a little bit more about

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.760 
make you wonder a little bit more about
their<00:01:29.070> relationship<00:01:29.670> why<00:01:29.820> would<00:01:30.000> go<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> song

in<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.150> sense<00:01:39.329> if<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.630> look<00:01:39.780> at<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.020> character

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
in a sense if you look at this character

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.760 
in a sense if you look at this character
he<00:01:41.189> started<00:01:41.700> off<00:01:41.850> where<00:01:42.119> ok<00:01:42.689> he<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.290> know<00:01:43.320> had

he started off where ok he you know had

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.889 
he started off where ok he you know had
a<00:01:43.799> brother<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.399> he<00:01:45.030> basically<00:01:45.329> flipped<00:01:45.659> on

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
a brother and he basically flipped on

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.480 
a brother and he basically flipped on
him<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> Marines<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.189> he<00:01:47.280> even

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
him for the Marines and then he even

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.280

flipped on the Marines for even better
cause<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:50.040> that's<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.610> certain

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
cause and I think that's just a certain

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.700 
cause and I think that's just a certain
sense<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.540> justice<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.320> character<00:01:52.680> has

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and I'm going a little bit in depth into

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.940 
and I'm going a little bit in depth into
the<00:01:54.509> character<00:01:54.780> whatever<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.320> he<00:01:55.770> will

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the character whatever but he will

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.100 
the character whatever but he will
always<00:01:56.130> go<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.840> he's<00:01:57.960> an
