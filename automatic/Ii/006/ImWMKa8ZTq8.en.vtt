neighborhood and get on to arterial

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.219 
neighborhood and get on to arterial
where<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.150> should<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.420> able<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.660> get<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.110> to

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:30.970 
where we should be able to get up to
about<00:01:04.320> 50<00:01:04.710> miles<00:01:04.890> an<00:01:05.129> hour

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.740 

I<00:01:31.130> want<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.730> accelerate<00:01:31.970> a<00:01:32.150> little<00:01:32.360> faster

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
I want to accelerate a little faster

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.790 
I want to accelerate a little faster
here<00:01:32.900> so<00:01:33.080> I'm<00:01:33.170> gonna<00:01:33.260> go<00:01:33.440> ahead<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:33.590> shift

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
here so I'm gonna go ahead and shift

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.200 
here so I'm gonna go ahead and shift
into<00:01:33.980> second<00:01:34.460> gear<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:34.970> that<00:01:35.090> I<00:01:35.150> can

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
into second gear so that I can

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.970 
into second gear so that I can
accelerate<00:01:35.660> quickly<00:01:36.020> going<00:01:36.530> on<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:36.860> the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
arterial and then then we'll go ahead

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.860 
arterial and then then we'll go ahead
and<00:01:40.580> shift<00:01:41.330> on<00:01:41.570> up

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.480 

now<00:01:47.230> for<00:01:47.440> just<00:01:47.590> normal<00:01:47.890> stopping<00:01:48.340> and

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
now for just normal stopping and

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.040 
now for just normal stopping and
starting<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:48.970> just<00:01:49.180> put<00:01:49.330> it<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:49.450> third<00:01:49.630> gear<00:01:49.870> and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
starting I just put it in third gear and

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.290 
starting I just put it in third gear and
leave<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.350> there<00:01:50.620> so<00:01:51.430> I<00:01:51.490> shift<00:01:51.760> it<00:01:51.880> into<00:01:51.970> third

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
leave it there so I shift it into third

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.570 
leave it there so I shift it into third
gear<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:52.900> we'll<00:01:53.410> just<00:01:53.530> wait<00:01:53.680> for<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:53.950> traffic

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
gear and we'll just wait for the traffic

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:03.380 
gear and we'll just wait for the traffic
light<00:01:54.730> to<00:01:54.910> change<00:01:54.940> here

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.120 

I'm<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:04.020> go<00:02:04.140> ahead<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.320> go<00:02:04.470> just<00:02:04.710> by<00:02:04.920> pushing

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
I'm just go ahead and go just by pushing

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.070 
I'm just go ahead and go just by pushing
on<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.340> gas

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
on the gas

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.390 
on the gas
and<00:02:07.500> we<00:02:07.680> should<00:02:07.830> be<00:02:07.890> able<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.100> get<00:02:08.190> up<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> about

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.400 
and we should be able to get up to about

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.920 
and we should be able to get up to about
50<00:02:08.729> miles<00:02:08.910> an<00:02:09.119> hour

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.809 

can't<00:02:13.469> see<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.739> speedometer<00:02:14.099> very<00:02:14.519> well<00:02:14.760> here

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.110 

but<00:02:18.420> we're<00:02:18.719> getting<00:02:19.670> just<00:02:20.670> shifted<00:02:20.999> into

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
but we're getting just shifted into

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.449 
but we're getting just shifted into
fourth<00:02:21.420> gear<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.930> we're<00:02:22.530> getting<00:02:22.650> at<00:02:22.859> 50<00:02:23.129> 50

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
fourth gear and we're getting at 50 50

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:41.070 
fourth gear and we're getting at 50 50
miles<00:02:23.639> an<00:02:23.819> hour<00:02:23.909> right<00:02:24.060> here

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.560 

so<00:02:41.680> what<00:02:41.860> we're<00:02:42.010> going<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.220> do<00:02:42.340> here<00:02:42.640> we

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
so what we're going to do here we

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.230 
so what we're going to do here we
decided<00:02:43.930> we<00:02:44.680> good<00:02:44.830> idea<00:02:45.100> to<00:02:45.190> show<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.490> car<00:02:45.730> and

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
decided we good idea to show the car and

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.290 
decided we good idea to show the car and
highway<00:02:46.570> speeds

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
highway speeds

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.540 
highway speeds
so<00:02:48.630> I'm<00:02:48.690> going<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.840> make<00:02:48.960> this<00:02:49.140> turn<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.860> then

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
so I'm going to make this turn and then

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.960 
so I'm going to make this turn and then
we'll<00:02:50.700> go<00:02:50.820> down<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.210> on-ramp<00:02:52.700> get<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
we'll go down the on-ramp get on the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.070 
we'll go down the on-ramp get on the
freeway<00:02:55.100> so

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
freeway so

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.860 
freeway so
and<00:02:58.530> now<00:02:58.680> I'm<00:02:58.800> in<00:02:58.920> fourth<00:02:59.190> gear

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.570 

I'll<00:03:02.230> go<00:03:02.349> ahead<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.620> keep<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.069> fourth<00:03:03.370> gear

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
I'll go ahead and keep it in fourth gear

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.110 
I'll go ahead and keep it in fourth gear
up<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.879> about<00:03:04.409> 55<00:03:05.409> or<00:03:05.830> 60<00:03:06.099> miles

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120

up to about 55 or 60 miles
like<00:03:08.269> when<00:03:08.450> shifted<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.049> pill

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:45.500 

65<00:03:23.720> miles<00:03:23.989> an<00:03:24.230> hour

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.350 

now<00:03:45.870> it's<00:03:46.019> fast<00:03:46.230> me<00:03:46.470> go<00:03:46.650> right

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.840
