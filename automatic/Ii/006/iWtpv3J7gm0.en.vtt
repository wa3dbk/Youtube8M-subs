here<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:56.920> an<00:02:57.070> adjustment<00:02:57.430> for<00:02:57.580> fuzziness<00:02:58.150> you

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
here and an adjustment for fuzziness you

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.690 
here and an adjustment for fuzziness you
have<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.930> selection<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.560> image<00:02:59.770> here<00:03:00.100> and<00:03:00.250> your

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
have a selection and image here and your

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.000 
have a selection and image here and your
hue<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.060> saturation<00:03:01.170> replacements<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:02.860> what

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
hue and saturation replacements so what

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.770 
hue and saturation replacements so what
you<00:03:03.070> want<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.280> do<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:03.670> make<00:03:04.300> sure<00:03:04.330> you<00:03:04.540> have<00:03:04.690> the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
you want to do is make sure you have the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.270 
you want to do is make sure you have the
first<00:03:05.020> eyedropper<00:03:05.560> selected<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:06.250> then

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
first eyedropper selected and then

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.880 
first eyedropper selected and then
choose<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.450> blue<00:03:07.990> area<00:03:08.290> out<00:03:08.560> around<00:03:08.740> here

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
choose the blue area out around here

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.190 
choose the blue area out around here
probably<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.000> light<00:03:10.240> blue<00:03:10.390> airy<00:03:10.570> work<00:03:10.870> best

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
probably the light blue airy work best

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.410 
probably the light blue airy work best
and<00:03:11.530> then<00:03:12.280> you'll<00:03:12.430> see<00:03:12.550> this<00:03:12.700> image<00:03:13.000> appear

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
and then you'll see this image appear

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.960 
and then you'll see this image appear
here<00:03:13.660> such<00:03:14.200> as<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.350> silhouette<00:03:14.820> depending<00:03:15.820> on

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
here such as a silhouette depending on

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.520 
here such as a silhouette depending on
how<00:03:16.150> much<00:03:16.300> light<00:03:16.630> is<00:03:16.660> in<00:03:16.960> your<00:03:17.080> image<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.380> need

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
how much light is in your image you need

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.770 
how much light is in your image you need
to<00:03:17.650> adjust<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:18.040> fuzziness<00:03:18.460> I<00:03:18.820> find<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.600> best

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
to adjust the fuzziness I find the best

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.910 
to adjust the fuzziness I find the best
way<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:19.990> adjust<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.440> is<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.620> bring<00:03:20.770> it<00:03:20.860> up

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
way to adjust it is to bring it up

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.100 
way to adjust it is to bring it up
around<00:03:21.130> 100<00:03:21.610> depending<00:03:22.330> on<00:03:22.450> how<00:03:22.630> much<00:03:22.780> color

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
around 100 depending on how much color

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.690 
around 100 depending on how much color
that<00:03:23.710> you're<00:03:23.830> editing<00:03:24.100> is<00:03:24.250> in<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.490> image

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
that you're editing is in the image

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.000 
that you're editing is in the image

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
since we have a lot of blue here I don't

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.530 
since we have a lot of blue here I don't
want<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.250> girl<00:03:27.430> affected<00:03:27.880> too<00:03:28.030> much<00:03:28.240> so<00:03:28.450> I'm

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
going to bring the fuzziness up to about

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.460 
going to bring the fuzziness up to about
a<00:03:30.310> hundred<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.730> ten<00:03:30.970> now<00:03:31.930> you<00:03:31.990> can<00:03:32.200> see<00:03:32.350> the

these<00:03:45.880> flutter<00:03:46.150> bars<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:47.260> I'm<00:03:47.320> going<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:47.530> turn

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
these flutter bars so I'm going to turn

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.980 
these flutter bars so I'm going to turn
the<00:03:47.770> saturation<00:03:48.370> down<00:03:48.550> and<00:03:48.850> then<00:03:49.780> I'm<00:03:49.870> going

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
the saturation down and then I'm going

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.840 
the saturation down and then I'm going
to<00:03:50.020> turn<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.290> lightness<00:03:50.680> down<00:03:50.860> a<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:51.670> about

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
to turn the lightness down a to about

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.230 
to turn the lightness down a to about
minus<00:03:52.120> 35<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:53.230> minus<00:03:53.470> about<00:03:53.560> 45<00:03:54.100> and<00:03:54.430> then<00:03:55.150> I'm

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
minus 35 to minus about 45 and then I'm

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.030 
minus 35 to minus about 45 and then I'm
going<00:03:55.360> to<00:03:55.420> adjust<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.750> hue<00:03:56.020> this<00:03:56.620> will<00:03:56.800> change

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
going to adjust the hue this will change

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.920 
going to adjust the hue this will change
the<00:03:57.250> color<00:03:57.490> depending<00:03:58.120> on<00:03:58.240> how<00:03:58.360> far<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:58.720> drag

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
the color depending on how far you drag

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.199 
the color depending on how far you drag
the<00:03:59.080> slider<00:03:59.170> I<00:03:59.590> like<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.430> orange<00:04:00.640> color<00:04:00.910> but

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
the slider I like the orange color but

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.790 
the slider I like the orange color but
I'd<00:04:01.420> still<00:04:01.720> like<00:04:01.780> it<00:04:02.050> if<00:04:02.170> a<00:04:02.260> lot<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.650> color

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
I'd still like it if a lot of the color

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.770 
I'd still like it if a lot of the color
was<00:04:02.980> taken<00:04:03.220> out<00:04:03.340> so<00:04:03.970> I'm<00:04:04.030> going<00:04:04.240> to<00:04:04.270> reduce<00:04:04.600> the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
was taken out so I'm going to reduce the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.020 
was taken out so I'm going to reduce the
saturation<00:04:04.959> even<00:04:05.800> more<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.520> about<00:04:06.730> minus

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
saturation even more to about minus

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.360 
saturation even more to about minus
eighty-five<00:04:07.510> or<00:04:08.110> minus<00:04:08.530> 90<00:04:08.950> that's<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.220> good

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
eighty-five or minus 90 that's a good

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.699 
eighty-five or minus 90 that's a good
bet<00:04:09.580> if<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.780> still<00:04:10.990> want<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.170> make<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.320> darker

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
bet if you still want to make a darker

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.949 
bet if you still want to make a darker
of<00:04:11.860> course<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:12.520> can<00:04:12.670> bring<00:04:12.820> it<00:04:12.910> down<00:04:13.090> the

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
of course you can bring it down the

of course you can bring it down the
likeness<00:04:14.320> is<00:04:14.410> what<00:04:14.590> controls<00:04:14.860> how<00:04:15.190> much<00:04:15.220> light

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370
