roof house here where we are doing
trials<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.740> various<00:00:14.809> varieties<00:00:15.809> planting

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
trials on various varieties planting

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.609 
trials on various varieties planting
dates<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.070> planting<00:00:17.490> densities<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.619> over

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
dates and planting densities so over

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.420 
dates and planting densities so over
here<00:00:19.920> we<00:00:20.550> can<00:00:20.730> see<00:00:21.560> that<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.740> planting<00:00:23.220> date

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
here we can see that the planting date

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.859 
here we can see that the planting date
was<00:00:23.699> September<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.960> 6th<00:00:25.789> 2013<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
was September the 6th 2013 and the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.019 
was September the 6th 2013 and the
planting<00:00:28.289> density<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.769> 2.5<00:00:29.460> plants<00:00:29.910> per

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
planting density is 2.5 plants per

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.670 
planting density is 2.5 plants per
square<00:00:30.060> meter<00:00:31.850> 5<00:00:32.850> days<00:00:33.149> after<00:00:33.809> these<00:00:34.290> plants

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
square meter 5 days after these plants

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.130 
square meter 5 days after these plants
were<00:00:34.770> transplanted<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.719> hurricane<00:00:36.719> had<00:00:36.930> hit

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
were transplanted a hurricane had hit

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.610 
were transplanted a hurricane had hit
and<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:38.430> water<00:00:38.670> was<00:00:39.390> higher<00:00:39.780> than<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.140> top<00:00:40.440> of

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and the water was higher than the top of

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.400 
and the water was higher than the top of
the<00:00:40.680> bed<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.270> these<00:00:42.480> plans<00:00:42.809> did<00:00:43.079> quite

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the bed and so these plans did quite

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.700 
the bed and so these plans did quite
well<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.950> recover<00:00:44.730> from<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.780> stress<00:00:46.230> shortly

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
well to recover from that stress shortly

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.990 
well to recover from that stress shortly
after<00:00:46.980> transplanting

we can see a later planting date this

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:41.260 
we can see a later planting date this
was<00:02:30.420> October<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.550> 16th<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.290> at<00:02:40.500> a

difficult time with late blight you can
see<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.770> there<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.010> some<00:02:56.400> late<00:02:56.940> blight<00:02:57.240> on

the leaves however the damage was

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.230 
the leaves however the damage was
contained<00:03:06.320> because<00:03:07.320> they<00:03:07.500> were<00:03:07.560> able<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:08.240> open
