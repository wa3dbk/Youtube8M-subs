 personalized attention of the cabinet before england the tram puntocom dot mx 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:12.009
 how are you 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.649
 sonia al aire brings again presenting you this video 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.679
 about diets 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:21.950
 delicious cookies beautiful nutritious cookies 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.050
 pretty 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.289
 they will like it a lot 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.679
 They serve for ideal memories to fix them 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.919
 yours to enjoy very much 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.919
 making these cookies and with those of the 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.610
 let's cut 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.460
 with the different molds that we are going to use 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.460
 is for example these plastic 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.600
 we remove the mold 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.600
 the shovel we put the icing sugar 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.980
 so they do not stick 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.980
 and carefully we raise the figure 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.570
 you have to remove what's left around 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.850
 empty it first in another hand 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.650
 and then place it 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.380
 on silicone paper 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.380
 here we can accommodate the necessary i's 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.910
 same let's do 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.910
 with the molds of the mine 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.240
 again our word 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.260
 we put it in fat sugars 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.980
 and we collect 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.980
 with practice every time we do it better 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.630
 but if there is no problem then 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480
 according to how they are p 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.110
 quickly we return to collect the dough look here I'll take a 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.920
 little 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.200
 rendijita that is the least of the flight to accommodate 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.860
 and it looks good 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.860
 to see here be for example this little elephant 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.820
 we can cut 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.510
 we go at the same time 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.480
 and then go picking 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.340
 about the cookie 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.100
 if we fall even bigger than how is the cookie 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.260
 we can shrink a little 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.530
 I thought about the size we can 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.740
 extend it a little bit the case is that not only as itself amount of 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.549
 cookie 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.779
 all around 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.779
 the whole princess 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.459
 also there we wanted 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.669
 you will see the combination with cookie that is delicious 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.279
 so let's cover 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.889
 or both pieces other not 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.289
 for example 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:40.460
 the star we do not need 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.740
 put him 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.549
 we can work directly 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.779
 the little boy 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:49.109
 for which the Mustang can not wear 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.029
 right away let's see why there 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:55.379
 to decorate some of the cookies we can use these cutters 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.559
 little ones 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.099
 once you have 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.179
 and with him to mark 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:04.179
 Commander 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:15.129
 you always have to start with the little sticks 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.489
 because the prison fefe will be respected 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.489
 in the case of the princess 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:25.509
 let's also delineate his face 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.359
 Nestor that would be 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.359
 the edge of your environment 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.129
 if we were laudated our 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.189
 according to the dark spots 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.989
 the carperos ball on the right side 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.859
 how they pointed 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.859
 with a cloth with his hand 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.409
 with humor 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.769
 that does not let it dry 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.919
 they do not stop sparks and mud admires 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.089
 he has already done it 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:10.299
 is caritas berlanga 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.829
 and this one must do 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.739
 to propose to you how to tell you how decoration goes on well 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.469
 now let's decorate the figurines 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:22.469
 It's just fair beautiful done in advance 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:27.699
 which is going to make it a bit easier to drill the time but it does not have to be 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:28.279
 A) Yes 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:31.010
 simply that about ten minutes pass 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.240
 that I have not yet reached this part 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.979
 you can decorate 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.539
 then we are going to 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.930
 do a couple of ministers 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.930
 with rose 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.599
 first I will delineate 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.599
 all of the little dress 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.930
 ricky we make him a dictated 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.479
 few dots 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.099
 here the imagination of everyone 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.319
 it will be 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.979
 the one that's going to make 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.150
 they want some original pieces 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.150
 come on tuna bonito 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.370
 just with the shoes 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.449
 we're going to line up too 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.900
 and make the separation 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.900
 I'm not here a fist 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.219
 and also a project 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:37.219
 of dots 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:42.749
 Now I'm going to decorate my hair 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.809
 for the pilot and to use royal there without coffee 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:49.860
 but I'm going to use a different crane the number 16 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.680
 that it's not weird anymore, but it's 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.270
 way like unitas
