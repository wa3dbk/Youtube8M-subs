not<00:02:16.210> a<00:02:16.270> black<00:02:16.840> color<00:02:17.470> as<00:02:17.800> though<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.580> may<00:02:18.730> look

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
not a black color as though it may look

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.320 
not a black color as though it may look
on<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:20.170> camera<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.130> is<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.490> very<00:02:21.910> very<00:02:22.180> very

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
on the camera it is a very very very

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.680 
on the camera it is a very very very
light<00:02:22.900> blue<00:02:23.500> gray<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.550> also<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.150> little<00:02:25.450> bit<00:02:25.570> of

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
light blue gray and also a little bit of

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.690 
light blue gray and also a little bit of
black<00:02:25.870> in<00:02:26.110> between<00:02:26.470> but<00:02:26.740> it's<00:02:26.800> not<00:02:27.100> all<00:02:27.340> black

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
black in between but it's not all black

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.240 
black in between but it's not all black
so<00:02:28.510> if<00:02:28.600> you<00:02:28.690> look<00:02:28.840> here<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.290> have<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.530> theory<00:02:29.890> 11

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
so if you look here you have a theory 11

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.790 
so if you look here you have a theory 11
promo<00:02:30.460> card<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:31.660> have<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.840> double-sided<00:02:32.380> card

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
promo card you have a double-sided card

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.790 
promo card you have a double-sided card
and<00:02:33.010> then<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.430> have<00:02:33.700> two<00:02:34.240> jokers<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.350> I<00:02:35.620> have

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
and then you have two jokers and I have

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.490 
and then you have two jokers and I have
absolutely<00:02:36.400> no<00:02:36.700> idea<00:02:36.730> what<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.960> Joker's<00:02:38.350> are

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
absolutely no idea what the Joker's are

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.740 
absolutely no idea what the Joker's are
they<00:02:39.100> just<00:02:39.850> basically<00:02:40.060> look<00:02:40.480> like<00:02:40.510> the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
they just basically look like the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.220 
they just basically look like the
machinery<00:02:41.260> that's<00:02:41.770> right<00:02:42.010> here<00:02:42.400> but<00:02:43.230> enlarged

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
machinery that's right here but enlarged

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.700 
machinery that's right here but enlarged
right<00:02:44.620> here<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:47.020> don't<00:02:47.080> know<00:02:47.350> what<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.560> looks

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
right here so I don't know what it looks

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.520 
right here so I don't know what it looks
like<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.040> kind<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.280> looks<00:02:48.460> like<00:02:48.520> a<00:02:48.640> sad<00:02:48.970> face

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
like it kind of looks like a sad face

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.410 
like it kind of looks like a sad face

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
the frowny face and it's kind of crying

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.930 
the frowny face and it's kind of crying
because<00:02:56.710> there's<00:02:57.010> boogers<00:02:57.460> coming<00:02:57.820> out<00:02:57.910> of

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
because there's boogers coming out of

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.180 
because there's boogers coming out of
the<00:02:58.120> nose<00:02:58.300> I<00:02:58.510> don't<00:02:58.930> know<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.440> really<00:03:00.040> don't

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
the nose I don't know I really don't

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.130 
the nose I don't know I really don't
know<00:03:00.400> what<00:03:00.550> this<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.730> but<00:03:01.030> that's<00:03:01.180> my

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
know what this is but that's my

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.590 
know what this is but that's my
interpretation<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.340> but<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.150> know<00:03:04.270> that's

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
interpretation of it but I know that's

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.800 
interpretation of it but I know that's
absolutely<00:03:05.370> completely<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.640> wrong

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
absolutely completely the wrong

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.920 
absolutely completely the wrong
interpretation<00:03:09.090> but<00:03:10.090> if<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.630> take<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.840> look

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
interpretation but if you take a look

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.030 
interpretation but if you take a look
here<00:03:11.080> we<00:03:11.500> have<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:12.040> ace<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:13.440> spades<00:03:14.440> now<00:03:14.860> it

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
here we have the ace of spades now it

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.460 
here we have the ace of spades now it
does<00:03:15.220> continue<00:03:16.030> with<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.660> split<00:03:17.020> spades

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
does continue with the split spades

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.030 
does continue with the split spades
design<00:03:17.950> but<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.820> has<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.270> giro<00:03:20.020> in<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.770> middle

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
design but it has a giro in the middle

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.310 
design but it has a giro in the middle
of<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.310> which<00:03:22.150> makes<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.980> not<00:03:24.600> like<00:03:25.600> this<00:03:26.020> one

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
of it which makes it not like this one

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.250 
of it which makes it not like this one
because<00:03:26.770> it<00:03:27.040> is<00:03:27.400> just<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.790> splits<00:03:28.120> paid<00:03:28.420> not

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
because it is just the splits paid not

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.250 
because it is just the splits paid not

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.340 
all the cards and it's a very like Wes
turning<00:04:17.859> kind<00:04:18.520> of<00:04:18.670> feel<00:04:18.850> like<00:04:19.320> you<00:04:20.320> just

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
turning kind of feel like you just

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.290 
turning kind of feel like you just
stepped<00:04:20.739> out<00:04:21.190> of<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.430> dust<00:04:21.669> and<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.180> just

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
stepped out of the dust and you just

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.790 
stepped out of the dust and you just
kind<00:04:22.570> of<00:04:22.630> wave<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.260> card

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
kind of wave the card

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.800 
kind of wave the card
do<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:24.009> and<00:04:24.280> that's<00:04:24.669> what<00:04:24.819> it<00:04:24.970> came<00:04:25.120> out<00:04:25.330> as<00:04:25.539> and

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
do it and that's what it came out as and

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.439 
do it and that's what it came out as and
it's<00:04:26.560> just<00:04:26.800> a<00:04:26.889> very<00:04:27.129> different<00:04:27.759> design<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.389> I

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
it's just a very different design and I

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.869 
it's just a very different design and I
like<00:04:28.629> how<00:04:28.750> theory<00:04:29.050> 11<00:04:29.470> always<00:04:29.770> changes<00:04:30.190> up<00:04:30.370> the

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:30.879 
like how theory 11 always changes up the

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.800 
like how theory 11 always changes up the
court<00:04:31.120> cards<00:04:31.330> in<00:04:32.310> their<00:04:33.310> decks<00:04:34.180> it's<00:04:34.479> a<00:04:34.569> very

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
court cards in their decks it's a very

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.909 
court cards in their decks it's a very
good<00:04:34.930> thing<00:04:35.669> that<00:04:36.669> theory<00:04:37.150> 11<00:04:37.479> does<00:04:37.800> if<00:04:38.800> you

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
good thing that theory 11 does if you

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.119 
good thing that theory 11 does if you
check<00:04:39.129> out<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.280> back<00:04:39.669> design<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.389> is<00:04:41.229> so

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:42.129 
check out the back design it is so

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.730 
check out the back design it is so
simple<00:04:42.759> of<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.300> back<00:04:43.479> design<00:04:43.840> that<00:04:44.319> makes<00:04:44.349> it

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
simple of a back design that makes it

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.089 
simple of a back design that makes it
very<00:04:45.330> intricate<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.569> like<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.620> fact<00:04:47.800> that

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
very intricate I like the fact that

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.809 
very intricate I like the fact that
there<00:04:48.550> is<00:04:48.699> a<00:04:48.729> circle<00:04:49.419> in<00:04:49.539> the<00:04:49.629> middle<00:04:49.659> of<00:04:49.900> it

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
there is a circle in the middle of it

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.180 
there is a circle in the middle of it
when<00:04:51.819> you<00:04:51.909> do<00:04:52.000> card<00:04:52.330> spins<00:04:52.690> it<00:04:53.259> gives<00:04:53.530> it<00:04:53.770> a

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
when you do card spins it gives it a

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.029 
when you do card spins it gives it a
very<00:04:54.220> nice<00:04:55.060> circle<00:04:55.870> effect<00:04:56.440> as<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.860> goes

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
very nice circle effect as it goes

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.820 
very nice circle effect as it goes
around<00:04:57.219> I<00:04:57.810> really<00:04:58.810> do<00:04:58.930> like<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.229> back<00:04:59.409> design

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
around I really do like the back design

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.320 
around I really do like the back design
of<00:04:59.949> this<00:05:00.069> there's<00:05:00.639> another<00:05:00.909> way<00:05:01.090> you<00:05:01.150> can

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
of this there's another way you can

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.659 
of this there's another way you can
think<00:05:01.389> of<00:05:01.659> this<00:05:01.719> back<00:05:01.990> design<00:05:02.349> to<00:05:02.650> each<00:05:03.400> of

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
think of this back design to each of

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.399 
think of this back design to each of
these<00:05:03.759> circles<00:05:04.240> kind<00:05:04.840> of<00:05:04.930> looks<00:05:05.080> like<00:05:05.169> the

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
these circles kind of looks like the

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.520 
these circles kind of looks like the
theory<00:05:05.710> 11<00:05:06.190> logo<00:05:06.879> in<00:05:07.270> a<00:05:07.419> way<00:05:07.539> so<00:05:08.229> you<00:05:08.319> could

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
theory 11 logo in a way so you could

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.589 
theory 11 logo in a way so you could
also<00:05:08.740> interpret<00:05:09.580> all<00:05:09.819> these<00:05:10.120> little<00:05:10.419> circles

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
also interpret all these little circles

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:20.249 
also interpret all these little circles
as<00:05:12.180> 311<00:05:13.590> circles<00:05:17.460> now<00:05:18.460> on<00:05:18.669> to<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.180> ratings<00:05:19.569> the

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
as 311 circles now on to the ratings the

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.159 
as 311 circles now on to the ratings the
overall<00:05:20.620> deck<00:05:20.949> of<00:05:21.099> cards<00:05:21.460> it<00:05:22.020> handles<00:05:23.020> very

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
overall deck of cards it handles very

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.119 
overall deck of cards it handles very
nicely<00:05:23.770> it<00:05:24.280> looks<00:05:24.969> fantastic<00:05:25.500> so<00:05:26.500> this<00:05:27.099> is

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:27.129 
nicely it looks fantastic so this is

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:30.059 
nicely it looks fantastic so this is
deck<00:05:27.490> overall<00:05:28.060> we<00:05:28.330> get<00:05:28.509> a<00:05:28.599> 5<00:05:28.840> out<00:05:29.050> of<00:05:29.080> 5<00:05:29.199> not

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
deck overall we get a 5 out of 5 not

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:31.980 
deck overall we get a 5 out of 5 not
because<00:05:30.460> it<00:05:30.699> handles<00:05:31.120> this<00:05:31.270> way<00:05:31.479> not<00:05:31.690> because

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
because it handles this way not because

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.019 
because it handles this way not because
it<00:05:32.139> looks<00:05:32.349> this<00:05:32.500> way<00:05:32.680> just<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:33.310> overall<00:05:33.490> of

into this one little package makes it a
very<00:05:39.699> nice<00:05:40.419> deck<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:41.020> only<00:05:41.259> downfall<00:05:41.500> to<00:05:42.130> it

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
very nice deck the only downfall to it

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:45.069 
which I might have to give it a 4.9 for

which I might have to give it a 4.9 for
that<00:05:45.219> is<00:05:45.490> that<00:05:45.969> it<00:05:46.150> has<00:05:46.360> no<00:05:46.770> stupid<00:05:47.770> stinking

this deck the overall look of the cards
the<00:06:23.500> back<00:06:23.800> design<00:06:24.490> is<00:06:24.759> so<00:06:25.090> intricate<00:06:25.629> as<00:06:25.990> I

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 
the back design is so intricate as I

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.480 
the back design is so intricate as I
said<00:06:26.560> before<00:06:27.029> that<00:06:28.029> it's<00:06:28.259> simple<00:06:29.279> simple<00:06:30.279> but

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
said before that it's simple simple but

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.279 
said before that it's simple simple but
intricate<00:06:31.029> and<00:06:31.210> that's<00:06:31.810> what<00:06:32.020> I<00:06:32.050> like<00:06:32.229> about

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289 
intricate and that's what I like about

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.800 
intricate and that's what I like about
it<00:06:32.680> because<00:06:33.250> it's<00:06:33.520> a<00:06:33.729> very<00:06:33.759> nice<00:06:34.210> deck<00:06:34.570> that

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
it because it's a very nice deck that

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.090 
it because it's a very nice deck that
you<00:06:34.899> could<00:06:35.050> just<00:06:35.110> go<00:06:35.349> to<00:06:35.380> expect

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
you could just go to expect

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.500 
you could just go to expect
here<00:06:36.220> be<00:06:36.820> like<00:06:37.030> hey<00:06:37.410> pick<00:06:38.410> a<00:06:38.440> card<00:06:39.330> but<00:06:40.330> they

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
here be like hey pick a card but they

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.820 
here be like hey pick a card but they
wouldn't<00:06:40.810> know<00:06:40.930> the<00:06:41.050> difference<00:06:41.080> between<00:06:41.530> a

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
wouldn't know the difference between a

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.470 
wouldn't know the difference between a
gimmick<00:06:42.220> deck<00:06:42.430> and<00:06:42.670> a<00:06:42.760> non<00:06:42.940> gimmick<00:06:43.330> deck

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 
gimmick deck and a non gimmick deck

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.390 
gimmick deck and a non gimmick deck
because<00:06:43.810> this<00:06:43.990> does<00:06:44.290> not<00:06:44.530> resemble<00:06:45.010> one<00:06:45.310> of

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
because this does not resemble one of

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.610 
because this does not resemble one of
those<00:06:45.520> so<00:06:46.240> the<00:06:46.390> overall<00:06:46.540> look<00:06:46.960> of<00:06:47.080> this<00:06:47.200> deck<00:06:47.440> I

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
those so the overall look of this deck I

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.390 
those so the overall look of this deck I
would<00:06:47.770> have<00:06:47.920> to<00:06:48.100> give<00:06:48.250> a<00:06:48.460> 4<00:06:48.730> out<00:06:48.820> of<00:06:48.880> 5<00:06:50.130> now<00:06:51.130> they

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
would have to give a 4 out of 5 now they

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.370 
would have to give a 4 out of 5 now they
handling<00:06:51.790> a<00:06:51.910> feel<00:06:52.180> of<00:06:52.210> the<00:06:52.360> deck<00:06:52.630> like<00:06:53.200> all

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 
handling a feel of the deck like all

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.560 
handling a feel of the deck like all
decks<00:06:53.740> the<00:06:54.190> cars<00:06:54.430> are<00:06:54.520> going<00:06:54.970> to<00:06:55.030> clump<00:06:55.330> in

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.570 
decks the cars are going to clump in

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.990 
decks the cars are going to clump in
some<00:06:56.470> areas<00:06:57.660> but<00:06:58.660> every<00:06:59.050> deck<00:06:59.430> does<00:07:00.430> do<00:07:00.970> that

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
some areas but every deck does do that

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.400 
some areas but every deck does do that
at<00:07:01.390> some<00:07:01.840> point<00:07:01.870> in<00:07:02.320> time<00:07:03.120> these<00:07:04.120> cards<00:07:04.690> handle

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
at some point in time these cards handle

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.870 
at some point in time these cards handle
very<00:07:05.980> nicely<00:07:07.140> so<00:07:08.140> i<00:07:08.440> would<00:07:08.950> have<00:07:09.130> to<00:07:09.160> give<00:07:09.460> the

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880 
very nicely so i would have to give the

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.540 
very nicely so i would have to give the
handling<00:07:10.330> and<00:07:10.420> feel<00:07:10.750> of<00:07:11.280> this<00:07:12.280> deck<00:07:12.640> a<00:07:14.130> 4<00:07:15.130> out

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550
