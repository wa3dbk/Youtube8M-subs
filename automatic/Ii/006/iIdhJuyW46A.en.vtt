00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.139
 How are you all how are you? 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.389
 subscribers and friends of youtube 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.670
 I am tito the son and to use the loquendo 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.530
 after a long time in this 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.449
 occasion will be to explain them a 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.820
 my guess about the delivery of the 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.950
 next silent and I want to stand out 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.440
 everything that this is an assumption of mine already 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.320
 you may seem stupid simple 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.140
 or absurd but it's my guess 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.809
 of course it is without further ado let's start 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.760
 My guess is the years they've been 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.010
 separately deliveries of silent and 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.289
 of silente the 1 accident and the 2 there are two 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.969
 years of difference of sil in til 2 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.370
 accident on 3 there are two years of 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.829
 difference of sil in til 3 a seal in til 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.199
 4 there is a year of signal difference in 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.300
 til 4 a silente and the origins there are 4 years 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.920
 of difference of silent and origin 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.960
 sacyl in til omer coming there is no 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.269
 differences since they were in the same 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.249
 year of silent and what is coming me so lendl 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.289
 shattered memories there is a year of 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:04.360
 difference of silence and shattered 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.729
 memories so read he called a poor and three 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.710
 years of difference the difference 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.870
 large that there was between one delivery and another 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.450
 It is between 4 and silent and 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.509
 Silence and origins this gives us a pose 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.500
 that the next silent come out in 2014 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.600
 2015 or 2016 that would be as a result two 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.969
 three or four years apart with 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.920
 silence and don pop I do not think that late in 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.810
 out more than four years after if 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.119
 read typed a by since the maximum that 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.860
 it took to take four years 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.799
 that according to my guess the next 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.079
 silence will not take more than 2016 to leave 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.630
 from my point of view I do not see any 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.939
 problem that comes out in 2016 as the 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.310
 creators would have enough time in 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.500
 achieve a game with good long story 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.750
 with good soundtracks with good 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.729
 puzzles with real terror like it was 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.700
 in his first deliveries but that 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.560
 our wait until 2016 is worth it 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.569
 I trust that konami is able to give 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.640
 good blow on the table and can achieve 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.280
 one of the best silence ever 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.170
 let's lose hope silence fans and 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.630
 let's hope everything goes well for the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.160
 next game well I hope there's 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.650
 it became clear that it is only one 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.630
 my guess nothing here is official neither 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.340
 nobody said anything alone I was 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.709
 disturbed with this topic and wanted 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.210
