00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.820
 hey people today, I'll show you from the front 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:41.700
 blons what's going on 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.600
 For these we need the following chords 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.600
 namely a 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.450
 who all 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.360
 and the clock 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.550
 to access that 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:07.170
 Let's put our index finger on the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.960
 fourth page in the second bund the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.960
 middle finger on the third page in the 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:19.500
 second bunch and the ring finger on the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:24.600
 second page in the second bunch and play 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.600
 fifth fourth third two first page 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.850
 Whom that is a concept 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.920
 that means we put our index finger 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.329
 completely on the second bunch, then 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.420
 press down all pages and 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:46.689
 place our middle finger on the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.869
 second page in the third bund the 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:53.920
 Ringfinger on the fourth page in the 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:59.890
 third bunch and the little finger up 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:03.420
 the third page in the fourth bunch and 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.420
 play the first five pages 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:23.190
 that sounds right there still the d lay there 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.550
 must and forefinger on the third 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:32.580
 side in the middle and on the middle finger 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:36.900
 the first page 2 0 the ring finger on 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:41.000
 the second page in the third castle and 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.000
 play the first four pages 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:54.439
 okay comes to blow would have in principle 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:03:05.450
 It is in fact every pattern pattern 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:03:11.099
 then three times up down under high and 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:13.579
 and then again down high I'll do it 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.579
 once before 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:32.970
 So first we play down down 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:37.520
 then three times up and then down and 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:44.220
 high and after we did that 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:50.990
 Let's leave that with the accord 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.990
 ringfinger going on so well 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.530
 then grab the b minor and play 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:12.180
 again the same thing only this time we leave 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:15.510
 the middle finger los they play under 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:21.900
 then raised three times 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:27.919
 back down and then that with the 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.919
 middle fingers go and play our high 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.240
 but slowly 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:48.020
 then the d comes , we do it exactly 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.300
 the same thing 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:56.080
 yes but this time we leave the 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.080
 middle finger los 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.530
 and that is the complete song
