connecting to each other and making kind

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.289 
connecting to each other and making kind
of<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.229> metal<00:01:58.229> noise<00:01:58.490> when<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.520> step<00:01:59.820> on<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.149> and

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
of a metal noise when you step on it and

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.819 
of a metal noise when you step on it and
what<00:02:00.719> that's<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.140> do<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.469> it's<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.740> to

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
what that's going to do is it's going to

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.740 
what that's going to do is it's going to
keep<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.189> lot<00:02:02.340> quieter<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.090> if<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.329> live<00:02:03.540> in

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
keep it a lot quieter so if you live in

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.899 
keep it a lot quieter so if you live in
a<00:02:04.020> apartment<00:02:04.409> if<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.460> parents<00:02:05.850> that

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
a apartment if you have parents that

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.789 
a apartment if you have parents that
sleep<00:02:06.180> early<00:02:06.540> things<00:02:07.049> like<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.320> anything

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
sleep early things like that anything

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.859 
sleep early things like that anything
that<00:02:07.950> quiet<00:02:08.129> out<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> pedal<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:09.030> plus<00:02:09.390> so

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
that quiet out a pedal is a plus so

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.900 
that quiet out a pedal is a plus so
that's<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.170> good<00:02:10.319> thing<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.459> other<00:02:11.610> thing<00:02:11.819> to

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
that's a good thing the other thing to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.610 
that's a good thing the other thing to
take<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> look<00:02:12.300> at<00:02:12.540> obviously

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
take a look at obviously

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.570 
take a look at obviously
is<00:02:13.709> probably<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.069> first<00:02:14.099> thing<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.459> you're

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
is probably the first thing that you're

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.309 
is probably the first thing that you're
going<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.790> notice<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.239> that<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.930> footboard

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
going to notice is that the footboard

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.500 
going to notice is that the footboard
has<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> different<00:02:16.950> design<00:02:17.190> not<00:02:18.030> only<00:02:18.060> does<00:02:18.480> it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
has a different design not only does it

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.360 
has a different design not only does it
have<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.780> different<00:02:19.080> design<00:02:19.620> but<00:02:20.250> it's

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
have a different design but it's

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.550 
have a different design but it's
actually<00:02:20.580> longer<00:02:21.299> than<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:22.170> previous

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
actually longer than the previous

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.410 
actually longer than the previous
version<00:02:22.950> now<00:02:23.459> here's<00:02:23.670> something<00:02:23.909> to<00:02:24.060> consider

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
version now here's something to consider

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.009 
version now here's something to consider
if<00:02:24.690> you're<00:02:25.290> somebody<00:02:25.590> who<00:02:25.920> has<00:02:26.099> larger<00:02:26.580> feet

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
if you're somebody who has larger feet

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.500 
if you're somebody who has larger feet
larger<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.319> footboard<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:29.010> better<00:02:29.640> now<00:02:30.390> if

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
larger the footboard the better now if

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.600 
larger the footboard the better now if
you've<00:02:30.629> done<00:02:30.810> some<00:02:31.079> research<00:02:31.610> you've

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
you've done some research you've

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.039 
you've done some research you've
probably<00:02:32.849> already<00:02:33.150> noticed<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
probably already noticed that the

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.899 
probably already noticed that the
previous<00:02:34.379> version<00:02:34.829> of<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.190> destroyer<00:02:35.519> pedal

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
previous version of the destroyer pedal

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.819 
previous version of the destroyer pedal
already<00:02:36.690> have<00:02:36.959> one<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.319> longest<00:02:37.440> foot

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
already have one of the longest foot

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.309 
already have one of the longest foot
boards<00:02:38.099> this<00:02:38.760> one<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.209> actually<00:02:39.420> longer<00:02:40.049> than

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
boards this one is actually longer than

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.319 
boards this one is actually longer than
the<00:02:40.560> previous<00:02:40.890> version<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.760> that's<00:02:41.970> an<00:02:42.150> added

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
the previous version so that's an added

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.199 
the previous version so that's an added
bonus<00:02:43.010> going<00:02:44.010> down<00:02:44.190> from<00:02:44.430> there<00:02:44.700> another

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
bonus going down from there another

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.369 
bonus going down from there another
thing<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.450> take<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.720> look<00:02:45.959> at<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.349> the

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
thing to take a look at is the

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.770 
thing to take a look at is the
reinforcement<00:02:46.799> screw<00:02:47.519> again<00:02:48.390> if<00:02:48.569> you've<00:02:48.660> been

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
reinforcement screw again if you've been

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.089 
reinforcement screw again if you've been
doing<00:02:49.019> your<00:02:49.049> research<00:02:49.319> you've<00:02:49.769> heard<00:02:49.980> of

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
doing your research you've heard of

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.130 
doing your research you've heard of
people<00:02:50.250> who<00:02:50.519> have<00:02:50.549> bought<00:02:50.790> destroyers<00:02:51.359> after

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
people who have bought destroyers after

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.900 
people who have bought destroyers after
a<00:02:52.170> while<00:02:52.319> that<00:02:52.379> reinforcements<00:02:53.370> crew<00:02:53.549> seems

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
a while that reinforcements crew seems

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.699 
a while that reinforcements crew seems
to<00:02:54.150> get<00:02:54.269> loose<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.230> always<00:02:55.349> have<00:02:55.560> to

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
to get loose and you always have to

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.920 
to get loose and you always have to
tighten<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.069> up<00:02:56.160> one<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.150> easy<00:02:57.299> fixes<00:02:57.780> on

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
tighten it up one of the easy fixes on

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.599 
tighten it up one of the easy fixes on
that<00:02:58.109> what<00:02:58.349> I<00:02:58.379> did<00:02:58.590> on<00:02:58.709> my<00:02:58.739> previous<00:02:59.010> version

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
that what I did on my previous version

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.789 
that what I did on my previous version
is<00:02:59.730> I<00:03:00.299> just<00:03:00.480> put<00:03:00.599> loctite<00:03:00.959> on<00:03:01.109> it<00:03:01.260> never<00:03:01.590> had<00:03:01.769> a

is I just put loctite on it never had a

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.369 
is I just put loctite on it never had a
problem<00:03:02.040> again<00:03:02.310> when<00:03:03.299> I<00:03:03.329> called<00:03:03.690> mark<00:03:03.989> after

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
improved and you shouldn't have the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.729 
improved and you shouldn't have the
problem<00:03:12.780> as<00:03:12.900> much<00:03:13.079> as<00:03:13.230> what<00:03:13.379> you<00:03:13.470> had<00:03:13.620> before

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739
