00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
not one for the big another racks fires

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.859 
not one for the big another racks fires
but<00:01:04.449> you<00:01:05.449> know<00:01:05.540> what<00:01:05.750> it<00:01:06.410> kind<00:01:06.650> of<00:01:06.770> makes<00:01:07.010> it<00:01:07.869> so

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.210 
with stalls and some pens here and so
this<00:01:27.740> isn't<00:01:27.979> just<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.580> you<00:01:29.030> know<00:01:29.180> pretty<00:01:29.690> map<00:01:30.220> it

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
this isn't just a you know pretty map it

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:39.190 
this isn't just a you know pretty map it
actually<00:01:31.820> funkin<00:01:32.240> functions<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:36.160> okay<00:01:38.140> by<00:01:39.140> the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
actually funkin functions to okay by the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.469 
actually funkin functions to okay by the
way<00:01:39.350> I'd<00:01:39.950> like<00:01:39.979> to<00:01:40.190> introduce<00:01:40.460> skull<00:01:41.030> crusher

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
way I'd like to introduce skull crusher

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.859 
way I'd like to introduce skull crusher
the<00:01:41.780> unstoppable<00:01:43.000> I'm<00:01:44.000> gonna<00:01:44.179> jump<00:01:44.569> over

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
the unstoppable I'm gonna jump over

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.779 
the unstoppable I'm gonna jump over
these<00:01:45.190> because<00:01:46.690> welcome<00:01:48.130> okay<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:49.190> you'll<00:01:49.550> see

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
these because welcome okay so you'll see

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.210 
these because welcome okay so you'll see
a<00:01:50.030> lot<00:01:50.869> of<00:01:50.899> pressure<00:01:51.229> plates<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.830> lot<00:01:52.039> of

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
a lot of pressure plates a lot of

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.450 
a lot of pressure plates a lot of
command<00:01:52.520> blocks<00:01:52.929> sitting<00:01:53.929> around<00:01:54.140> so<00:01:54.619> this

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
command blocks sitting around so this

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.180 
command blocks sitting around so this
one<00:01:55.789> actually<00:01:56.600> starts<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.289> race<00:01:57.470> as<00:01:57.830> you<00:01:57.890> can

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
one actually starts the race as you can

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.260 
one actually starts the race as you can
see<00:01:58.369> it'll<00:01:58.580> come<00:01:58.789> down<00:01:59.470> the<00:02:00.470> gate<00:02:00.679> will<00:02:00.950> drop

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
see it'll come down the gate will drop

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.120 
see it'll come down the gate will drop
and<00:02:02.270> on<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.959> right<00:02:03.140> side<00:02:03.410> you'll<00:02:03.619> also<00:02:03.770> see

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
and on the right side you'll also see

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.340 
and on the right side you'll also see
timer<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.830> this<00:02:07.190> will<00:02:07.459> count<00:02:07.640> in<00:02:08.240> tenths<00:02:09.110> of<00:02:09.229> a

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
timer and this will count in tenths of a

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.220 
timer and this will count in tenths of a
second<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.340> every<00:02:10.550> 10<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:10.970> actually<00:02:11.420> second<00:02:11.959> so

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
second so every 10 is actually second so

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.800 
second so every 10 is actually second so
where<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.040> says<00:02:13.120> 140<00:02:14.120> something<00:02:14.540> it's

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
where it says 140 something it's

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.420 
where it says 140 something it's
actually<00:02:15.230> 14<00:02:15.650> seconds<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:18.069> so<00:02:19.069> as<00:02:19.280> I'm

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
actually 14 seconds and so as I'm

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.400 
actually 14 seconds and so as I'm
running<00:02:19.900> I'm<00:02:20.900> actually<00:02:21.140> gonna<00:02:21.410> stop<00:02:22.280> okay<00:02:23.410> so

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
running I'm actually gonna stop okay so

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.260 
running I'm actually gonna stop okay so
there's<00:02:24.830> two<00:02:24.890> sets<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.459> pressure<00:02:25.700> plates<00:02:26.030> here

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
there's two sets of pressure plates here

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.600 
there's two sets of pressure plates here
the<00:02:26.420> first<00:02:26.720> one<00:02:26.990> as<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:28.220> see<00:02:28.430> stops<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.420> time

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
the first one as you see stops the time

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.699 
the first one as you see stops the time
the<00:02:31.610> next<00:02:32.000> one<00:02:32.209> I<00:02:32.480> don't<00:02:32.720> have<00:02:32.990> anyone<00:02:33.230> else<00:02:33.290> to

the next one I don't have anyone else to

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.710 
the next one I don't have anyone else to
kind<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.400> help<00:02:34.640> me<00:02:35.110> here<00:02:36.110> so<00:02:36.819> this<00:02:37.819> is<00:02:38.030> actually

kind of help me here so this is actually
it's<00:02:39.319> gonna<00:02:39.560> just<00:02:39.860> seem<00:02:40.340> pointless<00:02:41.060> but<00:02:41.660> um

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.990 
it's gonna just seem pointless but um
next<00:02:43.250> one<00:02:43.430> teleports<00:02:44.330> me<00:02:45.700> this<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.880> the

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
next one teleports me this is the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.170 
next one teleports me this is the
winner's<00:02:47.150> circle<00:02:47.270> now<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:49.040> thing<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.520> with

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
winner's circle now the thing is with

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.680 
winner's circle now the thing is with
this<00:02:50.360> one<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:51.650> will<00:02:51.830> only<00:02:52.010> teleport<00:02:52.460> the<00:02:53.270> first

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
this one it will only teleport the first

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.490 
this one it will only teleport the first
person<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.290> cross<00:02:54.650> this<00:02:54.980> line<00:02:56.020> and<00:02:57.020> then<00:02:57.290> I'll

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
person to cross this line and then I'll

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.900 
person to cross this line and then I'll
reset<00:02:57.950> after<00:02:58.130> 60<00:02:58.910> seconds<00:02:59.770> so<00:03:00.770> one<00:03:01.310> person

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
reset after 60 seconds so one person

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.290 
reset after 60 seconds so one person
every<00:03:02.210> 60<00:03:02.660> seconds<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:03.380> hopefully<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:05.120> don't

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
every 60 seconds so hopefully you don't

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.660 
every 60 seconds so hopefully you don't
have<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.480> really<00:03:05.720> slow<00:03:05.990> person<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.710> takes

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
have a really slow person that takes

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.090 
have a really slow person that takes
more<00:03:07.880> than<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:08.150> minute<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.720> finish<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:09.890> race

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
more than a minute to finish this race

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.030 
more than a minute to finish this race
so<00:03:10.970> yeah<00:03:11.390> it'll<00:03:11.600> teleport<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.380> first<00:03:12.650> person

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
so yeah it'll teleport the first person

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.490 
so yeah it'll teleport the first person
across<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.370> line<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:15.080> winner's<00:03:15.230> circle

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
across the line to the winner's circle

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.850 
across the line to the winner's circle
and<00:03:15.890> then<00:03:16.400> these<00:03:16.640> just<00:03:17.060> say<00:03:17.480> oh<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.530> winner<00:03:18.680> is

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
and then these just say oh the winner is

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.910 
and then these just say oh the winner is
me<00:03:19.070> yeah<00:03:19.430> look<00:03:19.880> at<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.980> anyway<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:23.740> so<00:03:24.740> I'm

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
me yeah look at that anyway so so I'm

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.010 
me yeah look at that anyway so so I'm
going<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.490> actually<00:03:26.180> move<00:03:26.510> Skullcrusher

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
going to actually move Skullcrusher

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.860 
going to actually move Skullcrusher
cause<00:03:27.410> otherwise<00:03:27.850> you<00:03:28.850> will<00:03:29.000> constantly<00:03:29.270> keep

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
cause otherwise you will constantly keep

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.630 
cause otherwise you will constantly keep
teleporting<00:03:30.470> me<00:03:30.590> back<00:03:30.800> by<00:03:31.250> running<00:03:31.460> over

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
teleporting me back by running over

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.590 
teleporting me back by running over
those<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.980> as<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:34.400> can<00:03:34.520> see<00:03:34.580> these<00:03:35.180> are<00:03:35.390> down

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
those so as you can see these are down

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.240 
those so as you can see these are down
and<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:38.690> also<00:03:38.810> see<00:03:39.110> that<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.500> time<00:03:39.740> score<00:03:40.160> is

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
and you also see that the time score is

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.990 
and you also see that the time score is
still<00:03:40.370> there<00:03:40.720> this<00:03:42.250> command<00:03:43.250> block<00:03:43.370> here<00:03:43.730> this

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
still there this command block here this

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.330 
still there this command block here this
will<00:03:45.250> reset<00:03:46.690> these<00:03:47.690> as<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:48.770> can<00:03:48.800> see<00:03:49.130> these

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
will reset these as you can see these

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.480 
will reset these as you can see these
are<00:03:49.490> back<00:03:49.670> up<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.260> then<00:03:51.260> this<00:03:51.470> one<00:03:51.709> here<00:03:52.070> will

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
are back up and then this one here will

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.020 
are back up and then this one here will
clear<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:53.000> time<00:03:54.040> now<00:03:55.690> this<00:03:56.690> is<00:03:56.900> actually<00:03:57.170> a

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
clear the time now this is actually a

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.390 
clear the time now this is actually a
piston<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.060> starts<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.870> race<00:04:00.020> so<00:04:00.500> the

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
piston that starts the race so the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.590 
piston that starts the race so the
command<00:04:01.700> block<00:04:01.910> that<00:04:02.060> starts<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.480> race

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
command block that starts to race

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.320 
command block that starts to race
actually<00:04:02.870> flops<00:04:03.410> a<00:04:03.770> redstone<00:04:04.490> block<00:04:04.640> on<00:04:05.120> top

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
actually flops a redstone block on top

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.170 
actually flops a redstone block on top
of<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:05.600> but<00:04:05.900> I'm<00:04:06.890> going<00:04:07.100> to<00:04:07.160> kind<00:04:07.459> of<00:04:07.550> shift

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
of that but I'm going to kind of shift

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.840 
of that but I'm going to kind of shift
it<00:04:08.420> downwards<00:04:08.959> soon<00:04:09.410> so<00:04:10.010> this<00:04:10.130> is<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.459> start

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
it downwards soon so this is the start

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.180 
it downwards soon so this is the start
of<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.030> race<00:04:11.209> this<00:04:11.630> is<00:04:12.070> actually<00:04:13.070> the

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
of the race this is actually the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.530 
of the race this is actually the
countdown<00:04:13.730> so<00:04:14.600> if<00:04:14.720> you'll<00:04:14.870> see<00:04:15.080> tell<00:04:15.500> three

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
countdown so if you'll see tell three

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.370 
countdown so if you'll see tell three
tell<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:18.609> tell<00:04:19.609> one<00:04:19.910> and<00:04:20.510> then<00:04:20.810> these<00:04:21.020> two<00:04:21.350> have

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
tell to tell one and then these two have

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.490 
tell to tell one and then these two have
to<00:04:21.770> do<00:04:21.890> with<00:04:21.920> the<00:04:22.130> timer<00:04:22.460> on<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:23.750> side<00:04:23.990> this<00:04:24.290> is

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
to do with the timer on the side this is

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.960 
to do with the timer on the side this is
the<00:04:24.650> clock<00:04:24.920> for<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.340> timer

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
the clock for the timer

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.790 
the clock for the timer
these<00:04:26.780> are<00:04:27.200> the<00:04:27.440> starting<00:04:27.830> gates<00:04:28.100> right<00:04:28.400> here

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
these are the starting gates right here

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.750 
these are the starting gates right here
so<00:04:31.060> that's<00:04:32.060> what<00:04:32.770> this<00:04:33.770> half<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.190> room<00:04:34.370> has<00:04:34.610> to

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
so that's what this half the room has to

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.390 
so that's what this half the room has to
do<00:04:34.850> with<00:04:34.970> starting<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.450> timer<00:04:35.840> this<00:04:36.680> half<00:04:36.980> has

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
do with starting the timer this half has

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.250 
do with starting the timer this half has
to<00:04:37.610> do<00:04:37.760> with<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.090> finish<00:04:38.630> line<00:04:38.840> and<00:04:39.140> the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
to do with the finish line and the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.740 
to do with the finish line and the
teleporting<00:04:39.980> the<00:04:40.070> first<00:04:40.250> person<00:04:40.730> this<00:04:41.690> is

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
teleporting the first person this is

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.990 
teleporting the first person this is
just<00:04:42.169> for<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.500> sixty<00:04:43.010> seconds<00:04:43.580> of<00:04:44.740> delay

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
just for the sixty seconds of delay

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.760 
just for the sixty seconds of delay
between<00:04:47.080> teleporting<00:04:48.160> before<00:04:49.160> it<00:04:49.220> resets<00:04:50.770> but

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
between teleporting before it resets but

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.600 
between teleporting before it resets but
yeah<00:04:51.979> so<00:04:53.020> this<00:04:54.020> one<00:04:54.260> this<00:04:54.620> one<00:04:54.860> is<00:04:54.890> always<00:04:55.340> down

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
yeah so this one this one is always down

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.190 
yeah so this one this one is always down
I<00:04:55.850> don't

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
I don't

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.800 
I don't
understand<00:04:56.590> why<00:04:56.830> it<00:04:57.430> likes<00:04:57.820> to<00:04:57.970> constantly<00:04:58.600> do

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
understand why it likes to constantly do

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.410 
understand why it likes to constantly do
that<00:04:59.070> but<00:05:00.070> this<00:05:01.260> is<00:05:02.260> very<00:05:02.560> complicated<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.550> me

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
that but this is very complicated to me

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.830 
that but this is very complicated to me
I<00:05:04.450> built<00:05:05.200> it<00:05:05.410> but<00:05:05.650> I<00:05:05.920> was<00:05:06.550> explained<00:05:07.000> to<00:05:07.090> me<00:05:07.240> by

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
I built it but I was explained to me by

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.430 
I built it but I was explained to me by
someone<00:05:08.620> more<00:05:08.920> intelligent<00:05:09.520> than<00:05:09.700> I<00:05:10.200> so<00:05:11.200> I'm

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
someone more intelligent than I so I'm

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.890 
someone more intelligent than I so I'm
not<00:05:11.670> not<00:05:12.670> really<00:05:12.940> entirely<00:05:13.180> sure<00:05:13.540> how<00:05:13.780> it

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
not not really entirely sure how it

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.140 
not not really entirely sure how it
works<00:05:14.080> this<00:05:14.770> is<00:05:14.950> all<00:05:15.130> kind<00:05:15.400> of<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:15.580> hodgepodge

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
works this is all kind of a hodgepodge

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.970 
works this is all kind of a hodgepodge
of<00:05:16.570> a<00:05:18.300> bunch<00:05:19.300> of<00:05:19.540> different<00:05:19.780> tutorial<00:05:20.620> videos

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
of a bunch of different tutorial videos

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.290 
of a bunch of different tutorial videos
and<00:05:21.280> I<00:05:21.400> watched<00:05:21.670> and<00:05:22.150> you<00:05:22.900> know<00:05:22.990> just<00:05:23.290> reading

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
and I watched and you know just reading

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.140 
and I watched and you know just reading
wiki's<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:26.040> making<00:05:27.040> stuff<00:05:27.310> up<00:05:27.490> as<00:05:27.760> I<00:05:27.910> go

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
wiki's and making stuff up as I go

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.780 
wiki's and making stuff up as I go
cuz<00:05:28.300> originally<00:05:29.290> the<00:05:29.470> gates<00:05:29.800> didn't<00:05:30.370> self

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
cuz originally the gates didn't self

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.470 
cuz originally the gates didn't self
reset<00:05:31.600> like<00:05:32.440> you<00:05:32.650> couldn't<00:05:33.060> turn<00:05:34.060> it<00:05:34.120> back

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
reset like you couldn't turn it back

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.010 
reset like you couldn't turn it back
without<00:05:34.810> having<00:05:35.340> completely<00:05:36.340> other<00:05:37.020> reset

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
without having completely other reset

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.280 
without having completely other reset
mechanism<00:05:38.800> but<00:05:39.040> somehow<00:05:39.700> I've<00:05:40.270> broke<00:05:41.020> it<00:05:41.260> so

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
mechanism but somehow I've broke it so

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
mechanism but somehow I've broke it so
it<00:05:41.680> works

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
it works

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.260 
it works
ah<00:05:42.490> I'm<00:05:43.240> not<00:05:43.300> even<00:05:44.140> entirely<00:05:44.470> sure<00:05:44.650> so<00:05:45.270> but

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
ah I'm not even entirely sure so but

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.840 
ah I'm not even entirely sure so but
anyway<00:05:46.540> that's<00:05:47.200> my<00:05:47.440> redstone<00:05:50.400> sly<00:05:51.400> out<00:05:51.550> here

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
anyway that's my redstone sly out here

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.260 
anyway that's my redstone sly out here
so<00:05:52.630> I<00:05:52.990> only<00:05:53.320> have<00:05:53.620> this<00:05:54.040> line<00:05:54.430> that<00:05:54.970> has<00:05:55.120> the
