00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.769
 At the end of the television show 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.989
 Organize as an analyst by running and talking 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.449
 By the way, it is the action information of this Gold Wing 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.970
 Kaikochira 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.970
 Out dry spring s 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.190
 It is a touring thing without any change until now 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.700
 Those 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.040
 In fact 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.340
 Goldwin releases for the first time 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.610
 Long length 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.570
 And 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.980
 Like this 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.680
 Dedicated off road such as dual purpose gs1000 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.600
 For Enjoyable Diyaraba Bus 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.940
 We have second only to Hong Kong 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.910
 Now 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.979
 Hey me too 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.080
 Though it already enters 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.060
 The professors went into the day 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.060
 Did you cry to Yoichi Tsuji? 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.550
 I visited 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.550
 I still got such a correction proposal 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.610
 Though it may not go out 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.330
 US professional football 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.260
 It is easy to walk democracy 2 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.410
 And doing 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.410
 The game console should come over 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.950
 Let's explain a little below 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.800
 When you look at it, your toes are 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.160
 I have 8 adapters 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.850
 More than this 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.130
 It is a directionality 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.790
 It's getting higher 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.740
 So you can also have cushioning 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.940
 After all 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.880
 In the tooling destination 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.630
 Canceled by walking 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.070
 In fact there are many 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.070
 My name card hurts 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.320
 There is also such an experience I 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.630
 If this out dry tooling thing 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.579
 Seven-year marriage system- 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.579
 I also go to smell 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.879
 And so is this bbra 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.959
 Now that I came to Britain 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.189
 I was a bit early on the soles of my feet 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.369
 The published material is included in the heel part 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:26.029
 Where would you like to go 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.909
 After all, 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.159
 In a simple 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.159
 I can not be fashionable 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.509
 The heart of Goldwin 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:41.509
 The black part of the heel part 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.219
 We use reflection dish 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:51.649
 Part of the city inside here 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.239
 By being high 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.239
 We prevent the invasion of water 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:00.489
 And 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.659
 Calf 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.189
 Even such people 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.189
 Make it easy to pitch 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.740
 Area and white of this Velcro 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.119
 this part 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:14.019
 I'm myself 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.049
 I'm recording 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.689
 Because 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:18.879
 Calf 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.199
 In the background 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.939
 Regardless 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.939
 To be used by various people 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:36.389
 Right elbow right elbow right elbow right flying contest 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.819
 I did my baseball but 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.319
 this is 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.129
 It is a waterproof moisture-permeable material 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.509
 In other words, waterproofness is high 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:51.529
 And this out-drive structure is waterproof 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.749
 I have a big relationship 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:56.849
 Out-dry action machine 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.109
 Roughly wait easily 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.619
 On the outer skin 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:03.899
 Waterproof breathable 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:06.899
 I apologize if it has been stuck safely 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.539
 A person who thought that it was not so far 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.119
 So I study 

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:13.669
 Until now 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.669
 For example, actually the outer skin 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:21.949
 There was a space between the inner waterproof breathable film 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:25.949
 There will be a puddle there 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.809
 Above all easy to see 

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.809
 And water is easy to make a day 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.460
 Hard to dry 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.370
 In other words, things get almost gone 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.830
 Negative part comes out 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.559
 Even with this outdrive structure 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:45.889
 A very light and different perspective model 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.150
 I think I can produce a sense of flexibility 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.849
 It's a nice old weather 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.580
 so 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.990
 I'm really holding this to watch 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.990
 Year-to-date low price 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.120
 If this is true 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.379
 Please attach the supplies immediately 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.379
 Almost in the future 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.460
 Make power 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.770
 The elderly 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.300
 surely 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.419
 I like heavy things, but I'm in front of them 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.419
 But the feeling spread 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:23.819
 Tell the brightness that you don't think it's a very laser mouse 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:24.629
 I will 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.219
 Agnes is 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:30.919
 We will also have a number of lawmakers who will recognize Matsushita Jichi et al. 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.669
 49 are done though 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:34.780
 Round the corner 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.479
 The installation you are using is 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.599
 To return- 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.059
 But after this in odlin in Seoul 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:43.180
 New 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.839
 I use silverlight 

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:47.309
 If this is applied to 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:50.309
 Deodorant antibacterial effect 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:55.139
 Dad but why are they 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.610
 A person to be played by a child 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.610
 1937 Showa 12-22 Golo 

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:05.369
 After all it was over to book 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.039
 Do this 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.860
 And there is also a shape of the cup insole 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.279
 One of the best in the country 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.490
 Because it is a scandal purpose 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.900
 This is the end from the beginning 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.900
 I would be happy 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.169
 It is announced that it became a composition person 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.839
 This section is divided from the culture medium 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:35.449
 Mr. Okami did it first 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:36.300
 And 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.520
 It turns out that in fact it is likely to accelerate further 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.180
 Injured 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.180
 Surely it was easy to do 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.969
 Especially, I am in the head of Mr. Ozawa 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:52.349
 I want you to pay attention
