00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.560
 hi girls here I am for a new one 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.320
 nvidia video a little bit special I wanted 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.010
 in fact tell you about a last purchase 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.030
 my emmanuel of which I am 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.180
 enthusiastic that he just arrived 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.000
 morning then shall rule and 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.919
 we will open together and it is a thing 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.390
 of technology therefore definitely a 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.210
 topic that I think I never have 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.829
 almost never treated on my channel part 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.980
 a few times when I told you about 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:33.650
 some accessories for pc or lo 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.030
 smartphone but I really wanted to do 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.610
 this video just to do it for you 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.730
 to know for those of you who don't know 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.449
 this smartphone in particular yes 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.120
 it's a point cell and it's the one 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.329
 plus one create this you are 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.390
 delighted because it is a one 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.280
 smartphone kin one let's say again 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.769
 present on the market in the sense that it is not 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.170
 You can buy it in a store 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:04.430
 physical that no part of the world 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.980
 but in the online wine so let's say vi 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.020
 you will ask how it is possible then 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.150
 buying it is a very mobile phone 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.040
 special to create features 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.960
 certainly superior to any other 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.900
 smartphone topic on the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.700
 market and this we say is the reason that 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.620
 prompted us to always be interested in 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.480
 more to this object and then to 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.070
 buy it you can buy it 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.690
 by invitation only 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.510
 why 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.750
 let's say the manufacturer of 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.070
 this of this smartphone has put on 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.560
 market for invitations by giving them to some 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.510
 people in the world 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.520
 usually they were say people of 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.920
 major major companies and then these a 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.320
 in turn they had other invitations to give 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.940
 to other people friends relatives 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.430
 acquaintances 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.770
 so let's say that so with a turn a 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.920
 chain is possible if you know someone 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.620
 that there is an invitation to buy it 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.800
 therefore precisely for this reason 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.140
 which is a little more difficult to have 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.320
 but he managed to get an invitation 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.260
 it is therefore precisely we have it 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.510
 taken and wanted to tell you about it first 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.470
 how you can get these invitations 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.260
 it is possible to get them participate of with 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.140
 stef contest of competitions on assets up 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.050
 facebook on various social media present 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:32.209
 in short, the mark of this of this 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.190
 smartphone is on twitter by running 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.980
 in short, the advertising campaign and the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.020
 one plus one marketing campaign 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.820
 which certainly very active a lot 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.230
 lively and has the peculiarity of this 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.690
 cell phone that certainly has a price 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.880
 very very competitive compared to everyone 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.959
 the others because it has a cost of around 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.730
 300 euros 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.580
 so it's definitely a cost 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.290
 low for the qualities he presents 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.500
 in fact we say it has qualities 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.500
 comparable but even superior 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.030
 greater than the top of the range then 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.570
 I don't do all the other smartphones 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.330
 but we do know which names 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.210
 I refer is certainly 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.350
 it has very very superior qualities 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.000
 as for the ram the memory 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.180
 in short, a little bit all that 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.600
 the processor has the display the 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.370
 camera the battery then precisely 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.050
 emanuele who always interested everyone 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.330
 he didn't want to leave these things 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.160
 we missed the opportunity 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.050
 I really wanted to talk to you I hope 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.270
 that you are happy with this thing maybe 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.580
 that you can take inspiration for a 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:42.100
 eventual gift these to the vast one 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:43.240
 loved one family a unicum relative 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.550
 I want to emphasize that obviously 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.930
 I was not paid by the company for 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.930
 talk about this product 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.800
 maybe I really wanted to talk to you 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.000
 there are very few videos on youtube 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.700
 of this smartphone is for the most part 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.150
 part in English and therefore I wanted 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.880
 just talk or open together and 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.240
 this is the first time I have it 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.780
 in short, we open here we pull 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.000
 these tab and this is the cell phone 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.769
 how it looks so it's very much 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.330
 great and how do you see why it has a 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:21.580
 5 and a half inch display and us 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:25.930
 so we chose it so all black 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:28.000
 and type is not smooth in such a way that if 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.580
 I put a surface on it anyway 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.830
 cling let's say in quotation marks 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.040
 therefore not 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.990
 but not and it slips me so much both 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.000
 for the design that obviously for the 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.020
 internal features 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.820
 now you see the opaque film because 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.000
 it is precisely his film with which 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.720
 it is sold however as you see 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.740
 removing it is all nice and smooth 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.870
 the exit 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.580
 we try to light it together as vi 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.500
 I said before to the features of 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.930
 this mobile are even do 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.580
 greater than the top of the range 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.370
 in fact it has an internal memory of 64 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.790
 gigabyte actually exist even at a 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.910
 lower cost always the one pass plus 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.010
 one of a minor memory and then 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.520
 even the 13 camera 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.010
 megapixel and and the front to do i 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.780
 then serious 5 megapixel fi 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.760
 certainly superior to any other 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.590
 mobile phone present on the 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.920
 market and a battery that lasts 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.320
 really a lot because they are 3,100 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.330
 milian for itself also the processor the ram 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.730
 make it really fast so it is 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.590
 very very powerful very very fast 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.000
 these are the characteristics 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.610
 main for which we have it 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.370
 purchased we choose the Italian language 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:51.660
 to do the main installation e 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.850
 interested emanuele we see a little bit 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.230
 we put all the various passwords and there 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.030
 let's have a little fun with your mobile phone 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.680
 then obviously new are given 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.200
 along with all the accessories of 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.600
 wall charger and usb cable 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.510
 the only flaw that is not there 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.500
 inside the box the earphones 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.890
 inside within the operating system 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.450
 Android 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.520
 actually a little different because yes 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.790
 call it gen 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.340
 however practically to a version a 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.140
 a little different but always of android 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.060
 so why in you very very similar 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.430
 sums but it's the samsung galaxy for 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.840
 understand each other and I hope nothing this 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.990
 video different from the usual you enjoyed it 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.050
 I greet you and send you many many kisses 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.570
 I wanted to remind you that I have another method 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.660
 to say to buy them know 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.970
 someone who bought one because 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.920
 to the purchase of a one plus one comes 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.300
 issued an invitation for example to us is 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.540
 been given an invitation we can 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.310
 just give in to the person who is from Chile 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.300
 who we want if we know someone who 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.130
 wants to buy it 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.050
 I will ask for emanuele if maybe not 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.760
 evening someone if some promise 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.590
 his friend in case if there is someone between 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.320
 you who want to buy it but don't have 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.030
 still received an invitation and does not know who 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.460
 ask but give me a private message 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.840
 will sell to help you and nothing there 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.840
 See you next video hello
