00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
the making um if the video does not have

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.540 
the making um if the video does not have
a<00:01:12.200> border<00:01:12.590> around<00:01:12.680> it<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.070> don't<00:01:13.220> really<00:01:13.430> have

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
a border around it you don't really have

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.070 
a border around it you don't really have
to<00:01:13.640> pay<00:01:13.760> attention<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:14.450> other<00:01:14.690> than<00:01:14.930> the

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
to pay attention to it other than the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.890 
to pay attention to it other than the
audio<00:01:15.440> my<00:01:15.620> voice<00:01:15.830> and<00:01:16.070> me<00:01:16.190> explaining<00:01:16.730> it

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
audio my voice and me explaining it

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.090 
audio my voice and me explaining it
basically<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.020> videos<00:01:18.350> with<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.650> border<00:01:18.920> are

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
basically the videos with the border are

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.310 
basically the videos with the border are
the<00:01:19.250> actual<00:01:19.520> technique<00:01:19.940> otherwise<00:01:20.390> then<00:01:20.900> it's

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
the actual technique otherwise then it's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.780 
the actual technique otherwise then it's
just<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.620> standard<00:01:21.950> gameplay<00:01:22.160> showing<00:01:22.670> me

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
just a standard gameplay showing me

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.210 
just a standard gameplay showing me
trying<00:01:23.480> to<00:01:23.540> do<00:01:23.690> it<00:01:23.840> I<00:01:24.020> had<00:01:24.410> a<00:01:24.440> lot<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.800> fails

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
trying to do it I had a lot of fails

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.040 
trying to do it I had a lot of fails
because<00:01:25.640> it's<00:01:25.820> not<00:01:26.000> like<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.360> CPU<00:01:26.750> would<00:01:26.870> just

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
because it's not like the CPU would just

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.530 
because it's not like the CPU would just
sit<00:01:27.200> there<00:01:27.410> and<00:01:27.440> let<00:01:27.650> me<00:01:27.850> do<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.000> move<00:01:29.210> on<00:01:29.360> them

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
sit there and let me do the move on them

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.540 
sit there and let me do the move on them
or<00:01:29.690> do<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:29.900> combo<00:01:30.290> on<00:01:30.380> them<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.100> if<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:31.370> could

Ultimate Jutsu
input<00:01:48.890> now<00:01:49.310> when<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:49.729> do<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:49.970> Ultimate<00:01:50.330> Jutsu

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
input now when you do the Ultimate Jutsu

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.660 
input now when you do the Ultimate Jutsu
input<00:01:50.900> you<00:01:51.080> should<00:01:51.110> do<00:01:51.410> this<00:01:51.560> really<00:01:51.920> fast<00:01:52.190> it

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
input you should do this really fast it

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.370 
input you should do this really fast it
should<00:01:52.729> look<00:01:53.060> as<00:01:53.210> if<00:01:53.390> you're<00:01:53.600> not<00:01:53.720> moving<00:01:53.990> at

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
should look as if you're not moving at

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.410 
should look as if you're not moving at
all<00:01:54.410> even<00:01:55.369> though<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:55.520> did<00:01:55.790> do<00:01:55.940> a<00:01:55.970> cancel

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
all even though you did do a cancel

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.420 
all even though you did do a cancel
forward<00:01:56.810> because<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.560> drop<00:01:57.830> speed<00:01:58.130> of<00:01:58.340> the

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
forward because the drop speed of the

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.150 
forward because the drop speed of the
character<00:01:58.940> is<00:01:59.180> really<00:01:59.630> fast<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:00.410> if<00:02:00.800> you

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
character is really fast and so if you

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.630 
character is really fast and so if you
do<00:02:01.340> cancel<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:03.229> move<00:02:03.470> like<00:02:04.009> slightly<00:02:04.430> a

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
do cancel and you move like slightly a

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.609 
do cancel and you move like slightly a
little<00:02:04.729> bit<00:02:05.030> sometimes<00:02:05.509> it<00:02:05.810> may<00:02:05.990> still<00:02:06.410> pick

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
little bit sometimes it may still pick

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.740 
little bit sometimes it may still pick
up<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.860> alternate<00:02:07.310> but<00:02:07.399> sometimes<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.420> won't

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
up the alternate but sometimes it won't

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.540 
up the alternate but sometimes it won't
so<00:02:09.320> I'm<00:02:09.410> just<00:02:09.590> saying<00:02:09.830> make<00:02:10.100> sure<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.429> you

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
so I'm just saying make sure that you

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.580 
so I'm just saying make sure that you
cancel<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.060> fast<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.810> make<00:02:11.959> sure<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.440> get

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
cancel it fast to make sure that you get

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.310 
cancel it fast to make sure that you get
it<00:02:12.709> every<00:02:12.980> single<00:02:13.130> time<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:14.600> prior<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.019> the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
it every single time so prior to the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.870

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
rarely have to chase them it doesn't

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.120 
rarely have to chase them it doesn't
feel<00:03:02.750> like<00:03:02.810> you're<00:03:03.049> chasing<00:03:03.470> them<00:03:03.620> when

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
feel like you're chasing them when

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.130 
feel like you're chasing them when
they're<00:03:04.310> running<00:03:04.519> or<00:03:04.910> trying<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.840> get<00:03:05.959> away

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
they're running or trying to get away

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.620 
they're running or trying to get away
cuz<00:03:06.320> they<00:03:06.410> have<00:03:06.440> no<00:03:06.739> subs<00:03:07.100> use<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.180> tilt

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
cuz they have no subs use the tilt

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.170 
cuz they have no subs use the tilt
use<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.410> tilt<00:03:09.709> as<00:03:09.860> much<00:03:10.310> as<00:03:10.459> possible<00:03:10.670> because

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
use the tilt as much as possible because

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.860 
use the tilt as much as possible because
that<00:03:11.360> is<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:11.690> auto<00:03:12.080> lock<00:03:12.620> worn<00:03:12.980> straight<00:03:13.459> it's

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
don't chase them because you're either

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.070 
don't chase them because you're either
wasting<00:03:34.190> your<00:03:34.310> chakra<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.180> not<00:03:35.630> catching

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
basically like a combo breaker but it

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.050 
basically like a combo breaker but it
even<00:03:45.320> works<00:03:45.560> with<00:03:45.650> chakra<00:03:45.950> dashes<00:03:46.400> if<00:03:46.550> you<00:03:46.670> do

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
even works with chakra dashes if you do

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.820 
even works with chakra dashes if you do
a<00:03:47.090> chakra<00:03:47.540> -<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:47.990> they're<00:03:48.140> blocking<00:03:48.350> and<00:03:48.740> they

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
a chakra - and they're blocking and they

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.740 
a chakra - and they're blocking and they
click<00:03:49.100> X<00:03:49.310> at<00:03:49.520> that<00:03:49.700> right<00:03:49.910> moment<00:03:49.940> before<00:03:50.630> you

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
click X at that right moment before you

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.410 
click X at that right moment before you
connect<00:03:51.140> then<00:03:51.920> you'll<00:03:52.340> be<00:03:52.610> stunned<00:03:53.090> and

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
connect then you'll be stunned and
