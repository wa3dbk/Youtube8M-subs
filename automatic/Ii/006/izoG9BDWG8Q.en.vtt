 7 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.280
 who wants to go to sarkozy 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.469
 maybe it's a very dim word he heard talk and I never heard him speak 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:13.189
 of osteopenia and osteoporosis osteopenia is something that happens 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:17.760
 corresponding to June of the years that bones are trending 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.950
 lack of diversity is another step in the search for votes in the elections 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.669
 agreement 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.390
 osoro peÃ±a then know now in some losses 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.790
 in the loss of muscle mass that starts around 30 minutes at 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.479
 the 40 years that your muscle 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:33.180
 an incoherent attitude 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.190
 d of a thigh 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.450
 on the left 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.390
 at twenty and as they progress in two years here we have 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.560
 another look how the red that was sought is being replaced 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.559
 by the ssa 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.559
 and some cases doubt much more we have another image 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.570
 where it shows in case of a person who is with overweight and who moved 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.830
 little notice you compare the amount of red muscle mass 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.819
 with the amount of fat mass that yesterday left 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:05.869
 what is yellow are losing muscle mass over the years and 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.080
 also exercise 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.160
 and we have 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.140
 a last one where we have a muscle of a person that that entity and the 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.890
 same shoulder muscle 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.810
 the person who is and the entity 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.550
 then eel the basque 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.680
 is not a theme of the age of beginning that is a subject that many people 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.520
 worry 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.250
 for having the hard belly in the case of the girl for dieter the belly part 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.460
 high of the arms percent the tail the worlds 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.220
 good that problems arise 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.900
 for you presented part of the solution professor verÃ³n compared work as 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.820
 was from sergio 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.600
 then I would like 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.729
 pose some simple exercises and you can go to your house 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.299
 that to throw from zintan 34 muscles and to smile is only 7 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.770
 so start with a smile peace 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.979
 the hour andes exercises with the uc teacher 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.590
 for I am going to see what matters is to have some overload if it were any 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.450
 load with a lower load sign a kilo 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.110
 i this but in the case of a person who just started tumbes ago - sources 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.630
 something I forget restrained years ensures a can that heavy that allows us 50 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.080
 cubic centimeters a little bit of life after a quarter kilo here there was a 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.739
 botlita exactly are the elements that anyone has in the house tavis 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.530
 knoyle talked about what he wanted to show that is that for example there is no 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.110
 to do a lot of strength with the arms place the overload understand about the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.430
 shoulders yes no 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.470
 there I have to do a little resistance, my column is more tense 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.379
 safe way 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.779
 nestor ick placing me a normal position miami in right 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.969
 and what can be done is to make it dead that I do in everyday life 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:46.159
 go down 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.919
 to come down like a fire was to present keep a few seconds 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.899
 and go back up andrew s rodrigo medina who should be given that plane of which 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:58.110
 7 goes with the providence of the headquarters of the detachment come together 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.600
 ciro as they have parallel legs that like me can not sit on a chair

 and with a profile just for this camera and so the classic and sictpla and cta 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.639
 true toshack factory and if it loses like I can not sit on the chair 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.439
 I go back to the queue 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.779
 my column is doing a lot of force because it's closing up keeping 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:15.619
 right 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:20.209
 may be a hundred of my shoulders from tarn contracted I am reading books up

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:24.680
 we quote roda saying 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.140
 although this one although it does not seem because it does not seem too much effort 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.340
 we are winning 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.349
 the legs the thighs 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.439
 that far ahead the vehicles that go through the knee because the master of 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.879
 Keys of life a little the glutes

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.099
 there they work or not 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.730
 no no this is also for the glutes and back mendez offered 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.790
 cepibo own benefits that are exercises 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.060
 movements of everyday life such as sitting and standing 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.469
 in the camera a shisha yes yes a lot of muscle group is involved 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:00.559
 with a lot of posture control 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:04.369
 and is doing strength as if they were some work and doctors are 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:08.849
 not the column is not moving outside the government the hip and the provinces 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.149
 I do not work in bending you lie this move be 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:17.039
 yes it goes hugs up because sometimes the ad in the frequency 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.259
 cardiac shooting but above all more than 50 years as a coach pressed 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:22.849
 up balls 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.330
 to start the ideal thing the ideal is to do 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.409
 practicing first practice can be simple that ease of movement for 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:30.099
 do what 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:34.360
 correctly lula decided makes the time is correct subo do two 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.349
 goals 5 repetitions of this yes very slow very according to another side to jose 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:42.419
 and then relax winner and a recommendation there was always sigea 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.190
 person designing a chair after highlighting exactly 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.129
 over here too 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.509
 work to work balance yes 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.499
 attracted coordination we started to fly towards the body is totally 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:57.150
 opposite all the muscles and there's a hybrid job to follow towards 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.590
 front water to the side 3 is very important is very simple 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.110
 it's a good moment he does it all his life 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.819
 but you have to concentrate on thinking about the column think about the shoulders 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.729
 think about the arms brings you the pieces of the plane said the teacher following the 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:13.840
 shoulder and one thing that 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.340
 always ask people is the subject d what is hanging here the hug that

 modernity had been fertilized with everything said and didactic where 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:33.029
 painful memory local cesep of realities 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:34.370
 when the exercise 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.819
 1 super super practical than a loquacious anywhere 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:39.030
 quesada race 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.979
 of the table 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:40.950
 cela prayed 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.159
 for another also from the side 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.740
 p forward

 and go back up 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.139
 at rates and how that exactly 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:55.210
 precious coast of going down the corne nanopower the trunk derek of said 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.010
 agreement I have a true mix 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.619
 but it will lower itself 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:00.909
 0 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:02.569
