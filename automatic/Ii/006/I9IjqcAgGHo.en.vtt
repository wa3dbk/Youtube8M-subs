00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
because obviously the unboxing part this

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.420 
because obviously the unboxing part this
video<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> not<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> very<00:00:52.980> long<00:00:53.070> one

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
video is not going to be a very long one

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.970 
video is not going to be a very long one
now<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.719> quick<00:00:54.960> start<00:00:55.230> guide<00:00:55.410> i<00:00:55.649> will

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
now in this quick start guide i will

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.680 
now in this quick start guide i will
just<00:00:56.129> read<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> bit<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
just read a bit of it so you get the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.810 
just read a bit of it so you get the
idea<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.649> happening<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.520> you

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
idea if what is happening so you

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.740 
idea if what is happening so you
probably<00:01:00.030> won't<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.329> able<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.510> read<00:01:00.660> this

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
probably won't be able to read this

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.750 
probably won't be able to read this
because<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.109> nine<00:01:01.230> focus<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:01.829> basically<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
because it's nine focus but basically it

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.270 
because it's nine focus but basically it
says<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.359> were<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:04.320> got<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.680> expandable

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
says you were it's got it's expandable

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.620 
says you were it's got it's expandable
this<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.119> thumb<00:01:06.869> drive<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.450> is

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
this a thumb drive is so it is this is

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.130 
this a thumb drive is so it is this is
actually<00:01:10.049> expandable<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.580> put<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
actually expandable so you can put a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.850 
actually expandable so you can put a
microsd<00:01:13.140> i<00:01:13.170> think<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.119> you<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.860> or

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
microsd i think it is you can have a or

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.499 
microsd i think it is you can have a or
memory<00:01:17.310> card<00:01:17.490> slot<00:01:17.700> that's<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.060> say<00:01:18.240> is

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
memory card slot that's what they say is

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.940 
memory card slot that's what they say is
so<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> little<00:01:19.799> memory<00:01:20.400> card<00:01:20.610> slot

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
so you have a little memory card slot

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.999 
so you have a little memory card slot
right<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> side<00:01:23.490> they're<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
right in the side they're just there and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.219 
right in the side they're just there and
that<00:01:26.130> means<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:27.150> from<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.930> thumb<00:01:28.200> drive

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
that means this this from a thumb drive

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.590 
that means this this from a thumb drive
is<00:01:28.710> expandable<00:01:29.280> which<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.759> pretty<00:01:30.060> awesome<00:01:30.240> as

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
is expandable which is pretty awesome as

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.469 
is expandable which is pretty awesome as
well<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.350> also<00:01:31.530> says<00:01:32.070> things<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.329> says

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.660 
device and that is how you pair it's
pretty<00:03:01.260> simple<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.860> think<00:03:02.070> it's<00:03:02.190> just<00:03:02.250> all<00:03:02.490> on

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
pretty simple I think it's just all on

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.980 
pretty simple I think it's just all on
the<00:03:02.760> instructions<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.420> app<00:03:03.660> if<00:03:03.870> I'm

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
the instructions of the app if I'm

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.170 
the instructions of the app if I'm

handy<00:05:11.460> and<00:05:11.670> by<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:12.330> way<00:05:12.510> just<00:05:12.810> to<00:05:12.930> open<00:05:13.110> the

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
handy and by the way just to open the

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.360 
handy and by the way just to open the
USB<00:05:14.400> they<00:05:14.610> got<00:05:14.760> pizza<00:05:15.030> like<00:05:15.180> that<00:05:16.160> yeah<00:05:17.160> that's

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
USB they got pizza like that yeah that's

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.370 
USB they got pizza like that yeah that's
really<00:05:17.580> cool<00:05:17.760> it<00:05:18.240> operates<00:05:18.630> on<00:05:18.750> up<00:05:18.870> to<00:05:18.990> 4<00:05:19.200> hours

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
really cool it operates on up to 4 hours

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.800 
really cool it operates on up to 4 hours
of<00:05:19.650> continuous<00:05:20.190> usage<00:05:20.580> so<00:05:21.150> obviously<00:05:21.630> that

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
of continuous usage so obviously that

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.900 
of continuous usage so obviously that
will<00:05:21.930> last<00:05:22.080> for<00:05:22.260> more<00:05:22.350> than<00:05:22.410> 44<00:05:23.370> hours<00:05:23.430> if<00:05:23.820> you

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
will last for more than 44 hours if you

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.300 
will last for more than 44 hours if you
don't<00:05:23.940> stream<00:05:24.390> continuously<00:05:24.990> from<00:05:25.200> that<00:05:25.500> in

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
don't stream continuously from that in

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.520 
don't stream continuously from that in
that<00:05:26.790> time<00:05:27.080> so<00:05:28.080> it's<00:05:28.230> USB<00:05:28.470> 2.0<00:05:28.800> and<00:05:29.430> it's<00:05:30.180> a

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
that time so it's USB 2.0 and it's a

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.660 
that time so it's USB 2.0 and it's a
takes<00:05:31.530> up<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:31.740> two<00:05:31.860> hours<00:05:31.890> for<00:05:32.160> a<00:05:32.250> full<00:05:32.280> charge

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
takes up to two hours for a full charge

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.240 
takes up to two hours for a full charge
but<00:05:33.210> yeah<00:05:33.420> that<00:05:33.840> is<00:05:33.870> basically<00:05:34.470> all<00:05:34.770> that<00:05:34.800> that

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
but yeah that is basically all that that

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.280 
but yeah that is basically all that that
is<00:05:35.460> it's<00:05:35.700> pretty<00:05:35.940> simple<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.840> way<00:05:36.990> that<00:05:37.170> it

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
is it's pretty simple the way that it

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.770 
is it's pretty simple the way that it
works<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.800> it's<00:05:38.010> pretty<00:05:38.250> simple<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:39.270> idea

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
works and it's pretty simple the idea

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.260 
works and it's pretty simple the idea
what<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.860> idea<00:05:41.160> of<00:05:41.340> it<00:05:41.430> is<00:05:41.520> pretty<00:05:41.640> simple<00:05:42.000> but

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
what the idea of it is pretty simple but

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.800 
what the idea of it is pretty simple but
the<00:05:43.220> function<00:05:44.220> of<00:05:44.370> it<00:05:44.550> is<00:05:44.730> absolutely<00:05:45.360> awesome

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810
