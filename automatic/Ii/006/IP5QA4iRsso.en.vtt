 change life on doctissimo see this is 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.109
 spoons and well they are 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.550
 filled with salt and that's pretty much what 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.440
 that we consume daily then 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.769
 it does not sound huge like that but on 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.580
 a year 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.139
 it's still more than 4 kilos and 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.850
 according to the world organization of 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.800
 health and well these two times too much their 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.590

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.279
 your room yesterday in the closet because that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.279
 you change your mind 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.030
 in excess of salt is bad for the 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.020
 health you know hypertension diseases 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.970
 cardiovascular stomach cancers 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.070
 ideally it would be necessary to limit 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.510
 consumption at 5 grams per day 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.269

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.339
 cold cuts and cheeses dishes 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.839
 canned foods 80% of the salt that 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.000
 we consume are hiding in the 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.519

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.190
 prepared and I say well hides it's 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.760

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.769
 find out why there is everything 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.500
 simply because in the place written 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.180
