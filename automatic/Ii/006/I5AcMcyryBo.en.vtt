00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.820
 but there are no more 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.199
 but do this 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.309
 that Mimi could not fully understand for a few weeks then my skin 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:14.239
 Harnik year could 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.419
 in the meantime everything has turned out for the better 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.089

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:25.119
 16 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.470
 This seminar is suitable for Mac in school 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.999
 Merck is sorry 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.110
 then suddenly take on super 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.600

 Of course, and does not look so terribly terrible from that one 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.690
 mostly wrong 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.830
 Therefore, I find it very pleasant and equally natural 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.080
 As the name indicates 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.590
 instead of corn is not easy here 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.980
 and a nice one

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.530
 finance and is 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.860
 a color concept fits my too 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.140
 very easy me there is no extreme eye-op for me at least colorful 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.220
 Of course, that would be quite a reason if I'm stuck 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.390
 wants to have a representative 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.600
