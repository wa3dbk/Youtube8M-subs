from a preventative and an education
standpoint<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.890> think<00:03:06.950> when<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:07.700> comes<00:03:07.940> to

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
standpoint I think when it comes to

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.300 
standpoint I think when it comes to
helping<00:03:08.810> people<00:03:09.140> feel<00:03:09.380> better<00:03:09.620> they<00:03:10.070> just

helping people feel better they just

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.220 
helping people feel better they just
really<00:03:10.610> lack<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:11.000> guidance<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:12.050> I<00:03:12.080> think

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
really lack the guidance and so I think
