shrimp there's some new babies in the
aquarium<00:00:37.140> maybe<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.740> can<00:00:37.920> catch<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.250> few

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
aquarium maybe we can catch a few

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.850 
aquarium maybe we can catch a few
glimpses<00:00:38.699> of<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.809> other<00:00:39.989> than<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.199> let's<00:00:40.739> go

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
glimpses of but other than that let's go

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.799 
glimpses of but other than that let's go
ahead<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.129> get<00:00:41.190> into<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.550> there's<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.690> my

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
ahead and get into it there's one of my

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.310 
ahead and get into it there's one of my
buried<00:00:43.770> triple<00:00:44.430> s<00:00:44.579> crystal<00:00:45.210> red<00:00:45.449> shrimp<00:00:46.550> and

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
buried triple s crystal red shrimp and

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.830 
buried triple s crystal red shrimp and
triple<00:00:49.320> s<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.859> grading<00:00:50.280> system<00:00:50.840> with

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
triple s is just a grading system with

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.840 
triple s is just a grading system with
CRISPR<00:00:52.199> red<00:00:52.350> shrimp<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.920> many<00:00:53.670> other

CRISPR red shrimp and many other

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.660 
CRISPR red shrimp and many other
variations<00:00:54.269> of<00:00:54.809> shrimp<00:00:55.079> where<00:00:55.670> its

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
variations of shrimp where its

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.880 
variations of shrimp where its
classified<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.329> CB<00:00:58.019> a<00:00:58.289> s<00:00:58.910> SS<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.090> triple<00:01:00.420> s<00:01:00.539> and

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
classified as CB a s SS or triple s and

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.560 
classified as CB a s SS or triple s and
triple<00:01:01.890> s<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.550> highest<00:01:02.760> grade<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
triple s is just the highest grade and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.070 
triple s is just the highest grade and
obviously<00:01:04.410> can<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.480> notate<00:01:06.480> that<00:01:06.540> C<00:01:06.960> as

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
obviously can you can notate that C as

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.870 
obviously can you can notate that C as
the<00:01:07.230> lowest<00:01:07.380> grade<00:01:09.560> I'm<00:01:10.560> extremely<00:01:10.950> happy<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
the lowest grade I'm extremely happy the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.270 
the lowest grade I'm extremely happy the
crystal<00:01:12.270> red<00:01:12.390> shrimp<00:01:12.660> have<00:01:12.840> been<00:01:12.990> breeding

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
crystal red shrimp have been breeding

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.670 
crystal red shrimp have been breeding
successfully<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:15.240> frequently<00:01:15.930> over<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
successfully more frequently over the

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
last couple weeks and I haven't really

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.270 
last couple weeks and I haven't really
done<00:01:19.200> anything<00:01:19.440> different<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:19.980> think<00:01:20.010> they're

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
done anything different I think they're

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.700 
done anything different I think they're
just<00:01:20.430> really<00:01:20.790> well<00:01:20.940> established<00:01:21.150> now<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.170> feel

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
just really well established now I feel

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.970 
just really well established now I feel
comfortable<00:01:22.950> with<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.520> environment<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.980> you

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
comfortable with the environment and you

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.410 
comfortable with the environment and you
got<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:26.310> patient<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.910> can't<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.300> expect

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
got to be patient you can't just expect

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.020 
got to be patient you can't just expect
them<00:01:27.870> to<00:01:27.930> breed<00:01:28.350> right<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> gate<00:01:29.100> yeah

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
them to breed right out of the gate yeah

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.760 
them to breed right out of the gate yeah
give<00:01:30.240> them<00:01:30.360> time<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> acclimate<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.560> water

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
give them time to acclimate to the water

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.650 
give them time to acclimate to the water
and<00:01:32.100> obviously<00:01:33.740> get<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.010> mood<00:01:35.600> here's<00:01:36.600> a

shrimps along with a buried crystal red

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.860 
shrimps along with a buried crystal red
shrimp<00:01:40.590> as<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.820> see<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.360> babies<00:01:42.720> are

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
shrimp as you can see the babies are

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.200 
shrimp as you can see the babies are
about<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.050> mirror<00:01:43.410> image<00:01:43.620> of<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.460> adults<00:01:44.940> you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
about a mirror image of the adults you

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.000 
about a mirror image of the adults you
can<00:01:45.360> even<00:01:45.510> tell<00:01:45.900> the<00:01:46.050> patterns<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.830> what

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
can even tell the patterns and what

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.670 
can even tell the patterns and what
grade<00:01:47.280> they<00:01:47.520> are<00:01:47.960> already<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.290> they're<00:01:49.410> just

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
grade they are already and they're just

00:01:49.680 --> 00:02:00.990 
grade they are already and they're just
born<00:01:49.980> you<00:01:50.700> know<00:01:50.730> a<00:01:50.820> couple<00:01:51.090> weeks<00:01:51.390> ago

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.120 

here<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:01.690> can<00:02:01.840> see<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.110> size<00:02:02.320> comparison<00:02:02.830> of

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
here you can see the size comparison of

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.200 
here you can see the size comparison of
a<00:02:03.220> shrimp<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.910> an<00:02:04.120> adult<00:02:04.510> crystal<00:02:05.230> red<00:02:05.380> shrimp
