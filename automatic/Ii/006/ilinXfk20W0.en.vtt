00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.190
 Hello everyone and today I will tell you about 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.160
 Cambre orchid I got it 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.020
 collections a couple of months ago and now 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.060
 I have some information 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.060
 which I would like to share with you 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.800
 grow like a tropical plant 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.920
 cambrian priests need increased 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.960
 humidity and so I close it and 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.880
 every day will be from such 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.370
 spray gun that increase moisture 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.040
 also ski with miltonia 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.230
 and there are small because already 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.140
 I really need additional benefits so that 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.370
 I have them 2 are in very good 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.710
 companies and field dwelling somewhere in time 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.980
 2 weeks but I soak her very well 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.710
 in pots and yesterday I had watering see 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.199
 it's all wet but my substrate is punishment 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.359
 starting ground and with perlite and spheres 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.740
 top I put sphagnum could to 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.900
 retain this moisture but between watering it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.909
 orchids should dry very well 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.000
 so I water it every two weeks 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.070
 even in summer I also have a pot 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.369
 many holes for extra 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:25.170
 ventilation in principle this is true for 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.430
 all orchids propagate it ahi d.s. 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.100
 sura bombs 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.159
 or bombs here so here I have 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.110
 there are two shoots behind 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.329
 after flowering after archived from 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.930
 bodies on usually releases two large 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.180
 scion well or how much you will have and 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.820
 then to the beginning of flowering here 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.759
 bulbs form so they 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.799
 breed as I said what to separate 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.329
 bulby is not worth itself in them 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.210
 contains additional nutrients 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.280
 items for plants if you them 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.549
 it will be very difficult to separate this plant 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.799
 he will have to recover 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.539
 but if you have bulbs replaced it 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.370
 better either unscrew 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.690
 either slowly cut off so as not to 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.030
 disturb the structure of temperature plants 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.110
 the contents of this orchid 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:26.069
 same as others somewhere minimum 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.450
 15 degrees in the winter and no more than 30 and 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.590
 of course if you are over thirty 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.470
 passed him home he can't himself 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.180
 cool your home then they will obviously be in 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.980
 okay well i mean they don't love for 30 but 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.090
 they won't die if you come out 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.430
 somewhere 35 even 40 is pretty orchids 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.440
 light-requiring and therefore put it 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.840
 closer to the window but not to direct solar 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.690
 rays because the sun can burn 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.060
 such thin little leaves but you always 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.780
 can be guided by the color of the leaves 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.269
 is it enough orchid lighting if 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.030
 your leaves have become emerald green 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.910
 colors are a direct indication that 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.140
 you do not have enough lighting move and 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.430
 closer to the window 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.470
 if your leaves have turned yellow then this 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.299
 direct indicator that this is too much 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.790
 light and then and and move away from the window and 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.160
 replant like an orchid 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.380
 worth it so often try 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.780
 pick a bigger pot because 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.450
 transplants it on average 1 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.760
 the weather is only if the substrate has started 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.850
 decompose if your substrate puts in 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.970
 normal state then you don't worry 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.150
 transplants and if the roots are still not yet 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.760
 rested against the cows of the wall of your pot 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.320
 then you should not repot because 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.470
 this is another injury 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:56.070
 orchid but by and large it is an orchid 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:01.440
 very easy to maintain and do not need anything 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:03.810
 so specific i think it will be 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.730
 very cool orchids for any home 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.720
 because moisture somewhere has to be 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.090
 50 percent is typical for most 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.890
 houses 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:18.880
 unless she could not have low and and became 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:22.000
 like life is blooming she is very beautiful 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.720
 flowers held about a month and it was 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.970
 all I know about the cambria orchid 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.100
 I hope this helps you I wish you all 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.100
 good mood as far as
