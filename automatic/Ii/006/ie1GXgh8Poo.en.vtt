the new puppies are going to be able to
have<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:15.900> she<00:02:15.959> doesn't<00:02:16.830> really<00:02:17.040> know<00:02:17.250> any

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
have so she doesn't really know any

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.710 
have so she doesn't really know any
better<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.760> she's<00:02:18.000> old<00:02:18.180> enough<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.420> it's

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
better and she's old enough that it's

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.990 
better and she's old enough that it's
kind<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.050> hard<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.410> break<00:02:20.280> her<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.489> that<00:02:20.640> habit

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
kind of hard to break her of that habit

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.910 
kind of hard to break her of that habit
so<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.900> idea<00:02:22.019> is<00:02:22.290> we're<00:02:22.560> going<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.709> go<00:02:22.890> ahead

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
so the idea is we're going to go ahead

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.660 
so the idea is we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:23.159> keep<00:02:23.370> her<00:02:23.609> let<00:02:23.939> her<00:02:23.969> manage<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:25.019> goats

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
and keep her let her manage the goats

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.030 
and keep her let her manage the goats
the<00:02:26.240> new<00:02:26.360> puppy<00:02:26.780> will<00:02:27.110> have<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.590> little<00:02:27.890> bit

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
the new puppy will have a little bit

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.210 
the new puppy will have a little bit
freer<00:02:28.310> access<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.390> his<00:02:30.290> responsibilities

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
freer access and his responsibilities

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.800 
freer access and his responsibilities
will<00:02:31.489> be<00:02:31.900> everything<00:02:32.900> else<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:34.150> that's<00:02:35.150> kind

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
will be everything else so that's kind

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.050 
will be everything else so that's kind
of<00:02:35.840> what<00:02:36.020> we're<00:02:36.140> hoping<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.530> accomplish<00:02:37.060> see

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
of what we're hoping to accomplish see

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.940 
of what we're hoping to accomplish see
how<00:02:38.180> well<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.569> works<00:02:38.810> with<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.500> other<00:02:39.620> the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
how well it works with the other the

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.220
