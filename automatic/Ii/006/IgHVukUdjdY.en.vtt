00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.380
 minecraft 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.019
 well what 's the first update in my 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.230
 This city appeared such a mini 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:27.310
 camp less camp we have a studio 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.380
 as always here these stools we have 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.180

 boiler where we have a filled sensor 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.309

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.390
 or that no cook let's say sausages here 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.420
 I think this is the best 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.440
 option we have four more tents 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.480

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.429

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.940
 let's go straight to this station here 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.580
 I think even more convenient to be here and do not even 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.790
 only this station is ours 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.490

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.000
 update by the way the next update 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.160
 will be about the abandoned building and about the new 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.650
 prospectus we do a lot of things updated 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.080
 although not so much in principle but 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.960
 let's see here in principle our 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.880
 new abandoned building basically this 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.070
 unfinished some office let it be 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.260

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.090

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.370
 places on the left well there you understand 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.700

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.060
 windows live here just like that in a human 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.890

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.920
 here you can go Xin still such a fence 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.440
 Well around here such we've got nothing 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.110
 there is no interesting 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.140
 empty dummy that's nothing interesting 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.090
 there is no these columns are well 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.980
 Of course, the stairs to the second floor but 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.050
 there too there were interesting here with us 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.910
 such spiers are worth well too 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.709
 let's put the roof but for example 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.170
 already wanted to make a cover but 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.600
 Well, as always, here we have St. Petersburg 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.730
 the budget does not allow them, as always us 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.960

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.870
 long build 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.450
 and in principle there is still a new avenue 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.320

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.020

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.990
 there were residential buildings 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.530

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:16.320

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.880
 there's nothing really interesting here 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.930
 the layouts are the same here are the 3 front doors 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.540
