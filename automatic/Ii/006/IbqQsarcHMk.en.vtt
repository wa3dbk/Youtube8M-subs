00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.320
 hi here today in character I'm going to 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.299
 teach how to make a recipe super easy 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.920
 to make cupcakes and I 'll give you one 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.630
 Very pretty idea of ​​how you can 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.029
 decorate them because we are going to put a 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.710
 rainbow on top is very simple like this 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.779
 let's see how you do it first 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.579
 what we need is wheat flour and 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.439
 We are going to occupy only 10 tablespoons 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.540
 that you spoons and about 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.259
 same size as the friend we are going to occupy 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.660
 bitumen a cup of nutella coloring 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.270
 blue vegetable we are also going to occupy some 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.739
 sweets that look like rainbows and two eggs 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.570
 and they are all the ingredients for 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.850
 our cupcakes a tray for 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.190
 cupcakes and layers and those of the colors 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.930
 what you want 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.519
 let's start by adding the 10 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.260
 tablespoons of flour to our 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.780
 bowl 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.989
 the two eggs 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.760
 and the cup of nutella and let's beat 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.769
 completely with a spatula or with a 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.600
 balloon until all the 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.190
 ingredients and you do not have any group left 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.839
 at the beginning it's going to be a bit difficult 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.339
 because the mixture will be very dry 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.320
 until they start to incorporate well 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.880
 all liquid ingredients and that is 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.430
 the consistency that our 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.259
 mixture is quite thick we are going to occupy 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.240
 a spoon to fill our layers 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.159
 and we were going to be filling our 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.020
 layers and llos with the mixture but remember 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.670
 leave one centimeter before reaching the 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.200
 edge because they are going to fluff a little 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.820
 when we get to bake then not 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.170
 we want it to be tool and now 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.780
 we are going to take them to our oven 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.210
 previously preheated to 210 degrees 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.009
 centigrade for 20 minutes while 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.170
 from our cupcakes we are going to paint 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.000
 our colored bitumen and we're going to 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.460
 divide about 3 tablespoons to leave the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.319
 bitumen like this white color and the rest 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.580
 we are going to paint it with blue see adding 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:41.830
 the dye drops until 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.330
 get the blue you want and 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.100
 then we will move it to a manga 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.170
 pastry maker and remember that you have to 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.970
 put on the tip that you want and you go to 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.920
 do the same with the bitumen that was left over from 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.330
 white color that we will occupy for 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.120
 make the clouds of our activists 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.090
 after 20 minutes we take our 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.500
 from the oven and they should be ready and 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.660
 now we have to let them cool 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.070
 because if we put the beto one hour 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.050
 it's going to melt everything and it's not going to last 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.000
 our did once cold you're going to cut 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.800
 a piece of candy that is in the form of 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.690
 rainbow and we will occupy first 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.220
 our pastry bag full of bitumen 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.710
 blue and we're going to cover the entire surface 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.750
 with blue color just like I am 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.850
 doing and now with the color white 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.560
 you'll just make two small points I 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.720
 occupy a star- shaped tip and 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.670
 that's why I came out that way we're going to take 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.590
 our sweet in the form of rainbow and what 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.680
 let's fit the fair in the dots 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.799
 whites we just made and ready 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.420
 is going to do with all your cupcakes 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.280
 it's a very, very easy way to decorate it 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.840
 if the truth is super beautiful 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.790
 when you bite taste 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.799
 of vanilla with bitumen the taste of 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.390
 chocolate with nutella and you have that 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.250
 bittersweet flavor that brings our sweet 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.659
 in the form of a rainbow I hope you 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.040
 I really liked this recipe remember 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.329
 that if you are going to put into practice you do not 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.340
 forget to send me a photo to my networks 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.290
 with the Nabón hashtag and with the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.090
 hashtag craft and show remember that they 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.560
 they look at these cartridges of banyas and we 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.560
 we see in the next video by
