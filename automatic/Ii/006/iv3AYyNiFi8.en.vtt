00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.250
 not a single big family meal are 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.450
 these little ones then intersperses the hole 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.420
 Normand brings us to Normandy 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.530
 and there attention sorbet apple green apple 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.470
 and of course calvados 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.910
 go away then I have them 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.439
 three elements I started by doing 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.640
 a little green apple juliette 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.340
 we take a green apple a little bit 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.039
 acid you see you cut it very hungry 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.550
 like that so we leave the skin I 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.550
 take a visual effect 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.079
 Here you cut it very finely you 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.520
 stack them up and you 'll make women 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.510
 thundered like that the start that he is 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.340
 not because there is a little bit of 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.320
 skin tuning because makes the skin go 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.370
 give a small visionary side to 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.280
 Julian you do last to do it 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.860
 a small gift of poor people with the choice 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.989
 aside a little bit it really does 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.280
 especially the facts as an employee in 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.840
 the glasses it's really good 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.070
 but pan of notching looks we have 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.000
 slapped greens that is to say we put 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.250
 greens for a long time at 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.790
 freezer and sending that are frosted that 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.939
 allows to keep the sorbet then we do 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.990
 with 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.280
 either a bull spoon or a 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.320
 Convoy spoon soak in water 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.700
 hot do you soak your well 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.049
 to cook in the hot water makes us a 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.290
 pretty connell like that okay that's fine 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.290
 basically 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.100
 I advise you to go out we have a 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.580
 commercial ice cream to an apple sorbet 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.290
 trade 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.280
 I advise you to take out a half 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.140
 hour in the advanced so that they are not 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.560
 too hard agree I tempered cook 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.540
 in hot water 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.870
 that's a pretty connell up 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.500
 in the background we will put the julienne of 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.890
 leeks open like this here the titan 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.240
 steal a car and now we're going 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.460
 put a little bit of calvados 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.240
 above plus or month and of course 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.940
 that to consume in moderation 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.190
 that's it for the grown-ups I know 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.240
 for the good ones also we showed you 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.740
 how to make a Norman hole you have 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.970
 seen it's simple it's good then in the middle 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.970
 a meal that refreshes
