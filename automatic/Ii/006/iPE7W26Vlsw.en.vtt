 episode of our series building 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.779
 that I actually changed the name of the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.900
 series exactly as you have seen is by 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.789
 title now the name of the series will be the show 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.400
 average or found meters I'll be 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.590
 deciding but you should probably 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.130

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.170

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.910
 is that map stop here as 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.100
 You know what I did here in the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.570
 channel already and if it stops here that is more 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.410
 a warmth as I had spoken to 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.899
 you 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.940
 and here then I did the second part is 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.690
 good that we have a few plates 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.070
 huh 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.050
 Welcome to the second part of the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.890
 I hope you enjoy good luck for 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.289
 shogun gamer 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.570
 Good, I wanted to let you know that you've already left. 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.530
 the minecraft version 1.4 that actually 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.420
 is 1.4.2 has returned using it since 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.580
 you can see that you have some items and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.960
 That's enough stuff I did not 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.970
 I made a video explaining why I already have 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.640
 enough people to do so I wanted to give 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.470
 space for them so good let's get to it 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.810
 Good, next, guys. Me, like I always do. 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.790
 I did a time lapse of or 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.770
 built here all away according to 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.150
 channel and if you want to check it 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.280
 my why according to the channel so that in 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.080
 description of the video yeah i want 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.720
 remember that these people here are more 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.460
 based on so send to be the first 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.890
 part not so easy but also 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.500
 not so difficult then sendic is a bit 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.450
 Easy is a little difficult here these are 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.820
 these stairs I put a type 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.710
 to do a check point and so this 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.329
 way at least for you to fall power 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.000
 come back because it's really going to be a 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.979
 survival that I have in the creative 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.960
 Map when you get down will be in the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.399
 Good survivor here we have one 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.829
 checkpoint first is that when you 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.210
 Come back here, you 're going to make a fucking jump. 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.520
 have to fall in the range that if not you 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.679
 will take some nasty damage and 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.539
 because I also wanted to remind you to be 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.280
 it may surprise the strange noise of 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.289
 but it is because of the date of 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.240
 particularly new update I particularly 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.610
 I liked the new sounds. I did not think it was bad. 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.900
 but could have improved a little more or 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.180
 even the owner 's noise the noise is 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.690
 What do you do when you fall? 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.090
 thing could be shown that the 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.459
 old crack in betas when doing certain 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.470
 but then this country I even lose myself 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.910
 Here I am not aiming for you 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.799
 complete this from here 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.900
 and look it's actually based on sounds 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.640
 he is very small because the 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.700
 next as I go, I go 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.200
 increasing the size of beauty parks 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.180
 here then we are at the end is 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.040
 Congratulations, you have reached the second part of 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.630
 Parkour I hope you enjoyed it there 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.970
 The gamer is that we have some 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.819
 guys here in the club and the skeleton 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.500
 here's a bummer to get your reward and 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.299
 so on 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.670
 wellington this was the video of today I 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.319
 I wanted to show you here my 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.090
 in the second part of the boat that I 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.340
 I built here you will have enough 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.040
 I 've been looking for or sending you who wants 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.190
 train a little bit more than parkour 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.730
 so lets say the nerd blocks are like this 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.530
 huh 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.090
