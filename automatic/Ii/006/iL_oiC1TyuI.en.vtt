00:00:00.017 --> 00:00:01.050
(male narrator)
In this video,

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.037
we will begin
to take a look

00:00:03.037 --> 00:00:05.073
at square roots
of negative numbers.

00:00:05.073 --> 00:00:07.040
Currently,
we have no number

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.040
that when it's squared
would equal a -1.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.087
So to make
this solvable,

00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:17.070
what we will do is create
a new type of number.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.090
We will call this number
a "complex number,"

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.080
which we will represent
by the letter i.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.090
The square root of -1 is i,
and if we square both sides,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.057
it will clear
the square root,

00:00:29.057 --> 00:00:33.097
telling us that i squared
is equal to -1.

00:00:33.097 --> 00:00:37.063
Now, we can calculate
the square root of -25,

00:00:37.063 --> 00:00:40.073
because we'll have
the square root of the negative,

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.090
which we can think of
as a factor of -1,

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.093
and 25
is 5 squared.

00:00:46.093 --> 00:00:49.073
The square root
of -1 is i,

00:00:49.073 --> 00:00:54.007
and the square root
of 5 squared is 5.

00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:58.043
This means the answer--
the square root of -25--

00:00:58.043 --> 00:01:00.043
will be simply 5i.

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:02.053
In this video,

00:01:02.053 --> 00:01:05.027
we're going to be simplifying
expressions with radicals,

00:01:05.027 --> 00:01:07.060
where we must
always reduce...

00:01:11.047 --> 00:01:13.047
the radical first.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.067
Also remember,
before reducing...

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.000
with fractions, we must be
first sure to factor...

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.020
and then reduce the fraction.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.017
Let's try some examples
where we do just that.

00:01:35.017 --> 00:01:36.047
In this problem,

00:01:36.047 --> 00:01:38.093
we're going to simplify
the radical first

00:01:38.093 --> 00:01:43.033
by finding
the prime factorization of 300.

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:45.033
Notice the negative
in there

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:49.083
is just gonna be represented
with the factor of -1.

00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:53.067
Prime factorization
of 300--

00:01:53.067 --> 00:02:01.010
by dividing by 2, 150 times;
2, 75 times; 3, 25 times;

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.027
5, 5 times;
and 5, once--

00:02:04.027 --> 00:02:10.033
tells us the 300 is 2 squared,
times 3, times 5 squared--

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:13.033
all over 5.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:18.007
We can take the square root
of 2 squared is just 2;

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:21.007
the square root
of 5 squared is just 5;

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:24.080
and also, now we know
the square root of -1

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.007
we have defined as i.

00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:33.047
This means we now have
15 plus; 2 times 5, or 10i;

00:02:33.047 --> 00:02:38.063
and left inside the square root
is 3 over 5.

00:02:38.063 --> 00:02:40.030
Before we're allowed
to reduce,

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.093
we'll want to factor
the numerator.

00:02:42.093 --> 00:02:45.027
There is
a common factor of 5,

00:02:45.027 --> 00:02:51.053
leaving 3 plus 2i,
square root of 3, over 5.

00:02:51.053 --> 00:02:55.043
Now, we can divide out the 5s,
leaving our final answer:

00:02:55.043 --> 00:02:59.060
3 plus 2i, square root of 3.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.023
Let's try another example
where we have to use the fact

00:03:04.023 --> 00:03:06.067
that the square root
of -1 is i

00:03:06.067 --> 00:03:10.003
in order to simplify
the problem.

00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:11.043
In this problem, again,

00:03:11.043 --> 00:03:14.017
we have a negative
inside the square root.

00:03:14.017 --> 00:03:19.023
We'll represent that negative
with the factor of -1.

00:03:19.023 --> 00:03:21.013
Again, just as before,

00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:23.050
we'll find
the prime factorization of 80

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.040
by dividing by 2, 40 times;
2, 20 times;

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.033
2, 10 times;
and 2, 5 times.

00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:36.067
We have 2 to the fourth times 5,
and this is all over 8.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.047
Now, we can simplify
the square root

00:03:41.047 --> 00:03:44.047
by dividing the exponent
by the index:

00:03:44.047 --> 00:03:48.080
4 divided by 2 tells us
that two 2s must come out.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.023
The square root of -1,
again, we know is i.

00:03:54.023 --> 00:03:58.087
Now, we have 20;
plus 2 squared, or 4i;

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:03.043
square root of 5;
over 8.

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:05.053
Again, before we're allowed
to reduce,

00:04:05.053 --> 00:04:07.093
we must factor
the numerator:

00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:10.063
20 and 4 are both
divisible by 4,

00:04:10.063 --> 00:04:17.010
giving us 4 times 5, plus i,
square root of 5, over 8.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.043
And now, we can reduce
the factors:

00:04:19.043 --> 00:04:22.020
4 and 8 are both divisible by 4,

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.013
leaving 2 in the denominator.

00:04:25.013 --> 00:04:26.077
For our final answer,

00:04:26.077 --> 00:04:31.060
we have 5 plus i,
square root of 5, over 2.

00:04:34.077 --> 00:04:38.073
By defining the i
as the square root of -1,

00:04:38.073 --> 00:04:41.020
and i squared as just -1,

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.047
we're able
to simplify expressions

00:04:43.047 --> 00:04:46.013
that before had no solution.
