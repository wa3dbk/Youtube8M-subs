it but to me what I connect with most
deeply<00:00:36.429> is<00:00:36.730> that<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:38.530> know<00:00:38.620> love<00:00:38.859> story

and feelings of shame and unworthiness

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.190 
and feelings of shame and unworthiness
but<00:02:41.879> those<00:02:42.510> are<00:02:42.950> precursors<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.690> either<00:02:45.690> acts

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
but those are precursors to either acts

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.949 
but those are precursors to either acts
of<00:02:46.440> heroism<00:02:46.680> or<00:02:47.040> acts<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.400> destruction<00:02:47.959> you

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
of heroism or acts of destruction you

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.960 
of heroism or acts of destruction you
know<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.650> they<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.430> back<00:02:50.579> stories<00:02:50.880> of

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
know and and they the back stories of

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.370 
know and and they the back stories of
these<00:02:51.060> characters<00:02:51.239> are<00:02:51.480> often<00:02:51.750> very<00:02:51.780> similar

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
these characters are often very similar

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.650 
these characters are often very similar
but<00:02:52.950> it's<00:02:53.099> how<00:02:53.250> they<00:02:53.430> react<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.060> that

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
but it's how they react to that that

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.380 
but it's how they react to that that
defines<00:02:55.019> their<00:02:55.260> characters<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.069> and<00:02:56.430> it's

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
defines their characters and and it's

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.750 
defines their characters and and it's
it's<00:02:57.629> something<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.200> think<00:02:58.410> we<00:02:59.010> all<00:02:59.400> can

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
it's something that I think we all can

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.180 
it's something that I think we all can
identify<00:02:59.940> with<00:03:00.360> on<00:03:00.599> a<00:03:00.629> very<00:03:00.840> basic<00:03:01.049> level<00:03:01.349> but

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
identify with on a very basic level but

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.559 
identify with on a very basic level but
it's<00:03:02.310> played<00:03:02.519> out<00:03:02.549> on<00:03:02.730> an<00:03:02.940> extraordinarily

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
it's played out on an extraordinarily

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.830 
it's played out on an extraordinarily
large<00:03:04.079> canvas<00:03:04.680> well<00:03:05.610> why<00:03:06.030> do<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.239> think<00:03:06.450> AMC

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
large canvas well why do you think AMC

playful fun hero that that comes from

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.500 
playful fun hero that that comes from
comic<00:03:19.260> books<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:19.680> love<00:03:20.180> but<00:03:21.180> he's<00:03:21.269> having

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
comic books that we love but he's having

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.030 
comic books that we love but he's having
to<00:03:21.600> confront<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.109> face<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.319> evil<00:03:22.650> for<00:03:22.980> the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
to confront the face of evil for the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.289 
to confront the face of evil for the
first<00:03:23.250> time<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:23.819> going<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.000> transform

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
first time and it's going to transform

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.660 
first time and it's going to transform
him<00:03:24.780> forever<00:03:25.109> and<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.889> think<00:03:26.370> this<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.519> an

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
him forever and I think this is an

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.330 
him forever and I think this is an
episode<00:03:27.090> in<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.269> comics<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:28.340> probably

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
episode in the comics that is probably

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.069 
episode in the comics that is probably
one<00:03:29.549> of<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:29.700> most<00:03:29.790> controversial<00:03:30.329> but<00:03:30.780> most

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
one of the most controversial but most

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.170 
one of the most controversial but most
provocative<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.980> interesting<00:03:32.130> stories<00:03:33.030> and

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
provocative and interesting stories and

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.080 
provocative and interesting stories and
all<00:03:33.269> comics<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.780> change<00:03:34.260> comic<00:03:34.799> books<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.250> I

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
all comics that change comic books and I

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.559 
all comics that change comic books and I
think<00:03:36.299> it's<00:03:36.510> an<00:03:36.630> important<00:03:37.400> moment<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:39.299> that

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
think it's an important moment that that

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.229 
think it's an important moment that that
people<00:03:40.019> I<00:03:40.079> think<00:03:40.139> we'll<00:03:40.380> be<00:03:41.000> talking<00:03:42.000> about

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
people I think we'll be talking about

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.360 
people I think we'll be talking about
for<00:03:42.359> a<00:03:42.599> while<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:43.049> think<00:03:43.530> spider-man<00:03:43.739> fans<00:03:44.190> and

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
for a while I think spider-man fans and
