said as a social experiment that's what

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.190 
said as a social experiment that's what
I'm<00:03:42.030> engaging<00:03:42.360> in<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:42.720> because<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:42.960> haven't

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
I'm engaging in it because I haven't

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.050 
I'm engaging in it because I haven't
been<00:03:43.380> out<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.770> the<00:03:43.860> dating<00:03:43.890> world<00:03:44.550> in<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:44.880> while

been out of the dating world in a while

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.720 
been out of the dating world in a while
so<00:03:45.390> I'm<00:03:45.450> just<00:03:45.660> like<00:03:45.840> what<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:46.380> that<00:03:46.410> all<00:03:46.680> about

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
so I'm just like what is that all about

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.060 
so I'm just like what is that all about
but<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.910> do<00:03:48.150> find<00:03:48.540> that<00:03:48.840> it's<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:49.710> interesting

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
but I do find that it's so interesting

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.470 
but I do find that it's so interesting
to<00:03:50.340> me<00:03:50.490> the<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:52.200> time<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.620> we're<00:03:52.770> living<00:03:52.920> in

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
to me the the time that we're living in

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.050 
to me the the time that we're living in
the<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:55.140> reasons<00:03:55.650> for<00:03:55.770> doing<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.310> are<00:03:56.580> correct

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
the the reasons for doing it are correct

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.120 
the the reasons for doing it are correct
but<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.690> end<00:03:57.960> result<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.590> don't<00:03:58.800> think<00:03:58.860> can

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
but the end result I don't think can

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.290 
but the end result I don't think can
never<00:03:59.280> be<00:03:59.460> fulfilled<00:03:59.610> because<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.270> thing

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
never be fulfilled because the thing

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.390 
never be fulfilled because the thing
that<00:04:00.570> we're<00:04:00.720> really<00:04:00.900> looking<00:04:01.170> for<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:01.950> the

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
that we're really looking for in the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.130 
that we're really looking for in the
phones<00:04:02.640> are<00:04:03.060> never<00:04:03.570> going<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.840> be<00:04:03.930> fulfilled

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
phones are never going to be fulfilled

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.720 
phones are never going to be fulfilled
that<00:04:04.500> way<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:04.920> then<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.310> had<00:04:05.520> a<00:04:05.550> really

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
that way and then I had a really

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.100 
that way and then I had a really
interesting<00:04:05.970> experiment<00:04:06.390> that<00:04:06.720> validated

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
interesting experiment that validated

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.010 
interesting experiment that validated

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
he feels like he could do better in life

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.180 
he feels like he could do better in life
and<00:06:13.880> with<00:06:14.300> and<00:06:14.509> he<00:06:14.599> says<00:06:14.810> that<00:06:14.990> he<00:06:15.320> feels<00:06:15.560> he

and with and he says that he feels he
most<00:06:16.460> easily<00:06:16.699> communicates<00:06:17.449> through<00:06:17.780> letters

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
most easily communicates through letters

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.310 
most easily communicates through letters
and<00:06:18.320> text<00:06:18.650> and<00:06:18.770> then<00:06:18.889> he<00:06:19.610> said<00:06:19.880> do<00:06:20.449> I<00:06:20.509> feel<00:06:20.930> like

I'm<00:06:21.530> an<00:06:21.650> expert<00:06:21.979> in<00:06:22.159> having<00:06:22.610> a<00:06:22.699> normal

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
I'm an expert in having a normal

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.620 
I'm an expert in having a normal
conversation<00:06:23.570> face-to-face<00:06:25.449> absolutely<00:06:26.449> not

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
conversation face-to-face absolutely not

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.500 
conversation face-to-face absolutely not
and<00:06:26.900> then<00:06:27.860> he<00:06:27.949> goes<00:06:28.099> on<00:06:28.280> to<00:06:28.340> say<00:06:28.490> that's<00:06:29.120> not<00:06:29.330> my

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
and then he goes on to say that's not my

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.589 
and then he goes on to say that's not my
natural<00:06:29.570> state<00:06:30.789> then<00:06:31.789> it<00:06:31.970> sort<00:06:32.180> of<00:06:32.270> becomes

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
natural state then it sort of becomes

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.089 
natural state then it sort of becomes
this<00:06:32.900> I<00:06:33.139> think<00:06:33.740> a<00:06:33.860> very<00:06:33.889> interesting

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:36.099 
this I think a very interesting

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.670 
this I think a very interesting
conundrum<00:06:37.099> of<00:06:37.550> is<00:06:37.820> it<00:06:38.270> not<00:06:38.599> once<00:06:39.080> natural

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
conundrum of is it not once natural

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.149 
conundrum of is it not once natural
state<00:06:40.010> because<00:06:40.729> we<00:06:40.940> become<00:06:41.360> so<00:06:41.750> tech<00:06:42.500> driven

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159 
state because we become so tech driven

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.879 
state because we become so tech driven
that<00:06:43.699> then<00:06:43.909> we<00:06:44.090> lose<00:06:44.570> our<00:06:44.960> connection<00:06:45.169> to<00:06:45.590> what

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:45.889 
that then we lose our connection to what

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:48.520 
that then we lose our connection to what
it<00:06:46.010> really<00:06:46.190> means<00:06:46.490> to<00:06:46.759> actually<00:06:47.659> feel<00:06:48.020> through

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
it really means to actually feel through

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.620 
it really means to actually feel through
somebody<00:06:48.979> feel<00:06:49.340> with<00:06:49.639> somebody<00:06:50.090> look

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
somebody feel with somebody look

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.200 
somebody feel with somebody look
somebody<00:06:51.050> in<00:06:51.080> the<00:06:51.169> eyes<00:06:51.759> stand<00:06:52.759> in<00:06:52.909> line<00:06:52.940> at

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
somebody in the eyes stand in line at

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.089 
somebody in the eyes stand in line at
the<00:06:53.240> bay<00:06:53.479> and<00:06:53.810> actually<00:06:54.409> smile<00:06:54.680> at<00:06:54.889> someone

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099 
the bay and actually smile at someone

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:56.649 
the bay and actually smile at someone
instead<00:06:55.580> of<00:06:55.699> just<00:06:55.849> pretending<00:06:56.270> to<00:06:56.300> be<00:06:56.449> on<00:06:56.570> the

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:56.659 
instead of just pretending to be on the

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:59.320 
instead of just pretending to be on the
phone<00:06:56.870> looking<00:06:57.500> at<00:06:57.620> nonsense<00:06:58.070> so<00:06:58.789> again<00:06:59.150> it

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
phone looking at nonsense so again it

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.749 
phone looking at nonsense so again it
comes<00:06:59.509> back<00:06:59.690> to<00:07:00.080> how<00:07:00.380> do<00:07:00.440> we<00:07:00.740> try<00:07:01.070> to<00:07:01.130> policy

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 
comes back to how do we try to policy

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.520 
comes back to how do we try to policy
ourselves<00:07:02.419> so<00:07:02.870> you<00:07:02.930> get<00:07:03.169> the<00:07:03.289> information

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
ourselves so you get the information

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.770 
ourselves so you get the information
that<00:07:03.830> you<00:07:04.039> need<00:07:04.220> but<00:07:04.669> you<00:07:04.820> don't<00:07:05.030> use<00:07:05.360> it<00:07:05.389> to

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:05.780 
that you need but you don't use it to

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.200 
that you need but you don't use it to
distract<00:07:06.289> from<00:07:06.590> to<00:07:07.159> me<00:07:07.310> the<00:07:07.490> experience<00:07:07.699> why

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210 
distract from to me the experience why

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.300 
distract from to me the experience why
we're<00:07:08.360> here<00:07:08.449> on<00:07:08.570> the<00:07:08.659> planet<00:07:09.050> so<00:07:09.949> it's<00:07:10.220> not

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
we're here on the planet so it's not

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.640 
we're here on the planet so it's not
really<00:07:10.580> a<00:07:10.909> lesson<00:07:11.360> I<00:07:11.419> mean<00:07:11.539> it's<00:07:11.690> funny<00:07:12.020> and<00:07:12.229> i

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:12.650 
really a lesson I mean it's funny and i

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.100 
really a lesson I mean it's funny and i
think<00:07:12.889> i'm<00:07:13.009> sure<00:07:13.220> i<00:07:13.250> will<00:07:13.370> do<00:07:13.550> that<00:07:13.699> more<00:07:14.110> you

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
think i'm sure i will do that more you

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.409 
think i'm sure i will do that more you
know<00:07:15.259> maybe<00:07:16.070> it<00:07:16.250> is<00:07:16.370> and<00:07:16.699> i<00:07:16.849> think<00:07:16.880> i<00:07:17.120> have<00:07:17.150> to

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:17.419 
know maybe it is and i think i have to

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:18.820 
know maybe it is and i think i have to
be<00:07:17.509> reminded<00:07:17.780> of<00:07:18.050> as<00:07:18.199> well<00:07:18.349> because<00:07:18.590> it's<00:07:18.740> like

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830 
be reminded of as well because it's like

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.170 
be reminded of as well because it's like
a<00:07:18.860> new<00:07:19.039> toy<00:07:19.070> to<00:07:19.280> nervous<00:07:19.820> like<00:07:19.909> a<00:07:19.970> new<00:07:20.150> toy

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180 
a new toy to nervous like a new toy

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.570 
a new toy to nervous like a new toy
until<00:07:20.810> it's<00:07:20.990> not

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580 
until it's not

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.189 
until it's not
more<00:07:21.789> and<00:07:22.030> then<00:07:22.150> something<00:07:22.599> new<00:07:22.870> will<00:07:23.050> come

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 
more and then something new will come

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:26.249 
more and then something new will come
along<00:07:23.439> and<00:07:23.650> yet<00:07:24.460> is<00:07:24.750> it<00:07:25.750> what's<00:07:25.930> right<00:07:26.139> in

00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:26.259 
along and yet is it what's right in

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:30.330 
along and yet is it what's right in
front<00:07:26.289> of<00:07:26.530> us<00:07:26.620> enough<00:07:27.030> can<00:07:28.030> it<00:07:28.180> be<00:07:29.159> so<00:07:30.159> that's

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:30.340 
front of us enough can it be so that's

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.409 
front of us enough can it be so that's
what<00:07:30.430> we<00:07:30.490> have<00:07:30.580> to<00:07:30.699> try<00:07:30.819> to<00:07:30.879> work<00:07:31.060> with<00:07:31.120> more

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:31.419 
what we have to try to work with more

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:33.059 
what we have to try to work with more
it's<00:07:32.080> a<00:07:32.169> lot<00:07:32.349> of<00:07:32.439> what<00:07:32.530> we<00:07:32.620> talked<00:07:32.830> about<00:07:32.889> last

00:07:33.059 --> 00:07:33.069 
it's a lot of what we talked about last

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:35.670 
it's a lot of what we talked about last
night<00:07:33.400> in<00:07:33.729> the<00:07:33.849> work<00:07:34.000> and<00:07:34.270> obviously<00:07:35.199> the

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 
night in the work and obviously the

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.260 
night in the work and obviously the
connection<00:07:36.189> is<00:07:36.310> always<00:07:36.639> with<00:07:36.879> someone

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:37.270 
connection is always with someone
