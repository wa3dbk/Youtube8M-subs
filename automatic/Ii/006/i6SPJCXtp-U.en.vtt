take plugs about 34 inches out of the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.459 
take plugs about 34 inches out of the
ground<00:01:35.119> what<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> allows<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.110> couple

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
ground what it allows to do a couple

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.260 
ground what it allows to do a couple
things<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.159> puts<00:01:38.340> oxygen<00:01:38.819> back<00:01:38.939> into<00:01:39.179> the

things is it puts oxygen back into the
ground<00:01:39.509> loosens<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.229> soil<00:01:40.560> up<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.219> can

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
ground loosens the soil up so you can

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.190 
ground loosens the soil up so you can
get<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.429> better<00:01:41.610> route<00:01:41.850> system<00:01:42.119> also<00:01:42.899> allows

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
get a better route system also allows

get a better route system also allows
the<00:01:43.500> seem<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.860> actually<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.219> into<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.549> soil

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the seem to actually get into the soil

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.359 
the seem to actually get into the soil
versus<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.450> top<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.869> soil<00:01:46.049> /<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.740> it's

raining would like that and won't allow
to<00:01:49.259> see<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> wash<00:01:49.969> d<00:01:50.969> patching<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.630> actually

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
to see the wash d patching is actually

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.080 
to see the wash d patching is actually
when<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.829> cut<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> property<00:01:53.610> country<00:01:53.880> long

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
when you cut the property country long

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.940 
when you cut the property country long
too<00:01:54.329> many<00:01:54.509> times<00:01:54.780> without<00:01:54.990> bagging<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.829> it

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
too many times without bagging and it
