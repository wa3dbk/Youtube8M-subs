00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:20.650
 hello today we are going to make a atole 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:26.859
 Atole champurrado with some combinations 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:28.720
 between coconut cornstarch chocolate and dough or 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.500
 drier 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:36.280
 so then the ingredients are a 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.160
 a glass of water a cold 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:44.219
 to dissolve the drier one cup of 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:48.610
 more to one or a more dry cup and in 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.850
 prepare four tablespoons of starch 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.850
 corn 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:00.449
 sugar to taste half tablet 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.780
 chocolate and a quarter cup of coconut 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.630
 grating is to taste if you do not like it 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.690
 they do not put him and well, here I 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.450
 other side look at this on the stove already 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.880
 I'm going to put my hot water for 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.680
 it starts to boil while I 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.810
 I'm dissolving what mass is with 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.260
 the cornstarch then we are going to mix it 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.810
 well fine that no balls are left 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.000
 in the pot that I have the stove because there 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.170
 I am already adding the half tablet 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.870
 of chocolate 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.840
 then I'm going to leave it there 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.530
 boiling to undo it but to 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.909
 low fire 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.330
 so that it is not consumed because the water 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.090
 so 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.950
 I'm there stirring the dough 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.409
 how do i tell you yes 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.289
 they have closer then with drier and if 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.939
 they have the dough prepared with dough 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.619
 in this case I had her there ready and 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.070
 I did not want to throw it away and I said good 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.619
 to make my atole and there in the pot 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.239
 I'm adding the sugar because 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.849
 after the chocolate is already 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:15.709
 dissolved for later then 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:18.890
 add to my dough with cornstarch and water 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.239
 in the description box there I'm going 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.319
 to leave the complete recipe of all 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:30.420
 ingredients that I used since then 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.970
 I was sweetening this one 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.270
 my atole 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.450
 little by little as I say this 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.790
 how sweet, because everyone is very 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.600
 different truth then if the sugar 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.470
 also what you like then 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.600
 we will leave it there 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.270
 this boil for about 5 to 10 minutes and 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.880
 be taking care of it so it does not stick 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.060
 then I added another little cup of 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.610
 water because I saw that my cat was doing 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.180
 missing and then when I was 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.790
 boiling I also added my coconut 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.719
 grated 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.390
 then this it is very easy good 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:17.670
 I hope and enjoy it today if you put it 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.200
 they start doing it to prepare it 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.310
 delicious and good that's how it looks 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.700
 our cup of atole with a seed of 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.459
 wheat and then in comments I'm going to 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.079

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.790
