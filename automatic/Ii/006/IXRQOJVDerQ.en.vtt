 I try to give me some advice on how to rosico some song he has on 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.359
 sources of problems 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.890
 today we try to see some 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.099
 song that is significant 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.099
 how to play 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.470
 one of the songs that deceives will know passionate k are many guitarists who 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.690
 try to play 10 ebay sounds 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.850
 it's a song he has 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.510
 time a way of being alone very simple comments her clearly 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.800
 it becomes a lot of fun 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 let's try to feel like 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:04.290
 bunga bunga bunga mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm car tax 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.450
 mood new renaissance buddhism only 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.830
 how to feel that 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.369
 I like I use houseplants 403 eng 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.609
 milliseconds of course you can also vary in the second of the speed 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.180
 james ha 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.610
 a very important thing to get money elce 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.160
 particular with clean sounds 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.870
 when using say here is to use this particular type of plectrum 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.810
 two faces of a little bit closer than the question 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.500
 is situated 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.000
 on the internet somewhere that how to see the part above ex world champion then 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.100
 it is irregular 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.640
 this produces a particular type of whipping sound a kind of scratched 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.560
 engaged with the rope that is truly distinctive if you just try it 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.570
 smooth part 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.980
 and with the part of the deputy mayor who hears an enormous difference for me 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:16.130
 feel with the smooth part kim bum bum ummm moon moon moon and only 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.979
 who invented the term paper 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:22.109
 let's not throw ourselves 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.109
 mmmm a 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.869
 johnny 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:32.750
 the meteo.it 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.310
 another important thing uses the position of the pd doubly just absent 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.969
 the penultimate appears 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:39.869
 not last 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:40.929
 this thing 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:45.469
 very important that you could find also seeing the videos of lg 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:47.249
 that sounds from the pc 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:51.759
 the last thing to note this kind of song but not only this one 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:57.139
 The storage must be made of ropes with the palm of the hand 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.359
 otherwise you will overlap and in the end we will not be able to stay behind 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.329
 so if we don't dream by putting a lot of attention to how we ask the hand in 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.179
 this part settete 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:13.689
 bunga bunga in no time 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:19.989

 pressed to check its glass wool rope is a very important thing 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:28.379
 there is a little beautiful thing 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.369
 part of the solo of this song 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:35.459
 that then one cannot speak of ace in the case of research a way of living 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.909
 interpret this 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.399
 this is an important part 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:43.979
 the guitar parts anyway songs 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:48.529
 cyanobacteria is very simple but that counts of the beautiful direct that it has 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.279
 made monopolies mad 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:54.019
 it's a bit strange to listen to this song played without her because it is 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.339
 extremely simple I make it feel like without any of her 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:01.199
 bunga bunga bunga bunga 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.079
 only one 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.709
 pardon forgiveness 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.619
 a wagon 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:12.999
 eating is absolutely something else 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:15.709
 and there is the central part of only 10 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.739
 that still very simple but that together beyond and it will have been spectacular 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.739
 I make her feel without her 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.190
 . I'm 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:36.779

 myself 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.110
 like seeing a spectacular hotel pressure 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.280

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.099
