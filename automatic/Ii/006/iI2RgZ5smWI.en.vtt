to see at about a year a lot of failure
on<00:00:51.360> wheels<00:00:51.629> because<00:00:51.960> people<00:00:52.770> buy<00:00:52.980> them

they're lightweight they do everything

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.090 
they're lightweight they do everything
that<00:00:54.809> they<00:00:54.960> want<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.410> they<00:00:55.469> also<00:00:55.739> don't

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
realize that it's also a racing wheel so

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.799
