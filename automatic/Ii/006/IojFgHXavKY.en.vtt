00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.549
 Hello Cristina. Ciao Paolo. How are you? I am fine, how are you? All right. Look, I brought you a 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.310
 new product to make a great juice. Juices? But I already have a blender. This 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.180
 It's not a blender, it's the extractor Essenzia, let me show it to you. Ok, come on. Grace 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.550
 mille Well come Paolo, show me the extractor 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.309
 This you have told me. Sure, with pleasure. This is the Essenzia extractor and how 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.010
 I was telling you, unlike a blender, it does not have blades. And then how 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.720
 Does he make juice? This press smoothly and at low speed. 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:57.280
 But this is great! The easiest way to assemble. 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.790
 Well I like it with this we can avoid what happens sometimes with the blender that the 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.180
 The speed it takes is so high that a lot of oxygen enters the juice and could oxidize some 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.829
 vitamins, especially vitamin C for example, which is the most labile. If right. 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:14.830
 Did we try one? Let's make one rich in vitamin C. Please. 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:25.479
 We can use oranges, kiwi and strawberries. Cool! You meanwhile cut a little while and I go to 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.600
 try turning it on. Have you noticed how silent it is? Well 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:49.030
 It is true. And this fiber? It is very dry. Very dry, yes. 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.229
 But we could take advantage of it and make recipes, a cake, some cookies. Yes, yes, correct. 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.729
 Also in Italy there is, we have studied something. Do you take advantage of them? 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.100
 Yes, yes. I think it's a great idea. 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.420
 Because unlike a blender it is drier. 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.230
 Yes, it shows. And you can use it for many things. 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.150
 So we take advantage of everything. Sure, and so more juice will come out then. 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.889
 Also also. We can if you want to check it. Voucher. 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:27.340
 Yes? Voucher. We will do it with a comparison 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.279
 Well Cris, we are going to do the same as we have said but with a blender, with yours. 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:36.779
 Let's see. Let's see. Same fruit Same content We light up 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:46.419
 I do not hear you We are putting fruit. The same one that we have thrown 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:53.590
 there. Sure, the blades cut everything. 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.749
 At this rate a lot of oxygen enters the fruit. 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:14.299
 Yes, it is oxidizing a lot. And it warms up a bit, right? 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:14.489
 Yes, it could heat up. Yes, it will certainly heat up 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.180
 Also, the problem after cleaning it, you've seen it before, has been much simpler, 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.349
 do not? Look what happens to the juice, I do not see it 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.010
 so uniform. And that, because the liquefied part and the part 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.109
 fibrous, you'll see, It separates In a few moments it will separate. 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:38.129
 And the noise by the neighbors ... I do not know what they will say 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:47.689
 What do you think you're cleaning with a vacuum cleaner? 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:56.979
 I turn off the monster ... uufff ... See how it separates. 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.819
 Well, I do not think there's much to say, it's just that look. 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.639
 He has crushed it That's what happens with Essenzia and that's what 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:11.109
 go with any blender, classic With Essenzia let's pamper the fruit more. 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:16.489
 Slowness is a value. Noticeable. Well I want that 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.380
 Please. I am an Italian gentleman, before women 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.479
 forever. Look Cris, how I told you before, this 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:31.539
 summer I'm going to do 40 years, so please do something to me, give me a help 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:42.210
 40 anni, da vero? Okay, we can make an energy snack. 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.099
 Perfect We can make it with a variety of cereals, 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:51.389
 a little banana and we make a vegetable milk with almonds. 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:57.599
 What a spectacle! We can both jugs, let's put here, 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:02.810
 come on Let's throw the almonds and some water 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.389
 A little water, yes Uauuu. Wonderful 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:16.389
 This is one of the differences, for example We can also prepare Smoothies, ice cream, 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.699
 sorbets With an extractor, there are many possibilities 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:27.150
 of doing things There is a community in Italy where they spend 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.159
 recipes, ideas, things ... Yes, we can also do this ... 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:53.819
 I'm going to stop the Essenzia. The cereals ... A little banana. With a 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:06:01.860
 little honey and cinnamon, perfect! Uaauuu! This is my snack. 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.830
 Grazzie Paolo. You have convinced me, I like it. I change the blender for the extractor Essenzia. 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:13.550
 Thanks Cristina. I have loved your nutritional advice. 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.069
 Grazzia mile Essenzia
