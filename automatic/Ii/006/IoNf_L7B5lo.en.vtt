00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.310 
lived okay so that's all of the outside
petals<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.100> last<00:04:40.370> one<00:04:40.700> is<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.210> bowl<00:04:41.420> now

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
petals and the last one is the bowl now

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.150 
petals and the last one is the bowl now
we<00:04:42.380> don't<00:04:42.800> wipe<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:43.880> line<00:04:44.120> on<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:45.470> shadow<00:04:45.770> of

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
we don't wipe the line on the shadow of

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.270 
we don't wipe the line on the shadow of
the<00:04:46.460> bowl<00:04:46.640> because<00:04:46.790> it's<00:04:47.120> a<00:04:47.240> soft<00:04:47.570> fold<00:04:48.280> but

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
the bowl because it's a soft fold but

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.210 
the bowl because it's a soft fold but
what<00:04:49.490> we<00:04:49.640> do<00:04:49.850> do<00:04:50.150> is<00:04:50.450> take<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:51.230> chisel<00:04:51.470> end<00:04:51.950> of

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
what we do do is take the chisel end of

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.670 
what we do do is take the chisel end of
the<00:04:52.340> watch<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:53.320> give<00:04:54.320> ourselves<00:04:54.500> a<00:04:56.680> curvy

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
the watch and give ourselves a curvy

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:05.920 
the watch and give ourselves a curvy
wavy<00:04:58.280> line<00:05:02.350> so<00:05:03.350> again<00:05:04.090> we<00:05:05.090> put<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.630> brush

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
wavy line so again we put the brush

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:13.800
