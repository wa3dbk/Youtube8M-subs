00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.220
 love 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:22.400
 how about friends of the green route of 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.610
 possible we already have many enigmas many 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.759
 strange cases that are unresolved and 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.730
 now a new discovery arises 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:35.210
 where a star you have been named 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.760
 mausoleum and it turns out that the calculation that 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.659
 is made based on the information that 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.409
 send the satellite of the nasa is calculated 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:49.519
 that this star has between 14 and 15 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:52.039
 a billion years up there could 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.489
 seem normal but if we calculate 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.859
 that the universe only has 13 thousand 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.909
 years then is where they start to leave 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:03.310
 the doubts of how a star arises that 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.820
 it's more 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.140
 ancient that our universe we know that 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.200
 are all the theories that speak of 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.870
 the multiverses and how when these 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.730
 many universes collide new ones are created 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.540
 universes and well there are many 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.910
 possibilities that this can give us 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.830
 origin of the star there is also another 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.980
 possibility that has simply not been 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.930
 studied enough to this star 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.640
 Methuselah the star is really called 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.160
 14 02 83 h from 14 02 100 behind but 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.930
 Well, I like the name 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.130
 given of the Methuselah 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.050
 this enigma will be solved surely 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.750
 while investigating more limits the game 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.960
 also more information to see why 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.229
 are marking that big mistake of 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.670
 age or if this age of history 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.520
 Methuselah that is much older 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.720
 our universe part that explanation 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.369
 could have I think it's a note 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.490
 curious a fact that will be interesting 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.039
 as we go getting more 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.569
 information for now good I leave you 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.790
 this information is called being pretty 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.069
 strange I hope you liked it and if you 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.830
 Click on the brave path dotcom here 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:23.709
 in the league that I give you I'm going to show you 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.709
 some extra photos see you 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.000
 ah
