00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.150
 hi to all guys welcome back to those 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.529
 two on server 2 at the park park times e 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.929
 this is the second blog we do 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.550
 from the park to talk to you about the second 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.170
 topic on the agenda not in 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.400
 order of importance but as well 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.350
 we wrote it on the sheet 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.100
 the second argument is ours 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.230
 videogames because finally we are 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.900
 almost in the pipeline we 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.180
 however we have often said it speaks 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.099
 obviously of the first level as there 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.170
 we are coordinated these days 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.399
 together with the great franceschi ours 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 developer that we salute hello 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.750
 francesca you're very good hello francesco 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.719
 we love you then francesco what is 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.809
 doing is putting everyone together 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.840
 the experiences made with the first level 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.340
 of our game to speed up has 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.860
 very much the production of the second 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.170
 and the third and fourth which I then carry and 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.329
 particular as different as it is not a 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.850
 light level will not be a level 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.590
 will set the right three levels 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.500
 first the second and the third level 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.830
 all three with a different concept e 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.900
 with an exact different setting 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.260
 in fact if the big software houses 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.600
 they don't think of renewing it from time to time 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.460
 emotional thrust in trying a game 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.560
 they think 3 assholes they are doing 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.619
 a free game because every level 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.900
 will have a different mood will also have in 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.520
 some way a different gameplay e 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.270
 these three levels will be structured 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.549
 in order to completely renew the 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.500
 surprise at every start we hope to 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.340
 being able to proceed in this sense since 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.590
 however , ideas are there when when 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.689
 we'll launch the game of course we'll do it 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.150
 with a review on the first channel e 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.040
 this is our game we don't do 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.780
 review us at our game 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.299
 I would do it in my opinion one will come 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.759
 positive review yes in my opinion as well 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.310
 because these girls are good they are 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.189
 good these girls engage they have 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.270
 done a good job the game is worth that 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.270
 that costs nothing 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.960
 no well guys it's a fun little game 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.060
 that will entertain you and above all for 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.840
 all our friends youtubers because there 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.000
 they are 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.220
 there are many, even starting from 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.580
 who will have 100 members to arrive 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.410
 to those who cina 400 thousand well for them we have 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.349
 a nice surprise 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.959
 exact the game will be completely 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.510
 copyright free then the music 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.610
 we have no copyrights to you and you 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.040
 Game images are not copyright to 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.750
 you can register gameplay you can 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.400
 show what you think of the title 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.680
 no one will come to your home with the machine gun 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.810
 to recover your income is not 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.049
 in fact you can do that what 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.090
 you want and it is the best thing because not 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.700
 having problems that someone might have there 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.180
 signal the video or other 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.489
 I think for those who make gameplay and for whom 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.920
 has had problems with third parties with 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.090
 reserved content is a boon from 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.829
 sky everywhere 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.819
 we say a little more than the game from 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:03.790
 then it is a bastard en roco game that is 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.980
 a platformer actually and is inspired 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.260
 very much mario kart but it inspires us 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.670
 not in everything in the sense that in mario kart 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.380
 often does not reward your skill if 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.349
 the termoli pots you say is a 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.799
 truck is a big no trailer car e 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:23.470
 a scooter 50 a hole muffler well 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.480
 we take the disc we said we are 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.220
 inspired a lot of mario karts for what 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.079
 is the difficulty level and the 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.880
 frustration that you will find in some 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.010
 however, we are here too 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.400
 concentrate on making it feasible 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.959
 and above all at a level of 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.329
 challenge high but it is you who owe 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.299
 being good is just fucking dying 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.430
 like the mario cat or other games 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:49.000
 no not fucking die because he is a 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.769
 reggae in a range action game that does not 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.930
 I believe there is his belief that we have 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.930
 invented us who are this kind yes 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.970
 yes the game is bastard but you must also 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.280
 be very clever because it is not enough 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.349
 know the level know where where 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.940
 fall to know where the thorns are no 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.400
 you have to be good you have to have gods 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.069
 very ready reflections 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.390
 so it's much better for us than 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.819
 mario cup because it also gives you some 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.310
 satisfaction is a platform and it is 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.690
 let's remember with a depth then a 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.489
 platform let's say 3d but always 2b remains 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.039
 let's say to the style there then a 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.870
 transforms horizontal scrolling but with 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.860
 even two ways of 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.380
 display 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.870
 exact because we are two those two up 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.240
 server and in the game you can peek by 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.919
 red hat has synergy and the two characters 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.750
 they will obviously have characteristics 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.699
 different 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.370
 see you see how to play a game a 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.800
 fucking dog these two characters that 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.710
 do your special skills so you have to 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.270
 use both of them and you'll also have to 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.169
 combine both and it won't be at all 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.570
 easy 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.460
 you will find yourself in the middle of a jump to having to 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.169
 Peel the character to change the skill 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.090
 and you have to peel again 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:01.410
 in short, it is a game that aims very much at 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.539
 make you use your skill at 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.759
 Your reflexes one hundred percent not 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.370
 being a rugby im fucking hopefully 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.750
 to develop the third as soon as possible 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.590
 level because we are at the second level 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.590
 for the moment
