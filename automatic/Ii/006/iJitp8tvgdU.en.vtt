number of kills that I'm getting with

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.610

some<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.390> these<00:02:21.480> weapons<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.049> you<00:02:22.500> know<00:02:22.590> I

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
some of these weapons and you know I

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.949 
some of these weapons and you know I
just<00:02:22.739> try<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.280> use<00:02:23.730> them<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.480> general<00:02:24.930> way

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
just try to use them in a general way

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.589 
just try to use them in a general way
that<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:25.379> would<00:02:25.470> play<00:02:25.890> normally<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.819> whenever<00:02:27.540> I

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
that I would play normally so whenever I

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.569 
that I would play normally so whenever I
see<00:02:27.900> an<00:02:27.959> opportunity<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.829> use<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.190> weapon<00:02:29.459> is

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
see an opportunity to use the weapon is

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.089 
see an opportunity to use the weapon is
probably<00:02:30.090> how<00:02:30.329> I'm<00:02:30.510> going<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.840> use<00:02:31.019> it<00:02:31.170> now<00:02:31.319> and

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
probably how I'm going to use it now and

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.619 
probably how I'm going to use it now and
some<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.430> these<00:02:32.489> cases<00:02:32.670> i<00:02:32.940> feel<00:02:33.299> like<00:02:33.450> i'm

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
some of these cases i feel like i'm

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.170 
some of these cases i feel like i'm
probably<00:02:33.930> going<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.530> need<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:35.010> put<00:02:35.760> away<00:02:35.909> the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
probably going to need to put away the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.580 
probably going to need to put away the
sniper<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.659> little<00:02:36.959> bit<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.200> either<00:02:37.319> use<00:02:37.560> a

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
sniper a little bit and either use a

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.190 
sniper a little bit and either use a

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.059 
whole lot of hand cannas so with this
week<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.900> one<00:03:37.019> i<00:03:37.049> do<00:03:37.169> have<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.739> really

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
week of the one i do have that I really

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.860 
week of the one i do have that I really
want<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.280> use<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.760> last<00:03:38.970> word<00:03:39.299> I've<00:03:39.599> used

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
want to use is the last word I've used

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.520 
want to use is the last word I've used
it<00:03:40.290> in<00:03:40.379> PvE<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:40.980> small<00:03:41.579> amount<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.959> i<00:03:42.989> think<00:03:43.230> this

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
it in PvE a small amount so i think this

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.339 
it in PvE a small amount so i think this
week<00:03:43.799> probably<00:03:44.510> be<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.540> lot<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.810> last<00:03:46.109> word

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
gameplay i'll try to rotate a couple

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.110 
gameplay i'll try to rotate a couple
others<00:03:49.079> and<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.349> half<00:03:49.530> thorn<00:03:49.980> i<00:03:50.280> can<00:03:50.760> use<00:03:50.879> that

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
others and a half thorn i can use that

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.479 
others and a half thorn i can use that
one<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.650> there's<00:03:52.650> one<00:03:53.040> or<00:03:53.160> two<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:53.310> think

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
one and there's one or two I think

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.849 
one and there's one or two I think
legendaries<00:03:54.389> that<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:54.989> might<00:03:55.260> have<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.709> can

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
legendaries that I might have that I can

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.839 
legendaries that I might have that I can
also<00:03:56.010> use<00:03:56.280> up<00:03:56.489> check<00:03:56.819> my<00:03:57.030> inventory<00:03:57.599> i<00:03:57.989> think<00:03:58.739> i

also use up check my inventory i think i

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.830

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
dismantled one for some shards so that's

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.530
