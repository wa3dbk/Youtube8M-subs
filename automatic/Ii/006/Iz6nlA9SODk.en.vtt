robots we want with the DeLaval reps and
toured<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> barn<00:00:28.800> all<00:00:29.039> three<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.369> us<00:00:29.460> decided

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
toured a barn all three of us decided

that<00:00:29.970> day<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.330> were<00:00:30.390> gonna<00:00:30.480> go<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.660> robots

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
that day we were gonna go to robots

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.470 
that day we were gonna go to robots
because<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.160> too<00:00:32.309> hard<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.550> find<00:00:32.759> work<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
because it's too hard to find work and

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.340 
because it's too hard to find work and
so<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.500> work<00:00:34.649> began<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.250> October<00:00:35.760> 2011<00:00:36.450> first

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the pit underneath the new barn was dug

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.970 
the pit underneath the new barn was dug
which<00:00:39.570> would<00:00:39.750> eventually<00:00:39.960> house<00:00:40.410> all<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
which would eventually house all of the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.250 
which would eventually house all of the
cattles<00:00:41.340> manure<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.270> cement<00:00:42.629> was<00:00:42.780> laid<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
cattles manure the cement was laid and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.869 
cattles manure the cement was laid and
the<00:00:43.379> walls<00:00:43.590> went<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.430> investment

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the walls went up and this investment

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.729 
the walls went up and this investment
was<00:00:45.149> becoming<00:00:45.539> very<00:00:45.870> real<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> cleaner

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
was becoming very real for the cleaner

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.130 
was becoming very real for the cleaner
family<00:00:47.190> when<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> work<00:00:48.239> was<00:00:48.420> completed<00:00:48.570> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
family when the work was completed and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.110 
family when the work was completed and
the<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.530> deal<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.920> all<00:00:50.039> robots<00:00:50.489> were<00:00:50.730> hard<00:00:51.000> at

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the for deal of all robots were hard at

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.119 
the for deal of all robots were hard at
work<00:00:51.270> they<00:00:51.690> realized<00:00:52.110> how<00:00:52.350> beneficial<00:00:52.620> these

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
work they realized how beneficial these

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.520 
work they realized how beneficial these
robots<00:00:53.610> were<00:00:53.820> going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.180> be<00:00:55.430> they<00:00:56.430> work<00:00:57.530> we

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
robots were going to be they work we

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.990 
robots were going to be they work we
didn't<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.859> worry<00:00:59.039> about<00:00:59.100> waking<00:00:59.460> up<00:00:59.789> so

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
didn't have to worry about waking up so

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.400 
didn't have to worry about waking up so
early<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> morning<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.960> melting<00:01:01.199> cows

and everything else got done with our
crops<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.350> lot<00:01:04.500> easier<00:01:04.890> because<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.189> didn't

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
crops a lot easier because we didn't

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.429 
crops a lot easier because we didn't
have<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> stop<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.090> melt<00:01:06.840> cause<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.350> the

morning<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.920> night<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.430> could<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.760> wake<00:01:08.909> up

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
morning and night we could just wake up

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.969 
morning and night we could just wake up
and<00:01:09.360> one<00:01:09.630> person<00:01:09.990> could<00:01:10.110> run<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:12.740> base<00:01:13.740> was

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
and one person could run this base was

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.850 
and one person could run this base was
all<00:01:14.159> about<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> labor<00:01:14.689> there's<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:16.680> don't

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
all about the labor there's you don't

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.109 
all about the labor there's you don't
have<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.130> pay<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.400> machines<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:17.970> your

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
have to pay the machines to do your

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.420 
have to pay the machines to do your
labor<00:01:18.299> for<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.659> with<00:01:19.530> such<00:01:19.860> increased

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
labor for you with such increased

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.140 
labor for you with such increased
productivity

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
productivity

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.240 
productivity
I<00:01:21.240> wondered<00:01:21.659> why<00:01:21.869> more<00:01:22.259> family<00:01:22.650> farms<00:01:23.009> aren't

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
I wondered why more family farms aren't

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.120 
I wondered why more family farms aren't
taking<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.850> route<00:01:24.560> everybody<00:01:25.560> looks<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
taking this route everybody looks at the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.010 
taking this route everybody looks at the
cost<00:01:26.310> at<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.820> sticker<00:01:27.150> price<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.869> at<00:01:27.990> first

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
cost at the sticker price on it at first

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.499 
cost at the sticker price on it at first
and<00:01:28.579> realized<00:01:29.579> they<00:01:29.820> think<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.210> they<00:01:30.329> can

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and realized they think that they can

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.020 
and realized they think that they can
pay<00:01:30.659> labor<00:01:30.930> instead<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.579> way<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.909> don't

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
pay labor instead but this way we don't

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.580 
pay labor instead but this way we don't
have<00:01:33.240> them<00:01:33.390> calling<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:33.960> at<00:01:34.110> two<00:01:34.229> o'clock<00:01:34.530> in

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
have them calling in at two o'clock in

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.050 
have them calling in at two o'clock in
the<00:01:34.770> morning<00:01:34.829> saying<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.460> can't<00:01:35.670> make<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.939> to

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the morning saying they can't make it to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.480 
the morning saying they can't make it to
work<00:01:36.240> Arlen<00:01:37.200> gave<00:01:37.380> me<00:01:37.590> an<00:01:37.680> idea<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.040> how<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
work Arlen gave me an idea of how the
