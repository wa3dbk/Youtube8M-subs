00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.400
 after three seasons of zombies there 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.410
 a lot of accessories maybe we throw away 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.930
 less a real campaign mode in which 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.180
 our characters can go 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.949
 evolving and going 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.600
 let's say getting stronger and stronger 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.519
 well, this is more or less 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.230
 solved with this new accessory 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.330
 expansion that is called ultimate 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.800
 survivors number 1 which means 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.570
 that there will be more because they are the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.820
 survivors of the first season 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.010
 thom and that's what he takes advantage of here 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.750
 apart from some new miniatures some 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.270
 letters of experience that will allow us 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.460
 evolve a little bit that neither much 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.260
 to the survivors between game and 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.530
 practice let's look at the content of the 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.250
 box 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.140
 we open ultimate survivors number one and 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.180
 endo we found this is the new 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.500
 format of zombie boxes there are a few 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.519
 plastic counters with skulls 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.030
 experience are the typical ones that call 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.260
 we know the miniatures of the six 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.600
 survivors of the first season 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.420
 but they are different vale are not the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.520
 same miniatures change in the pose 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.580
 and we have letters large letters 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.740
 as you see 4 decks that are the letters of 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.189
 experience machete baton gun that 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.549
 they give us some advantages below 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:24.399
 he lifted the plastic underneath we found 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.200
 the manual that explains how it works 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.670
 this from the experience mode that 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.320
 it's just when we advance a color 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.060
 from yellow blue from yellow to orange 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.060
 from orange to red we can take one of 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.159
 these letters of experience that we the 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.509
 we can be between games of this 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.330
 way we can start the next 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.490
 departure with some experience worth 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.679
 everything else that we take is lost but 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.080
 the letters are kept so we can 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:50.440
 have along several games 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.149
 up to three experience cards and for 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.409
 our character the instructions we 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.380
 they say we can have the ones we want 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.880
 but we can not repeat it from new and 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.520
 the chips of the survivors of the 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.289
 first season with some variation 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.509
 for example they start with two skills 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.369
 in blue instead of one to give them a 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.380
 little bit more of the field puts it ultimate and 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.840
 behind the cohabiting version that 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.790
 it is also ultimate 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.970
 well minus give a stone here so 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.739
 least we can start games 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.599
 different with experience letters in 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.540
 our survivor to be a 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:26.849
 little bit stronger is not a campaign 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.849
 real but at least it's a small year
