then<00:00:31.890> sword<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.669> already<00:00:32.969> like<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
then sword is already like that and

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.040 
then sword is already like that and
enchanting<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:39.390> I'll<00:00:39.510> show<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.809> what

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
enchanting this and I'll show you what

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.520 
enchanting this and I'll show you what
it<00:00:40.230> looks<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:41.360> soil<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.480> pretty<00:00:42.690> cool<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.410> no

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
it looks like soil is pretty cool but no

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.979 
it looks like soil is pretty cool but no
it's<00:00:43.710> kind<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.920> default<00:00:44.340> well<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:45.750> this

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it's kind of default well if you do this

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.529 
it's kind of default well if you do this
and<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.590> put<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.829> one<00:00:47.090> it<00:00:48.090> looks<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:48.300> that

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and we put this one it looks like that

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.850 
and we put this one it looks like that
because<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.899> never<00:00:48.960> give<00:00:49.230> my<00:00:49.320> search<00:00:49.469> by<00:00:49.620> Kobe

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
because I never give my search by Kobe

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.760 
because I never give my search by Kobe
which<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.190> forgot<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:52.350> particles

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
which you forgot to and the particles

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.810 
which you forgot to and the particles
aren't<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.160> very<00:00:54.020> special<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.230> honest

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
aren't really very special to be honest

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.010 
aren't really very special to be honest
I'm<00:00:56.820> pretty<00:00:57.030> sure<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> drinking<00:00:57.600> particles

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
I'm pretty sure the drinking particles

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.830 
I'm pretty sure the drinking particles
are<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.260> circles<00:00:59.270> yeah<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.480> those<00:01:00.660> little

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
