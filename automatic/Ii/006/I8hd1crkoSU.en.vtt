00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
tried it it wasn't good for me and then

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.270 
tried it it wasn't good for me and then
you<00:01:53.390> just<00:01:53.600> leave<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:54.799> go<00:01:54.950> on<00:01:55.070> like

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
you just leave it and you go on like

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.219 
you just leave it and you go on like
that<00:01:55.360> so<00:01:56.360> for<00:01:56.540> example<00:01:56.600> if<00:01:56.930> you're<00:01:57.049> going<00:01:57.170> to

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229
