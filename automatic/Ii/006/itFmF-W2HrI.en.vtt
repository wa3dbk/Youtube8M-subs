I like better than the Glock so I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.289 
I like better than the Glock so I
thought<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.560> did<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> little<00:01:14.520> more

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299

extensive review of these guns
individually<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.570> say<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
individually as I say this is the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.640 
individually as I say this is the
service<00:01:20.250> model<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.380> I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
service model this is the one that I

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.260 
service model this is the one that I
have<00:01:23.040> found<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.430> little<00:01:23.520> bit<00:01:23.670> easier<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> shoot

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
have found a little bit easier to shoot

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.260 
have found a little bit easier to shoot
as<00:01:25.259> most<00:01:25.560> people<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.130> even<00:01:26.759> though<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:26.909> tend<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
as most people do even though I tend to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.190 
as most people do even though I tend to
like<00:01:27.450> small<00:01:27.750> guns

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
like small guns

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.340 
like small guns
this<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:29.820> shoots<00:01:30.180> really<00:01:30.360> well<00:01:30.570> so

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
it really does feel better in a lot of

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.490 
it really does feel better in a lot of
ways<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.209> Glock<00:02:44.450> because<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.290> doesn't

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
ways in the Glock because it doesn't

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.620 
ways in the Glock because it doesn't
have<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.740> hump<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:47.030> don't<00:02:47.209> like<00:02:47.420> that

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
have the hump and I don't like that

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.530 
have the hump and I don't like that
safety<00:02:48.080> but<00:02:48.290> if<00:02:49.070> it's<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.670> hand<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:50.180> little<00:02:50.450> bit

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
safety but if it's a hand a little bit

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.020 
safety but if it's a hand a little bit
better<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.860> see<00:02:52.040> what<00:02:52.160> people<00:02:52.489> like<00:02:53.000> about

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030

that<00:02:53.420> grip<00:02:54.070> I've<00:02:55.070> gotten<00:02:55.340> used<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.670> Glock

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
that grip I've gotten used to the Glock

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.420 
that grip I've gotten used to the Glock
though<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.450> do<00:02:56.510> little<00:02:57.010> contouring<00:02:58.010> and

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
though and I do little contouring and

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.970 
though and I do little contouring and
time<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:58.730> get<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.150> Talon<00:02:59.750> grips<00:02:59.959> on<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.200> it

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.390 
time I get the Talon grips on it it
feels<00:03:01.160> fine<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.670> me<00:03:01.820> but<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:03.650> grips<00:03:03.980> feel<00:03:04.190> good

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
feels fine to me but the grips feel good

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.990 
feels fine to me but the grips feel good
on<00:03:04.580> these<00:03:04.700> guns<00:03:04.970> they<00:03:05.540> seem<00:03:05.780> accurate<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:07.000> have

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000

on these guns they seem accurate I have
just<00:03:08.360> as<00:03:08.540> with<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.780> subcompact<00:03:09.700> XD<00:03:10.700> I<00:03:11.470> have<00:03:12.470> a

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
just as with the subcompact XD I have a

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.949 
just as with the subcompact XD I have a
little<00:03:12.920> issues<00:03:13.370> with<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.670> trigger<00:03:13.970> it<00:03:14.810> would

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
little issues with the trigger it would

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.890 
little issues with the trigger it would
take<00:03:15.140> me<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.680> think<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:15.950> lot<00:03:16.100> of<00:03:16.130> practice<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:17.000> to

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
take me I think a lot of practice to to

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.690 
take me I think a lot of practice to to
get<00:03:18.050> really<00:03:18.620> comfortable<00:03:18.860> with<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.280> trigger

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
get really comfortable with that trigger

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.550 
get really comfortable with that trigger
an<00:03:20.330> antelope<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:20.750> would<00:03:20.959> mess<00:03:21.140> me<00:03:21.320> up<00:03:21.350> with

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
an antelope that would mess me up with

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.370 
an antelope that would mess me up with
the<00:03:21.620> Glocks<00:03:21.860> or<00:03:22.100> not<00:03:22.900> switching<00:03:23.900> over<00:03:24.230> like

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
the Glocks or not switching over like

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.680 
the Glocks or not switching over like
that<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:24.830> would<00:03:25.070> probably<00:03:25.250> not<00:03:25.489> rule<00:03:25.760> in<00:03:26.390> a<00:03:26.450> big

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
that I would probably not rule in a big

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.310 
that I would probably not rule in a big
way<00:03:26.930> for<00:03:27.230> sure<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:28.519> like<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.269> get<00:03:29.420> temple<00:03:30.140> with<00:03:30.290> a

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
way for sure I like to get temple with a

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.680 
way for sure I like to get temple with a
system<00:03:30.890> that<00:03:31.100> works<00:03:31.549> for<00:03:31.820> me<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.209> then<00:03:32.420> stick

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
system that works for me and then stick

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.160 
system that works for me and then stick
with<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:33.130> but<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:35.120> trigger<00:03:35.360> is<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.630> little<00:03:35.989> bit

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
with it but the trigger is a little bit

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.320 
with it but the trigger is a little bit
odd<00:03:36.350> is<00:03:36.830> it's<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.190> nice<00:03:37.400> trigger<00:03:37.730> has<00:03:38.000> a<00:03:38.030> nice

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
odd is it's a nice trigger has a nice

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.199 
odd is it's a nice trigger has a nice
release<00:03:38.750> can't<00:03:39.440> complain<00:03:39.799> about<00:03:39.980> that<00:03:40.340> it's

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
release can't complain about that it's

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.550 
release can't complain about that it's
just<00:03:41.630> it's<00:03:42.200> just<00:03:42.410> different<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:44.410> gun<00:03:45.410> is

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
just it's just different and gun is

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.199 
just it's just different and gun is
accurate<00:03:45.950> as<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.160> say<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.760> sights<00:03:47.000> are<00:03:47.180> pretty

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
accurate as I say the sights are pretty

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.740 
accurate as I say the sights are pretty
good<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:48.650> little<00:03:49.519> bit<00:03:49.670> bigger<00:03:50.000> in<00:03:50.120> some<00:03:50.390> areas

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
good a little bit bigger in some areas

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.090 
good a little bit bigger in some areas
then<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:52.010> think<00:03:52.340> it<00:03:52.489> needs<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.820> be<00:03:53.079> but<00:03:54.079> it<00:03:54.920> does

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
then I think it needs to be but it does

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.500 
then I think it needs to be but it does
alright<00:03:55.519> goes<00:03:56.090> alright

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
alright goes alright

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.290 
alright goes alright
no<00:03:57.260> major<00:03:57.500> problems<00:03:57.980> we

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
no major problems we

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:07.960 
no major problems we
they<00:03:59.300> get<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.860> hear<00:04:06.070> some<00:04:07.070> kind<00:04:07.310> of<00:04:07.370> determined

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
they get to hear some kind of determined

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:52.180 
they get to hear some kind of determined
to<00:04:08.030> hit<00:04:08.150> five<00:04:08.360> plates<00:04:08.840> in<00:04:09.080> a<00:04:09.170> row<00:04:50.830> like<00:04:51.830> I<00:04:51.950> say<00:04:52.160> I

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
to hit five plates in a row like I say I

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.590 
to hit five plates in a row like I say I
could<00:04:52.490> get<00:04:52.640> used<00:04:52.820> to<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.060> trigger<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:53.510> just

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
could get used to the trigger and just

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.040 
could get used to the trigger and just
take<00:04:53.840> some<00:04:53.870> practice<00:04:54.200> but<00:04:55.060> this<00:04:56.060> gun<00:04:56.300> it<00:04:56.840> feels

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
take some practice but this gun it feels

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.230 
take some practice but this gun it feels
pretty<00:04:57.230> good<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.770> like<00:04:58.340> this<00:04:58.550> one<00:04:58.760> I<00:04:59.000> have<00:04:59.210> to

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
pretty good I like this one I have to

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.710 
pretty good I like this one I have to
say<00:04:59.510> better<00:04:59.780> than<00:05:00.140> the<00:05:00.680> subcompact<00:05:01.480> as<00:05:02.480> I

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
say better than the subcompact as I

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.540 
say better than the subcompact as I
mentioned<00:05:03.080> in<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.230> subcompact<00:05:03.680> video<00:05:04.220> I

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
mentioned in the subcompact video I

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.060 
mentioned in the subcompact video I
think<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:08.810> smaller<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.260> gun<00:05:09.410> more

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
think the the smaller the gun more

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.490 
think the the smaller the gun more
critical<00:05:10.460> I<00:05:10.520> get<00:05:10.790> is<00:05:11.090> that<00:05:11.270> simple<00:05:11.720> but<00:05:12.140> as<00:05:12.350> you

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
critical I get is that simple but as you

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.830 
critical I get is that simple but as you
the<00:05:12.740> gun<00:05:12.890> gets<00:05:13.070> bigger<00:05:13.450> some<00:05:14.450> of<00:05:14.540> the<00:05:14.630> little

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
the gun gets bigger some of the little

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.659 
the gun gets bigger some of the little
things<00:05:14.870> about<00:05:15.320> it<00:05:15.560> as<00:05:16.040> being<00:05:16.100> a<00:05:16.430> little<00:05:16.580> bit

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
things about it as being a little bit

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.280 
things about it as being a little bit
busy<00:05:17.030> and<00:05:17.360> maybe<00:05:17.630> a<00:05:17.720> little<00:05:17.810> bit<00:05:17.930> heavier

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
busy and maybe a little bit heavier

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.920 
busy and maybe a little bit heavier
they're<00:05:19.010> not<00:05:19.190> as<00:05:19.340> big<00:05:19.520> an<00:05:19.640> issue<00:05:19.790> perhaps<00:05:20.150> so

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
they're not as big an issue perhaps so

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.909 
they're not as big an issue perhaps so
this<00:05:21.350> gun<00:05:21.560> I<00:05:22.990> kind<00:05:23.990> of<00:05:24.020> like<00:05:24.169> this<00:05:24.320> gun<00:05:24.560> it's

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
this gun I kind of like this gun it's

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.270 
this gun I kind of like this gun it's
fun<00:05:25.100> to<00:05:25.220> shoot<00:05:25.400> feels<00:05:25.940> good<00:05:26.180> you<00:05:27.020> know<00:05:27.110> I

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
fun to shoot feels good you know I

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.090 
fun to shoot feels good you know I
probably<00:05:28.280> prefer<00:05:28.610> my<00:05:28.910> Glock<00:05:29.120> 23<00:05:29.480> but<00:05:30.410> this<00:05:30.919> gun

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
probably prefer my Glock 23 but this gun

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.950 
probably prefer my Glock 23 but this gun
is<00:05:31.280> fine<00:05:31.520> I<00:05:31.550> can<00:05:31.910> see<00:05:32.060> why<00:05:32.180> people<00:05:32.210> like<00:05:32.660> it<00:05:32.690> it

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
is fine I can see why people like it it

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.659 
is fine I can see why people like it it
shoots<00:05:33.710> really<00:05:33.919> well<00:05:34.220> it<00:05:35.169> hasn't<00:05:36.169> bobbled<00:05:36.710> yet

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
shoots really well it hasn't bobbled yet

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.310 
shoots really well it hasn't bobbled yet
there's<00:05:37.910> been<00:05:37.970> no<00:05:38.180> malfunctions<00:05:38.930> with<00:05:39.110> it<00:05:39.230> at

there's been no malfunctions with it at

there's been no malfunctions with it at
all<00:05:39.440> this<00:05:39.800> gun<00:05:40.010> was<00:05:40.160> brand<00:05:40.490> new<00:05:40.730> out<00:05:40.910> of<00:05:41.000> the

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
all this gun was brand new out of the

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.820 
all this gun was brand new out of the
box<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:42.470> week<00:05:42.919> ago<00:05:43.160> when<00:05:43.340> I<00:05:43.430> pulled<00:05:43.669> it<00:05:43.790> out<00:05:43.940> and

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
box a week ago when I pulled it out and

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.409 
box a week ago when I pulled it out and
you've<00:05:45.830> seen<00:05:46.070> me<00:05:46.220> shoot<00:05:46.250> almost<00:05:46.850> every<00:05:47.150> round

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
you've seen me shoot almost every round

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.930 
you've seen me shoot almost every round
that's<00:05:47.780> been<00:05:47.930> shot<00:05:48.169> through<00:05:48.410> it<00:05:48.530> I<00:05:48.740> took<00:05:48.980> two

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
that's been shot through it I took two

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.730 
that's been shot through it I took two
magazines<00:05:50.510> before<00:05:50.750> I<00:05:50.930> started<00:05:51.230> this<00:05:51.380> video

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
magazines before I started this video

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.630 
magazines before I started this video
but<00:05:52.490> you've<00:05:53.030> seen<00:05:53.240> every<00:05:53.540> shot<00:05:53.780> and<00:05:54.460> so<00:05:55.460> I<00:05:55.490> am

sure about the trigger take me a while

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:24.550 
sure about the trigger take me a while
to<00:06:21.409> get<00:06:21.740> used<00:06:21.919> to<00:06:21.979> that<00:06:22.159> one<00:06:22.340> and<00:06:23.289> what<00:06:24.289> else<00:06:24.470> do

I not like about it or do I like about
it<00:06:26.840> after<00:06:27.560> after<00:06:28.129> shooting<00:06:28.310> at<00:06:28.490> this<00:06:28.610> much<00:06:28.849> it

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:29.659 
it after after shooting at this much it

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:32.710 
it after after shooting at this much it
seems<00:06:30.500> accurate<00:06:31.330> one<00:06:32.330> thing<00:06:32.479> I<00:06:32.539> like<00:06:32.690> about

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
seems accurate one thing I like about

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.570 
seems accurate one thing I like about
these<00:06:33.050> guns<00:06:33.319> I<00:06:33.500> I<00:06:33.740> guess<00:06:34.039> I<00:06:34.159> haven't<00:06:34.340> mentioned

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
these guns I I guess I haven't mentioned

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.610 
these guns I I guess I haven't mentioned
too<00:06:35.090> much<00:06:35.300> is<00:06:35.539> I<00:06:35.750> kind<00:06:36.050> of<00:06:36.080> like<00:06:36.229> the<00:06:36.379> way<00:06:36.500> they

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
too much is I kind of like the way they

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.969 
too much is I kind of like the way they
break<00:06:36.830> down<00:06:37.069> is<00:06:37.639> lock<00:06:37.940> it<00:06:38.120> back<00:06:38.300> up<00:06:38.770> the<00:06:39.770> lever

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
break down is lock it back up the lever

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.300 
break down is lock it back up the lever
there<00:06:40.360> and<00:06:41.360> then<00:06:41.479> you<00:06:41.690> release<00:06:42.590> the<00:06:42.650> slide

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
there and then you release the slide

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
there and then you release the slide
pull<00:06:43.849> the<00:06:43.909> trigger<00:06:44.770> and<00:06:45.970> they<00:06:46.970> just<00:06:47.150> come

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
pull the trigger and they just come

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.180 
pull the trigger and they just come
right<00:06:47.360> off<00:06:47.720> so<00:06:48.080> some<00:06:48.560> people<00:06:48.830> have<00:06:49.069> a<00:06:49.130> little

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
right off so some people have a little

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.010 
right off so some people have a little
trouble<00:06:49.490> getting<00:06:49.819> the<00:06:49.849> Glock<00:06:50.150> slides<00:06:50.479> off<00:06:50.780> and

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
trouble getting the Glock slides off and

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.200 
trouble getting the Glock slides off and
maybe<00:06:51.139> some<00:06:51.380> of<00:06:51.470> the<00:06:51.530> others<00:06:51.770> but<00:06:51.800> I<00:06:52.280> mean<00:06:52.520> once

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
maybe some of the others but I mean once

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.189 
maybe some of the others but I mean once
you<00:06:53.270> get<00:06:53.389> the<00:06:53.449> hang<00:06:53.479> of<00:06:53.690> those<00:06:53.840> they're<00:06:54.020> not<00:06:54.169> a

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 
you get the hang of those they're not a

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:55.870 
you get the hang of those they're not a
problem<00:06:54.470> either<00:06:54.620> but<00:06:54.949> it<00:06:55.370> does<00:06:55.550> come<00:06:55.729> apart

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
problem either but it does come apart

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.640 
problem either but it does come apart
pretty<00:06:56.090> easily<00:06:56.330> and<00:06:56.900> you<00:06:57.020> put<00:06:57.259> that<00:06:57.409> back<00:06:57.620> on

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
pretty easily and you put that back on

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.390 
pretty easily and you put that back on
lock<00:06:58.550> it<00:06:58.729> back<00:06:58.909> with<00:06:59.389> the<00:06:59.479> lever<00:06:59.690> down<00:06:59.900> so<00:07:00.400> it's

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 
lock it back with the lever down so it's

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.399 
lock it back with the lever down so it's
kind<00:07:01.610> of<00:07:01.639> a<00:07:01.729> no-brainer<00:07:01.909> comes<00:07:02.840> apart<00:07:03.199> very

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:03.409 
kind of a no-brainer comes apart very

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:07.990 
kind of a no-brainer comes apart very
very<00:07:03.740> well<00:07:03.919> and<00:07:04.909> I<00:07:05.360> can<00:07:05.599> say<00:07:05.719> it<00:07:05.810> feels<00:07:05.990> good<00:07:07.000> it

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
very well and I can say it feels good it

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.879 
very well and I can say it feels good it
rests<00:07:08.960> in<00:07:09.050> the<00:07:09.080> hand<00:07:09.289> I<00:07:09.379> like<00:07:09.530> the<00:07:09.650> trigger

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:09.889 
rests in the hand I like the trigger

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:11.379 
rests in the hand I like the trigger
guard<00:07:10.190> is<00:07:10.490> because<00:07:10.699> it<00:07:10.849> is<00:07:10.940> a<00:07:10.969> lot<00:07:11.180> like<00:07:11.360> a

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:11.389 
guard is because it is a lot like a

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.390 
guard is because it is a lot like a
Glock<00:07:11.719> you<00:07:11.960> can<00:07:12.110> get<00:07:12.229> that<00:07:12.380> finger<00:07:13.099> under

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 
Glock you can get that finger under

Glock you can get that finger under
there<00:07:13.550> you<00:07:13.699> can<00:07:13.849> create<00:07:14.090> that<00:07:14.330> shelf<00:07:14.690> and<00:07:15.430> get

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
there you can create that shelf and get

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.659 
there you can create that shelf and get
a<00:07:16.460> good<00:07:16.639> grip<00:07:16.789> on<00:07:16.969> it<00:07:17.030> so<00:07:17.419> so<00:07:18.050> this<00:07:18.409> gun<00:07:18.669> she's
