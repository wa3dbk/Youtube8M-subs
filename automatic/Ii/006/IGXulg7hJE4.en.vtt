00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.509
 Hi 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.689
 and and 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:06.689
 Yes 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.759
 come 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.610
 come on 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.170
 well this is the broad care school this is the 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.599
 place where children with disabilities 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.029
 can develop with the 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.660
 guidance they need in one 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.939
 pace that suits them during school hours 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.460
 in their free time or in the weekends and 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.540
 holidays for children on the broad 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.570
 care school 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.530
 education forms the guidance care 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.540
 and training a continuous chain 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.280
 everything is under one roof and close to it 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.170
 child organized 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.660
 we think that is important because it is possible 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.610
 find every child's own way 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.020
 that's why all disciplines work with 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.760
 each other together 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.060
 make teachers for every child 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.390
 caregivers therapists and 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.350
 behavioral expert 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.180
 together one plan one child one plan that is 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.799
 our starting point 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.210
 what does such a chain look like in the 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.079
 practice 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.540
 let's start with it 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:12.820
 kinderdagcentrum flip you come here 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.320
 children from 0 to 5 years 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.290
 who have a developmental delay 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.120
 and or an intellectual disability 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.040
 close supervision and treatment 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.930
 at the development stage of the 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.390
 individual child 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.120
 we observe and diagnose children 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.200
 here based on the findings of the 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.000
 professionals 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.799
 we advise parents on guidance 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.110
 home the start if desired one 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.510
 treatment we also formulate one 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.610
 the school goes to suitable school advice 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.170
 the broad care school the cambier then 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.630
 the health care professionals remain like it 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.520
 is involved with the child in the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.380
 family support at home with the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.920
 after school care or when it 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.920
 child comes to stay 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.490
 the cambier is a special school 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.259
 Education 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.750
 all students have one 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.359
 intellectual disability and iq lower than 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.770
 80 some also have physical ones 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.600
 constraint 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.579
 with every child go looking again 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.319
 its level of development 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.729
 we try to do this as well as possible 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.590
 to close 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.750
 and from there we stimulate his or 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.430
 its development a little further true 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.040
 does the child enjoy it 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.780
 how responds to new course material at the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.819
 one succeeds through new things throughout 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.790
 to offer small pieces at the 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.319
 others by moving in for example 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.299
 so we can find one for every child 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.519
 starting point 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.569
 to get the right one at the right time 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.810
 find clues that is one 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.300
 nice puzzle for the teachers 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.800
 it is nice and especially useful at a young age 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.660
 That they then easily with your care 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.640
 colleagues can consult 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.830
 at this school we donate in addition to subjects 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.110
 as arithmetic and language also pay attention to the 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.239
 development of socio-emotional 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.550
 communicative physical or 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.349
 sensory skills 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.730
 so a child goes to between classes 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.280
 for example speech therapy 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.260
 or get the game therapy and if the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.760
 lesson situation which demands a lot 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.790
 we take a walk on the 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.830
 walk or the student starts sniffing 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.110
 sometimes that's what it takes to get the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.000
 stimulate development 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.130
 the school is a protected environment and 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.799
 everyone a very equal 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.580
 there is room for individual construction and 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.580
 own choices 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.840
 when children are 12 and 13 years old they go 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.950
 to the secondary education of the 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.120
 kanbier 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.610
 here they can stay as one 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.500
 twentieth to the different levels 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.380
 the students do it right 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.120
 education divided into two streams 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.590
 b-stream is for children who have the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.240
 have the opportunity to find a place 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.640
 on whether or not to protect the 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.980
 labor market for the students for whom 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.090
 your pace or the demands of paid work 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.360
 be high 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.280
 is there the c stream these students will 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.050
 after school presumably transfer to 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.260
 volunteer work or daily activities 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.510
 go place in secondary education 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.630
 education and care still go hand in hand 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.630
 hand 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.280
 the broad care school is more than school 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.290
 only 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.880
 before and after school 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.110
 pupils to out-of-school care 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.090
 from flipje 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.040
 staff of sheerenloo who are in the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.600
 help class and students as needed 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.280
 care also work in the 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.750
 school care 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.209
 great for the kids that they are here so 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.010
 encounter familiar faces in one 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.230
 the children come in a protected environment 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.300
 here a breath after a school day and 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.860
 they can go their own way 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.830
 guidance is provided here 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.930
 based on the needs of the child itself 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.680
 to rest and regularity and structure 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.169
 offer 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.090
 we work with a fixed day program 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.950
 the theme changes every so often 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.340
 activities so that they are also educational 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.340
 to be 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.030
 you cannot do children with a disability 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.100
 always to the care of the neighbors or 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.170
 leave friends 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.450
 if as a parent you have to leave for a few days 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.150
 or just want to relax then you can 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.730
 child staying at the weekend with a flip card 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.770
 holidays or possibly during the week we 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.690
 know your child well and feel it 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.280
 Here at home it can be 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.100
 independence from home 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.990
 what build up to sleepover 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.090
 both have sufficient energy and rest 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.350
 to resume daily life together 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.400
 to grab 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.290
 and also for care and guidance 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.460
 money while staying 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.460
 one child one plan 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.020
 Then the time comes for the young 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.639
 take the step to bigger ones 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.319
 independence 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.330
 the students who are in the store at the 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.129

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:36.150
 to an internship outside the school 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:38.189
 others teach at the academy 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.599
 independence and skills they 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:42.330
 need for being so independent 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.590
 possibly exist for some of them 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.270
 is a home in it 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.310
 room training center 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.599
 one selected above the broad care school 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.939
 opportunity 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:53.759
 here they are released from home and we learn 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:55.560
 own household they build and do 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.229
 maintain their own friends with work 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.939
 and teach themselves their emotions and 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:03.569
 know and recognize responses 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:05.580
 there is 24 hour supervision available 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:07.439
 try the counseling with the youngsters 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.360
 to be phased out 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:10.770
 it will power off after a maximum of four years 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.439
 to an independent home 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.669
 if necessary, we will provide outpatient services 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.669
 support for appointments 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.550
 and
