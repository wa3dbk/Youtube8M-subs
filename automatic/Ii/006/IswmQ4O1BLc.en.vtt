before the team is ready for this season

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.680 
before the team is ready for this season
I<00:02:11.709> think<00:02:12.099> preparing<00:02:12.849> where<00:02:13.000> well<00:02:13.239> I<00:02:13.269> mean<00:02:13.510> we

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
I think preparing where well I mean we

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.569 
I think preparing where well I mean we
had<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.989> two<00:02:14.590> weeks<00:02:14.739> now<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.190> preseason

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
had to two weeks now in the preseason

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.850 
had to two weeks now in the preseason
and<00:02:16.000> we've<00:02:16.269> got<00:02:16.420> another<00:02:16.660> four<00:02:17.380> weeks<00:02:17.410> I<00:02:17.829> think

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
and we've got another four weeks I think

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.170 
and we've got another four weeks I think
and<00:02:18.690> yeah<00:02:19.690> it's<00:02:20.230> two<00:02:20.440> weeks<00:02:20.650> no<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.760> see<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.030> in

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
and yeah it's two weeks no you see it in

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.220 
and yeah it's two weeks no you see it in
the<00:02:22.269> game<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:23.970> team<00:02:24.970> is<00:02:25.180> not<00:02:25.299> ready<00:02:25.599> yet<00:02:25.840> poor

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
the game the team is not ready yet poor

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.190 
the game the team is not ready yet poor
and<00:02:26.769> a<00:02:27.160> few<00:02:27.430> minutes<00:02:27.610> later<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.450> saw<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.959> team

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
and a few minutes later you saw the team

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.949 
and a few minutes later you saw the team
could<00:02:29.769> play<00:02:30.040> together<00:02:30.099> and<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.850> think<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.750> play

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
could play together and I think you play

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.960 
could play together and I think you play
the<00:02:32.109> next<00:02:32.380> few<00:02:32.920> games<00:02:32.980> better<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.639> will<00:02:33.760> see

up by both teams yes indeed i think for
rare<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.970> think<00:02:51.970> if<00:02:52.060> Celtics<00:02:52.569> first<00:02:52.780> game<00:02:52.989> of

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
rare I think if Celtics first game of

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.879 
rare I think if Celtics first game of
the<00:02:53.350> season<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:54.450> for<00:02:55.450> it's<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:55.989> friendly<00:02:56.650> match

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:56.889

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
it was played in a good spirit I think

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.190 
it was played in a good spirit I think
that<00:02:58.959> was<00:02:59.079> a<00:02:59.109> good<00:03:00.450> technical<00:03:01.450> ability<00:03:01.930> Sean

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
that was a good technical ability Sean

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.229 
that was a good technical ability Sean

this team going far in Europe and Celtic

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.150 
this team going far in Europe and Celtic
is<00:03:20.859> very<00:03:21.190> very<00:03:21.489> difficult<00:03:21.790> because<00:03:23.010> we<00:03:24.010> have

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
is very very difficult because we have

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.140 
is very very difficult because we have
to<00:03:24.310> play<00:03:24.579> euro<00:03:25.530> q32<00:03:26.530> in<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.579> Champions<00:03:28.060> League

to play euro q32 in the Champions League

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.020 
to play euro q32 in the Champions League
q3<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.040> that's<00:03:30.040> going<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.310> be<00:03:30.370> difficult<00:03:30.519> and

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
q3 and that's going to be difficult and

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.629 
q3 and that's going to be difficult and
then<00:03:31.540> after<00:03:31.959> q3<00:03:32.319> if<00:03:32.470> we<00:03:32.590> managed<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.340> when

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
then after q3 if we managed it to when

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.789 
then after q3 if we managed it to when
that<00:03:33.880> game<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.450> going<00:03:34.629> to<00:03:34.689> be<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.810> playoff<00:03:35.200> so

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
that game is going to be a playoff so

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.949 
that game is going to be a playoff so
