00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.110
 the window is leaking obliquely 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.210
 or not getting it right anymore 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.160
 it is new at the time of this opening 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.719
 but do not worry 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.430
 how easy to set one 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.710
 fensters is showing them this 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.269
 video instruction under the cover caps 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.250
 we find all important adjusting screws 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.660
 to set up the window again 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.429
 underneath are the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.320
 adjusting screws for the diagonal 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.380
 installation of the window at the bottom corner 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.820
 camp as well as the upper scissors camp the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.100
 adjusting screw for the parallel 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.380
 height adjustment and adjusting screws 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.530
 for adjusting the contact pressure amec 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.240
 stock as well as shearing arm 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.070
 First we start the imbalance 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.410
 to correct the window sash 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.970
 we have the window with the help of 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.820
 adjusting screw for the diagonal 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.770
 Alignment at the bottom corner bearing 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.810
 we bring this with a hex key 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.630
 turn clockwise until the 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.760
 The window has lifted accordingly 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.880
 we test new smoothness 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.140
 the opening and closing of the window 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.270
 should the window now on the side 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.890
 window frame stripe can do this 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.960
 turn the adjusting screws of the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.120
 diagonal alignment can be corrected 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.990
 Lifting the window on the upper screen 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.420
 Stock and a lowering of the window at 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.770
 lower corner camp brings this in sum 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.660
 more to the hinges 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.420
 the next step in setting the 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.850
 fensters is the height adjustment with the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.100
 second adjusting screw amec stock can do that 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.490
 windows raised and lowered in parallel 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.830
 become 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.130
 We take care that windows are as possible 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.360
 to place in the middle of the window frame 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.190
 Next we'll check that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.260
 contact pressure in this case is the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.240
 Anpressdruck far too low so that the 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.070
 window does not close properly 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.409
 increase this at the close tap 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.180
 on the handle side of the window to it 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.880
 we turn the eccentric screws 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.920
 is a little counterclockwise 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.720
 a correction of the contact pressure on the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.430
 side of the hinges may be necessary 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.680
 this by another screw on 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.570
 corner as well as through this less 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.490
 accessible screw on the scissors arm 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.230
 be adjusted 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.000
 Last but not least, we still check 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.360
 we also set the window correctly 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.070
 to have 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.330
 We open the window one after the other 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.250
 around 90 60 and 30 degrees 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.960
 in none of the positions may the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.240
 open window independently or 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.640
 Close the window is done 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.640
 set and close as if it were new
