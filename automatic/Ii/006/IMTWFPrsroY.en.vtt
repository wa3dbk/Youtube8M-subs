00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.690
 well charge the information on the dlc 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.309
 1.16 that I have content date and everything 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.289
 so I 'm sure you'll love it or 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.780
 try to upload as soon as possible so that 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.769
 to be among the first to give them all 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.299
 this information 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.340
 well said this let's start with the 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.680
 dlc first say the name that the dlc 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.990
 will be fly school in English translated 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.520
 to the Spanish school of flight so 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.900
 that would suppose there's going to be 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.370
 related to airplanes and all 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.010
 these things are worth with all things of 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.349
 flight then this one to choose the truth 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.940
 that the first one seems bad according to 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.380
 that flight school had been said 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.570
 it seemed a bit crap but seeing what 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.530
 that brings the truth is that to myself what 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.880
 unless it worth me as I have said 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.079
 flight school then we will be 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.270
 all related to opening these 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.860
 our things then I have 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.630
 to tell now I have all the information 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.050
 about what each vehicle will cost 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.450
 what everything will cost things 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.800
 that's going to bring everything in, so 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.630
 I recommend watching the whole video if 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.280
 you want to be if you want to be aware 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.660
 of all the information that you have to have 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.030
 and so already know exactly what is going to 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.979
 get out and first of all I recommend you 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.800
 if you make clichés of money that you 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.130
 you are doing 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.880
 what are you going to spend a good pasture and 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.960
 that if wild cost money 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.900
 you have to buy what is going to come out 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.550
 Now kids are going to freak out even 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.990
 making clichés or that some hacker 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.310
 spend money whatever be careful that we 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.150
 they're worth and things like that because you're going to 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.250
 flip 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.090
 saying that we start now with the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.090
 content of tlc 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.640
 saying one by one explaining one by 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.410
 one all so do not leave the video to 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.120
 half and if you're not going to lose half 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.640
 of the content then we do not go to it 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.170
 first paratrooper costumes or 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.110
 flight as you do not want to call 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.370
 we extend some suits to jump and for 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.200
 the parachutists really is 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.970
 that we go the union armh then 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.100
 we will have 10 missions a lonely 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.810
 flight using one of the planes that go 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.210
 to leave an order is not known if it is plane 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.380
 but I think they did know that between 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.030
 them through these missions as I have 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.730
 said alone would be the flight in 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.900
 formation low flight by calling it some 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.150
 way two activities per sites 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.550
 touching the ground or things like that fighting 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.140
 air and so on etc. these are the 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.730
 things that are known but that there will be more 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.020
 only those are ten missions and I've 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.009
 done three things so he'll see more 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.870
 safe 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.189
 and then another thing that is amazing 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.900
 leaving aside those missions that 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:17.629
 many people fly is to help something that 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.310
 The truth is that I had not thought about it and 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.290
 comes very very well especially for the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.640
 acrobats of these who already do 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.980
 acrobatics with the parachute to stop 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.629
 because it's going to come out they 're going to get a 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.400
 reserve parachute is to say that you are going to 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.200
 have a second parachute and the second 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.790
 that is, if the first parachute activates it 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.129
 at a time when you did not want to 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.170
 you take it off and a little later active 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.400
 of the second types for them to 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.230
 it's true that you have a reservation because 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.090
 If you break them first, imagine that you 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.530
 you are going to eat a tree or if you take off 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.569
 the parachute and active of the following 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.549
 well done perfect and in perfect 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.069
 to help for all things well 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.170
 thought by rockstar and then let's what 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.700
 really matters' seems some 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.659
 way and it would be the vehicles that 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.670
 it is always what attracts the most attention 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.760
 in this case there would be about four 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.159
 vehicles that would be three fliers and a 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.639
 car or at least he is on the ground 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:06.319
 and I'm going to tell you that something brutal is that 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.150
 one of them will have 16 places 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.849
 say are you going to have going to be able to take 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.200
 to a whole room a whole lobby you're going to 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.940
 being able to carry on an airplane is an advantage 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.359
 incredible because until now I had to 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.519
 catch 23 helicopters or whatever and a 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.989
 acceptance of 130 and this and take them but 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.579
 you make very slow and such 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.069
 this plane is because it will be fast 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.510
 because it's a jet because he knew we can 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.129
 take a lot of people and very fast so 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.329
 that an advantage no more value you I will 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.980
 explain then now how much are they going to 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.410
 cost each of these things how to 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.319
 they will call etcetera then first 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.480
 we started with the western extra brain 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.090
 training is already worth it that you are with whom 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.560
 we are going to use in flight missions 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.690
 that I've told you before going slow we're going to 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.879
 use this plane that's why it's called 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.680
 training &amp; because it's practical sack 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.400
 to practice with him this plane is going to 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.079
 cost $ 1,985,000 is a pass 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.870
 of money this is the most expensive of 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.730
 614 bets but even that gave me a 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.440
 little scary but of course it is the most expensive 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.030
 pérez that are many vehicles are 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.030
 four vehicles that are very expensive all 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.310
 so in total do not add four 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.079
 million so since you do not have four 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.880
 millions more clothes plus parachutes 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.710
 and all because you will not be able to buy everything 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.300
 better would be to buy as soon as possible 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.620
 you already know how to coordinate kids on 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.239
 next vehicle would be the buckingham 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.270
 the jet that this is the one that told you there 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.980
 16 seats worth it would cost you one million 250 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.050
 a thousand dollars this will come in handy 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.450
 to take people we have said voucher and 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.010
 the next plane that is the one that 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.140
 contradicts in names according to the seen yo 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.670
 some call it the swift hello and others 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.930
 they are called and leads, I do not know if there will be 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.880
 made to simply change the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.060
 name his previous model that was 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.910
 pound or that they have been wrong some not 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.680
 I know but good fitness or the case 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.060
 is that in one they are called hydra 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.040
 others call their zeal because all 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.570
 others agree less this as I have 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.400
 said with the others swift zeal and others 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.840
 dramas no idea worth this plane would cost 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.940
 one million seven hundred thousand and if not 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.130
 you know what is being fought is a plane that 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.940
 this airplane takes off vertically 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.620
 I was in previous 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.450
 with this we can take off in 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.910
 vertical and it is believed that you will have two 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.640
 squares or hollow for two for two 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.560
 people in the jet and because they believe this 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.890
 because it is the only airplane that is believed to 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.720
 asks you to confirm that you are a pilot is 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.160
 curious that the game has to check 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.330
 that you are a pilot to drive it if 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.580
 you're a copilot, you can not drive it 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.040
 obviously then if the game asks you 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.120
 what ideas to be a co-pilot for 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.410
 things that you have to be a pilot 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.140
 to drive it means that it's going to have 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.480
 two places minimum I do not think I have 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.630
 more but it would not be two seats like 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.720
 I say we are believed to be worth prisoner 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.010
 Vertical two - seater and with this flight 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.840
 have already done the planes and now 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.120
 we would go to the fourth vehicle that followed 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.760
 believe I believe a car is going to be called 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.320
 invent or coquet classic this car is going 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.010
 to be cheaper but we were going to be 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:52.440
 caris 665 thousand dollars is worth all this 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:56.620
 would be the d lc 1.16 adding clothes then 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.410
 clothing related to airplanes this 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.970
 and according to the same hairstyle they also take out 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.919
 some tattoo or whatever as always 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.229
 we go for that less importance that already 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:06.880
 we will see it in the moment and now what 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.870
 you will be asking a lot about a water 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.580
 has gone from the video and will be left without 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.979
 find out what I'm going to say is that 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.530
 this dlc leaves on August 19 Tuesday 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:16.479
 it and why I say that out on 19 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.070
 not like that the next week or whatever 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:21.790
 Well, because we're going a long time 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.880
 saying good then now I tell you the 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.620
 why will he come out next week? 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.010
 rockstar always taken out of times the 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:32.910
 Tuesday there is Tuesday, 19th because 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:35.420
 diego day 19 then day 19 in the usa is 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.610
 the national day of aviation 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.980
 coincidence does not believe it is to say that the 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.620
 Day 19 in the USA is already celebrated aviation 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.480
 that's why it matches the lcd gta 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.710
 5 is worth all airplanes both the two 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.750
 things very related to airplanes 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.100
 I'm going to be done so you know that 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.200
 then on Tuesday everyone to the 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.800
 tomorrow between 10 to 11 or what 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.240
 be in gta to play this dlc and nothing
