00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.789
 sp 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.369
 At this time, we will talk about the basic structure of a car. 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:22.800
 Let's take a look. 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.599
 Summer cars are made up of tens of thousands of parts 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.999
 There is a large number to be carried out and pussy largely divided. so 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.039
 From now on 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.910
 Let's take a closer look at implementation and presentation. 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.910
 I'll do it. 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.309
 The implementation of the car 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.800
 The car that performs the road is first of all the main parts 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.920
 Which is an engine that generates power 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.309
 Or its power 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.819
 Power transmission device that delivers outside 

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:54.819
 Then frame and lay up to side 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.690
 Braking system All of us steering 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.760
 So from now on 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.960
 We carry out each part one by one 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.829
 With Green 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:07.829
 Let me explain it again. 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.049
 Being rescued from the car is also against our human rights. 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.340
 The same. I can do this here 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.799
 Because I have bones in my body. 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.299
 So the car is also the most 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.330
 Basic skeletal posture 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.670
 As you can see in the picture, 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:30.450
 It's called a frame. 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.450
 So, as you can see, 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.700
 Apache sub 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.630
 As it is connected to a separate street 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.369
 Japanese cars 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.540
 Some people have a reign that has been made for a long time. 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.530
 This basic framework, 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.769
 Put the engine on, 

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:49.030
 A book I received 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.200
 The shape of the whole car will come out 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.100
 That's right, 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.100
 It is called a frame. 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.810
 Secondly, if we plant a purchase 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.750
 It's a power generator. 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.780
 It is closely related to the performance of the car. 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.759
 As you all know 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.400
 Depending on the performance of the engine 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.109
 I was to evaluate the car. 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.870
 The engine has open devices or 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.389
 Or cooling system 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:19.650
 On this day, 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.609
 It is configured as a feed-in device, 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.539
 When I was in the engine class, I explained in detail. 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:27.870
 Let me give you 1. 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.810
 practice 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.310
 There is also an engine that is powered 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.310
 Please cooperate. 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.889
 Now that we know it's common, 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.989
 You can not accept that in part. 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.809
 It's a power train. 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:48.320
 When power is generated by the engine 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.359
 That power 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.249
 The last thing to eat is to turn the field 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:55.009
 Purpose. 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.279
 How to deliver the power from the engine to the receiver 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:00.639
 It is a power transmission device. 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.790
 The first thing that drives power 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.659
 It will be worth breaking up 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.889
 When the clutch receives power from the transmission 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.530
 Will you do it faster or less? 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.519
 Is it the gearbox that determines this? 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.770
 Therefore, the manure posture 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.130
 When you deliver it again 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.180
 Technique recording will require knowledge of driving 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.880
 If you put pressure on it, 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.230
 The axis that returns the brightness of the driver shaft 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.040
 To deliver 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.119
 Do you give back the field? 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:35.510
 When we learn the power train, 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.640
 Power transmission to face-to-face cars and front-wheel cars 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.949
 Let's take a closer look at the system. 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:45.109
 Now that you are tmo, 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:46.149
 It is branches. 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:49.799
 Front-wheel drive vehicle or rear-wheel drive vehicle 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:51.110
 Medical staff 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.459
 Even if it is picked up, the whole acda is called as the dorporo 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.459
 Moving cars are the main so this candidate 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.059
 I went into icc's power train 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:04.059
 Let's take a closer look. 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:09.309
 Contemporary athlete 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:12.719
 We call it a 9, a lot of words in old Japanese 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:15.929
 I'm going to do it to Bush. 

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:18.630
 It's a bit of a loser. 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.340
 When the brightness is set, 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.809
 That's because you get a flyer. 

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:24.750
 If the 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.420
 We say that it does not bother, 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.440
 I have been in such a situation these days 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.590
 Maybe you will not ride. 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.560
 The impact of Park 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.620
 Until it is delivered to the body 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.540
 If you sew some screen 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.880
 Grease water through the reduction action than before 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.279
 I will. 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:44.379
 So, 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.669
 What is currently called a device 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.499
 Such a system that can mitigate vibration in the primary 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:51.350
 It's effective. 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.110
 In that effect system 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.729
 Mokpo or the birth or the birth 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.729
 Or shock 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.340
 By using something like a stabilizer 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.229
 It consists of various shapes and story structures. 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.129
 This part goes into suspension, too. 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:06.270
 in detail 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.270
 Let's take a look. 

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:14.220
 It is called " 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.610
 uc car 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.160
 800, and the driver 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160
 Would not there be an intention to do so? 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.699
 The handle is talking when I turn the handle 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.639
 All the devices that can change the angle of the presser 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:31.759
 It's limited. 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.439
 The childish banquet does not look like it used to be. 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:36.250
 You do not have to turn around hard. 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.650
 Even gently 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.460
 That heavy car 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.500
 An apartment that is not growing can move smoothly 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.949
 What is 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:44.780
 It's called power steam. 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.699
 Yeoju is almost all cars are covered 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.660
 So this part 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.090
 Let's take a closer look at storage devices. 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.090
 I'll do it. 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.940
 Now in the car 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.160
 Another one is the most important. 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.800
 Brake system turns on 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.849
 The braking system is also included in the implementation. 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:07.320
 The brake device 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.819
 How important it is 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.499
 More than Beijing 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:15.680
 Or velocity is more important than 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:17.180
 I do not like this 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.780
 So people can not just build cars with the power they receive. 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.710
 Because of 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.340
 A series of all the meat hanging 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.840
 Is this someone 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.440
 Or if you stop by for a while and learn the braking device 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.040
 I will study. 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.769
 The operation is also carried out in the camera 

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:40.599
 All of today's cars have advanced systems 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.749
 The goal is blowing up. 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.650
 Evolution is becoming dreadfully fast 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.570
 Among them 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.860
 It's the heaviest thing to write in your biggest home. 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.259
 So it's not all that is used in these cars. 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.659
 This is included in the fourth implementation, 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:58.280
 Experts say 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.280
 Let's take a closer look at each section. 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.129
 This time, it was a lot of grasp. 

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:12.279
 All the rest except the implementation 

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:14.289
 You can look at body check. 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:18.340
 For example, if a person wears a seat part or dances 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.490
 Outgoing 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.570
 The cargo segment distinguishes this and becomes a passenger car. 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.149
 Or a lorry or something like this. 

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:27.430
 Anyway 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.070
 What is the part of the remainder of the remainder except for 1 billion won 

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.899
 Peek at 

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:33.939
 It's a half.
