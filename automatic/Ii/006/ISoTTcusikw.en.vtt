before Geralt will talk with you anymore
I<00:02:15.840> guess<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:17.340> one<00:02:18.180> final<00:02:18.569> note<00:02:18.989> before<00:02:19.230> we<00:02:19.680> move

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
I guess so one final note before we move

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.009 
I guess so one final note before we move

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
here but it's not that difficult of a

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.369 
here but it's not that difficult of a
fight<00:05:47.610> and<00:05:47.849> even<00:05:48.719> with<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.080> unfinished

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:49.379

is<00:06:30.000> now<00:06:30.330> you<00:06:30.389> did<00:06:30.629> get<00:06:30.779> a<00:06:30.810> warning<00:06:31.110> about<00:06:31.319> this

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:35.219 
a little bit earlier but um not too I

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:36.499 
a little bit earlier but um not too I
guess<00:06:35.279> in<00:06:35.519> the<00:06:35.639> case<00:06:35.789> of<00:06:35.909> this<00:06:36.000> video<00:06:36.149> it's<00:06:36.389> not

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:36.509 
guess in the case of this video it's not

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:37.820 
guess in the case of this video it's not
too<00:06:36.629> important<00:06:37.019> that<00:06:37.169> I<00:06:37.199> had<00:06:37.409> mentioned<00:06:37.620> that
