unfortunately<00:01:37.770> although<00:01:38.430> there<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.119> another

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
unfortunately although there is another

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.090 
unfortunately although there is another
way<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:40.170> out<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.590> glitch<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
way to get out of this glitch and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.609 
way to get out of this glitch and
basically<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:42.210> all<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:43.049> all<00:01:43.229> coordinated

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
basically it's all it's all coordinated

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.679 
basically it's all it's all coordinated
but<00:01:44.189> anyways<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.820> wanted<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> show<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.450> guys

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
but anyways I wanted to show you guys

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.080 
but anyways I wanted to show you guys
this<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.110> spirit<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.159> naval<00:01:47.520> strike<00:01:47.640> pack

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
this in spirit of the naval strike pack

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.020 
this in spirit of the naval strike pack
coming<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.049> march<00:01:49.380> 25th<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.220> premium<00:01:50.670> members

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
coming on march 25th for premium members

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.810 
coming on march 25th for premium members
and<00:01:51.270> basically<00:01:51.990> before<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.890> guess<00:01:53.220> maybe<00:01:53.520> this

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and basically before I guess maybe this

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.639 
and basically before I guess maybe this
as<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> possibility<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.840> even<00:01:54.990> being<00:01:55.350> patched

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
as a possibility of even being patched

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.819 
as a possibility of even being patched
or<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.700> course<00:01:56.880> they<00:01:57.240> even<00:01:57.509> discover<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.110> being

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
or of course they even discover it being

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.859 
or of course they even discover it being
there<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.310> first<00:01:59.490> place<00:01:59.640> I<00:02:00.119> spent<00:02:00.780> about

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
there in the first place I spent about

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.600 
there in the first place I spent about
two<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.350> half<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.680> three<00:02:01.710> hours<00:02:02.009> with<00:02:02.460> my

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
two and a half to three hours with my

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.289 
two and a half to three hours with my
buddy<00:02:02.790> J<00:02:03.240> or<00:02:03.689> Brice<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.439> basically<00:02:05.189> we<00:02:06.000> worked

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
buddy J or Brice and basically we worked

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.479 
buddy J or Brice and basically we worked
our<00:02:06.570> asses<00:02:06.810> off<00:02:07.170> trying<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.590> find<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.250> ran

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
our asses off trying to find this we ran

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.190 
our asses off trying to find this we ran
around<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.910> every<00:02:09.300> objective<00:02:09.810> or<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.050> least

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
around on every objective or at least

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.930 
around on every objective or at least
every<00:02:10.530> object<00:02:11.039> around<00:02:11.340> all<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
every object around all of the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.830 
every object around all of the
objectives

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
objectives

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.750 
objectives
trying<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.349> place<00:02:13.530> our<00:02:13.680> MIB<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.340> jump<00:02:14.580> on

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
trying to place our MIB is and jump on

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.880 
trying to place our MIB is and jump on
things<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.720> there<00:02:15.810> was<00:02:15.930> truly<00:02:16.170> interesting

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
things and there was truly interesting

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.020 
things and there was truly interesting
but<00:02:17.099> as<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.310> see<00:02:17.489> here<00:02:17.700> I'm<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:17.940> show

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
but as you see here I'm going to show

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.120 
but as you see here I'm going to show
you<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.360> can't<00:02:18.690> capture<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.200> see<00:02:19.560> objective

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
you you can't capture the see objective

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.100 
you you can't capture the see objective
and<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.880> can't<00:02:21.120> shoot<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.840> can't

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
and you can't shoot it and you can't

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.500 
and you can't shoot it and you can't
basically<00:02:22.489> trigger<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.700> LEvolution<00:02:24.060> events

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
basically trigger the LEvolution events

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.170 
basically trigger the LEvolution events
around<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.050> objective<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.790> get

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
around that objective but you can get

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.460 
around that objective but you can get
out<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.569> glitch<00:02:27.870> now<00:02:28.140> if<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.349> have

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
out of this glitch now if you have

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.650 
out of this glitch now if you have
teammates<00:02:28.890> who<00:02:29.400> are<00:02:29.550> inside<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.209> ceiling

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
teammates who are inside of the ceiling

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.449 
teammates who are inside of the ceiling
doing<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.050> same<00:02:31.260> thing<00:02:31.500> as<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:32.430> can

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
doing the same thing as you you can

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.040 
doing the same thing as you you can
actually<00:02:32.700> get<00:02:33.030> out<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.269> this<00:02:33.390> glitch<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.900> if

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
actually get out of this glitch and if

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.720 
actually get out of this glitch and if
you<00:02:34.140> go<00:02:34.290> over<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.650> stairs<00:02:34.980> over<00:02:35.220> here<00:02:35.370> by

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
you go over to the stairs over here by

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.640 
you go over to the stairs over here by
be<00:02:35.970> objective<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.780> course<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.200> conquest

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
be objective of course this is conquest

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.650 
be objective of course this is conquest
large<00:02:37.739> if<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.700> run<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.090> jump<00:02:39.150> right<00:02:39.599> here

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
large if you run and jump right here

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.809 
large if you run and jump right here
where<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.260> LEvolution<00:02:40.620> occurs<00:02:41.099> you<00:02:41.790> can

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
where the LEvolution occurs you can

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.850 
where the LEvolution occurs you can
actually<00:02:42.060> get<00:02:42.360> out<00:02:42.569> of<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.780> glitch<00:02:43.019> now<00:02:43.739> in<00:02:43.800> a

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
actually get out of the glitch now in a

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.770 
actually get out of the glitch now in a
few<00:02:44.040> minutes<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.430> few<00:02:44.459> moments<00:02:45.060> here<00:02:45.299> I'm<00:02:45.420> going

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
few minutes a few moments here I'm going

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.390 
few minutes a few moments here I'm going
to<00:02:45.840> show<00:02:46.049> you<00:02:46.080> what<00:02:46.560> happens<00:02:46.890> if<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.130> screw

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
to show you what happens if you screw

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.250 
to show you what happens if you screw
this<00:02:47.549> glitch<00:02:47.760> up<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.150> basically<00:02:48.900> why<00:02:49.200> you

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
this glitch up and basically why you

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.620 
this glitch up and basically why you
need<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> spawn<00:02:49.920> beacon<00:02:49.950> if<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:51.060> don't<00:02:51.330> turn

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
need a spawn beacon if you don't turn

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.509 
need a spawn beacon if you don't turn
far<00:02:52.080> enough<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.739> left<00:02:52.980> while<00:02:53.370> you're

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
far enough to the left while you're

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.340 
far enough to the left while you're
doing<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.850> glitch<00:02:54.120> you'll<00:02:54.690> actually<00:02:54.900> fall

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
doing this glitch you'll actually fall

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.990 
doing this glitch you'll actually fall
down<00:02:55.380> below<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.160> I'll<00:02:56.280> show<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.519> what<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.790> mean

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
down below and I'll show you what I mean

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.630 
down below and I'll show you what I mean
here<00:02:57.269> this<00:02:57.870> area<00:02:58.260> down<00:02:58.440> here<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:59.069> can't<00:02:59.400> shoot

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
here this area down here you can't shoot

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.280 
here this area down here you can't shoot
anything<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.269> only<00:03:00.569> thing<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:00.989> do<00:03:01.110> is

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
anything the only thing you can do is

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.770 
anything the only thing you can do is
capture<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.830> objective<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:03.150> can't<00:03:03.510> get

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
capture the objective and you can't get

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.240 
capture the objective and you can't get
out<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.290> glitch<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:04.860> is<00:03:04.980> one<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.190> the

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
out of this glitch this is one of the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.949 
out of this glitch this is one of the
things<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.700> can't<00:03:05.940> get<00:03:06.060> out<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.330> there

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
things that you can't get out of there

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.800 
things that you can't get out of there
could<00:03:07.230> be<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.410> possible<00:03:07.950> way<00:03:08.099> to<00:03:08.130> do<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.849> but

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
could be a possible way to do that but

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.839 
could be a possible way to do that but
from<00:03:09.989> what<00:03:10.110> I've<00:03:10.200> discovered<00:03:10.590> basically<00:03:11.580> you

from what I've discovered basically you

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.850 
from what I've discovered basically you
can't<00:03:12.120> escape<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:12.690> little<00:03:13.049> corridor<00:03:13.440> here

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
can't escape this little corridor here

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.650 
can't escape this little corridor here

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
at least jail cells I like to think of

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.160 
at least jail cells I like to think of
it<00:03:15.840> now<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.980> area<00:03:17.340> down<00:03:17.519> here<00:03:17.820> again<00:03:18.019> you<00:03:19.019> can

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
it now this area down here again you can

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.810 
it now this area down here again you can
capture<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.560> objectives<00:03:20.130> but<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.549> only<00:03:20.670> way

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
capture the objectives but the only way

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.099 
capture the objectives but the only way
to<00:03:20.880> get<00:03:21.090> out<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.359> is<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.930> course
