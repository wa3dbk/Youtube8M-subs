world<00:01:29.289> here<00:01:29.590> in<00:01:29.679> Alberta<00:01:29.950> I<00:01:30.280> could<00:01:30.910> run<00:01:31.090> plants

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
world here in Alberta I could run plants

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.290 
world here in Alberta I could run plants
courses<00:01:31.929> in<00:01:32.110> those<00:01:32.410> two<00:01:32.619> environments<00:01:33.209> so<00:01:34.209> if

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
courses in those two environments so if

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.690 
courses in those two environments so if
you<00:01:34.390> come<00:01:34.660> from<00:01:34.959> the<00:01:35.709> state<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:35.979> New<00:01:36.190> York<00:01:36.459> and

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
you come from the state of New York and

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.480 
you come from the state of New York and
I<00:01:37.660> say<00:01:37.899> here<00:01:38.200> learn<00:01:38.440> about<00:01:38.740> our<00:01:38.950> plants<00:01:39.310> here

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
I say here learn about our plants here

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.609 
I say here learn about our plants here
are<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.640> DVDs<00:01:39.940> you<00:01:40.360> likely<00:01:40.750> will<00:01:40.899> say<00:01:41.080> well

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
are the DVDs you likely will say well

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:42.930 
are the DVDs you likely will say well
these<00:01:41.770> plants<00:01:42.099> probably<00:01:42.399> don't<00:01:42.580> grow<00:01:42.729> where<00:01:42.880> I

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
these plants probably don't grow where I

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.910 
these plants probably don't grow where I
come<00:01:43.149> from<00:01:43.179> therefore<00:01:44.080> I<00:01:44.110> don't<00:01:44.470> think<00:01:44.800> I'll

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
come from therefore I don't think I'll

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.339 
come from therefore I don't think I'll
bother<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:46.119> is<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.360> big<00:01:46.780> mistake

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:47.349 
bother that is a big mistake

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:50.070 
bother that is a big mistake
at<00:01:47.860> any<00:01:48.039> rate<00:01:48.130> people<00:01:49.030> will<00:01:49.330> often<00:01:49.539> ask<00:01:49.869> about

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
at any rate people will often ask about

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.850 
at any rate people will often ask about
good<00:01:50.470> information<00:01:51.130> now<00:01:52.119> from<00:01:52.149> my<00:01:52.569> perspective

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
good information now from my perspective

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.630 
good information now from my perspective
when<00:01:53.860> I<00:01:53.920> look<00:01:54.250> at<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.399> plant<00:01:55.259> I'll<00:01:56.259> say<00:01:56.560> ok<00:01:57.160> now<00:01:57.610> I

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
when I look at a plant I'll say ok now I

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.210 
when I look at a plant I'll say ok now I
know<00:01:57.819> what<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.239> plant<00:01:58.509> is<00:01:58.810> what<00:01:59.770> are<00:01:59.920> all<00:02:00.039> its

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
know what that plant is what are all its

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.050 
know what that plant is what are all its
uses<00:02:01.170> now<00:02:02.170> generally<00:02:02.709> what<00:02:02.890> happens<00:02:03.340> is<00:02:03.580> that

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
uses now generally what happens is that

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.330 
uses now generally what happens is that
you<00:02:04.720> will<00:02:04.929> find<00:02:05.289> that<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.679> uses<00:02:06.039> for<00:02:06.250> that

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
you will find that the uses for that

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.260 
you will find that the uses for that
plant<00:02:06.700> whether<00:02:06.910> it's<00:02:07.179> edible<00:02:07.770> medicinal<00:02:08.770> or

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
magical or useful when we say useful can

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.209 
magical or useful when we say useful can
I<00:02:13.150> use<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.480> for<00:02:13.659> string<00:02:13.930> can<00:02:14.439> I<00:02:14.500> use<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.040> make

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:15.219 
I use it for string can I use it to make

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.369 
I use it for string can I use it to make
something<00:02:15.519> other<00:02:16.150> than<00:02:16.750> something<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.110> goes

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
consider this

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.020 
consider this
a<00:04:33.050> bit<00:04:33.680> much<00:04:33.889> a<00:04:33.919> lot<00:04:34.220> of<00:04:34.250> people<00:04:34.370> shy<00:04:34.759> away<00:04:34.910> from

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
a bit much a lot of people shy away from

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.020 
a bit much a lot of people shy away from
the<00:04:35.300> price<00:04:35.509> because<00:04:36.169> they<00:04:36.350> very<00:04:36.949> often<00:04:37.160> sort

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
the price because they very often sort

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.659 
the price because they very often sort
of<00:04:38.120> think<00:04:38.330> they<00:04:38.449> figure<00:04:38.840> that<00:04:39.669> information

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
of think they figure that information

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.700 
of think they figure that information
should<00:04:40.850> come<00:04:41.030> cheaply<00:04:41.330> but<00:04:42.020> at<00:04:42.139> any<00:04:42.289> rate<00:04:42.380> if

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
should come cheaply but at any rate if

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.010 
should come cheaply but at any rate if
