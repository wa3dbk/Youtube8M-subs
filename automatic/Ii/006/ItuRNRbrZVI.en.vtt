your<00:00:52.590> composure<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.100> little<00:00:53.340> bit<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:53.550> almost

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
your composure a little bit with almost

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.889 
your composure a little bit with almost
penalties<00:00:54.210> or<00:00:54.420> what<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:54.930> going<00:00:55.110> on

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
they bury the power-play chances I think

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.280 
they bury the power-play chances I think
we<00:01:05.100> were<00:01:05.220> obviously<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.390> lot<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> emotion<00:01:07.170> from

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
we were obviously a lot of emotion from

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.690 
we were obviously a lot of emotion from
the<00:01:07.380> game

about<00:01:11.700> someone<00:01:12.030> between<00:01:12.300> but<00:01:12.630> yeah<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.229> guess

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
about someone between but yeah I guess

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.050 
about someone between but yeah I guess
maybe<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.190> little<00:01:14.310> bit

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060
