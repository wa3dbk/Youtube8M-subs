00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.100
 the trees 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.650
 to develop 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.049
 the total perception of the group is that if 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.240
 the dallas are more at risk before 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.639
 of developing an addiction now we 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.330
 I would like to listen because you believe 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.210
 who are at higher risk for someone from 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.790
 experiment because the same friends 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.530
 they are induced to use drugs 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:31.510
 because they have to belong because of the lack of 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.250
 information that sometimes there are students 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.289
 in particular the parents and 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.789
 the schools have no information 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.399
 adequate regarding addictions 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:42.190
 of what is its impact how they are generated 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.769
 where does it come from that promotes it how 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.269
 start why they keep consuming that they do not 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.249
 they know what the damages they have to 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.170
 short to medium and long term on 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:52.149
 addictions on the consumption of some 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.069
 drugs believe that tobacco and alcohol 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.109
 many times they are not drugs because they have 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:57.609
 as a very easy access to them the 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.649
 problem has to do with developing 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.850
 solutions in prevention we work with 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.670
 the elements that are already working 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.340
 properly to take them from the party 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.110
 functional to an exceptional state we do not 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.210
 we based on terror we do not rely on 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.219
 a problematic us as 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.970
 prevention educators we put ourselves to 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.790
 your level 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.590
 we speak in their own language and it is for 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.870
 what they like that open open 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.340
 totally then they forget that 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.950
 someone authoritarian 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.690
 we try to break with those styles 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.700
 of learning and teaching that has been 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.200
 long handled what 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.060
 we do first that nothing is 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.350
 inform the whole community what the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.200
 model of the way in which we 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.790
 we work from that information 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.100
 Segment work with parents 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.110
 we work with students we work with the 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.600
 school and with each of them 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.000
 we design educational strategies we believe 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.380
 that it's super important that a guy from 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.540
 12 13 years with which we are 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.700
 working now grow with a 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.530
 education in prevention that they can 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.450
 make healthy decisions from 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.940
 right now they have a car like a 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.350
 clear self-knowledge of themselves if 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.540
 they do not know each other and they have a low 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.190
 self-esteem of course it is very much 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.320
 easier to fall into a behavior of 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.910
 risk and what we do is identify 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.310
 the role that each of us has 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.020
 within prevention with strategies 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.060
 very clear is not only a course of 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.830
 addictions or substances but it is 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.660
 when you face that problem or 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.610
 that situation at home at school in 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.250
 the family 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.660
 in society I identify now what 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.390
 is what are you going to do how are you going to 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.220
 respond as a parent as a manager as 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.050
 student as a member of this society I 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.440
 it seemed very very important that we 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.740
 they would say at what point is it that the parents 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.410
 we can intervene so that the boys 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.300
 do not fall into an addiction that 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.750
 dedicate more time to the boys 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.910
 offer them a healthy entertainment 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.959
 foster family coexistence through 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.920
 Evenings of dancing to sing without 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.069
 that there is 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.110
 this exposure to alcohol drugs 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.300
 for example and they see that there is a 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.810
 healthy way to have fun and 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.360
 integrate young people to be able to have 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.540
 as prevention strategies or be 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.950
 under a culture of prevention 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.440
 what we first tell you is 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.060
 you know he researches simple way 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.250
 they have information they are going to think two 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.950
 times before carrying out a 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.900
 another risk behavior is that they have 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.670
 a person of trust with whom 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.380
 talk to him so they can talk about their 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.760
 problems or difficult situations brings 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.800
 your own successes is always very 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.989
 important to share what lives what 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.340
 we are doing is a new culture and 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.989
 that the transmission that these 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.209
 teenagers and young people today 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.580
 tomorrow they can convey the possibility 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.640
 to generate relationships of solidarity 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.950
 healthy coexistence without having substances of 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.280
 through 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.280
