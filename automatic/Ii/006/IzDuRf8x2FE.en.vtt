00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
upon hearing that I was honestly very

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.180 
upon hearing that I was honestly very
disappointed<00:00:50.969> um<00:00:51.600> did<00:00:52.289> not<00:00:52.500> expect<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.039> at

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
disappointed um did not expect that at

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.979 
disappointed um did not expect that at
all<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.699> course<00:00:54.030> no<00:00:54.360> one<00:00:54.510> Robbie<00:00:54.690> saw<00:00:54.930> it

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
all of course no one Robbie saw it

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.099 
all of course no one Robbie saw it
coming<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.699> it<00:00:56.699> does<00:00:56.969> make<00:00:57.210> sense<00:00:57.270> now<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.870> i

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
coming but it does make sense now that i

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.750 
coming but it does make sense now that i
think<00:00:58.199> about<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.710> does<00:00:59.070> make<00:00:59.250> sense<00:00:59.280> if

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
think about it does make sense if

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.029 
think about it does make sense if
they're<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.750> now<00:01:00.930> put<00:01:01.260> all<00:01:01.500> their<00:01:01.680> focus

of the episodes eight and nine but the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.350 
of the episodes eight and nine but the
