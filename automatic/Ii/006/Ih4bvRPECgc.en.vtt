00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 we are going to talk about dance but not one 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.319
 any dance we are talking about 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.809
 a work related to non-literature 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.170
 everyone knows how to create this type of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.630
 union but we have the one who has it 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.250
 made the one who knows how to do it differently 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.750
 time so let's welcome 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.230
 michele di stefano ciao michele 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:27.359
 good morning everyone good afternoon indeed 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.300
 it's day has long since become is 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.520
 the sun is back 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.290
 at tardini only day here is why 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.440
 obviously changes little that will come out 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.510
 only tonight I imagine you are the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.719
 choreographer of the company also i 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.050
 as well as one of the two founders of this 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.050
 company 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.410
 what is the mission I will do this to you 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.260
 he asks because I believe there is one 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.719
 of the sense all you're immersed in a job 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.329
 which is not easy is not easy because it is 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.520
 Possibly maybe you create something of the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.579
 kind but you can't get it to arrive 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.100
 really to those who look at you who is it 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.110
 spectator of this fantastic of 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.090
 so this fantastic work we are 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.280
 talking about something that will happen 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.540
 during the weekend that is about to enter 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.840
 in our week it is 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.690
 Robinson will debut in the national premiere at 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.050
 Argentine theater on February 7 and I would be 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.070
 you will be there until 9 then weekend 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.070
 in the name of dance 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.950
 exact the first interesting thing is that 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.010
 esteemed Argentine hosts a show 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.370
 of contemporary dance pure raise is 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:43.900
 a choreographic work in a place that of 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.430
 usually instead dedicated to the cause but 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.030
 this is very interesting and not 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.770
 be able to unhinge a little too 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.600
 kind of genre that usually 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.729
 then accompanies the programming 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.900
 we are very happy to be here 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.910
 work refers to a novel that 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.410
 is a rewrite of the robinson crusoe 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.090
 that everyone knows is a novel by 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.150
 michel tournier called friday o 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.759
 the limbo of the pacific 9 for enzo del 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.450
 original novel as a hobby around 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.790
 instead of putting the clothes back on the island 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.269
 Western civilized man who 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.660
 colonize the native you lose 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.680
 completely in this landscape and 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.720
 this immersion in nature 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.090
 the island causes him a metamorphosis 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.330
 very profoundly prepares him 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.549
 then to a different meeting with the year 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.430
 of an equal meeting in which it is 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:39.930
 possible together to invent a new one 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.630
 possibility of coexistence that yes 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.750
 away from the cliché of the relationship 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.830
 hierarchical between the man of culture and the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.750
 good wild and this idea of ​​openness 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.970
 towards the other no of a 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.360
 real meeting that opens 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.049
 new possibilities made me think 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.720
 of wanting to do a job on dance like 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.660
 instrument of the meeting between the places in the 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.600
 meaning that it is possible to hypothesize gods 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.060
 individual body projects that 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.790
 manage to emerge to grow a 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.730
 mature only next to those of 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.220
 others that the dance works when 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.169
 allows another dance to exist 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.389
 next to yours then the body is 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.510
 really body when it's next to 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.640
 front 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.310
 beside other doors and this is a bit 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.629
 the direct connection in short col 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.099
 sense of the novel there is to say no I wanted 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.069
 know what kind of music 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.459
 we will listen during robinson us 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.829
 we work with composers 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:49.010
 contemporary which is a written work to 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.650
 hoc for the show and from lorenzo 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.690
 whites a collaborator came out 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.420
 usual company is actually 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.549
 now an integral part of the group 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.409
 composed several musics for ours 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.579
 previous shows around the world 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:08.510
 in 80 days and others and does a job 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:10.819
 in this case it builds a system a 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.639
 starting from the electronics that is based on 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.930
 of linguistic information in the 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:19.900
 meaning that the phrases of musical movement 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.250
 they relate to sentences 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.949
 choreographic in a clustered way 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.930
 I call interesting and unpublished I say 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.289
 who almost look at each other with 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.130
 a certain distrust and therefore 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.800
 also reproduce in this report 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.220
 dance and music the possibilities yes 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.139
 open a meeting between the real-time 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.370
 different maliki languages was the idea 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:45.979
 to create dance shows 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:49.930
 starting from literary works but in 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:52.780
 reality is something that we only know that 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.710
 very often we know how to translate 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:00.530
 scenically the story is not for 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.800
 reconstruct the story so I can say 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.590
 in terms of design images of the 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.270
 choreography instead our approach is 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.060
 slightly different than I 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.930
 novel I am inspired by this vague idea of 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.550
 novelistic nut of these books by 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.370
 adventure however continue to 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:23.060
 refer to an elsewhere that can be 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.860
 also the exotic that perhaps today in the world 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.590
 contemporary is no longer there because now 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.440
 no place is really far away no 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.669
 contemporary tourist moves everywhere 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.500
 at the speed of light 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.750
 so let's say rebuild one 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.020
 possibility of the exotic and elsewhere 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.840
 entrusting it to a very meeting 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.780
 real among the three cooked in this sense is 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.680
 more exotic one afternoon at 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.599
 tip on the 14 low at the termini station 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.900
 a major door that not just a 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:56.629
 a malaysia resort trip how many 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.750
 are the assets that we will see on stage are 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:03.139
 five performers stage the musician 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.440
 which processes sound live and in directing 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.150
 there is the intervention of a visual artist 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.289
 which is very much appreciated in the field 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:15.590
 international that luca trevisani e 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:18.199
 this is the same that makes it up 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.889
 show very well where you will be from 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:23.360
 Romeo dependent on this work 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.830
 we continue to run with work 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.409
 previous which is called impression from 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.050
 sad is that it has the same type of 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:32.659
 this is what the exotic investigation actually is 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.389
 work will then go to the europe factory 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:37.520
 Florence will be at the Leopolda station 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:40.789
 to the international website of Santarcangelo 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.860
 and then being a debut is also the 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:45.159
 presence of operators in the hall in these 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.880
 three evenings will determine a little 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:51.050
 construction of the calendar for 2014 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.810
 very well the hero of 7 to 9 February 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.639
 robinson at the argentine theater thanks e 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.509

 your face
