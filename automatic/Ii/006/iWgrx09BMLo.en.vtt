00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.900
 one of the many innovations is included 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.059
 the new c-class in the radiator grille 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.000
 no joke this air flap or 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.190
 neudeutsch this r panel ensures 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.660
 better values in drag what 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.220
 according to the aerodynamics clearly 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.430
 Improved helps with the topic 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.050
 Wind noise helps with the topic consumption 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.029
 and helps, of course, in, so to speak 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.580
 the case further optics again there is the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.109
 c class in two variants once the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.510
 Classic with the star on the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.329
 bonnet or just the sportier 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.550
 Variant with the star in the grille so 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.520
 let's play with both faces 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.750
 the vehicle a very sporty 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.190
 Positioning very important in the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.100
 C-class also very successful in the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.329
 c-class in the old or up to 80 degrees 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.039
 but now with our limousine luxury 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.690
 the face sliding into a very 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.969
 There is exclusive direction in the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.829
 exclusive line and underline it 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.109
 we again in the modern luxury 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.120
 aspect of the c-class visually moves the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.939
 c-class now quite close to the s class 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.369
 a look for all models 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.580
 wanted and from mercedes view quite 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.520
 sensibly the design stages very much 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.990
 strong the brand and the brand values 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.610
 what mercedes benz stands for we like 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.560
 that mercedes benz a modern luxury 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.320
 defines that does the c class in that 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.720
 segment like no other car and that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.340
 my ambition is as chefdesigner 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.840
 Overall, the c class is nine 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.520
 centimeters longer 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.460
 This creates space for the new four 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.290
 handlebar front axle also offers mercedes 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.950
 even in the c class an air suspension 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.260
 on 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.750
 this is the first time per 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.940
 switch from very comfortable to extreme 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.530
 more athletic 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.660
 also optionally available is now at 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.150
 the c-class has a head up display 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.590
 So the navigation instructions are on 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.190
 the windscreen for the driver 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.770
 visible 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.990
 All in all, the current c-class is 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.210
 100 kilograms lighter 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.790
 mainly due to the increased use 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.860
 of high strength aluminum has been achieved 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.479
 from 10 to 50 percent aluminum share 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.649
 in the rough construction went 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.060
 if you also with the engines 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.709
 corresponding optimizes what the weight 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.840
 This concerns the focus 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.630
 also dropped again accordingly 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.450
 for driving brings that even more 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.060
 agility better driving performance at less 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.800
 fuel consumption then the weight comes 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.080
 but again for one or the other 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.410
 there is a new feature there , for example 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.590
 this container in the glove box 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.750
 the optional fragrance of the new c-class 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.870
 the whole in three stages adjustable who 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.510
 command system the extra fresh climate 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.730
 in the car has its extra charge for it 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.570
 the handsfree via bluetooth in 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.400
 the new c class as standard on board 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:53.410
 At the start of the sale there are five 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.769
 gasoline engines between 156 to 245 ps at the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.160
 dieseln goes the performance range of 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:03.610
 115 to 204 ps in addition there is the 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.980
 300 diesel with hybrid drive who less 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.459
 Save on but rather on benefits 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.640
 is from september can the c400 with 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.739
 333 hp and permanent all-wheel drive 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.650
 to order 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:20.530
 Our test car is a C 250 with the 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.010
 211 hp four-cylinder gasoline engine 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.600
 equipped that fits perfectly to the car 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.610
 accelerates the c class to 6 6 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.400
 seconds from 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.150
 bikes up to 250 km / h 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.970
 make fast 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.080
 All in all, the new c-class is over 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.820
 some sportier than the predecessor 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.430
 nevertheless she feels all expectations 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.290
 in terms of luxury and conveniences the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.200
 a mercedes too easy 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.000
 Therefore, it does not matter whether with 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.780
 the star on the hood or in the 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.210
 radiator grill 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.210
