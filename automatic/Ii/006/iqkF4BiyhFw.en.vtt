00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
new paint processes so then launches

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.610 
new paint processes so then launches
imminent<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.960> see<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.469> they

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
imminent as you can see here they

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.479 
imminent as you can see here they
delayed<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.460> white<00:01:03.000> version<00:01:03.329> until<00:01:03.719> spring

due to manufacturing problems the common

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.990 
due to manufacturing problems the common
theory<00:01:09.240> was<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.630> paint<00:01:09.869> was<00:01:10.049> causing

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
theory was that the paint was causing

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.570 
theory was that the paint was causing
concern<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.860> according<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.100> sources<00:01:14.400> at

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the time the painting of the handset

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.050 
the time the painting of the handset
with<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> white<00:01:17.070> color<00:01:17.310> was<00:01:17.490> proving<00:01:17.880> more

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
with a white color was proving more

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.600 
with a white color was proving more
difficult<00:01:18.200> than<00:01:19.200> Apple<00:01:19.560> had<00:01:19.650> hoped<00:01:19.920> with

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
have something to do with this and rise

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.709
