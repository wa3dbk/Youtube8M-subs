00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.520 
along with HTC's very own sense 4 plus
so<00:02:31.240> with<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.510> let's<00:02:31.720> take<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.990> wrapper<00:02:32.200> off

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:44.650 

and<00:02:36.890> let's<00:02:37.310> fire<00:02:37.610> up

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.030 

it's<00:02:45.410> either<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:45.970> five<00:02:46.970> inch

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
it's either that five inch

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.370 
it's either that five inch
440<00:02:50.040> PPI<00:02:50.430> display<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.210> just<00:02:51.480> remarkable<00:02:51.870> to

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
440 PPI display is just remarkable to

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.050 
440 PPI display is just remarkable to
look<00:02:52.530> at

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.320 

from<00:02:55.599> every<00:02:55.930> angle<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:56.760> mean<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:57.849> is<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.030> pretty

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
from every angle I mean this is a pretty

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:09.690 
from every angle I mean this is a pretty
steep<00:02:58.599> angle<00:02:59.020> we're<00:02:59.170> looking<00:02:59.440> at<00:02:59.560> right<00:02:59.739> here

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.229 

this<00:03:10.300> is<00:03:10.450> virtually<00:03:11.230> almost<00:03:11.879> looking<00:03:12.879> through

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
this is virtually almost looking through

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:20.050 
this is virtually almost looking through
this<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:14.319> side<00:03:14.590> of<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.980> device

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.589 

the<00:03:20.900> only<00:03:21.110> drawback<00:03:21.290> is<00:03:21.860> it's<00:03:22.099> only<00:03:22.310> got<00:03:22.599> 16

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
the only drawback is it's only got 16

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.949 
the only drawback is it's only got 16
gigabyte<00:03:24.110> of<00:03:24.230> memory<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:25.569> there<00:03:26.569> are<00:03:26.660> no

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
gigabyte of memory and there are no

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.890 
gigabyte of memory and there are no
memory<00:03:27.770> expansion<00:03:28.610> card<00:03:29.000> slots<00:03:29.330> so<00:03:29.630> you're

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
memory expansion card slots so you're

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.260 
memory expansion card slots so you're
stuck<00:03:30.290> with<00:03:30.470> 16<00:03:30.890> right<00:03:31.099> now<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.610> what's<00:03:32.030> even

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
stuck with 16 right now and what's even

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.880 
stuck with 16 right now and what's even
worse<00:03:32.420> is<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:33.470> only<00:03:33.590> has<00:03:33.920> 11<00:03:34.730> gigabyte<00:03:35.510> of<00:03:35.890> user

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
worse is it only has 11 gigabyte of user

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.309 
worse is it only has 11 gigabyte of user
storage<00:03:37.400> space<00:03:37.640> so<00:03:37.970> make<00:03:38.420> sure<00:03:38.450> you<00:03:38.840> swerving

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
storage space so make sure you swerving

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.500 
storage space so make sure you swerving
in<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.590> cloud<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.099> delete<00:03:40.580> those<00:03:40.790> big<00:03:41.209> big

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
in the cloud and delete those big big

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.660 
in the cloud and delete those big big
1080<00:03:41.900> videos<00:03:42.260> as<00:03:42.440> you<00:03:42.560> record<00:03:42.920> them<00:03:43.040> because

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
1080 videos as you record them because

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.250 
1080 videos as you record them because
you're<00:03:43.760> going<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:43.970> run<00:03:44.060> out<00:03:44.239> of<00:03:44.269> space<00:03:44.420> quickly

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
you're going to run out of space quickly

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.950 
you're going to run out of space quickly
on<00:03:45.440> this<00:03:45.650> device

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
on this device

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.330 

and<00:03:48.440> it's<00:03:48.590> something<00:03:48.800> that<00:03:48.950> you're<00:03:49.130> going<00:03:49.250> to

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
and it's something that you're going to

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.000 
and it's something that you're going to
hear<00:03:49.490> me<00:03:49.670> complain<00:03:50.060> about<00:03:50.240> a<00:03:50.390> lot<00:03:50.960> as<00:03:51.680> I'm

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
hear me complain about a lot as I'm

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.420 
hear me complain about a lot as I'm
reviewing<00:03:52.460> the<00:03:53.300> droid<00:03:53.930> DNA

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.280 

so<00:03:57.060> we're<00:03:57.239> going<00:03:57.420> through<00:03:57.629> the<00:03:57.840> phone

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
so we're going through the phone

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:26.480 
so we're going through the phone
activation<00:03:58.739> right<00:03:59.069> here

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.640 

before<00:04:27.240> I<00:04:27.300> forget<00:04:27.330> if<00:04:27.870> you're<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.319> global

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
before I forget if you're a global

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.089 
before I forget if you're a global
traveler<00:04:29.490> or<00:04:29.669> world<00:04:30.090> traveler<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:31.259> droid<00:04:31.680> DNA

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
traveler or world traveler the droid DNA

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.980 
traveler or world traveler the droid DNA
is<00:04:32.250> a<00:04:32.280> true<00:04:32.669> global<00:04:32.880> phone<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:33.630> that<00:04:33.660> means

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
is a true global phone so that means

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.110 
is a true global phone so that means
that<00:04:34.139> you<00:04:34.229> can<00:04:34.380> literally<00:04:34.740> take<00:04:35.160> this<00:04:35.819> phone

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
that you can literally take this phone

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.140 
that you can literally take this phone
anywhere<00:04:36.599> in<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.810> world<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.259> slot<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:38.150> local

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
anywhere in the world and slot a local

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.570 
anywhere in the world and slot a local
sim<00:04:39.360> card<00:04:39.630> in<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.080> should<00:04:40.289> work

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.029 

so<00:04:44.270> I'll<00:04:44.750> just<00:04:44.810> positive<00:04:45.439> for<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:45.620> second<00:04:45.979> and

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
so I'll just positive for a second and

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.159 
so I'll just positive for a second and
let<00:04:46.189> the<00:04:46.340> phone<00:04:46.520> activate<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.180> when<00:04:47.930> we<00:04:48.020> come

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
let the phone activate and when we come

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.140 
let the phone activate and when we come
back<00:04:48.289> I'll<00:04:48.530> give<00:04:48.710> you<00:04:48.800> a<00:04:48.860> quick<00:04:49.159> look<00:04:49.400> at<00:04:49.639> sense

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
back I'll give you a quick look at sense

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.140 
back I'll give you a quick look at sense
for<00:04:50.419> panel<00:04:50.720> on<00:04:50.930> Android<00:04:51.800> 4.1<00:04:52.310> point<00:04:52.699> one

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.210 

you
