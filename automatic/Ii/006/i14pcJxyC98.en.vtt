00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.300
 two boys were walking along 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.759
 of a road leading through 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.610
 a field 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:30.560
 they saw a couple of shoes 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.560
 used at the roadside 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.910
 far away the owner who worked in the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.330
 field 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.510
 the younger boy suggested that he hide 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.300
 the shoes and he hid for 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.170
 observe the surprise expression of the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.440
 shift when he returns boy more 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.140
 Old man thought it would not be good he thought 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.989
 that looking at your clothes as the owner 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.800
 should be a very poor man 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.500
 So, after you talked about it 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.340
 for their suggestion they concluded that 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.800
 try another experiment rather than 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.330
 hide the shoes would put a 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.090
 silver dollar in each and observe the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:24.440
 that the owner would do when he finds out 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.440
 money and that's how they did it 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.770
 soon the man returned from the field put 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.770
 your coat 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:00.220
 put on a foot and a shoe felt something 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.830
 hard took out and found a 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.410
 dodge for the man was amazed and 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.480
 surprised at the same time and turned if not 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.600
 saw no one around and then 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.420
 began to cause the other shoe and the 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.360
 his great surprise found another 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.870
 dollar a very strong emotion dominated his 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.870
 heart 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.900
 moved he knelt down and offered in 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.660
 A loud voice, a prayer of thanks in 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.110
 which he spoke about his wife who was 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.840
 sick and hopeless and their children 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.810
 defenseless and without food 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.650
 he thanked God fervently for 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.800
 this grace from unknown hands and 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.880
 evoked blessings from heaven upon those who 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.740
 they gave you the help you need 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.990
 they had been touched by his prayer 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.140
 and feel the heat inside your 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.570
 hearts 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.350
 walking the road one said to the 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:16.180
 other then really did not have a good 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:20.430
 feeling of another answering yes as 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.430
 It's good to do good to others.
