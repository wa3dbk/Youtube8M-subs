00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:16.260
 hello everybody, let's go to class 318 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.080
 thank you very much if you guys in this class 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.289
 what a like to qualify our 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.369
 channel what else to share on networks 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.400
 social 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.369
 this helps us a lot also what else 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.980
 personal always adds to favorites this 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.320
 and this will also help the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.780
 Our physical channel manufactures your channel 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.649
 physics on the internet every time 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.100
 more 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.660
 In this class we will discuss what the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.149
 dark chamber 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.340
 Do you like the camera I think? 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.719
 Yes, staff loves machinery. 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.260
 photographic 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.629
 well then you know there is a history 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.660
 searched for the history of the machine 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.809
 has a lot of physical in the machine 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.449
 photo but in the early days the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.990
 very simple cameras have 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.110
 as the main physical idea the principle 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.290
 from the darkroom a darkroom 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.330
 basically it's very simple to 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.880
 price of a personal camera 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.299
 a dark camera works basically 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.229
 with the principle of rectilinear propagation 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.860
 the light coming from an object 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.710
 this light can be come directly 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.470
 as an object as a source is primary 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.049
 light from it or a source 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.930
 secondary that reflects light for example 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.890
 take a photo of a person that person 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.189
 What does she do? 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.250
 it reflects light from a primary source 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.790
 of a sunshine lamp a person 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.860
 reflects the light but the light coming out 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.020
 person she goes and goes through dark camera 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.530
 This dark camera in the building has a 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.290
 This little hole is clear 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.509
 then evolved into modern cameras is 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.660
 The diaphragm that gives 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.350
 control the size of the hole 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.690
 but older cameras worked 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.830
 as basically brings all work 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.000
 more or less with the same principle 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:24.470
 physical light leaves the object and spreads 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.230
 as it propagates straight in the optics 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.100
 geometric we know that there is no 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.260
 which even fraction of the light the light always the 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.860
 light beams propagates straight 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.170
 for the good of the infinite rays of light come out 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.930
 of the object of all object points 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.720
 taking the characteristics of color and 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.910
 intensity that light that leaves the object 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.140
 through the dark camera hole 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.900
 and when crossing the light arrives in the bottom 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.800
 of this camera dark camera what it has in 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.410
 bottom 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.760
 formerly it was placed what if 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.970
 put a role that special role 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.420
 was sensitive to light when the light struck 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.310
 in this paper the light sensitize and the photo 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.310
 went straight to the paper 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.660
 at first it took a lot of light to 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.330
 person had to stand still for a while 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.230
 for the capture of the light I only stayed 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.990
 'stop' there is even given a flash 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.290
 so that the flash for which the object or the 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.230
 person is illuminated with 11 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.640
 that reflect more use more light between 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.470
 in the darkroom then the light comes through 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.030
 if it spreads suddenly in the 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.640
 camera bottom hits and sensitizes 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.920
 currently what we have currently in 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.190
 some time ago still used times 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.180
 and uses machines that had a movie 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.220
 so what happens the light beat 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.820
 I recorded that movie and we got 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.620
 that roll of film in my time, right? 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.270
 in my time only so there is currently 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.480
 a few years ago only digital cameras 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.340
 While I was taking that movie there 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.250
 You must use still has photographer 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.729
 like this kind of photo with a movie 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.310
 took that movie to reveal play 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.720
 that one that you film those 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.750
 features on paper 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.750
 paper instead of paper 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.010
 especially the film after an evolution 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.980
 of the cameras what we have we have one 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:39.050
 photo a photosensitive sensor in these 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:43.880
 digital cameras the light beats neither sensor nor 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:47.250
 each sensor sensor site then detects 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:51.030
 a color characteristic of the object of 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:54.990
 intensity of the object and record it 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:59.010
 a physical memory as a sd memory 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:02.040
 on a drive the camera has cameras that 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.760
 has memory already internal and everything then 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.080
 today in said all light is transformed 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.930
 information 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.780
 formerly what happened recorded 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.060
 direct in the film very interesting exist 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.650
 projects that this can 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:22.200
 even do not do with an ink can 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.510
 empty with a furry you can 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.060
 make a homemade camera a camera 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.500
 to achieve this special role and 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.210
 then has to reveal some put 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.750
 chemical products is not so for 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.090
 reveal but you can make a big 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:40.020
 application of the principle of 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:43.650
 rectilinear is what the darkroom of the 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.380
 building that was then up from it 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.350
 there were large photos 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.450
 Okay, so this is the class about 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.410
 dark camera I hope you have 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.450
 liked 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.240
 I will always put in the endings of the videos 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.790
 what the group that is participating the 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.500
 hello of the fable the value of the fable then goes 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.410
 To this galera that I'm going to list and 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.540
 now at the end of the video thanking 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.880
 However to help share 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:12.169
 help the channel grow until the next 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.169
 Class that hug.
