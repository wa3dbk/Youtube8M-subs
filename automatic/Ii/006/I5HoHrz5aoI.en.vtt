00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 hello everybody knows but we're not 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.069
 found today for a new 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.319
 video of a game I'm waiting with 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.110
 impatience so this is about state of 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.750
 death and so that is edited by undead 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.130
 labs so develop it I also think 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.800
 that these parrandas of the decline but I 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.029
 no precision on it but I think 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.980
 all the same as sunday from the aps who 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.359
 develop and who says the game then the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.539
 type of game that's of course a 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.689
 survival horror released france have 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.189
 formalized for the moment but the only 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.109
 official thing is we know he 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.090
 will be released in 2013 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.489
 I think for the first quarter because 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.489
 that already in late 2012 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.460
 the studio undead labs sent a 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.090
 version almost finalized at the studio 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.770
 microsoft 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.360
 so I think an official date 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.010
 will be really coming soon 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.440
 I think goes during the first 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.360
 quarter of 2013 so knowing that the month 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.640
 of january is finished the month of february has 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.809
 started well 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.879
 so it remains the end of February 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.739
 the beginning of March and the end of 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.199
 March but that's so I 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.539
 think we'll have a date soon 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.970
 so for if it's the price I did not 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.260
 no reliable sources at the price level 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.790
 but I still think that since 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.070
 it's an arcade game and that will have no 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.250
 box version we will have around 2 15 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.680
 euros or 1200 points microsoft 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.600
 so that seems correct to me if the game is 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.080
 as promising as can be seen on 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.610
 the video 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.520
 so when you could see the trailer 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.080
 official of this game is there so I 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.180
 cut out the video in several parts the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.329
 part distraction the tactical part and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.520
 the party when and creation of a camp 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.710
 precisely so there you can see so 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.890
 for the distraction part so a 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.200
 surviving survivor pass will be at 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.079
 my opinion customize because you have 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.939
 could see in the trailer that no 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.159
 survivor was the same so I think 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.350
 we can change as the wars i 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.430
 and daisy we can change to our taste 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.630
 of survivors 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.420
 there you could see he send a 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.439
 little firecracker then the firecracker while 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.430
 just because it's full of 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.439
 zombies that swarm and in front of the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.329
 store and so suddenly they were sending 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.290
 the firecracker so that the zombies are 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.180
 attracted where he wants it next 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.979
 so he's going to go to the store and 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.599
 I think it's going to be to recover 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.360
 wolves you put wolves you know what 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.120
 it's just what you can 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.920
 see in 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.370
 the other overspeed games that the 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.049
 wars or asia so the food to 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.900
 pick up the munichois pick up and 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.970
 cetera basically the loots and that some 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.560
 brief thing that's it it's simple but 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.370
 that there we can see one that pick up 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.840
 something we can see too 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.750
 the inventory that is pretty well organized 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.790
 we have a lot of two pockets in our 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.900
 bag of survivors knuble to stop it 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.650
 that he is taking if you 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.970
 have seen just now they 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.470
 did not have but we see that the hac 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.819
 really affect the speed of the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.590
 little character be power of then he 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.170
 a little faster and there with his 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.019
 bag it goes well slowed then of stake 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.690
 we know that we will have access to 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.200
 cars such as you could see there 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.239
 an instant of the knives and 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.239
 firearms so apparently weapons 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.280
 at fire will be editable changeable 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.799
 because there you could hear at 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.690
 sound he had a silencer on his 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.000
 weapon while normal weapons not not 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.680
 two silent on not add 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.959
 so I think there will be some 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.310
 improvements and it is then the 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.420
 ammunition I think it will take 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.420
 restrict because it's not 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.799
 things that will have to be found often if they 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.180
 want to keep their survival aspect for 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.380
 their game is better not that they have 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.519
 ammunition at every turn of the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.430
 food all the time is better 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.139
 whether to search and so on who is 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.569
 a little bit of trouble all the same 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:33.819
 so when it comes to 6 a game 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.989
 online or solo so here I have the 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.280
 questions share a little bit 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.989
 because I heard about one 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.340
 line that it would be that online and that 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.810
 it's a good thing for a game like 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.389
 that because I do not see too much played 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.199
 just solo game like that it's more one 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:49.810
 will say to play with friends and so on 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:50.919
 finally here and I heard also 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.290
 that they would have a solo mode 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.000
 no co-op mode and that's so it's 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.879
 really shared I 'm also yours 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.959
 to say that all I'm saying to you and 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.379
 reliable sources 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:05.319
 it comes either from official website or from 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.750
 official forums of jeuxvideo.com 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.190
 so 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.480
 here after you will search for you 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.780
 even you will see that what I tell you 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.739
 it's not a pipe, so here is 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.660
 so we can see some of the 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.040
 of the map that we could see the moment 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.329
 momentum power a survivor who's who 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.070
 arrive and the pigeon but who runs 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.730
 after who gets hit by a machete 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.090
 in the face 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:31.920
 so the how to say the fights are 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.020
 really pretty dynamic enough and enough 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.330
 well represented so for for this game 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.090
 so then we'll go on the part 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.350
 survival camp so a part that I 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.930
 think there was no game in 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.290
 survival is the creation of a camp 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.419
 survival 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.250
 I think we can create 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.110
 alliances with several survivors and 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.820
 cetera I do not know yet if we can 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.200
 place between us survivors like 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.540
 the other survival games that was 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.340
 available on pc but I know everything 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.220
 case we can create a camp so you 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.150
 see this in this video 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.800
 have seen that she is in the process of 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.480
 choose garden fabric etc 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.450
 and this is where you can see that 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.820
 can make a garden plant our vegetables 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.760
 to have our resources almost we will 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.800
 to say constantly and that's really 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.020
 really a big highlight for for 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.580
 the survival aspect so create finally not 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.460
 create planted ourselves our food and 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.919
 this is where we can see that the camp is 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.810
 fortified by stone walls and has 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.910
 so a kind of small base where we can 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.280
 store our guns and so there's a 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.140
 little house so I hope this 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.190
 video will please you and if you wait 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.020
 the game as much as me 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.490
 do not hesitate to put a little I like 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.600
 it really makes me extremely happy 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.440
 to be commenting on the video 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.440
 go ciao people
