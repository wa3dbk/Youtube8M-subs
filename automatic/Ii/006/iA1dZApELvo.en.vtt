My crafting ideas (May contain traces of old ideas and nuts)

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.720
Episode 5

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:20.940
Parachute:
The parachute will slow down your fall
after holding it and right-clicking.
It would have a durability of about a minute of use.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:31.180
Colored Parachute:
Pretty self-explanatory.
As with armor it can be dyed with any combination of colors.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:45.920
Fish and Chips - Just for an idea for the already expanding possibilities within the food-crafting!

00:00:47.980 --> 00:01:01.020
Clear Glass - A second trip in the furnace could get rid of the annoying scratches in the original glass!

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.660
Colored Redtsone - This would really help the hardcore redstone users! Like the real life wiring

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:15.860
this would make keeping track of your redstone wires a lot easier!

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:31.240
Fried Egg - Why is this not in the game already?

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:46.700
Armor Stand - Used to display your favorite armor! Simply right-click it while holding the items you want displayed!

00:01:48.040 --> 00:02:00.640
Colored Armor - Why is it only leather thatÂ´s dye-able? Make it posible to dye all the other types of armor!

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:16.220
Redstone Clock - Will repeatedly send out a redstone signal with your desired delay!

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:26.260
Candy Apple - Another delicious food option!

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:42.400
Double Piston - Instead of using iron in the middle, use gold! This one will push blocks 2 spaces instead of 1.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:57.400
