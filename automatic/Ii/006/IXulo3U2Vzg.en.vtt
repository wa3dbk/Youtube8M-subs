 3 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.279
 at this time television is also redefining because the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.150
 people now seek to have more control over the contents 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.780
 it is about that they are 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.270
 you want to see what you want when you have what you want 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.789
 on the internet you do not have 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.470
 but also apart from the video we are integrating the official as well as 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.690

 video conference where October after me 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.350
 on a large screen with a very good definition to the person with whom 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.260

 of his in his living room of his house 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.789
 more content than before this system will be restricted then the 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.830
 creators of content even national chi minh that I think to get on this 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.030
 platform before I had no access which could be a German channel 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.280
 he occupied a channel of brazilian cook australian analyst with most wanted marisol 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.619
 valleys the percent series and the b series that are already known to impose 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.300
 but from the next series 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.410
 p well to see above we have all the functions in it the healthy screens 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.250
 mmmm this 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.260
 in the whole series 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.990
 what I want to tell you is not because it's a basic series we're taking away 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.520
 certain margins 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.720
 from the basic series to be and more complete we have all the same 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.790
 officials about lantern then I think that this day the people that the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.770
 bet is for an alternation that from now on because 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.850
 has more content regardless of the technology that we choose 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.630
 we recommend astra 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.270
 this in the documentary genre of increasing content 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.530
 i is that they are in the experience 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.830
 p for these actions 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.200
 something of the past 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.300
 very much alive on local television 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.410
 it is already a connected device 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.389
 cut internet which think enough to sam constantly 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.409
 things it's important to let people know that TV is Finnish 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.639
 While you are connected to the internet, you only need to receive it. 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:20.859
 opportunities to improve the life of broadcasting channels olive groves 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.469

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.749
 we are going to improve the drowsiness of the television then the players 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.040

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.619
 this trend was faster in the case of 2009 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:40.639
 and we hope that the television losada in the next 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.409
