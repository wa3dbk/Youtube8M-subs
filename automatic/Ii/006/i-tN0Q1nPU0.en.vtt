 bacterial plaque right where they join the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.590

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.380
 bacteria that are pathogenic to the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.300
 organism breaks the balance between 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.790
 good bacteria and bacteria 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.850
 bad then taking yogurt what 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.460
 we do is reconstitute that flora and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.660
 we turn it into a better flora 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.660
 to the body outside 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.840
 the question we have here below 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.950
 Mr. Director, let's see 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.880
 the yogurt strengthens them and thus we avoid 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.880
 how hot are we split between 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.880
 we 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.580
 that 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.150
 is what you have I do not think so 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.150
 let's see it 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.780
 Here is what is going on, Mr. Director, who 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.000
 we show it on the screen for a little while 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.260
 strengthens the bones 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.620
 friend 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:20.360
 yogurt because of its high calcium content 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.760
 its high content in this in proteins 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.379
 its high content in the act-ferrina 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.959
 which is a substance that helps to avoid 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:32.480
 osteoporosis look at you is a bone 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.650
 with osteoporosis has lost mass 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.959
 muscular 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.940
 instead consuming yogurt consuming 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.400
 calcium what we do is prevent this 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.200
 bone wear where we have a bone 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.299
 much more compact 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.579

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.579
 inexhaustible source of calcium according 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.900

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.270

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.120

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.470

 amount of fiber say yes no 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.310
 It would be delicious to eat a little bit of 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.819
 Natural yogurt with short pineapple 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.500
