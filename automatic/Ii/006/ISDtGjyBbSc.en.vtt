00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.030
 Hi, people are going to be there for you one today. 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.040
 overalls I saw in the nerd program 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.049
 But I gave her a personal touch and she 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.830
 super tasty and very practical let's go 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:25.340
 believe and 200 grams of salami a 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.760
 cup of cooked white bean tea 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.940
 a can of peeled tomato a cup of 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.469
 macaroni tea the father our a spoon 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.510
 of honey and basil August to 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.760
 this recipe I'm going to use this pasta 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.960
 who is our father and is number two is the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.430
 soup noodles 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.649
 but if you do not find it you can 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.000
 buy any other small 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.399
 soup that works 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.379
 Come on while noodles are 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.390
 cooking I'll fry the salami if 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.120
 Do not you have salami you can use? 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.350
 also calabresa or ham I think 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.730
 also works 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.890
 I'll quote a little but I do not like it. 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.380
 feitinho be fine I'll add here 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.570
 the peeled tomato 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.060
 if you want you can also use the sauce 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.549
 tomatoes are you do not want to use the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.890
 peeled tomato add a 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.930
 a little basil every year. 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.390
 treated but you can use the cool 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.770
 little pepper 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.049
 I'm going to add a little bit of 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.390
 Salt but be careful because I just slept 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.979
 already has salt and noodles water 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.040
 people will use to dilute a little 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.240
 wet also have now I'll leave until 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.159
 boil're cooking up 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.650
 boil now I'm going to add a 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.479
 a little bit of honey to be able to 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.790
 acidity of tomato but if you do not have 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.729
 honey can use sugar, too 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.740
 It works here to add a bit of 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.110
 water that I separated from cooking 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.840
 pasta to make a decrease 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.689
 On this wall, I'm going to wait for a boil. 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.369
 again to finish the process 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.630
 the eye is ready, I 'll add 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.549
 a noodles forget to take it one 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.520
 A little before he gets al dente tÃ¡ 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.149
 not to get too soft and the beans 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.739
 White 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.020
 I know it's strange but I guarantee 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.020
 It will be good now, just mix it up. 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.530
 this pasta he has a good eye 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.780
 simple but if you want a sauce more 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.610
 shortened pasta type you can 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.280
 add tomato sauce together with the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.280
 peeled tomato and now only serve 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.610
 the recipe is simple but it is very delicious 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:50.620
 blends very well with white beans with 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:51.550
 the salami and the macaroni but want 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.870
 to know 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.990
 the recipe is great to eat in front of 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.990

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:17.950
