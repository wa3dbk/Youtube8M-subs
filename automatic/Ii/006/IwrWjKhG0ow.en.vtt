00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
is OD kV now this password is probably

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.950 
is OD kV now this password is probably
going<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.820> change<00:02:12.850> by<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.360> time<00:02:13.600> of<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.810> video

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
going to change by the time of the video

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.150 
going to change by the time of the video
so<00:02:14.230> you're<00:02:14.350> gonna<00:02:14.470> have<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.620> go<00:02:14.770> back<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
so you're gonna have to go back to the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.620 
so you're gonna have to go back to the
website<00:02:15.340> because<00:02:15.760> they<00:02:15.910> change<00:02:16.390> their

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
website because they change their

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.180 
website because they change their
password<00:02:16.990> periodically<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:19.890> guess<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.040> use

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
password periodically and I guess I use

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.160 
password periodically and I guess I use
my<00:02:21.400> limit<00:02:21.700> today<00:02:22.410> anyways<00:02:23.820> once<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:25.120> log<00:02:25.930> on

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.880 
play the story mode right now it's
really<00:04:15.760> interesting<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:17.380> graphics<00:04:17.770> are

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
really interesting the graphics are

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.460

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
pretty good it's a lot different from

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.140 
pretty good it's a lot different from
the<00:04:20.620> previous<00:04:20.800> Call<00:04:21.130> of<00:04:21.160> Duty's<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.820> the

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
storyline is very interesting so for

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.640 
storyline is very interesting so for
those<00:04:25.390> who<00:04:25.450> don't<00:04:25.600> have<00:04:25.900> call<00:04:26.170> duty<00:04:26.440> advanced
