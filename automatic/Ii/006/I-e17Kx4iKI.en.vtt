00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.990 

I'm<00:00:27.050> gonna<00:00:27.259> paint<00:00:27.470> this<00:00:27.650> molding<00:00:28.189> and<00:00:28.369> the

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
I'm gonna paint this molding and the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.320 
I'm gonna paint this molding and the
light<00:00:29.210> is<00:00:29.390> coming<00:00:29.630> from<00:00:29.839> the<00:00:30.589> upper-left<00:00:31.330> so

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
light is coming from the upper-left so

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.910 
light is coming from the upper-left so
I've<00:00:32.450> done<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:32.750> light<00:00:32.990> sides<00:00:33.320> and<00:00:33.740> now<00:00:33.830> I'm

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
I've done the light sides and now I'm

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.980 
I've done the light sides and now I'm
going<00:00:34.070> to<00:00:34.220> do<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.490> shadow<00:00:34.760> sides<00:00:35.150> it's<00:00:35.780> going

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
going to do the shadow sides it's going

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.510 
going to do the shadow sides it's going
to<00:00:36.080> be<00:00:36.200> exactly<00:00:36.650> the<00:00:36.830> opposite

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
to be exactly the opposite

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.610 
to be exactly the opposite
so<00:00:38.480> where<00:00:38.660> white<00:00:38.840> is<00:00:38.870> it<00:00:39.200> will<00:00:39.320> now<00:00:39.440> be

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
so where white is it will now be

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.860 
so where white is it will now be
shadowed<00:00:40.040> on<00:00:40.130> that<00:00:40.280> side<00:00:40.520> and<00:00:40.730> where<00:00:40.850> dark<00:00:41.660> is

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
shadowed on that side and where dark is

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.180 
shadowed on that side and where dark is
where<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.230> shadow<00:00:42.410> is<00:00:42.530> it<00:00:42.770> will<00:00:42.860> now<00:00:43.010> be<00:00:43.160> the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
where the shadow is it will now be the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.490 
where the shadow is it will now be the
highlight<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.720> shadow<00:00:44.960> side<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:45.440> the

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
highlight so the shadow side and the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.760 
highlight so the shadow side and the
light<00:00:45.650> side<00:00:45.680> are<00:00:46.180> always<00:00:47.180> opposite<00:00:47.870> if<00:00:48.620> you

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
light side are always opposite if you

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.080 
light side are always opposite if you
took<00:00:48.950> a<00:00:49.010> cross-section<00:00:49.700> it<00:00:49.790> would<00:00:49.910> look<00:00:50.030> like

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
took a cross-section it would look like

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.300 
took a cross-section it would look like
this<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:50.960> this<00:00:51.140> is<00:00:51.290> representing<00:00:51.920> a<00:00:52.010> curve

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
this so this is representing a curve

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.450 
this so this is representing a curve
this<00:00:52.940> is<00:00:53.150> a<00:00:53.180> soft<00:00:53.510> curve<00:00:54.010> coming<00:00:55.010> down<00:00:55.280> like

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
this is a soft curve coming down like

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.790 
this is a soft curve coming down like
this<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:55.910> then<00:00:56.510> it's<00:00:56.690> bordered<00:00:57.380> by<00:00:57.410> another

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
this and then it's bordered by another

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.790 
this and then it's bordered by another
half<00:00:58.670> circle<00:00:59.150> when<00:01:00.080> you're<00:01:00.230> painting<00:01:00.470> this

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
half circle when you're painting this

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.830 
half circle when you're painting this
it's<00:01:01.280> best<00:01:01.580> to<00:01:01.670> just<00:01:01.730> paint<00:01:02.060> all<00:01:02.210> your<00:01:02.390> shadows

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
it's best to just paint all your shadows

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.329 
it's best to just paint all your shadows
let<00:01:03.080> it<00:01:03.200> dry<00:01:03.380> then<00:01:03.410> paint<00:01:03.890> your<00:01:03.920> highlights

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
let it dry then paint your highlights

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.029 
let it dry then paint your highlights

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:11.230 
you don't want to mix the black and the

edge and this straight edge is lifted

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.090 
edge and this straight edge is lifted
off<00:01:26.359> of<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.630> paper<00:01:26.840> with<00:01:27.229> screws<00:01:27.649> these<00:01:27.950> are

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
off of the paper with screws these are

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.969 
off of the paper with screws these are
things<00:01:28.640> we<00:01:28.789> made<00:01:28.969> in<00:01:29.119> class<00:01:29.710> with<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.740> piece<00:01:30.950> of

things we made in class with a piece of

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.870 
things we made in class with a piece of
foam<00:01:32.499> Plexiglas<00:01:33.499> and<00:01:33.859> some<00:01:34.310> screws<00:01:34.640> in<00:01:34.819> a

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
foam Plexiglas and some screws in a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.920 
foam Plexiglas and some screws in a
little<00:01:35.119> handle

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
little handle

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.520 
little handle
and<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.710> weight<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.340> brush<00:01:38.580> will<00:01:38.940> be<00:01:42.530> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and the weight of the brush will be the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.180 
and the weight of the brush will be the
pressure<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:44.010> put<00:01:44.070> down<00:01:44.720> when<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.870> pull<00:01:46.110> your

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
pressure I put down when you pull your

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.250 
pressure I put down when you pull your
your<00:01:47.190> brushstroke<00:01:47.760> you<00:01:48.690> start<00:01:48.960> off<00:01:49.050> with<00:01:49.230> a

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
your brushstroke you start off with a

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.780 
your brushstroke you start off with a
hem<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.530> your<00:01:49.590> line<00:01:49.830> and<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.220> your<00:01:50.370> paint<00:01:50.580> goes

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
hem of your line and as your paint goes

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.180 
hem of your line and as your paint goes
away<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:52.320> end<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:52.590> making<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.950> thinner

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
away you you end up making a thinner

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.980 
away you you end up making a thinner
line<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.790> you've<00:01:53.910> got<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.360> able<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.660> check

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
line so you've got to be able to check

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:04.790 
line so you've got to be able to check
the<00:01:55.230> the<00:01:56.190> line<00:01:56.460> weight<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.080> Weig<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
the the line weight and you can Weig the

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.460 
the the line weight and you can Weig the
corner<00:02:06.890> now<00:02:07.890> I'll<00:02:08.100> do<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> little<00:02:09.000> bit<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.179> a

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
corner now I'll do a little bit of a

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.449 
corner now I'll do a little bit of a
lighter<00:02:10.470> black<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.260> do<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.620> I'll<00:02:13.860> put

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.360 

its<00:02:17.459> pops<00:02:17.640> lip<00:02:17.910> glaze

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
its pops lip glaze

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.860 
its pops lip glaze
it's<00:02:20.370> putting<00:02:20.850> down<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> clear<00:02:21.570> medium<00:02:23.870> before

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
it's putting down a clear medium before

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.410 
it's putting down a clear medium before
you<00:02:24.959> put<00:02:25.170> down<00:02:25.290> your<00:02:25.440> pants<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.420> your

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
you put down your pants so that you your

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.560 
you put down your pants so that you your
edge<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.990> paint<00:02:28.290> doesn't<00:02:28.530> dry<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.400> hug

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.360 

so<00:02:33.570> now<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.900> meets<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.320> glaze<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.070> make<00:02:35.220> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
so now it meets the glaze in to make the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.600 
so now it meets the glaze in to make the
the<00:02:36.209> lighter<00:02:36.450> shadow

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:50.400 

the<00:02:43.120> line<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.330> did<00:02:43.600> first<00:02:43.840> was<00:02:44.140> rather<00:02:44.860> black<00:02:49.410> so

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
the line I did first was rather black so

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.199 
the line I did first was rather black so
this<00:02:50.590> has<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:50.950> soft<00:02:51.220> shadow

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.940 

can<00:02:56.209> we<00:02:56.300> go<00:02:56.420> over<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.750> several<00:02:57.140> times<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:57.830> we

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
can we go over to several times so we

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.610 
can we go over to several times so we
can<00:02:58.220> even<00:02:58.750> paint<00:02:59.750> up<00:02:59.959> okay

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
can even paint up okay

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.110 
can even paint up okay
you<00:03:00.830> see<00:03:01.040> it's<00:03:01.160> blending<00:03:01.640> but<00:03:01.819> there's<00:03:02.030> a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
you see it's blending but there's a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.210 
you see it's blending but there's a
darker<00:03:02.540> edge<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.020> got<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.290> make<00:03:03.349> that<00:03:03.500> soft<00:03:03.860> I

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
darker edge so I got to make that soft I

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.370 
darker edge so I got to make that soft I
can<00:03:04.910> actually<00:03:05.360> do<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.630> two<00:03:05.900> ways<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:07.209> could

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
can actually do that two ways I could

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:17.949 
can actually do that two ways I could
just<00:03:09.380> soften<00:03:11.290> but<00:03:12.290> I<00:03:12.319> could<00:03:12.530> wipe<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.890> away<00:03:16.959> so

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
just soften but I could wipe it away so

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.870 
just soften but I could wipe it away so
now<00:03:18.110> I<00:03:18.140> will<00:03:18.380> make<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.709> highlight<00:03:19.580> of<00:03:19.730> the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
now I will make the highlight of the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:34.760 
now I will make the highlight of the
half<00:03:20.209> round

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.950 

so<00:03:35.400> than<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:35.790> off<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.210> I<00:03:36.300> cannot<00:03:36.660> let<00:03:36.840> it

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
so than that off and I cannot let it

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.810 
so than that off and I cannot let it
touch<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.200> black<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.040> get<00:03:38.310> great<00:03:38.640> it

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
touch the black that I get great it

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.430 
touch the black that I get great it
becomes<00:03:39.090> okay<00:03:39.450> if<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.690> has<00:03:39.990> nothing<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.260> do

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
becomes okay if that has nothing to do

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.440 
becomes okay if that has nothing to do
with<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.620> length<00:03:40.800> of<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.010> door<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.210> takes

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
with the length of the door so it takes

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.010 
with the length of the door so it takes
some<00:03:42.600> glaze<00:03:43.580> my<00:03:44.580> used<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:45.000> glaze<00:03:45.390> like<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.660> color
