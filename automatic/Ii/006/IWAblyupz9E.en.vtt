00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
permanent root um they're both pretty

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.300 
permanent root um they're both pretty
much<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.299> same<00:02:38.480> because<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.870> can<00:02:39.310> unmoved

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
much the same because you can unmoved

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.530 
much the same because you can unmoved
remove<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.180> root<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:43.060> what<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.209> pretty<00:02:44.480> much

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
remove the root and what you pretty much

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.900 
remove the root and what you pretty much
have<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.750> do<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.170> just<00:02:45.349> click<00:02:45.670> temporary<00:02:46.670> or

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
have to do is just click temporary or

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.580 
have to do is just click temporary or
permanent<00:02:47.269> root<00:02:47.389> i<00:02:47.569> recommend<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.109> permanent

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
permanent root i recommend the permanent

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.400 
permanent root i recommend the permanent
because<00:02:48.709> it's<00:02:49.340> more<00:02:49.760> stable<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.510> probably<00:02:51.319> is

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
because it's more stable and probably is

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.170 
because it's more stable and probably is
better<00:02:51.620> i<00:02:51.889> haven't<00:02:52.340> tried<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.549> temporary<00:02:53.000> yet

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
better i haven't tried to temporary yet

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.930 
better i haven't tried to temporary yet
but<00:02:53.480> they're<00:02:53.690> probably<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.019> same<00:02:54.639> so<00:02:55.639> just

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
but they're probably the same so just

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.990 
but they're probably the same so just
click<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.829> permanent<00:02:57.829> or<00:02:58.010> temporary<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.819> then

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
click a permanent or temporary and then

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.699 
click a permanent or temporary and then
