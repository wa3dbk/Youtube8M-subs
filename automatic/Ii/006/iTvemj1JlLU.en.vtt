00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.390 

now<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.199> am<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.710> do<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.099> am<00:00:29.310> going

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
now what I am going to do is I am going

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.569 
now what I am going to do is I am going
to<00:00:29.880> place<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.509> spear<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:32.780> this<00:00:33.780> position<00:00:34.020> and

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.729 

adjust<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> spare<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.989> top<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
adjust the spare on the top of the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:48.290 
adjust the spare on the top of the
cylinder<00:00:46.159> now<00:00:47.159> what<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.400> am<00:00:47.519> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.970> do<00:00:48.089> is<00:00:48.269> I

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
cylinder now what I am going to do is I

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.619 
cylinder now what I am going to do is I
am<00:00:48.480> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:49.050> introduce<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.920> plane<00:00:52.400> at<00:00:53.629> this

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
am going to introduce a plane at this

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.539 
am going to introduce a plane at this
position<00:00:59.900> let's<00:01:00.900> increase<00:01:01.409> the<00:01:01.710> segment<00:01:02.220> of

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:02.549 
position let's increase the segment of

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.980 
position let's increase the segment of
width<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.689> length<00:01:03.839> to<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> 15<00:01:05.689> now<00:01:06.689> let's

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
width and length to the 15 now let's

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.870 
width and length to the 15 now let's
move<00:01:07.320> towards<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.979> flag<00:01:08.220> animation<00:01:09.229> step<00:01:10.229> 2

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
move towards the flag animation step 2

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.580 
move towards the flag animation step 2
so<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.180> are<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.869> choose<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.320> plane

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
so now we are going to choose the plane

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.760 
so now we are going to choose the plane
go<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.369> modify<00:01:15.000> panel<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:16.320> are<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.560> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
go to modify panel and we are going to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.740 
go to modify panel and we are going to
apply<00:01:17.009> cloth<00:01:17.490> modifier<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> plane<00:01:23.750> select

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
apply cloth modifier to the plane select

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.450 
apply cloth modifier to the plane select
the<00:01:24.930> group<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.380> shin<00:01:25.650> under<00:01:25.920> cloth<00:01:26.189> modifier

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the group of shin under cloth modifier

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.499 
the group of shin under cloth modifier
and<00:01:27.470> let's<00:01:28.470> select<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.280> vertices<00:01:29.490> which<00:01:30.240> we

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and let's select the vertices which we

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.430 
and let's select the vertices which we
want<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.930> stick<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.409> cylinder<00:01:32.010> for<00:01:33.440> now

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
want to stick to the cylinder for now

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.330 
want to stick to the cylinder for now
click<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.950> make<00:01:35.190> group<00:01:35.400> button<00:01:35.580> over<00:01:35.940> here<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
click on make group button over here and

click ok then click on node button and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.010 
click ok then click on node button and
select<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:43.890> cylinder<00:01:44.690> this<00:01:45.690> will<00:01:45.900> allow

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
select the cylinder this will allow

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.940 
select the cylinder this will allow
selected<00:01:46.770> vertices<00:01:46.970> stick<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.270> cylinder

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
selected vertices stick to the cylinder

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.440 
selected vertices stick to the cylinder
step<00:01:49.950> 3<00:01:51.650> now<00:01:52.650> go<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> space<00:01:53.370> war<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.820> choose

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
step 3 now go to space war and choose

step 3 now go to space war and choose
wind<00:01:54.810> under<00:01:55.020> forces<00:01:56.990> now<00:01:57.990> let's<00:01:58.350> place<00:01:58.710> wind

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
wind under forces now let's place wind

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.700 
wind under forces now let's place wind
over<00:01:59.549> here<00:02:04.850> we<00:02:05.850> are<00:02:05.940> going<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.360> rotate<00:02:06.510> it<00:02:06.840> just

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
over here we are going to rotate it just

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:15.340 
over here we are going to rotate it just
to<00:02:08.069> set<00:02:08.519> the<00:02:08.580> direction<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.750> wind

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.500 

now<00:02:16.010> let's<00:02:16.310> introduce<00:02:16.640> gravity<00:02:17.860> over<00:02:18.860> here

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:31.290
