mean do not be alarmed depend on the
length<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.740> all<00:01:22.979> depends

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
length of get here but just all depends

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.429 
length of get here but just all depends
on<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> look<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.420> now<00:01:25.170> um

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
on what it's going to look like now um

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.910 
on what it's going to look like now um
this<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.700> my<00:01:26.880> hair<00:01:27.380> shade<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> shower

I think this is like three or four days

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.640 
I think this is like three or four days
work<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.799> shade<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.490> hair<00:01:33.229> which<00:01:34.229> could

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
work for a shade of hair which could

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.170 
work for a shade of hair which could
possibly<00:01:34.890> look<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.400> lot<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:35.850> my<00:01:35.939> hair<00:01:36.150> is

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
possibly look like a lot but my hair is

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.410 
possibly look like a lot but my hair is
long<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.220> could<00:01:38.220> look<00:01:38.369> weight<00:01:38.850> thicker<00:01:39.180> than

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
long so could look weight thicker than

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.240 
long so could look weight thicker than
what<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:39.930> easy<00:01:40.350> stuff<00:01:40.530> yeah

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
what it really easy stuff yeah

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.380

it's<00:01:53.610> called<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> true<00:01:54.149> about<00:01:54.509> shedding<00:01:54.869> and

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
it's called the true about shedding and

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.840 
it's called the true about shedding and
it<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.560> has<00:01:55.799> several<00:01:56.159> ways<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.670> reduce

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
it just has several ways to reduce

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.940 
it just has several ways to reduce
shedding<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.780> any<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.350> ladies<00:01:58.770> are

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
shedding and any you ladies are

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.910 
shedding and any you ladies are
interested<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.700> now<00:02:00.600> all<00:02:01.200> those<00:02:01.560> other

to<00:02:05.790> be<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> lot<00:02:06.240> shorter<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:07.170> then<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.469> can

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
to be a lot shorter but then you can

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.100 
to be a lot shorter but then you can
also<00:02:07.799> get<00:02:08.220> very<00:02:08.509> long<00:02:09.509> strands

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
but don't try to do it excessively

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.670 
but don't try to do it excessively
especially<00:04:36.060> if<00:04:36.210> your<00:04:36.390> cut<00:04:37.020> your<00:04:37.200> ends<00:04:37.410> is<00:04:37.650> the

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
especially if your cut your ends is the

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.280 
especially if your cut your ends is the
oldest<00:04:38.220> part<00:04:38.400> of<00:04:38.520> your<00:04:38.670> hair<00:04:38.910> so<00:04:39.750> they<00:04:40.110> are

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
oldest part of your hair so they are

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.740 
oldest part of your hair so they are
most<00:04:40.530> likely<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.950> become<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.670> most<00:04:42.090> brittle

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
most likely to become the most brittle

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.870 
most likely to become the most brittle
or<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.440> most<00:04:43.620> drive<00:04:44.010> which<00:04:44.370> can<00:04:44.580> also<00:04:44.730> cause

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
or the most drive which can also cause

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.770 
or the most drive which can also cause
breakage<00:04:46.010> so<00:04:47.010> there<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:47.670> have<00:04:47.700> it<00:04:48.060> that's<00:04:48.510> the

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
breakage so there you have it that's the

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.470 
breakage so there you have it that's the
difference<00:04:49.140> between<00:04:49.170> shedding<00:04:50.160> in<00:04:50.520> breakage

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
difference between shedding in breakage

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.100 
difference between shedding in breakage
if<00:04:52.050> you're<00:04:52.260> interested<00:04:52.890> in<00:04:53.570> finding<00:04:54.570> out<00:04:54.870> if
