00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.829

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.639
 now that holland brazil 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.639
 I want to present 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.650
 the sectional video-classroom 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.760
 of 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.259
 crystal that 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.829
 pfeiffer that program that agent finds very easily in the 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:24.929
 Internet 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.179
 dear facial movements 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.289
 from animation to still images 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.080
 very well 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.440
 As we found it tutorial 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.890
 in English 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.190
 Let's now move on to you first hand. 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.790
 a tutorial 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.810
 perfect and portuguese 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.890
 in dohuk rest that fails 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.890
 Let's see he leaves the shelter. 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.450
 Let's put it into action successfully. 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.320
 just as it does 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.240
 feicipa because animation studios 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.640
 really 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.400
 this program of the real and on the ground and 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.399
 magnificent 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.900
 it's a little bit heavy 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.900
 but it was possible to work reminding you that 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.290
 it is extremely necessary to note that your internet collection can not 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.940
 be 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.030
 otherwise active 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.840
 it will not work 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.180
 the right program 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.730
 so here I do not know that it's easy to grow we take it very slowly step-by-step 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.660
 If he gave class, it's great, we cut two pieces, but let's go. 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.820
 the first step 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.900
 you have to import an image so you will is choosing the option 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.900
 modric 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.570
 open corruption model 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.520
 we have some options here 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.830
 next to 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.830
 that left in the upper left corner has a little taste 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.040
 there you see home 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.370
 month amount 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.370
 otherwise cricket this looks for pictures you want 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.220
 we will use an aquidauana callinan image of 'big brother' 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.760
 here we have with the image let's import 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.230
 we already have the image the first screen I am today 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.669
 is image processing 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:17.529
 here you lose all the angles you can approach 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:19.569
 you can distance 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.739
 you can move 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.430
 You can frame without end so you click who in this 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.499
 will process the freamunde of the march to these four points 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.749
 points 1 2 3 and 4 and a model appears that on the right side in the upper corner 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.489
 of the second leg 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.939
 so you are what you do not for you to have a better view 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.400
 And you? 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.929
 rola badiola people 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:52.199
 the next but if necessary because those points that lies exactly in the 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.469
 corner in the mouth 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:54.779
 right 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.499
 in the corner of the mouth 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:59.569
 the 4 in the left corner of the right mouth 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.059
 stayed 2 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.849
 in the right corner of the right eye 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.779
 in the right corner of the right 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:09.569
 and so on in fourth 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.669
 done that you have picture block 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.229
 click next 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:16.429
 who here 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.909
 1 prof face style area 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.959
 with the complex the human 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.299
 in the heroin to the smelly nowotny marquinho in which is machine type 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.579
 to leave the show that mix of both we will run a news click here the 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.979
 what 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.979
 if you notice we already have a small movement 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.869
 but it is not complete yet 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:44.109
 click and stop 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.909
 Let's now click here. 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.929
 it is not only the third option 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:51.299
 I lay down 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.879
 a detail that made real if the mountain is out there 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.090
 there you click 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.639
 all these points appear 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.040
 how much longer you 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.040
 It's easier for you to have someone to work 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.349
 I knew him 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.479
 so let's get close together 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.839
 remembering that mega sena if you want a more intense movement you have 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:14.319
 that suspending it enough we will reach enough 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.659
 the eyebrow 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:16.939
 our 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:18.569
 topping motel 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:20.669
 say so 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.300
 very well 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.069
 it can be seen that the eyes are not well framed by what God 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:26.870
 making 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.479
 returned to them 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.139
 to the right position perfectly framing an eye 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.720
 so it is not leaked or different 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.620
 world the white eye is already all broken this year 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.009
 of points 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.819
 right 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:43.999
 OK, let's go 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.900
 with a serve once more pulled the burn we will pull this 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.460
 let's pull closes too profile that is complicated 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.419
 there get there 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.419
 very well let's fit in one eye 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.270
 the files come back here 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.649
 Let's meet again and more to deal with the right mouth and nose. 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:09.169
 Let's get scared here. 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.779
 what 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:13.879
 the question of the bial boundary is fundamental 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.249
 competition 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.249
 so let's work hidden in the well-worked ameal 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:20.939
 so that it will not be subject too much 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:22.960
 not even a little 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.759
 the midfield line 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.919
 there the bial has to be well centered right 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:31.809
 so that the lip has three floors 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:33.759
 here it is 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.129
 the more you suffer the more with more block moves too 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.219
 right 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:43.199
 now it's time to try to grab yet by if you want it to move 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.330
 Another thing you must expand hair 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.069
 this square 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:52.819
 in every area that you want moves we enter into the court that is one more 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:56.020
 little hair that I moved a little not only the face but also the hair 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.089
 bomb runner 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:59.900
 like this 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.259
 normally 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.729
 usually smaller 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:07.650
 we do not use 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.809
 We used the year just the little face. 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:14.649
 the classes of structural biology and filipe that deals with its construction 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:16.550
 discovered 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.830
 that so you will not be put us well beyond 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.919
 of the phase 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.479
 How did you fish for soil? 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.479
 is one of the strong ones that how 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:29.529
 I put the sesdec the most perfect
