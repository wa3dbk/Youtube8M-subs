 circus history 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.020
 it is practically impossible to determine a specific date 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.860
 when or how circus practices began 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.449
 but you can bet it started in china 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.150
 where paintings of 5 thousand years were found 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.369
 with figures of acrobatas contorcionistas balanceistas 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.269
 these movements were part of the training exercises 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.289
 two warriors 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.170
 and gradually to these movements were added the recording and harmony 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.350
 is counted still here in the year felt 8 before Christ 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.750
 A huge celebration took place to welcome the 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.600
 foreign arrivals at the party 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.760
 there were real demonstrations of acrobatics 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.300
 from then on 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.250
 the emperor and ordered that it always take place in events of this order 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.600
 once a year at least 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.530
 around the year 70 before Christ came the massimo circus of rome 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.259
 either a fire totally destroyed 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.460
 causing great commotion 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.299
 years later in a year 40 before Christ 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.909
 They built the same place in the coliseum. 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.909
 with capacity for 87 thousand people 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.590
 in place were presentations of fire shrinkers 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.930
 plagiarists 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.900
 and exotic species of animals 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.929
 with only 600 followers of Christ 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:39.249
 between the 50's and almost 68's after Christ these places became 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:41.950
 used for strength demonstrations 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.289
 the Christians they 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.579
 were taken to the lions to be devoured before the public 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.770
 the saints then sought 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.710
 the injured squares 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.679
 or gray entries already to introduce people 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.230
 your juggling image 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.700
 still in 18th century europe groups of saltimbanco exhibited in france spain 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.010
 England showing their skills in combat simulations and 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.219
 horsemanship 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:17.329
 The structure of the circus as we know it today had its origin in London in the 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:24.329
 england inaugurated in 1770 do not get run over English official cavalry 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.979
 british filipe sá astoni 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.969
 the amphitheater had an arena 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:34.779
 with a nearby grandstand and if the main attraction is a spectacle 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.459
 with horses 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.859
 official noticed however 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.639
 that plunges that attraction of military 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.439
 did not hold the audience 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:47.779
 and began to increase it with mountaineers and clowns 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:51.759
 the clown of the place was a soldier 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:56.579
 whoever came in on the contrary made a thousand mistakes 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.390
 the success was both 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.119
 who adapted to the new situation 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:05.010
 it is the own official astley who present the show 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.249
 hence the figure of the master of ceremony 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:10.130
 success was size 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.800
 that 50 years later the English site was limited not only in the rest of the continent 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.110
 European 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.409
 but across the Atlantic 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:25.439
 and the circus history spread throughout the four corners of the planet in Brazil. 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.359
 is very much linked to the trajectory of the gypsies in our land since in the 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.239
 18th century europe they were persecuted 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.239
 here walking from city to city more at ease

 with the horses 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.769
 and his illusionistic talent 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.160
 but the circus 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.300
 with their characteristics these immigrants appeared in Brazil at the end of the 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.019
 19th century 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.409

 Brazilian clown in turn 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:19.419
 acquired its own characteristics unlike the European that communicated 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.799
 more for mimicry 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.760
 The Brazilian was a speaker.
