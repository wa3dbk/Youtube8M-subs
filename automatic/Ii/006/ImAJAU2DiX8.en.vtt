00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
heavier multi-species boats as I call

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.370 
heavier multi-species boats as I call
them<00:00:25.849> you<00:00:26.849> need<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.180> have<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.390> good<00:00:27.720> hole<00:00:28.019> shot

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
them you need to have a good hole shot

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.339 
them you need to have a good hole shot
plus<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.980> need<00:00:29.390> mid-range<00:00:30.390> performance<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
plus you need mid-range performance and

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.440 
plus you need mid-range performance and
it's<00:00:31.529> not<00:00:31.679> always<00:00:32.040> about<00:00:32.369> flat-out<00:00:32.880> speed

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
it's not always about flat-out speed

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.690 
it's not always about flat-out speed
when<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.780> comes<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.170> walleye<00:00:34.350> fishing<00:00:34.800> because

when it comes to walleye fishing because

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.540 
when it comes to walleye fishing because
I<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.300> take<00:00:36.480> into<00:00:36.690> consideration

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550

get the boat up out of the hole fast up
on<00:01:14.820> plane<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.930> four<00:01:16.200> blades<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> design

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
on plane the four blades and the design

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.390 
on plane the four blades and the design
of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> prop<00:01:18.000> allows<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.470> grab<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.159> bite

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
of the prop allows you to grab and bite

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.910 
of the prop allows you to grab and bite
more<00:01:20.729> water<00:01:21.060> which<00:01:21.720> gets<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.590> plane

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
more water which gets you up on plane

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.969 
more water which gets you up on plane
faster<00:01:23.960> consequently<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.080> better<00:01:25.350> haul<00:01:25.650> shot

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
faster consequently a better haul shot

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.100 
faster consequently a better haul shot
the<00:01:26.640> other<00:01:26.790> thing<00:01:27.090> when<00:01:27.270> I'm<00:01:27.390> running<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.900> big

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the other thing when I'm running in big

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.990 
the other thing when I'm running in big
heavy<00:01:28.380> water<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.979> want<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.369> be<00:01:29.460> able<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.729> hold

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
heavy water I want to be able to hold

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.230 
heavy water I want to be able to hold
that<00:01:30.150> hull<00:01:30.630> up<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.770> those<00:01:32.040> ways<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.729> by<00:01:32.970> having

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
that hull up on those ways and by having

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.990 
that hull up on those ways and by having
a<00:01:33.450> four<00:01:33.750> blade<00:01:34.049> what<00:01:34.950> occurs<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.640> when<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
a four blade what occurs is when the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.569 
a four blade what occurs is when the
props<00:01:36.270> turning<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.259> always<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.890> two<00:01:38.280> blades

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
props turning you always have two blades

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.179 
props turning you always have two blades
in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> water<00:01:39.150> which<00:01:39.900> gives<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.350> bite<00:01:40.619> which

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
in the water which gives it bite which

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.120 
in the water which gives it bite which
gives<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.759> boat<00:01:41.939> lift<00:01:42.329> which<00:01:42.899> gives<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.590> better

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
gives the boat lift which gives a better

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.380 
gives the boat lift which gives a better
drier<00:01:45.049> ride<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.409> those<00:01:46.770> rough<00:01:47.070> seas<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:48.240> other

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
drier ride in those rough seas the other

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.539 
drier ride in those rough seas the other
thing<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.689> comes<00:01:49.049> into<00:01:49.229> consideration<00:01:49.549> with

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
thing that comes into consideration with

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.090 
thing that comes into consideration with
the<00:01:51.000> four<00:01:51.299> stroke<00:01:51.659> outboard<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.590> use<00:01:52.829> on

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the four stroke outboard that we use on

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.730 
the four stroke outboard that we use on
these<00:01:53.549> walleye<00:01:53.909> boats<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:55.259> ability<00:01:55.470> to

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
these walleye boats is the ability to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.459 
these walleye boats is the ability to
forward<00:01:56.189> roll<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.880> back<00:01:57.329> roll<00:01:57.689> through<00:01:58.350> the

forward roll and back roll through the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.380 
forward roll and back roll through the
use<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.619> smart<00:01:59.100> craft<00:01:59.399> gauges<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
use of smart craft gauges I have the

but<00:02:13.980> also<00:02:14.190> it's<00:02:14.550> more<00:02:14.790> efficient<00:02:15.270> when<00:02:15.390> I'm

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
but also it's more efficient when I'm

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.140 
but also it's more efficient when I'm
back<00:02:15.810> trolling<00:02:16.320> or<00:02:16.550> when<00:02:17.550> I'm<00:02:17.700> forward
