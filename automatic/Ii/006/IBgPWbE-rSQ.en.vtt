00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.480
 this prescription to hot rumors and wild speculation about one 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.419
 motion pictures 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.130
 but now it's finally time 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.280
 over 20 years after her successful tv debut comes the most popular 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.689
 Cartoon series of the world in the cinema the Simpsons 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.930
 In this special we show you the first excerpts of the long-awaited 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.000
 Canvas adventure 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.470
 In addition, we talk with pillion inventor Matt Groening about the 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.710
 incredible success of his yellow cardboard figures 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.340
 and we look at the German voices of Auerswald with this colorful 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.340
 Market activity synchronously work over the shoulder 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.270
 Hoffenheim dominated the game and it is 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.540
 Thank you for your visit because it is a great honor and it has always been that 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.219
 Talk about it someday 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:14.130
 Forest fires feature-length feature film 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.570
 and they really needed it to explain the series, so to speak 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.660
 Highlight to set up but the panic this show comes anyway no one 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.850
 I think it can take part of this system, every child certainly not the stock 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.960
 come on the market 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.710
 Those who have been in concrete for a long time as much smaller series are much faster in 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.740
 I'm glad that the movie is finally ready 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.880
 This risk is greatest worst we have around the clock at the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.060
 Simpsons works illegally there's just no time for a movie 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.149
 although the idea for it already exists 18 years today after 20 years and 400 years 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.270
 We then said that we finally let the movie do it 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.270
 another 20 years pass 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.810
 In April 1987, the Simpsons were for the first time as a short film in the 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.689
 sent to American Princeton Venture 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.069
 Two years later she went into production 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.349
 Their triumphal march through the whole world to the unrestrained until today 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.550
 Maybe I had already cost from the States what if 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.789
 a customer she got it from ours 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:24.809
 so he met in the first one 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:28.789
 but that is such an art of speech that is the bright light in Dusseldorf 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:37.369
 after another prospective the front page the 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.159
 pay more 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.020
 The superiority of the movie prevailed until the last great silence 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.119
 only a few details seeped through 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.499
 Therefore, no stone unturned the dubbing a few hot 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:52.759
 Escape information 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:55.269
 it's about my family 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.260
 Hirche 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.339
 against this in the one yellow-red 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.339
 three children and two grandchildren Bodhi Elliot Handler 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:03.809
 Peren 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.169
 Berlin RPO 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:06.689
 not every word 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.689
 it livens up 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.090
 this is what Prof 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.290
 Frankfurt's Alter Oper 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.269
 was overshadowed 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.269
 Namco Bandai for a taste 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.099
 Franconia 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.099
 an environmental disaster 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.349
 and the only ones who are away from her were called it 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:37.419
 colored and the side but it has already been with us life it is like 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.810
 in front of a family movie the TV series curious in any case 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:45.549
 even painting the movie against the wall will still be yours in the cinema 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.029
 Just have fun 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:50.029
 that illuminates the ominous on the horizon 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.149
 he does something he should not do the tuning 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:04.149
 nowadays it is necessary to have the takeover approved 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.439
 which seven seasons have seen 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.029
 and from that emerges 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:16.259
 Valencia / For natural disasters, what's going on is too early 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:20.799
 you have to do it now you are doing there 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.909
 Hamilton duped and apologized for being able to do it 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:25.420
 explained 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.340
 but I'm afraid it's been there for many years 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.349
 empty 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:32.819
 also took lightly why did through 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.969
 so was included in course also a few political and satirical elements 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.350
 he is completely in the tradition of the series play the show because the word of God 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.990
 lives in each of us and I want him to be al-assad sideways 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.819
 So let it be that way 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.110
 what's new 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.870
 our luck he had something to build 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.900
