00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.820
 hello I'm joan pujol hockey player 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.770
 grass of the nora division junior and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.350
 we will explain how to do a push in the 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.780
 Field hockey is very important to know 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.450
 that in this technical gesture you have to 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.760
 Take the stick with your hands separated and 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.800
 the position of the body is had 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.530
 what to do with a little flexion of 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.200
 legs and very important also know 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.390
 that the position of the shoulders marks the 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.040
 direction of the ball that is if I have 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.399
 the body with the men looking for 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.810
 there the ball will go in this direction to 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.090
 from there it is very important that 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:47.040
 Also know that the push can be done 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.870
 accompanying the ball that is me 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.230
 I have the ball of the right foot 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.200
 flex the legs as we said and 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.890
 the shoulders tell me the direction of the 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.100
 ball is to say there I throw the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.060
 ball accompanying the can also be 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.219
 do the push by chopping the ball is the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.490
 same body position simply 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.700
 the ball is not going in the right foot 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.750
 it may be just 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.780
 of the body and from here I bit the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.780
 ball 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.630
 another aspect to highlight to give 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.200
 force the ball while doing the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.390
 push is to accompany the arms with our 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.960
 body is not movements are 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.390
 doll but while doing the push 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.399
 our arms accompany the body to 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.399
 give strength to the ball 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.000
 on the bus we also highlight that the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.710
 ball has to hit with the shovel 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.280
 of the stick that is this final part 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.170
 wood and from here 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.170
 hit with the shovel 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.080
 and here the video I hope that I have 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.230
 liked and I encourage you to practice hockey 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.230
 grass
