00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
it's a handy thing to have I would think

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.990

the<00:01:03.000> knife<00:01:03.210> itself<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:04.350> believe<00:01:05.100> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
the knife itself I believe it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.370 
the knife itself I believe it's
stainless<00:01:05.909> steel<00:01:06.390> I'm<00:01:06.600> not<00:01:06.750> sure<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.170> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
stainless steel I'm not sure that it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.429 
stainless steel I'm not sure that it
doesn't<00:01:07.619> really<00:01:07.860> give<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:09.020> steel<00:01:10.020> quality

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
doesn't really give a steel quality

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.620 
doesn't really give a steel quality
level<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.040> doesn't<00:01:11.189> say<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:11.580> 440<00:01:12.540> or

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
level on it it doesn't say like 440 or

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.380 
level on it it doesn't say like 440 or
420<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.200> anything<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.640> but<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.939> was<00:01:15.270> just

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
420 or anything like that but I was just

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.969 
420 or anything like that but I was just
assuming<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:16.020> stainless<00:01:16.229> steel<00:01:16.530> then<00:01:16.740> I'm

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
assuming it's stainless steel then I'm

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.390 
assuming it's stainless steel then I'm
not<00:01:17.130> too<00:01:17.280> sure<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:18.470> yeah<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.619> got<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.250> great

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.010 
on to a large stick to use as a spear
okay<00:01:44.009> which<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:45.270> don't<00:01:45.540> think<00:01:45.659> everyone's

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
okay which I don't think everyone's

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.840 
okay which I don't think everyone's
going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.170> use<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.220> neat<00:01:47.430> feature

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
going to use but it is a neat feature

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.020 
going to use but it is a neat feature
nonetheless<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:49.290> well<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.790> believe

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
nonetheless as well so it is I believe

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.889 
nonetheless as well so it is I believe
half<00:01:51.329> serrated<00:01:51.600> there<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.659> from<00:01:54.659> what<00:01:54.750> I've

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
half serrated there and from what I've

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.719 
half serrated there and from what I've
seen<00:01:54.930> from<00:01:55.110> other<00:01:55.409> videos<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.369> soon<00:01:56.430> as<00:01:56.610> you

i believe you can attach this to a molle

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.500 
i believe you can attach this to a molle
