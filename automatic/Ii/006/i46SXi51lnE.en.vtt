can show you some of the things we've
done<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:12.450> application<00:01:13.380> was<00:01:13.560> entirely

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
done this application was entirely

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.359 
done this application was entirely
written<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.960> C++<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.229> qml<00:01:16.560> where<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.070> front

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
written in C++ in qml where the front

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.760 
written in C++ in qml where the front
end<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:18.150> actually<00:01:18.600> designed<00:01:18.810> all<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.470> these

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
end was actually designed all of these

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.520 
end was actually designed all of these
screens<00:01:20.130> by<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.880> our<00:01:20.970> artists<00:01:21.600> at<00:01:21.720> ICS<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
screens by one of our artists at ICS and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.219 
screens by one of our artists at ICS and
what<00:01:23.159> he<00:01:23.250> did<00:01:23.400> was<00:01:23.460> use<00:01:23.909> Photoshop<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.659> create

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
what he did was use Photoshop to create

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.480 
what he did was use Photoshop to create
these<00:01:25.380> screens<00:01:25.830> such<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.729> radio<00:01:28.189> or<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
these screens such as the radio or the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.020 
these screens such as the radio or the
dashboard<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.530> he<00:01:31.530> exported<00:01:32.220> from<00:01:32.369> Photoshop

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
dashboard and he exported from Photoshop

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.240 
dashboard and he exported from Photoshop
to<00:01:33.270> qml<00:01:33.780> where<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.229> takes<00:01:34.350> each<00:01:34.619> layer<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
to qml where it takes each layer and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.490 
to qml where it takes each layer and
makes<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:35.909> item<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
makes it one item so then I is a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.950 
makes it one item so then I is a
programmer<00:01:38.009> right<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.520> C++<00:01:39.119> back<00:01:39.360> end<00:01:39.630> I

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
programmer right the C++ back end I

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.080 
programmer right the C++ back end I
export<00:01:40.530> variables<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:41.640> i<00:01:41.759> bind

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
export variables and then i bind

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.240 
export variables and then i bind
variables<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.020> say<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> rotation<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.130> this

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
variables to say the rotation of this

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.499 
variables to say the rotation of this
needle<00:01:44.700> item<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:46.500> since<00:01:46.920> qml<00:01:47.790> has<00:01:48.000> states<00:01:48.299> and

go<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.960> radio<00:02:07.380> application<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.190> get

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
go to the radio application we get

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.479 
go to the radio application we get
smooth<00:02:08.670> transitions<00:02:09.390> we<00:02:10.080> could<00:02:10.229> actually

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
smooth transitions we could actually

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.970 
smooth transitions we could actually
play<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.520> radio<00:02:11.910> um

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
play the radio um

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.140 
play the radio um
switch<00:02:14.790> stations<00:02:15.120> we<00:02:16.019> only<00:02:16.170> get<00:02:16.470> one<00:02:17.150> even

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
switch stations we only get one even

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.119 
switch stations we only get one even
that<00:02:18.299> once<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.690> little<00:02:18.930> dodgy<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.950> key

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
that once a little dodgy and the key

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.039 
that once a little dodgy and the key
part<00:02:23.459> here<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.090> develop<00:02:24.599> this<00:02:24.780> in

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
part here is that we develop this in

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.800 
part here is that we develop this in
only<00:02:25.290> two<00:02:25.620> weeks<00:02:25.650> with<00:02:26.069> work<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.810> what

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
only two weeks with work and what

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.960 
only two weeks with work and what
happens<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.830> since<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.310> design<00:02:29.730> it

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
happens is is that since the design it

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.530 
happens is is that since the design it
was<00:02:30.060> actually<00:02:30.510> involved<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:32.480> in<00:02:33.480> the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
was actually involved in the in the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.330 
was actually involved in the in the
development<00:02:34.140> what<00:02:34.560> we<00:02:34.769> get<00:02:35.069> from<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
development what we get from the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.729 
development what we get from the
designers<00:02:35.879> actual<00:02:36.330> usable<00:02:36.599> code<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
designers actual usable code so the

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.100 
designers actual usable code so the
designer<00:02:38.129> gets<00:02:38.459> their<00:02:38.730> vision<00:02:39.269> immediately

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
designer gets their vision immediately

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.830 
designer gets their vision immediately
inside<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.280> application<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.329> C++

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
inside of the application that is a C++

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.080 
inside of the application that is a C++
program<00:02:43.230> are<00:02:43.379> developing<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.700> something<00:02:45.060> that

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
program are developing to something that

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.880 
program are developing to something that
you<00:02:45.299> have<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.480> much<00:02:45.870> more<00:02:46.110> iterative<00:02:46.530> design

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
you have a much more iterative design

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.589 
you have a much more iterative design
process<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:47.970> goes<00:02:48.120> back<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.540> forth

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
process and that it goes back and forth

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.650 
process and that it goes back and forth
several<00:02:48.959> times<00:02:49.400> exactly<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.849> I<00:02:51.209> get<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.420> use

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
several times exactly so I get to use

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.020 
several times exactly so I get to use
actual<00:02:52.140> work<00:02:52.440> products<00:02:52.950> from<00:02:53.280> designers<00:02:53.849> and

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
actual work products from designers and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.330 
actual work products from designers and
artists<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.720> if<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.410> artist<00:02:55.799> wants<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.220> go

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
artists and if the artist wants to go

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.030 
artists and if the artist wants to go
back<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.790> change<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.359> they<00:02:57.660> can<00:02:57.920> would<00:02:58.920> be

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
back and change this they can would be

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.800 
back and change this they can would be
qualified<00:02:59.549> to<00:02:59.579> open<00:03:00.000> up<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.209> files<00:03:00.420> make

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
qualified to open up the files make

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.229 
qualified to open up the files make
changes<00:03:01.290> through<00:03:02.069> simple<00:03:02.370> geometry<00:03:03.060> type

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
changes through simple geometry type

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.740 
changes through simple geometry type
code<00:03:03.629> but<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.590> back<00:03:04.920> end<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.430> entirely<00:03:05.760> in<00:03:06.090> C++

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
code but the back end is entirely in C++

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.869 
code but the back end is entirely in C++
so<00:03:07.319> I<00:03:07.349> can<00:03:07.620> do<00:03:07.709> it<00:03:07.829> i'm<00:03:07.920> good<00:03:08.129> at<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.519> designer

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
so I can do it i'm good at the designer

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.430 
so I can do it i'm good at the designer
can<00:03:09.000> do<00:03:09.209> with<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.450> good<00:03:09.629> ad<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.989> you<00:03:10.140> end<00:03:10.290> up

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
can do with a good ad and you end up

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.830 
can do with a good ad and you end up
something<00:03:10.890> like<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:13.970> so<00:03:14.970> what<00:03:15.510> was<00:03:15.660> the

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
something like this so what was the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.920 
something like this so what was the
original<00:03:16.650> idea<00:03:17.579> behind<00:03:17.819> that<00:03:18.060> system<00:03:18.329> what

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
original idea behind that system what

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.170 
original idea behind that system what
what<00:03:19.169> what<00:03:19.470> drove<00:03:19.799> you<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.099> do<00:03:20.430> then<00:03:20.669> good

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
what what drove you to do then good

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.870 
what what drove you to do then good
question<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:22.139> I'm<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.829> bit<00:03:22.919> of<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.190> car<00:03:23.459> nut<00:03:23.669> as

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
question so I'm a bit of a car nut as

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.199 
question so I'm a bit of a car nut as
well<00:03:24.209> as<00:03:24.419> being<00:03:24.599> a<00:03:24.720> computer<00:03:25.049> geek<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.209> met

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
well as being a computer geek so I met

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.780 
well as being a computer geek so I met
some<00:03:27.359> of<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.510> guys<00:03:27.660> from<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.650> ED<00:03:29.069> project<00:03:29.579> and

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
some of the guys from the ED project and

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.670 
some of the guys from the ED project and
talked<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.359> them<00:03:30.480> at<00:03:30.630> dev<00:03:30.780> days<00:03:30.959> Munich<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.530> I

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
talked to them at dev days Munich and I

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.170 
talked to them at dev days Munich and I
thought<00:03:31.889> wow<00:03:32.069> I<00:03:32.310> really<00:03:32.489> want<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.880> write<00:03:33.060> an

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
thought wow I really want to write an

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.059 
thought wow I really want to write an
application<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.470> thought<00:03:34.590> about<00:03:34.859> writing

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
application and I thought about writing

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.849 
application and I thought about writing
a<00:03:35.549> radio<00:03:36.120> or<00:03:36.180> an<00:03:36.389> mp3<00:03:36.510> player<00:03:37.169> and<00:03:37.500> then<00:03:37.799> I

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
a radio or an mp3 player and then I

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.470 
a radio or an mp3 player and then I
thought<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.099> myself<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.579> know<00:03:38.639> I<00:03:38.730> have<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> fuel

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
thought to myself you know I have a fuel

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.089 
thought to myself you know I have a fuel
injection<00:03:39.930> system<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.349> my<00:03:40.380> garage<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:41.069> I

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
injection system in my garage that I

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.460 
injection system in my garage that I
have<00:03:41.280> yet<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.519> install<00:03:42.000> on<00:03:42.030> my<00:03:42.299> 1981<00:03:43.200> Camaro

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
have yet to install on my 1981 Camaro

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.289 
have yet to install on my 1981 Camaro
why<00:03:44.040> don't<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:44.340> talked<00:03:44.669> to<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.940> over<00:03:45.209> the

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
why don't I just talked to that over the

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.199 
why don't I just talked to that over the
serial<00:03:45.630> connection<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.910> that's<00:03:47.910> how<00:03:48.060> it

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
serial connection and that's how it

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.770 
serial connection and that's how it
started<00:03:48.569> I<00:03:49.010> rooted<00:03:50.010> up<00:03:50.160> me<00:03:50.819> go<00:03:50.970> easy<00:03:51.389> on<00:03:51.599> my

started I rooted up me go easy on my
lenovo<00:03:52.099> wrote<00:03:53.099> some<00:03:53.310> code<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.819> it's

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
lenovo wrote some code and it's

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.030 
lenovo wrote some code and it's

well<00:04:00.690> this<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:00.989> actually<00:04:01.500> an<00:04:01.590> open-source

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
well this is actually an open-source

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.580 
well this is actually an open-source
fuel<00:04:03.120> injection<00:04:03.540> system<00:04:03.870> called<00:04:04.079> megasquirt

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
fuel injection system called megasquirt

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.089 
fuel injection system called megasquirt
so<00:04:05.579> if<00:04:06.180> i<00:04:06.389> actually<00:04:06.569> and<00:04:07.230> this<00:04:07.379> is<00:04:07.530> an<00:04:07.680> engine

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
so if i actually and this is an engine

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.000 
so if i actually and this is an engine
simulator<00:04:08.639> if<00:04:08.879> i<00:04:09.359> had<00:04:09.629> the<00:04:10.169> engine<00:04:10.620> harness

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
simulator if i had the engine harness

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.319 
simulator if i had the engine harness
connected<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.519> this<00:04:11.639> computer<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:12.239> would

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
connected to this computer it would

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.330 
connected to this computer it would
actually<00:04:12.540> fire<00:04:13.109> my<00:04:13.410> injectors<00:04:13.919> and<00:04:13.980> spark

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
actually fire my injectors and spark

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.509 
actually fire my injectors and spark
plugs<00:04:14.579> so<00:04:15.510> this<00:04:15.720> is<00:04:15.750> an<00:04:15.989> actual<00:04:16.519> automotive

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
plugs so this is an actual automotive

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.930 
plugs so this is an actual automotive
ECU<00:04:18.000> providing<00:04:18.630> me<00:04:18.810> this<00:04:19.260> information<00:04:19.940> can

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
ECU providing me this information can

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.099 
ECU providing me this information can
you<00:04:21.000> show<00:04:21.239> us<00:04:21.269> on<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.660> screen

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
you show us on the screen

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.360 
you show us on the screen
works<00:04:22.530> good<00:04:23.360> form<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.599> i<00:04:25.199> can<00:04:25.560> change<00:04:25.770> values

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
works good form the i can change values

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.270 
works good form the i can change values
on<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.639> ECU<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.539> you<00:04:28.259> can<00:04:28.409> see<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.650> sensor

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
on the ECU and you can see the sensor

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.550 
on the ECU and you can see the sensor
values<00:04:29.759> change<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.629> the<00:04:31.020> needles<00:04:31.379> move

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
values change and the needles move

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.779 
values change and the needles move
smoothly<00:04:31.889> they<00:04:32.250> have<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.370> little<00:04:32.580> bit<00:04:32.759> of

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
smoothly they have a little bit of

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.270 
smoothly they have a little bit of
bounce<00:04:33.000> at<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.419> end<00:04:33.539> and<00:04:33.900> if<00:04:34.740> we<00:04:34.770> take<00:04:35.039> a<00:04:35.099> look

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
bounce at the end and if we take a look

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.890 
bounce at the end and if we take a look
at<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.580> sensor<00:04:36.000> view<00:04:36.210> this<00:04:36.389> is<00:04:36.509> actually<00:04:36.840> all

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
at the sensor view this is actually all

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.050 
at the sensor view this is actually all
the<00:04:37.409> information<00:04:37.979> i<00:04:38.099> can<00:04:38.129> get<00:04:38.490> at<00:04:38.610> one<00:04:38.819> time

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
the information i can get at one time

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.300 
the information i can get at one time
and<00:04:39.449> we<00:04:39.870> can<00:04:40.050> look<00:04:40.199> at<00:04:40.349> the<00:04:40.530> pulse<00:04:40.889> width<00:04:41.159> of

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
and we can look at the pulse width of

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.010 
and we can look at the pulse width of
the<00:04:41.460> injectors<00:04:41.969> how<00:04:42.210> long<00:04:42.509> they're<00:04:42.750> firing

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
the injectors how long they're firing

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.890 
the injectors how long they're firing
and<00:04:43.379> as<00:04:43.800> we<00:04:43.979> move<00:04:44.189> the<00:04:44.370> RPM<00:04:44.819> up<00:04:45.000> you'll<00:04:45.659> notice

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
and as we move the RPM up you'll notice

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.080 
and as we move the RPM up you'll notice
that<00:04:46.050> as<00:04:46.770> we<00:04:47.099> accelerate<00:04:47.639> and<00:04:48.030> decelerate

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
that as we accelerate and decelerate

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.709 
that as we accelerate and decelerate
we're<00:04:48.840> having<00:04:49.139> more<00:04:49.409> and<00:04:49.439> more<00:04:49.560> pulse<00:04:49.919> waves

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:50.719 
we're having more and more pulse waves

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:53.240 
we're having more and more pulse waves
so<00:04:51.719> just<00:04:51.900> give<00:04:52.050> us<00:04:52.169> a<00:04:52.289> bit<00:04:52.469> of<00:04:52.500> background<00:04:52.800> on
