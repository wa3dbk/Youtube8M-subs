00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
after another so while these ways aren't

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.499 
after another so while these ways aren't
like<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.309> waves<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.670> see<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.030> Pacific

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
like the waves you see in the Pacific

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
it's very calm the good thing about

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.429 
it's very calm the good thing about
these<00:00:20.189> ways<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.760> they<00:00:20.910> don't<00:00:21.270> break<00:00:21.570> these

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
these ways is they don't break these

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.120 
these ways is they don't break these
waves<00:00:22.769> don't<00:00:23.039> break<00:00:23.510> and<00:00:24.830> that's<00:00:25.830> pretty

long before I came to the Baltic Sea and

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.620 
long before I came to the Baltic Sea and
the<00:02:26.370> sunset<00:02:27.370> we<00:02:28.060> probably<00:02:28.270> wouldn't<00:02:28.510> have

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
the sunset we probably wouldn't have

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.900 
the sunset we probably wouldn't have
seen<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.810> anyway<00:02:29.230> because<00:02:29.410> we<00:02:30.310> usually<00:02:30.550> miss

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
seen it anyway because we usually miss
