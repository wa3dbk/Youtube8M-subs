00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
what probably was the booking office and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.160 
what probably was the booking office and
now<00:00:41.520> yes<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.940> won't<00:00:42.120> cut<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.600> where<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
now yes you won't cut on to where the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.049 
now yes you won't cut on to where the
platform's<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> railway<00:00:44.610> station<00:00:44.640> is

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
platform's on the railway station is

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.690 
platform's on the railway station is
three<00:00:45.620> which<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.649> massive<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.250> absolutely

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
three which is massive it's absolutely

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.080 
three which is massive it's absolutely
huge<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.469> there's<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.530> huge<00:00:49.770> big<00:00:50.100> wooden

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
huge and there's this huge big wooden

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.510 
huge and there's this huge big wooden
platform<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> middle<00:00:52.219> which<00:00:53.219> I

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
platform here in the middle which I

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.029 
platform here in the middle which I
guess<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.000> probably<00:00:54.149> where<00:00:54.930> m<00:00:55.230> lots<00:00:55.920> of

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
guess is probably where m lots of

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.950 
guess is probably where m lots of
Victoria's<00:00:56.520> used<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.820> stand<00:00:57.030> around<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.390> wait

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
Victoria's used to stand around and wait

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.439 
Victoria's used to stand around and wait
for<00:00:58.050> friends<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> come<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.329> where<00:01:00.329> that

blocks just getting out of this car

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.200 
blocks just getting out of this car
there<00:01:01.710> was<00:01:02.430> probably<00:01:02.699> where<00:01:02.820> all<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.969> trains

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
there was probably where all the trains

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.870 
there was probably where all the trains
used<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.420> stop<00:01:03.739> it's<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.860> huge<00:01:05.129> place<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
used to stop it's a huge place it's a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.410 
used to stop it's a huge place it's a
massive<00:01:06.240> old<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:07.100> railway<00:01:08.100> station<00:01:08.520> which<00:01:09.390> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
massive old and railway station which is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.340 
massive old and railway station which is
slowly<00:01:09.750> being<00:01:10.670> regenerated<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.350> brought

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
slowly being regenerated and brought

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.469 
slowly being regenerated and brought
back<00:01:13.470> into<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.909> superb<00:01:14.909> condition<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.450> which

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
back into the superb condition in which

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.910 
back into the superb condition in which
it<00:01:15.659> should<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.350> under<00:01:16.680> these<00:01:16.799> these
