00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
subject then that's important but also

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.150 
subject then that's important but also
knowing<00:01:19.060> how<00:01:19.150> to<00:01:19.270> relate<00:01:19.660> it<00:01:19.900> to<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.620> context

class because I find my favorite
teachers<00:01:43.200> once<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.320> can<00:01:44.470> teach<00:01:44.680> well<00:01:44.950> but<00:01:45.190> the

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
teachers once you can teach well but the

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.650 
teachers once you can teach well but the
ones<00:01:45.490> are<00:01:45.670> over<00:01:45.790> to<00:01:45.940> communication<00:01:46.510> to<00:01:46.540> the

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
ones are over to communication to the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.020 
ones are over to communication to the
class<00:01:46.870> and<00:01:47.830> it's<00:01:48.100> not<00:01:48.250> just<00:01:48.430> being<00:01:48.640> serious

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
class and it's not just being serious

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.600 
class and it's not just being serious
all<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.270> time<00:01:49.480> a<00:01:49.690> bit<00:01:50.410> of<00:01:50.440> fun<00:01:50.710> but<00:01:50.920> main<00:01:51.580> thing

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
all the time a bit of fun but main thing

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.980 
all the time a bit of fun but main thing
is<00:01:51.940> what<00:01:52.240> they've<00:01:52.360> got<00:01:52.510> for<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.690> lesson

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
is what they've got for the lesson

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.420 
is what they've got for the lesson
planned<00:01:53.230> they<00:01:53.620> get<00:01:53.800> across<00:01:54.010> to<00:01:54.190> you<00:01:54.280> we

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
planned they get across to you we

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.050 
planned they get across to you we
remember<00:01:54.790> it

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
remember it

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.370 
remember it
and<00:01:55.149> that's<00:01:55.570> fine<00:01:55.780> because<00:01:55.960> I<00:01:56.079> have<00:01:56.170> some

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
and that's fine because I have some

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.490 
and that's fine because I have some
teachers<00:01:56.790> who<00:01:57.790> really<00:01:58.149> know<00:01:58.270> their<00:01:58.420> stuff<00:01:58.509> but

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
teachers who really know their stuff but

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.710 
teachers who really know their stuff but
they're<00:01:59.680> not<00:01:59.920> able<00:02:00.100> to<00:02:00.280> sort<00:02:00.850> of<00:02:00.880> teach<00:02:01.329> it<00:02:01.570> to

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
they're not able to sort of teach it to

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.149 
they're not able to sort of teach it to
the<00:02:01.869> children<00:02:01.899> as<00:02:02.290> well<00:02:02.439> because<00:02:02.649> it<00:02:02.740> doesn't

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
the children as well because it doesn't

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.550 
the children as well because it doesn't
sink<00:02:03.340> in<00:02:03.490> so<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:03.880> think<00:02:04.180> that<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.869> best<00:02:05.380> thing

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
sink in so I think that the best thing

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.810 
sink in so I think that the best thing
for<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.710> teacher<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.009> do<00:02:06.189> is<00:02:06.310> be<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.549> be<00:02:06.640> able<00:02:06.759> to

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
for a teacher to do is be to be able to

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.410 
for a teacher to do is be to be able to
communicate<00:02:06.939> with<00:02:07.390> students<00:02:07.869> I<00:02:08.259> think

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
communicate with students I think

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.320 
communicate with students I think
consistency<00:02:10.420> because<00:02:10.959> is<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.670> even<00:02:13.030> if

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
consistency because is like it even if

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.790 
consistency because is like it even if
you<00:02:13.510> are<00:02:13.540> strict<00:02:13.989> then<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.250> like<00:02:15.700> if<00:02:16.209> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
you are strict then it's like if the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.380 
you are strict then it's like if the
student<00:02:17.800> or<00:02:18.069> whether<00:02:18.610> if<00:02:18.910> they<00:02:19.060> know<00:02:19.209> where

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
student or whether if they know where

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.449 
student or whether if they know where
they<00:02:19.480> stand<00:02:19.540> then<00:02:20.170> they're<00:02:20.950> more<00:02:21.099> likely<00:02:21.310> to

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
they stand then they're more likely to

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.449 
they stand then they're more likely to
do<00:02:21.670> what<00:02:21.819> you<00:02:21.910> want<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.650> think<00:02:23.650> I've<00:02:24.040> got<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.280> be

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
do what you want I think I've got to be

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.860 
do what you want I think I've got to be
that<00:02:24.610> approachable<00:02:25.239> like<00:02:25.480> if<00:02:25.569> you<00:02:25.690> have<00:02:25.810> a
