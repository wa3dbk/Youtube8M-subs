00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.670
 with this now has a little bigger completed milton rosseto what else you 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.659
 with these movements 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:12.209
 here goes 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.609
 working with the side pieces our goal is that the team had snake 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.400
 with food is that we have 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.009
 one of these games here 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.819
 complete 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.289
 the sides are 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.650
 with the cor song comes out so if here were the songs 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.970
 in the same thing 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.660
 got that corner here 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.990
 So to start, we'll do the next, put the corner that has the curse. 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090
 but we already feel put back 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.060
 here is going to be our front 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.430
 here's your side 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.220
 the right 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.220
 in the middle here right side and then only celebrated 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.060
 the bottom is going to be this side here 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.700
 the different movement and with the front 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.940
 to start the movement 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.570
 the movement is 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.570
 side-right direction during the time 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.520
 clockwise 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.740
 on the right side 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.200
 during the hours again 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.310
 and now the bottom we do a 70 degree fangio turn are interested in that if 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.680
 integrate in traffic 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.110
 two laps the sexes 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.100
 on the Internet 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.430
 and now we have the right side to make the clockwise movement 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.210
 forward in the direction 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.990
 counter-clockwise 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.540
 the right side towards 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.470
 counter-clockwise 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.470
 with the fear of a new 180 degree operation 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.660
 and there the side 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.760
 I had to finally cge also 180graus 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.850
 are games 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.350
 twice 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.200
 now everybody was me to complete a side 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.820
 already the side mickey orange coat 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.170
 this is the goal of the move if you do not complete your side the first time 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.370
 You again, take it here. 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.720
 the patient already feels deep and is now in the position already 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:10.999
 the score 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:12.529
 the final move 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:14.229
 or full award 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.699
 and the other sides with their corners 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:19.869
 how are they known 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.869
 in this black bridge the final movement 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.159
 once installed in this configuration here with a complete report 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.609
 and the others with their adjacent ones in the position 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.609
 correct as endpoint 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:45.129
 then the position with us start putting a full fund 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.219
 back 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:52.209
 and the move is now the following 180 degree forward movement 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.029
 the side 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:01.709
 greater than 15 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.709
 we are going to vote 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.179
 the clockwise direction 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:11.179
 if the two lines here people play down 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.179
 my work 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:15.899
 makes a mutation 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:18.769
 again programs are taken in front 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.829
 whether for white yellow and green columns 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.999
 and back in two up 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:27.069
 in simulation 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.889
 now we 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.889
 the Portuguese acted as the opposite direction 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.499
 and now 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:36.619
 ahead again 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:39.749
 180 degrees 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:41.569
 I did not go 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.209
 the first one we managed 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.209
 this was not the first we repeat the January movement 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:51.920
 now it should work because it is already in the configuration here in the movement 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.099
 the page 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.109
 behind 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.769
 so we repeat movement once more 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.059
 180 degrees 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:05.019
 in the frontal phase 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.019
 agents will or will not 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.869
 the two in the front 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:15.869
 180 degree turn at front 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.349
 rematch 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:19.900
 higher 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.129
 I suggest ninth position 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:25.129
 and now 180 degrees in front 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.080
 we managed to solve 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.559
 the fuel 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:35.909
 these the sequence of movements that we presented is one of the only 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.370
 moments the cbf site solved cuba 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.280
 in some real situations and you may be required to make this move 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.210
 occurs sometimes even got settings got victims 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:50.649
 population fatigue despite pressure from the movements and 

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:52.270
 we arrived solution 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.229
 according to him the prison solution 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.779
 simpler 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:58.409
 it's not faster 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.309
 and optimizations of them you want to make a fright but the more subtle it was not 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:03.069
 you 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.479
 decided to put on them
