00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
McKee and he has a theory on Phineas and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.869 
McKee and he has a theory on Phineas and
Ferb<00:00:43.350> real<00:00:43.800> short<00:00:44.100> theory<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.670> actually

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
Ferb real short theory but it's actually

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.220 
Ferb real short theory but it's actually
kind<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.090> fun<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.450> actually<00:00:45.719> reminds<00:00:46.020> me<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.140> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
kind of fun it actually reminds me of a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.260 
kind of fun it actually reminds me of a
theory<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.530> did<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.250> show<00:00:47.280> while<00:00:47.730> back<00:00:48.030> but

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
theory I did on the show while back but

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.900 
theory I did on the show while back but
he<00:00:48.390> says<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.140> Phineas<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.680> Ferb<00:00:49.920> are<00:00:50.190> all<00:00:50.579> in

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
he says the Phineas and Ferb are all in

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.540 
he says the Phineas and Ferb are all in
purgatory<00:00:51.660> which<00:00:51.930> explains<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.920> eight<00:00:53.219> years

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
purgatory which explains the eight years

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.060 
purgatory which explains the eight years
summer<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.270> how<00:00:54.480> Phineas<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.230> Ferb<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.770> I'm

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
summer and how Phineas and Ferb can I'm

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.029 
summer and how Phineas and Ferb can I'm
build<00:00:56.340> almost<00:00:56.969> anything<00:00:57.270> seemingly<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.620> fast

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
build almost anything seemingly so fast

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.650 
build almost anything seemingly so fast
very<00:00:59.550> cool<00:00:59.850> things<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.210> said<00:01:00.359> really

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
very cool things like I said really

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.569 
very cool things like I said really
short<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.770> reminded<00:01:02.100> me<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.219> lot<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
short but it reminded me a lot of the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.340 
short but it reminded me a lot of the
theory<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.910> did<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> while<00:01:03.300> back<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.629> guys<00:01:04.110> may

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
theory I did a while back you guys may

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.390 
theory I did a while back you guys may
have<00:01:04.379> missed<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:04.920> been<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> couple<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.339> years
