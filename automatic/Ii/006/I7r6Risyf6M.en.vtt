00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 the kids what if I bring a 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.660
 stunt zombies in simple Buried 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.580
 in fact it occurred to me from 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.320
 that you can realize what 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.450
 simple that is that at the same time very very 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.340
 useful it turns out that I was here playing for 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.619
 playing had taken a little money 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.289
 of the bank had touched me the pump of the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.220
 time that in fact just touching him 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.350
 pretty easy, well, I'm playing with 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.300
 friends or when I play alone and it turns out that 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.820
 I said host if you have a pump 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 time opens all the doors and then 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.050
 the detonated will follow all the doors 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.790
 open will return the money is a 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.590
 thing that occurred to me like that playing 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.300
 play as I tell you and in fact it works 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.640
 there I was studying the doors that 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.350
 I could open and there you see how he threw the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.870
 pump of time and then I start to 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.969
 open doors doors pardon fix the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.559
 salon I open the one of the fund I open 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.149
 also that of the bank that by the way 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.250
 end of the video will teach a trick to 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.710
 enter the bank for free without 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.530
 open any door I open here the the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.300
 the three turn on the electricity and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.859
 now how are you going to see as it detonated the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.989
 time bomb back to back 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.760
 returns in money but the doors continue 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.439
 open it turns out that I've noticed 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.450
 that all the changes we make in the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.729
 map when we go back in time 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.549
 they do not alter they stay the same under pressure 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.200
 the step of maxis that we put the bomb of 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.170
 energy in the gallows we come back in the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.149
 time and the ball is still inside 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.799
 of the gallows vale is good here you see how 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.479
 I'm going to detonate the bomb, we're going back 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.280
 back in time and you are going to see 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.409
 continue as they are all 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.140
 the open accounts but I'm with 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.210
 the same money I had when I pulled the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.799
 pump is a very good trick you can 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.100
 open all the doors on the map and not 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.569
 spend a single point and now we're going to 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.429
 spend a little trick that I will teach 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.950
 to enter the bank without having without 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.450
 spend any money worth there you see how 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.220
 I have placed a tool above me 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.630
 I'm going through the barn here and this is 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.039
 the route that you have to do is a 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.369
 little long but good it's worth it 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.229
 to not spend 750 let's say that jump 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.239
 we go here to the living room we go by 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.340
 behind the room we go here to the 

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:57.959
 posters of the mine and if you remember here 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.119
 There is a site just jump where you 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.270
 you can fall down here behind in the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.770
 tables you are that when you pass then it is 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.450
 let's say that if it falls then we throw ourselves 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.579
 down here and it turns out that we fall right 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.349
 here the bank is worth a very very trick 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.390
 good apart from the pump there will be good 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.910
 now not enough 750 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.780
 Very rat if you will not spend anything because 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.970
 Nothing, I hope you liked it 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.470
 these two little tricks I had to 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.050
 go up because they are good enough 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.140
 the one about the pump especially is very very 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.430
 useful this for good if we do not have 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.560
 money to open the door as well 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.750
 very very easy I recommend you take the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.220
 Chalks to earn many more points there 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.200
 nothing more kids to see if I bring you a 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.510
 already a multiplayer map gameplay or 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.730
 be the vital maps that I have 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.200
 very much Baskonia I will comment on something and 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.070
 nothing else see you in the next video 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.070
 goodbye People
