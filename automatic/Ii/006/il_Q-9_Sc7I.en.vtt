00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
Bryan had his moment as well but for me

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.810 
Bryan had his moment as well but for me
that<00:01:40.740> was<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.950> biggest<00:01:41.220> thing<00:01:41.400> coming<00:01:41.700> out<00:01:41.759> of

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that was the biggest thing coming out of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.859 
that was the biggest thing coming out of
Wrestlemania<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.600> been<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> year

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
Wrestlemania and it's been a year

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.020 
Wrestlemania and it's been a year
building<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.159> Paul<00:01:44.820> Heyman

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
building to that and Paul Heyman

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.819 
building to that and Paul Heyman
constantly<00:01:45.600> reminding<00:01:46.110> everybody<00:01:46.350> every

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
constantly reminding everybody every

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.800 
constantly reminding everybody every
time<00:01:47.009> he's<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.280> mic<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.090> Brock<00:01:48.329> Lesnar<00:01:48.720> is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
time he's on a mic that Brock Lesnar is

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.289 
time he's on a mic that Brock Lesnar is
the<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.170> behind<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.680> 21<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.250> 1<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.119> go<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the one behind the 21 and 1 if you go to

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.179 
the one behind the 21 and 1 if you go to
Wrestlemania<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.049> he's<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.680> champion

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
Wrestlemania and he's not the champion

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.280 
Wrestlemania and he's not the champion
and<00:01:53.399> still<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.970> one<00:01:54.180> behind<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.659> 21<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.170> one

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
and still the one behind the 21 and one

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.230 
and still the one behind the 21 and one
that<00:01:55.829> whole<00:01:56.070> year<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.430> waste<00:01:56.700> for<00:01:56.820> me<00:01:57.030> well

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
that whole year is a waste for me well

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.090 
that whole year is a waste for me well
not<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.509> me<00:01:57.630> all<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.290> money<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.619> ending<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
not to me all the money and ending the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.429 
not to me all the money and ending the
streak<00:01:59.460> was<00:01:59.850> building<00:02:00.600> up<00:02:00.689> rock<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.110> such<00:02:01.409> a

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
streak was building up rock to such a

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.380 
streak was building up rock to such a
degree<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.189> guy<00:02:02.430> who<00:02:02.490> beats<00:02:03.119> this

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
degree that the guy who beats this

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.410 
degree that the guy who beats this
person<00:02:03.930> inherits<00:02:04.729> something<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.060> would<00:02:06.240> want

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
person inherits something you would want

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.760 
person inherits something you would want
that<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:06.960> really<00:02:07.469> hasn't<00:02:07.619> been

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
that and that really hasn't been

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.440 
that and that really hasn't been
emphasized<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.610> you're<00:02:08.849> right<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.270> just

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
emphasized and you're right to just

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.229 
emphasized and you're right to just
trivialize<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.440> loss<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.730> move<00:02:11.910> on<00:02:12.030> to

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
trivialize the loss and just move on to

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.110 
trivialize the loss and just move on to
Wrestlemania

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
Wrestlemania

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.030 
Wrestlemania
it's<00:02:13.299> like<00:02:13.480> then<00:02:13.810> really<00:02:14.379> ending<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:14.860> streak

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
it's like then really ending the streak

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.550 
it's like then really ending the streak
was<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.549> a<00:02:15.640> puzzling<00:02:16.239> decision<00:02:16.599> and<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.319> want

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
was just a puzzling decision and I want

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.259 
was just a puzzling decision and I want
to<00:02:17.650> see<00:02:17.769> how<00:02:17.860> this<00:02:17.980> plays<00:02:18.159> out<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.790> think

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
to see how this plays out and I think

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.119 
to see how this plays out and I think
that<00:02:19.390> that's<00:02:19.480> certainly<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.319> strong<00:02:20.620> direction

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
that that's certainly a strong direction

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.250 
that that's certainly a strong direction
to<00:02:21.250> go<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.430> but<00:02:22.090> then<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.420> other<00:02:22.450> argument<00:02:23.140> is

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
to go in but then the other argument is

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.440 
to go in but then the other argument is
that<00:02:23.290> if<00:02:23.620> Lesnar<00:02:24.489> is<00:02:24.580> in<00:02:24.610> fact<00:02:24.879> leaving<00:02:25.330> right

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
that if Lesnar is in fact leaving right

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.360 
that if Lesnar is in fact leaving right
after<00:02:25.510> WrestleMania<00:02:26.379> do<00:02:26.560> we<00:02:26.709> want<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.040> so

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
after WrestleMania do we want it so

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.640 
after WrestleMania do we want it so
predictable<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.299> everyone<00:02:29.019> knows<00:02:29.200> Lesnar

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
predictable that everyone knows Lesnar

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.309 
predictable that everyone knows Lesnar
is<00:02:29.709> losing<00:02:30.129> this<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.489> it<00:02:31.209> loses<00:02:31.480> some<00:02:31.870> steam<00:02:32.140> I

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
is losing this and it loses some steam I

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.960 
is losing this and it loses some steam I
don't<00:02:32.590> think<00:02:32.769> it<00:02:32.890> will<00:02:33.069> but<00:02:33.579> that's<00:02:33.760> the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
don't think it will but that's the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.610 
don't think it will but that's the
argument<00:02:34.090> against<00:02:34.659> of<00:02:34.959> course<00:02:35.200> but<00:02:35.379> there's

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
argument against of course but there's

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.899 
argument against of course but there's
so<00:02:35.709> many<00:02:35.829> things<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.220> can<00:02:36.400> come<00:02:36.579> out<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.790> this

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
so many things that can come out of this

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.190 
so many things that can come out of this
match<00:02:37.120> as<00:02:37.299> well<00:02:37.480> as<00:02:37.629> you<00:02:37.750> could<00:02:37.870> set<00:02:38.079> up

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
match as well as you could set up

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.289 
match as well as you could set up
different<00:02:38.590> things<00:02:38.769> obviously<00:02:39.519> Brock<00:02:40.120> Lesnar

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
different things obviously Brock Lesnar

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.000 
different things obviously Brock Lesnar
pinning<00:02:40.780> Seth<00:02:40.989> Rollins<00:02:41.200> something<00:02:41.739> happens

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
pinning Seth Rollins something happens

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.069 
pinning Seth Rollins something happens
after<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.430> match<00:02:42.610> he<00:02:43.090> attempts<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.540> cash-in

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
after the match he attempts a cash-in

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.349 
after the match he attempts a cash-in
maybe<00:02:44.829> a<00:02:44.950> Randy<00:02:45.310> Orton<00:02:45.579> pure<00:02:45.790> appears<00:02:46.180> out<00:02:46.329> of

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
maybe a Randy Orton pure appears out of

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:47.910 
maybe a Randy Orton pure appears out of
nowhere<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.870> set<00:02:47.079> up<00:02:47.170> their<00:02:47.319> WrestleMania

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
nowhere you set up their WrestleMania

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.559 
nowhere you set up their WrestleMania
match<00:02:48.099> you<00:02:48.250> can<00:02:48.370> have<00:02:48.489> Randy<00:02:48.879> Orton<00:02:49.180> versus

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
match you can have Randy Orton versus

match you can have Randy Orton versus
Seth<00:02:50.019> Rollins<00:02:50.109> many<00:02:50.709> options<00:02:51.340> we<00:02:51.609> go<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.790> the

Seth Rollins many options we go to the

WrestleMania main event equation to play
itself<00:02:56.290> out<00:02:56.470> essentially<00:02:57.370> comes<00:02:57.519> down<00:02:57.730> to

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849

Roman reigns and Daniel Bryan do you see
any<00:02:59.650> other<00:03:00.239> really<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.269> mean<00:03:01.480> like<00:03:01.659> a<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:02.109> could

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
any other really I mean like a you could

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.649 
any other really I mean like a you could
pick<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:02.829> dark<00:03:03.190> horse<00:03:03.430> may<00:03:03.760> be<00:03:03.819> a<00:03:03.940> Bray<00:03:04.390> Wyatt

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
pick a dark horse may be a Bray Wyatt

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.539 
pick a dark horse may be a Bray Wyatt
out<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.109> blue<00:03:05.290> but<00:03:05.319> but<00:03:05.859> you're<00:03:05.980> right<00:03:06.099> it

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
out of the blue but but you're right it

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.399 
out of the blue but but you're right it
really<00:03:06.909> comes<00:03:07.180> down<00:03:07.239> in<00:03:07.480> my<00:03:07.569> opinion<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.989> Roman

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409

WrestleMania<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.750> think<00:03:37.989> works<00:03:38.139> just<00:03:38.769> as<00:03:38.919> well

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
WrestleMania I think works just as well

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.220 
WrestleMania I think works just as well
as<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.579> would<00:03:39.730> with<00:03:39.760> with<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:40.359> Brock<00:03:40.599> Lesnar<00:03:41.019> and

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
as it would with with a Brock Lesnar and

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.780 
as it would with with a Brock Lesnar and
actually<00:03:41.739> maybe<00:03:41.859> a<00:03:41.980> little<00:03:42.160> more<00:03:42.340> believable

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
actually maybe a little more believable

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.020 
actually maybe a little more believable
because<00:03:43.060> that<00:03:44.049> size<00:03:44.290> no<00:03:44.829> no<00:03:45.400> disrespect<00:03:45.940> to

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
because that size no no disrespect to

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.280 
because that size no no disrespect to
Daniel<00:03:46.299> Bryan<00:03:46.329> but<00:03:46.720> when<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:46.930> see<00:03:47.079> brock
