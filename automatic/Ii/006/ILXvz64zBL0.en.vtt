00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.370
 we are going to see in this video another one of the lariat lies 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.519
 applied in almost or more state to the obtaining of a cogwheel for 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.809
 We are going to start doing this, and it is that she runs lecce and we are looking for a 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:21.020
 circle that will be the basis of our race sold and from now on we are going to 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:27.070
 build I sat the rectangle resale what would the customers be 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.909
 de la serna we are going to get closer to improve 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.380
 the form to work 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.440
 we select tool form 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.030
 and we make a prisoner of the vertex is of the rectangle 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.870
 let's apply now through the effect or super chivas 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.520
 unesa 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.590
 reduction of 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.110
 the other top dimensions 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.840
 Acosta simultaneously carry out the control and capital keys and make a 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.920
 small respite the short while from here it was h showed that it would be at the base 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.210
 of the conscious of our poveda ventada 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.770
 we focus the way 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.020
 we copy the object or drag it discomforts mind to a certain 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.020
 position of type 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.240
 we will repeat the placement of the successive teeth and make 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.110
 the total of the stem and for this we will be 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.490
 I tried a lot doc lic 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.490
 and drag the center of rotation to the center of the wheel the circle that 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.070
 is going to assume the basis of the sales stem 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.620
 we will now have to duplicate this image around the wheel and for that 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.620
 let's take a look at skeleton windows 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.570
 pitana dockable windows 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.520
 transformations its action and from here we will try to move 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.300
 from image 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.540
 created from a rectangle around the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.120
 circumference that will compose the cogwheel for it we will mark that 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.310
 exhorted to goat we will establish a trunk or 20 degrees and we will double at the same time 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.830
 what are we doing 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.840
 Passion passed you will escape agustÃ­ centelles cheeses 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:32.829
 until we reach the end p we have already highlighted the tickets 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:39.709
 we do not hide the window transformations we select cost aspects and what 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:40.870
 let's do is going to be 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.309
 solchaga 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:46.039
 since he was showing his wheel 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:49.909
 and now we will apply a Swiss inner circle 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.779
 p 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.949
 let's drag the center fair 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.659
 make lightly felt inside 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:09.069
 and we will select both objects to make the record operation because 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.080
 will assume that the center of this figure of this wheel will be huecco from 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.099
 of this moment I am going to have moss the base of the wheel we will need to do by 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.620
 the amintas fusion to the rest of the operation for it we click on 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.620
 a few of dior and we do a drag operation 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:32.569
 we already have point of fuad we can modify and the depth of the effect 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.129
 expulsion that I can also modify to pastis of the vertical shooter of the center 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:44.479
 we can set the number of min a certain amount we are going to put 10 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.569
 for example 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.779
 and we could apply even a pink color applied good gray color it's already going 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:56.489
 Seeming adolfo final result that we chase we would have to do 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.489
 apply a small rotation 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.629
 there I think it will be fine 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:19.810
 politically in the sixth c lighting have it an effect 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.580
 seasonal while pressure 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:32.840
 we injure and we can suspect read want as a result from a 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.289
 circumference of a female rectangle figure built from the d 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.330
 frog propeller of the rectangle magazine we have got a cogwheel with 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.030
 a pretty three-dimensional look with quite accomplished
