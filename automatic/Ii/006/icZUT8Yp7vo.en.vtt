00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.620
 hello everyone here gauge hall 67 and 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.240
 today I will explain 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.710
 how to play the game boy color on his 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.940
 iphone ipod touch and a piece of 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.379
 rossi market on the ipad 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.880
 jealous lighter or not by 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.350
 via a website that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.710
 I will put in the description of the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.960
 video 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.460
 then you go on safari or on prom 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.019
 for example you will have a list of games 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.130
 you choose the game you like 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.500
 me for example I will take it 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.179
 crunches 2 so this website is 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.740
 totally free as you could the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.600
 notice in fact there is an emulator that 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.280
 is integrated into this website in 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.010
 which you will have the button to the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.860
 button b select stark button to go 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.570
 right on the left or down then 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.219
 I accelerated the video why because 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.870
 that in fact he has two negative points 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.309
 there is no very slow try 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.629
 so what is the purpose of the video 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.250
 it was actually to tell you that this 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.629
 kind of things that exists 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.190
 we're hoping there will be future bets 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.739
 up to date to just have some 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.629
 very fluid thing so let's do 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.699
 a little comparison by going on the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.500
 same website but on the pc because 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.379
 yes we can play the game boy 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.270
 color via the pc then we will select 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.350
 at stake me I advocate the same fangs two 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.180
 to show the difference 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.530
 so I did not speed up the video 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.750
 as you can see we are al 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.330
 so already positive and second point 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.350
 positive it is very fluid 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.770
 it's like having the game boy 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.689
 color with us then to play how 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.580
 we do then you have of course the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.020
 keyboard keys 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.880
 just at the bottom of the video you are told 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.659
 explains that she touches represents 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.659
 that she then touches 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.360
 lower because I can enter canvas 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.430
 and board we can go upstairs it's 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.090
 as before except that it is much more 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.770
 quick 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.630
 now that the video is finished I you 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.630
 empowers to play the gameboy go to the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.070
