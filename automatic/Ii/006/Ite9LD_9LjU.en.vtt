on<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.110> calmer<00:00:13.590> side<00:00:13.830> there's<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.580> breeze

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
on the calmer side there's a breeze

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.849 
on the calmer side there's a breeze
blowing<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.360> here<00:00:15.570> but<00:00:15.719> there's<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.320> flat<00:00:16.619> point

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
blowing in here but there's a flat point

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.310 
blowing in here but there's a flat point
you<00:00:17.789> know<00:00:17.940> here<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:18.480> got<00:00:18.600> some<00:00:18.750> good<00:00:18.900> Cedars

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
you know here it's got some good Cedars

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.230 
you know here it's got some good Cedars
and<00:00:19.350> stuff<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> lake<00:00:20.580> seven<00:00:20.939> foot<00:00:21.090> low

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
and stuff on it the lake seven foot low

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.840 
and stuff on it the lake seven foot low
so<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.720> really<00:00:22.080> learn<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.350> lot<00:00:22.640> about<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
so you can really learn a lot about the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.400 
so you can really learn a lot about the
lake<00:00:24.029> right<00:00:24.269> now<00:00:24.449> because<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.080> see<00:00:25.260> all

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
lake right now because you can see all

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.570 
lake right now because you can see all
these<00:00:25.560> trees<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:26.039> normally<00:00:26.400> would<00:00:26.550> be

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
these trees that normally would be

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.740 
these trees that normally would be
completely<00:00:27.029> underwater

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
completely underwater

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.400 
completely underwater
so<00:00:29.150> I'm<00:00:30.150> trying<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.599> fish<00:00:31.050> some<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.349> these

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
so I'm trying to fish some of these

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.410 
so I'm trying to fish some of these
transition<00:00:32.040> banks<00:00:32.430> close<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.969> these<00:00:33.149> flatter

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
transition banks close to these flatter

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.870 
transition banks close to these flatter
areas<00:00:33.899> like<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.710> catch<00:00:35.340> some<00:00:35.520> fish<00:00:35.550> you

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
areas like this and catch some fish you

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.920 
areas like this and catch some fish you
know<00:00:36.000> normally<00:00:37.670> on<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.790> day<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.059> today<00:00:39.270> what

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
know normally on a day like today what

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.540 
know normally on a day like today what
you'd<00:00:40.079> want<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.469> doing<00:00:40.710> at<00:00:40.829> Table<00:00:41.160> Rock<00:00:41.309> is

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
you'd want to be doing at Table Rock is

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.580 
you'd want to be doing at Table Rock is
we<00:00:41.730> got<00:00:41.910> good<00:00:42.149> wind<00:00:42.390> there's<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:43.020> many<00:00:43.320> clouds

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
we got good wind there's not many clouds

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.889 
we got good wind there's not many clouds
but<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.550> got<00:00:44.730> good<00:00:44.910> wind<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.420> what<00:00:45.539> wind<00:00:45.719> does

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
but you got good wind and what wind does

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.630 
but you got good wind and what wind does
is<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.170> cuts<00:00:46.350> down<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.590> light<00:00:46.860> penetration<00:00:47.489> in

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
is it cuts down the light penetration in

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.580 
is it cuts down the light penetration in
the<00:00:47.670> water<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.270> that's<00:00:48.809> where<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.500> know

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
the water and that's where you know

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.350 
the water and that's where you know
throwing<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.070> spinnerbait<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:51.210> it's

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
throwing a spinnerbait you know it's

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.720 
throwing a spinnerbait you know it's
early<00:00:51.690> fall<00:00:51.980> throwing<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.070> spinner<00:00:53.309> bait<00:00:53.520> down

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
early fall throwing a spinner bait down

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.520 
early fall throwing a spinner bait down
some<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.090> these<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.570> know<00:00:54.690> steeper<00:00:55.199> banks

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
some of these you know steeper banks

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.110 
some of these you know steeper banks
especially<00:00:55.739> they<00:00:56.190> got<00:00:56.370> some<00:00:56.579> timber<00:00:56.940> and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
especially they got some timber and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.630 
especially they got some timber and
trees<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.660> them<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.739> dynamite<00:00:59.190> it's

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
trees on them can be just dynamite it's

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.400 
trees on them can be just dynamite it's
just<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.879> little<00:01:00.090> bit<00:01:00.270> too<00:01:00.449> flat<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:01.050> for<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
just a little bit too flat here for it

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.930 
just a little bit too flat here for it
so<00:01:01.590> I'm<00:01:01.770> going<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.010> I'm<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> do<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> little

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
so I'm going to I'm going to do a little

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.100 
so I'm going to I'm going to do a little
bit<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.090> cranking<00:01:03.539> down<00:01:03.690> through<00:01:03.960> here

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
bit of cranking down through here

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.690 
bit of cranking down through here
especially<00:01:04.530> around<00:01:04.589> all<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.129> timber<00:01:05.519> right

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
especially around all this timber right

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.370 
especially around all this timber right
here<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.150> as<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:06.840> into<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> wind<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
here and as we get into the wind a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.750 
here and as we get into the wind a
little<00:01:07.409> more<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:07.950> I'm<00:01:08.130> definitely<00:01:08.580> going<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
little more I'm I'm definitely going to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.100 
little more I'm I'm definitely going to
throw<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.939> spinnerbait<00:01:09.299> some<00:01:09.689> because<00:01:09.930> it's

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
throw a spinnerbait some because it's

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.590 
throw a spinnerbait some because it's
just<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.520> may<00:01:11.850> not<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.390> most

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
just you it may not be the most

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.200 
just you it may not be the most
productive<00:01:12.840> technique<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.549> catch<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.000> lot

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
productive technique but you catch a lot

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.810 
productive technique but you catch a lot
of<00:01:15.270> quality<00:01:15.869> fish<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.380> lake<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.610> fall

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
of quality fish on this lake in the fall

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.700 
of quality fish on this lake in the fall
on<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.420> spinnerbait<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.110> know<00:01:19.229> you're<00:01:19.409> fishing

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
on a spinnerbait you know you're fishing

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.460 
on a spinnerbait you know you're fishing
for<00:01:19.979> fewer<00:01:20.640> bites<00:01:20.939> but<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.140> know<00:01:22.259> that's<00:01:22.350> how

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
for fewer bites but you know that's how

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.140 
for fewer bites but you know that's how
you<00:01:22.560> catch<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> big<00:01:23.100> largemouth<00:01:23.640> those<00:01:23.909> big

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you catch the big largemouth those big

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.880 
you catch the big largemouth those big
spots<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.840> stuff<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.439> too<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.799> are

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
spots and stuff like that too that are

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.940 
spots and stuff like that too that are
suspended<00:01:26.310> out<00:01:26.580> off<00:01:26.759> these<00:01:26.970> points<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:28.140> we're

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
suspended out off these points so we're

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.810 
suspended out off these points so we're
going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> give<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.310> run<00:01:33.770> well<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.520> lot

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
going to give it run well you know a lot

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.399 
going to give it run well you know a lot
of<00:01:35.939> people<00:01:36.150> think<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.509> wind<00:01:36.689> pushes<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
of people think that wind pushes the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.020 
of people think that wind pushes the
baitfish<00:01:37.590> around<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.579> really<00:01:38.759> doesn't

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
baitfish around and it really doesn't

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.020 
baitfish around and it really doesn't
but<00:01:39.299> what<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.900> wind<00:01:40.110> does<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:41.700> moves<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
but what the wind does is it moves the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.789 
but what the wind does is it moves the
plankton<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.659> that's<00:01:43.110> what<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> bait<00:01:43.560> fish

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
plankton and that's what the bait fish

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.069 
plankton and that's what the bait fish
feed<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.880> know<00:01:44.970> they<00:01:45.119> trust<00:01:45.930> me<00:01:46.049> a

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
feed on and you know they trust me a

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.690 
feed on and you know they trust me a
school<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.560> shad<00:01:46.740> or<00:01:46.770> school<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.280> bait<00:01:47.520> can

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
school of shad or school of bait can

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.090 
school of shad or school of bait can
swim<00:01:47.939> against<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.390> strongest<00:01:49.049> wind<00:01:49.649> current

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
swim against the strongest wind current

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.580 
swim against the strongest wind current
no<00:01:51.000> problem<00:01:51.360> at<00:01:51.420> all<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.470> not

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
no problem at all so it's it's not

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.760 
no problem at all so it's it's not
moving<00:01:52.979> them<00:01:53.220> around<00:01:53.360> but<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:55.350> does<00:01:55.530> create

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
moving them around but it does create

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.139 
moving them around but it does create
current<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> does<00:01:56.640> give<00:01:56.850> everything

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
current and it does give everything

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.060 
current and it does give everything
active<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.990> that's<00:01:58.409> what<00:01:58.560> those<00:01:58.680> fish<00:01:58.950> will

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
active and that's what those fish will

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.660 
active and that's what those fish will
use<00:01:59.570> as<00:02:00.570> an<00:02:01.259> area<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.619> set<00:02:01.860> up<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.310> wait<00:02:02.460> for

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
use as an area to set up and wait for

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.280 
use as an area to set up and wait for
these<00:02:02.790> pods<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.270> bait<00:02:03.390> fish<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.780> pass<00:02:03.960> through

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
these pods of bait fish to pass through

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.660 
these pods of bait fish to pass through
so<00:02:04.590> yeah<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.310> mean<00:02:05.579> if<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.780> really<00:02:07.290> had<00:02:07.530> my<00:02:08.369> choice

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
so yeah I mean if I really had my choice

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.609 
so yeah I mean if I really had my choice
I'd<00:02:09.030> be<00:02:09.270> I'm<00:02:09.539> gonna<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.259> side<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
I'd be I'm gonna be on the side of the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.320 
I'd be I'm gonna be on the side of the
lake<00:02:10.800> here<00:02:11.069> at<00:02:11.160> Table<00:02:11.520> Rock<00:02:11.550> that's<00:02:11.940> got<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
lake here at Table Rock that's got the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.800 
lake here at Table Rock that's got the
strongest

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
strongest

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.590 
strongest
when<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.470> biggest<00:02:15.220> waves<00:02:15.459> crashing<00:02:16.180> into<00:02:16.450> it

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
when the biggest waves crashing into it

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.350 
when the biggest waves crashing into it
because<00:02:16.780> even<00:02:17.740> there<00:02:18.280> it's<00:02:18.550> never<00:02:18.819> muddy<00:02:19.180> in

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
because even there it's never muddy in

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.620 
because even there it's never muddy in
the<00:02:19.450> water<00:02:19.690> up<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.490> more<00:02:21.819> wave<00:02:22.150> action

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
the water up and the more wave action

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.270 
the water up and the more wave action
you<00:02:22.750> have<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.200> more<00:02:23.380> light<00:02:23.560> penetration<00:02:24.040> it's

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
you have the more light penetration it's

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.650 
you have the more light penetration it's
going<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.520> cut<00:02:24.670> down<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.060> more<00:02:25.240> current<00:02:25.569> it's

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
going to cut down the more current it's

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.630 
going to cut down the more current it's
going<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.870> create<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:26.980> know<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.220> longer

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
going to create the you know the longer

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.090 
going to create the you know the longer
the<00:02:27.790> span<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.600> wind<00:02:28.810> blows<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.890> better

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
the span that that wind blows the better

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.770 
the span that that wind blows the better
the<00:02:30.310> chance<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.060> then<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.330> just<00:02:31.510> got<00:02:31.690> to

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
the chance and and then you just got to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.120 
the chance and and then you just got to
find<00:02:31.900> where<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.200> wind<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.500> blowing<00:02:32.560> on<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
find where the wind is blowing on the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.979 
find where the wind is blowing on the
right<00:02:33.310> kind<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.640> bank<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:34.330> holds<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.780> fish

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
right kind of bank that holds the fish

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.360 
right kind of bank that holds the fish
because<00:02:35.260> they're<00:02:35.500> not<00:02:35.620> just<00:02:35.860> everywhere<00:02:36.310> I

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
because they're not just everywhere I

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.910 
because they're not just everywhere I
mean<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:37.239> look<00:02:37.420> around<00:02:37.690> here<00:02:37.810> Table<00:02:38.290> Rock<00:02:38.470> and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
mean you look around here Table Rock and

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.740 
mean you look around here Table Rock and
it<00:02:39.370> looks<00:02:39.489> like<00:02:39.640> everything<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.150> rocky<00:02:40.360> Bank

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
it looks like everything is a rocky Bank

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.990 
it looks like everything is a rocky Bank
but<00:02:41.050> you<00:02:41.680> know<00:02:41.800> someone<00:02:42.160> have<00:02:42.280> gravel<00:02:42.760> some

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
but you know someone have gravel some

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.699 
but you know someone have gravel some
have<00:02:43.150> chunk<00:02:43.450> rock<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.170> biggest<00:02:44.500> thing

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
have chunk rock and the biggest thing

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.259 
have chunk rock and the biggest thing
here<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.489> is<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:46.060> look<00:02:46.360> for<00:02:48.060> variations<00:02:49.060> where

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
here is is you look for variations where

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.670 
here is is you look for variations where
you<00:02:49.330> have<00:02:49.510> two<00:02:49.690> different<00:02:49.870> types<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.470> Bank

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
you have two different types of Bank

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.050 
you have two different types of Bank
that<00:02:50.860> come<00:02:51.070> together<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.670> know<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:51.790> have<00:02:52.030> a

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
that come together you know you have a

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.570 
that come together you know you have a
transition<00:02:52.630> where<00:02:52.930> gravel<00:02:53.830> meets<00:02:54.040> chunk<00:02:54.370> rock

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
transition where gravel meets chunk rock

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.790 
transition where gravel meets chunk rock
or<00:02:54.790> chunk<00:02:55.030> rock<00:02:55.239> meets<00:02:55.480> ledge<00:02:55.870> rock<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.620> or

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
or chunk rock meets ledge rock and or

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.130 
or chunk rock meets ledge rock and or
where<00:02:57.370> there's<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.610> elevation<00:02:58.600> change<00:02:58.930> you

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
where there's a elevation change you

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.680 
where there's a elevation change you
know<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.380> goes<00:02:59.590> from<00:02:59.830> you<00:03:00.430> know<00:03:00.550> a<00:03:00.580> 30<00:03:01.269> or<00:03:01.360> 45

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
know it goes from you know a 30 or 45

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.050 
know it goes from you know a 30 or 45
degree<00:03:02.260> down<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:02.739> 15<00:03:03.130> degree<00:03:03.280> Bank<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.910> mean

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
degree down to a 15 degree Bank you mean

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.540 
degree down to a 15 degree Bank you mean
bottom<00:03:04.750> contour<00:03:05.350> changes<00:03:06.069> and<00:03:06.280> bottom

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
bottom contour changes and bottom

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.850 
bottom contour changes and bottom
composition<00:03:07.180> changes<00:03:07.660> are<00:03:07.870> really<00:03:08.470> what

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
composition changes are really what

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.460 
composition changes are really what
these<00:03:09.190> Highland<00:03:09.670> reservoir<00:03:09.930> baths<00:03:10.930> and

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
these Highland reservoir baths and

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.110 
these Highland reservoir baths and
places<00:03:11.860> like<00:03:11.890> Table<00:03:12.400> Rock<00:03:12.580> Lake<00:03:12.610> of<00:03:13.090> the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
places like Table Rock Lake of the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.190 
places like Table Rock Lake of the
Ozarks<00:03:13.530> Bull<00:03:14.530> Shoals<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:16.180> know<00:03:16.300> Beaver<00:03:17.019> Lake

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
Ozarks Bull Shoals you know Beaver Lake

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.920 
Ozarks Bull Shoals you know Beaver Lake
yeah<00:03:18.100> all<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.760> know<00:03:18.880> these<00:03:19.060> are<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.570> kind

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
yeah all you know these are the the kind

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.990 
yeah all you know these are the the kind
of<00:03:19.989> things<00:03:20.049> that<00:03:20.260> you<00:03:20.440> look<00:03:20.560> for<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:21.160> know<00:03:21.310> the
