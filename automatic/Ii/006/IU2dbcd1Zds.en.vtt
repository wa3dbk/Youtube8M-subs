00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.930
 it is the test the prototype santos 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:12.859
 the publications robert c 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.779
 when santos 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.529
 are wrong 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.909
 this is a he the first first single March 3 delta lloyd 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:21.860
 a 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.300
 and the belt drive that comes from the firm cakes in america 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.269
 and it's none 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.289
 the freeze to 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.759
 no senna really runs team drive with artists 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.650
 gears with 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.980
 squirrel in the ring 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.750
 can't slip through that either 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.760
 one big advantage 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.579
 no maintenance 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.579
 no fool no more smear just good driving 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.660
 but it means at the end of it 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.650
 look into the building 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.570
 the I think so 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.920
 in combination with the acceleration agenda, in particular the takeover 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.079
 At the meal 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.000
 it could mean the end of the chains known actually has no 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:01.520
 advantages over more of the belt 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.950
 ow wait a minute this system is therefore only the combination with 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.900
 after appearance 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.220
 indeed you can only use it on so-called I still see speed drive 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.240
 the means a leaf before a leaf behind so only after gears 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.620
 Rome or something else 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.700
 the head hangs when i have a pair 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.100
 and 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.659
 yes if you go with the great dating sites on black 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.160
 has this bike 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.969
 nine off 8 9 kilos 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.250
 just under 10 kilometers left after with belt drive 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.420
 and 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.409
 the operation speeches but if you compare it with the traditional one 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:37.320
 institution 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.330
 uncertain cell is at most just under the kilo 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.310
 but I don't think you should buy 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.460
 truus difference it is all about low maintenance and a lot 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.270
 cycling pleasure 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.610
 nice he gets through the mud in the Netherlands over the line 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.360
 most of the time 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.219
 and as a year, low maintenance 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.590
 we can always drive 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.790
 and how many miles 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.800
 so then that is not bad that he 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.800
 hit the chain a little heavier 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.969
 the string is there and the belt is lighter than a chain 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:14.919
 the index the 76 disaster GM and chains about 230 euros 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:19.849
 the whole reason surprising is 20 points 200 grams lighter than a it 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.239
 traditional single speed to the rich 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.839
 the frieze difference with one 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.349
 the sewerage charge 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.689
 both continents are simply talking about what they weigh against manolev 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.949
 compared to xd for example I also send 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:36.319
 it can be trendy in the overview 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.839
 he naturally needs a special champion 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:40.319
 vuelta 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.049
 yes it's his nose 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.319
 10 12 mm wide gears 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.339
 and 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:49.189
 special to the advice that they have it 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:50.750
 free and including lace 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.729
 any sheet that would remain on the belt while driving 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.069
 it stands out between 10 and the top 10 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.989
 is therefore expressed 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.439
 if you actually hardly bother with plates 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.620
 when we can test that i did i didn't bother 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.199
 safety the one has picked up 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:13.799
 in comparison with other riders of brook at the time, it did have problems 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.109
 had with often because the occupants for hypervisors seriously bid on course 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.129
 how long the gaza strip 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.399
 sorry but i expected 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:24.910
 in the auditorium the tests that have been going on for years 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.920
 free with three times longer than a chain between two years 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:30.859
 and 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.819
 it is also important to state that the chain's vision decreases as the chain develops 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:35.790
 That 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.989
 it goes sometimes it seems 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.870
 heidi critics of the government 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.299
 stays the same 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.469
 mdp if state 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.379
 dur old resistance 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.630
 one of them is that of the belt associated with a chain 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.169
 is on the same level 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.169
 and then it is also not the case that the chain is tested 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.699
 to stay in the straight path that is primarily focused on 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:59.899
 but 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:01.029
 if you then have your time 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.719
 at that bank that its so missing 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:05.219
 with it 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:09.769
 the jongerius fishermen so there is much stronger than your power on the pedals 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.379
 to be able to get 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.079
 I once did such a test with a tank with 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.399
 what counted I came in peak load at one and a half wk 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.040
 the 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.550
 the same belt that sits on it then a slightly wider version is used to 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.770
 architecture on engines with maybe engines up to 100 hp 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.909
 so count on you not afraid of terrain 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:33.139
 And he also can't end because that would be the question that asked if it is running 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:33.900
 you by not wondering 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.409
 this team is not flexible on the side 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.069
 you have a guide on the outside 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.559
 like pipe on the inside 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:44.860
 everything for a back teeth how perfect from sound and on each other 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.460
 I cannot end the other 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.659
 marechal 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.270
 that it is fairly accurately determined to deliver 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.320
 ard kleijer babysitting the record stood exactly parallel street one evening 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.319
 each other to write down that there is still demolition 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.289
 but if I hear it that way 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.900
 I actually don't think I have the March figure 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.470
 this system again theoretically would only be a practical problem 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.680
 and you only notice that when you continue to assemble it 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.180
 that a chain always goes through yachts before it goes 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.539
 so you have to be able to make your training run a bit 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:16.699
 can share 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.300
 and otherwise your friends won't get through 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.990
 because you wouldn't break 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.219
 exact one-piece display cases 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:26.469
 The basic material of the risk associated council that is endless hears continuously 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:30.360
 guns colt that also makes sure that is strong yes but you can get into it 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.670
 those parts you buy a different lengths 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.919
 it is for sale in different lengths 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.610
 we have a small piece 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.460
 emmen 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.910
 made removable in the frame 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.370
 such that it came out and drink in this 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.150
 at the moment this sees mounted and you get hit by the ground and 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.159
 a high order comes into effect 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:49.889
 will be due to the special shape 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.469
 grow stronger in those areas 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.439
 and with that and 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:55.910
 kind of weird 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.129
 obviously well suited to report at times 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.129
 even though you can share it 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.139
 ticket sales 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.969
 not yet soon it will be the first year 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:09.800
 bicycles 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.259
 the first months at the center and threats at the start of the second quarter 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:14.080
 April 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.080
 come to the market perhaps turn police 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:18.810
 this is really necessary 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:19.860
 really a prototype 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.030
 this is really a prototype is also the first model we have left 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.830
 to make 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.750
 and that is also the reason to ride peso mountains because I really wanted to do it myself 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.210
 know what is that belt ball is doing 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.569
 captain in the past four months 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:37.289
 commuting and every week the weekend and about the race or a tour 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:38.460
 and so too now she says 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.360
 feel good yourself 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.370
 and can test whether team is suitable for making good man in the Netherlands 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.169
 can begin 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:49.830
 very very good very very good so good that I've been a club the last two months 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.839
 matches 

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:52.990
 that I rode on this bike was driven 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.169
 those were 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:57.169
 what can be worked on 

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:58.039
 6
