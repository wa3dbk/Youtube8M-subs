00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.350
 so we soaked mushrooms day they 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.920
 stood changing water during this time 2 times 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.009
 that is, I night soaked last night 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.680
 they stood now here evening i have them 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.270
 washed three times during this period 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.100
 I will wash them again now 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:27.050
 put in the pan 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.050
 big and I will cook for 30 minutes 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.140
 put our mushrooms on the stove bye 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.340
 nothing boiled well 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.600
 turned out by volume 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.570
 mushroom was two kilograms built on 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.770
 5 liters that is a little bit of course here 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.329
 cramped so repeat the recipe 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:53.070
 we take my mushrooms clean them from dirt 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:58.469
 cut out some fraught draft places 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.149
 and soaked at a small press that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.460
 there is no need to press them directly 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.470
 we fill with water we put so small 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.530
 attack they are just outdoor or 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:13.220
 swam out and leave for the day someone 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.540
 rather not even someone basically doing 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.450
 here it is soaking for three days 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.240
 permanent 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.180
 water but I somehow do not really like this 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.299
 here is too some kind of fussy such 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.979
 event 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.530
 especially 5 bitterness which remains 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.210
 small after soaking for me 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.729
 even like that is so peculiar 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.659
 in since the clubs now we wait 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.500
 when not boil 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.200
 wait for 30 minutes pull them cool 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.850
 through the colander that is this year 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.299
 cool and saline everything here 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.490
 worth bucket if anyone wants 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.770
 tell me what operation I'm alone 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.659
 if at all I understand that in such 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.000
 a tyrannical dish costs once 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.310
 something to overheat it is straight 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.380
 fry they are not even too strong 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.099
 burn and just fry overdo 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.829
 without water, then there are some products 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:11.920
 with time, of course, it all starts too 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:16.440
 stick so there is nothing like that 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.599
 flawless such dishes and durable 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:25.569
 water a little add salt to the water was 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:28.959
 slightly salty and cook 30 minutes, you can 15 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.959
 30 minutes is possible on your principle 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:36.420
 discretion as far as all tough mushrooms 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:39.810
 also depends that is from 15 to 30 minutes 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.670
 Here is such a thing periodically I 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.840
 chasing as though external mushrooms 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.180
 top top so that down fire 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.519
 average 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.620
 this time the mushrooms were bought very successfully 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.900
 the struggle didn't come out to hi leading us 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.400
 high and never 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.180
 here if you go and cut you need to take 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.599
 the car 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.629
 formerly far Moscow when they all lived there 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.629
 Side by side and all the forests of Muskogee 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:20.060
 How to move too, I'll start again refunded 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:22.670
 bypass the law on the clock on boiled somewhere 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:27.680
 10 minutes is necessary so that from the beginning of boiling 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:31.519
 minutes 20 past hard now they 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.720
 I boil the salt water I throw off the colander and 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:38.810
 I will wait until the local this cherry plum 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:43.220
 heart shape casserole but get 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.530
 some pupyrke and normal hearts 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.200
 casserole 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:55.129
 the mold of which your not for sale all 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:57.640
 feed for baby and so mushrooms with lily 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:01.970
 water can be drained a little 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:06.380
 broth and for pouring after straws 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:09.170
 salting and you can basically all 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:14.260
 turning away from the drain in the same bag can be 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:17.060
 add after the mushrooms have cooled 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.109
 prepare the garlic cut it along 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.560
 a little bit of black pepper lavrushka and court 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:28.990
 pour salt every mushroom 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.990
 put the head down the number 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.160
 Mushrooms of course you can legs and more 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.020
 cut well so cut off so 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.820
 cut off so here we take every stroke 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.289
 before 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:44.710
 we fill and here it turns out we have one 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.710
 layer 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:55.830
 now pepper garlic 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.630
 a toy 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:13.449
 so each layer laid our mushrooms by 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.630
 the principle that we are their greater 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.580
 cut and put up the same 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.530
 we are doing absolutely small 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.289
 inside my mushrooms you can also 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.139
 upward they are faster for quarreling that is 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.050
 such less severe such pains already 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.090
 Here are the types that are falling apart . 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.250
 put them already up and such more 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.900
 tighter more elastic medium size 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:41.880
 better put down put the oppression I'll leave 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:45.389
 in the form of a pot of water and in the fridge 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:49.360
 we will try in 5 days 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:51.419
 We look to the water a little bit straight 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.090
 walked from the edges 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.919
 if you still have a mushroom broth 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.220
 You can dilute them here if you poured 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:05.169
 Broth forgotten let's say a little bit 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:08.620
 add water and so just 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:12.099
 Supplement once he did not pass 5 days not 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:15.820
 stood it today sunday and decided 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:23.310
 today to eat mushrooms that is 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:28.780
 passed means four days are ready 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:30.539
 no no bitterness at all crispy on 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:34.270
 consistency 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:36.669
 more often with mushrooms and do with sour cream with 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:40.169
 the bow will unite so through 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:43.560
 four days we can already eat them 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.560
 enjoy your meal
