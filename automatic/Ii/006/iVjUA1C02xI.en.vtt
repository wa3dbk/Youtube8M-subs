00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.099
 usually travel with each other and all 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.289
 days at which point he travels next 45 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.570
 minutes could be going down between 10 and 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.849
 15 minutes would improve the quality of 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.699
 you are much better and for me 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.059
 it's good enough because it's going to be 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:39.030
 streamline less people more if it would be 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.220
 It would not take 40 minutes to kick in here 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.699
 the electrification of the train says the rock 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.589
 would be going down between 10 and 15 minutes the 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.720
 time slot between train and train that 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.910
 see positive of course wonderful 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.219
 for people have meet this schedule 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.879
 the train that is a very effective medium 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.710
 as long as it works not but 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.289
 sometimes they were canceled on trains and what do I know? 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.879
 me and what not what broke that and then 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.170
 Catastrophes come and well I think 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.509
 which is something where you have to invest 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.060
 improve is very good the truth as 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:12.440
 well because people work very badly in 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.330
 these moments but I see it very well 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.210
 spectacular if it's like that is a dream with 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.770
 the sun gives for the whole south area is already 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.870
 listen in between lord of three 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.330
 practice what it does 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.340
 work at home work how 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.340
 is the train usually as now 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.020
 Regarding electrification, it would 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.780
 well this branch what do you think the thing 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.730
 it would be the best every time he said 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.160
 you that would be a dream think that makes 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.350
 a lot that people expect 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.240
 the co -worker all that yes 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.680
 you know lots of times could be 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.760
 going down between 10 and 15 minutes 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.740
 Time frequency as seen 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.830
 spectacular 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.530
 the station arrives from 3 what 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.480
 Many times you have to wait 30 or 40 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.970
 minutes an hour for cancer a 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.620
 consell an honorary train in this 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.210
 station with the new formations and 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.220
 with electrification could lower 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.190
 between 10 and 15 minutes those you the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.620
 obviously obviously benefit if 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.410
 apart train the most comfortable for many of 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.630
 us because you actually travel a lot 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.510
 better much faster than a collective 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.010
 from here quilmes you have train 15 minutes 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:29.390
 being that in a collective you have more than 45 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.390
 and more
