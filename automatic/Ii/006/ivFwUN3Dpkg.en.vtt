00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.090
 hello friends in today's video I love you 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.520
 teach how to make this type of bracelets 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.380
 that really are super nice and 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.480
 originals we can also make a great 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.650
 variety of models let's see the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.650
 material that we need 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.859
 The first thing we need is going to 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.629
 be 2 meters of trapillo you can choose 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.910
 between the great variety of colors that 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.399
 there are both prints and smooth 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.790
 we will also need a meter and a half 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.339
 of mouse queue and some accounts 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.699
 silver and we will help ourselves with a table 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:49.400
 with its tweezers a lighter a scissors and 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.989
 our silicone gun and now already 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.989
 let's see how to do it 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.140
 The first thing we have done has been 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.559
 fold two strips of glue in half 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.890
 mouse of 80 centimeters each and the 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.290
 we place with the tweezers on the table and 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.990
 Now we start to knit the trapillo to the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.240
 tail of the mouse for it we went through 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.260
 the school of mouse one above and another 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.050
 under 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.630
 and we leave a short end and with the 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.370
 long end we keep growing what 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.050
 same as we did when we threw the 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.050
 bracelet with the loom of join 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.230
 Although it is tight, I 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.020
 What I do is help me with pliers and 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.810
 I'm going to push everything up and I'm still 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.870
 passing the trapillo by the mouse tail 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.300
 skipping one above another below 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.770
 one above and one below and 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.770
 I struggle with the inhabitants 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.210
 do the same again to your below 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.510
 of the mouse tail above a 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.510
 correntino 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.840
 and when I have trouble expensive jurisdiction 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.670
 and now we will have to continue doing 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.560
 domain of the time until getting the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.560
 length of the bracelet we want 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.459
 As you can see, it's very easy to do and 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.720
 It's really entertaining , you see 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.450
 how is it going 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.880
 and I keep doing the same thing 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.210
 trapillo for centuries that formed with 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.950
 the mouse queue sauteed first by 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.040
 up and then down or up 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.350
 then down and so on all the time 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.590
 the important thing is to then squeeze it 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.590
 all right 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.390
 since we already have the length that we want 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.940
 we can release the bracelet from the table 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.790
 and from the back I do what I do 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.220
 is to tighten the trapillo and paste the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.370
 end with a little bit of silicone 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.370
 hot 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.610
 and on balls and none and now I squeeze 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.650
 well and placed in trapillo to be able 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.720
 cut what's left over 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.200
 and at the other end I'm going to do what 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.569
 same 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.569
 I tighten well to leave the ring free 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.260
 applied some hot silicone 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.010
 and I have the trapillo 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.630
 so stretching the fabric well and I can 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.630
 cut the piece that I made sure 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.370
 and now what I simply have left is 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.290
 make the closure we have left a hole 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.049
 that will help us to pass the 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.010
 ends of the mouse tail and so gives the 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.010
 world bracelet 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.110
 so it would be closed and now what 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.080
 I do is place some balls in the 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.970
 ends to make it more beautiful 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.069
 to put the balls what I do is 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.370
 burn the tail tapes a bit 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:42.090
 mouse and I can now run the accounts one 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.090
 at each end 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.360
 and now at a distance that we like 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.150
 we make a knot all more or less 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.800
 the same distance and we can already cut 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.800
 the ends and burn them 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:26.809
 I have done the same in both 

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:29.209
 extremes and look we would have ready the 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:32.269
 bracelet the truth that you want precious is 

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:33.799
 very easy in addition to putting and removing and its 

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:36.799
 mind towards the beginning we can 

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:39.679
 do in a variety of models already 

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:41.829
 you see that it looks very pretty for this 

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:41.829
 summer 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.000
 note that original so nothing else 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.230
