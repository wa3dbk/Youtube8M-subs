some<00:02:32.780> mention<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.349> might<00:02:33.530> not<00:02:33.650> be<00:02:33.829> online<00:02:33.980> but

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
some mention I might not be online but

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.690 
some mention I might not be online but
when<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.640> check<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.239> was<00:02:35.390> online<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.519> guys
