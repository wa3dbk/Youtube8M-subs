which<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.670> right<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.269> basically<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
which is this right here basically a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.890 
which is this right here basically a
steel<00:00:28.560> ball<00:00:28.800> bearing<00:00:29.220> inside<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.150> polymer
