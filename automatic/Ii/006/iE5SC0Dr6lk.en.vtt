Christmas one open I do next to see
there<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:26.720> said<00:02:26.930> something<00:02:27.200> about<00:02:27.290> ten

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
there it said something about ten

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.059 
there it said something about ten
megabytes<00:02:27.980> if<00:02:28.850> your<00:02:29.390> file<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:29.989> over<00:02:30.709> 10

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
megabytes if your file is over 10

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:37.300 
megabytes if your file is over 10
megabytes<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:35.300> will<00:02:35.630> have<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.350> break<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.160> up

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
megabytes you will have to break it up

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.949 
megabytes you will have to break it up
so<00:02:38.300> if<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.510> have<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.660> lot<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:39.010> friends<00:02:40.959> then

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.290 
so if you have a lot of friends then
you'll<00:02:42.170> have<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:42.530> do<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.709> over<00:02:42.890> again<00:02:43.069> and

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
you'll have to do it over again and

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.900 
you'll have to do it over again and
