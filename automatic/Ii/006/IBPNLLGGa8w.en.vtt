00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello my dear, I do not know 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.620
 why i can see so well i hope 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.450
 yes yes I am somewhere else we 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.190
 maybe i can see in mine 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.290
 new apartment and I thought I would take 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.730
 very short with ryan respectively 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.070
 had been back a while before 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.140
 blog and say something like that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.180
 can you run with me and yes I am 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.490
 just something in Umzugsstress times the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.990
 Exams are over now and now 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.330
 I still have a few days off and vacation 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.070
 then it goes on relatively quickly 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.800
 right now, I'm the first one 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.410
 time to cook here and yes so it 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.059
 everything looks very sporadic like 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.239
 you can see are still around a lot 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.530
 and a lot of garbage and so far that it 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.320
 definitely has to do a lot 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.850
 and that's why I have at the moment 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.820
 also not quite as much time videos too 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.260
 turn and I apologize for it 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.760
 may be that i maybe now or 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.340
 rather I would like to have a two- 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.520
 make up three-week break and video 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.199
 But there may be 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.899
 a special guest on this channel is 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.969

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.040
 Just look at your understanding and look forward 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.060

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 I'm looking forward to my baby 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.240

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.130

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.869

 The hunger somehow packed me 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.600

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.340
 When building up there are these cool funds 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.650

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.820
 I was extremely expensive and I was 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.050
 actually only the bottles have because 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.550
 I find the cool one 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.020
 The industry may also be simple 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.310
 to photograph in any case was the 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.080
 I do not drink mineral water 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.390
 knew and then it has 18 euros for this 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.010
 six bottles that costs pretty much 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.270
 expensive mineral water but it really me 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.019

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:43.030
 kettle and pretty much 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.980
 far from that, that's where it comes from 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.790
 dishwasher 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.130

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.900
 what's going on here is mine 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.310
