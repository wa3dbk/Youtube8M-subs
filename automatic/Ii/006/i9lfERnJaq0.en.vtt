money 10 let's start here we have a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.650 
money 10 let's start here we have a
rectangular<00:00:25.619> shaped<00:00:26.189> box<00:00:26.519> which<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.119> very

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
rectangular shaped box which is very

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.560 
rectangular shaped box which is very
easy<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.289> wrap<00:00:28.500> first<00:00:29.429> let's<00:00:30.029> make<00:00:30.210> sure<00:00:30.269> that

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
easy to wrap first let's make sure that

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.350 
easy to wrap first let's make sure that
we<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.900> enough<00:00:31.199> wrapping<00:00:31.740> paper<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.579> so

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
we have enough wrapping paper for it so

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.660 
we have enough wrapping paper for it so
I<00:00:33.690> wrap<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> paper<00:00:34.320> around<00:00:34.530> before<00:00:35.219> cutting

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
I wrap the paper around before cutting

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.319 
I wrap the paper around before cutting
making<00:00:36.329> sure<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.930> goes<00:00:37.200> around<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.980> box

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
making sure that it goes around the box

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.229 
making sure that it goes around the box
that's<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.600> length<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.140> your<00:00:40.649> wrapping<00:00:41.070> paper

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
that's the length of your wrapping paper

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.720 
that's the length of your wrapping paper
for<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> width<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:43.140> want<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.649> pull<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.550> edge

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
for the width you want to pull the edge

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.900 
for the width you want to pull the edge
of<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> paper<00:00:45.480> up<00:00:45.809> if<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.590> rich<00:00:46.860> half<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
of the paper up if it rich half of the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.029 
of the paper up if it rich half of the
height<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> box<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.230> would<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.770> enough<00:00:50.010> for

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
height of the box it would be enough for

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.970 
height of the box it would be enough for
you<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> folds<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.420> side<00:00:51.980> first

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
you to do the folds on the side first

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.639 
you to do the folds on the side first
let's<00:00:53.699> anchor<00:00:54.270> one<00:00:54.690> side<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.289> wrapping

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
let's anchor one side of the wrapping

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.279 
let's anchor one side of the wrapping
paper<00:00:55.680> onto<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.489> box<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.719> step<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.260> can

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
paper onto the box for this step you can

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.279 
paper onto the box for this step you can
just<00:00:58.559> use<00:00:58.829> regular<00:00:58.920> scotch<00:00:59.730> tape<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
just use regular scotch tape but for the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.200 
just use regular scotch tape but for the
rest<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.859> steps<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.370> think<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:02.879> really

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
rest of the steps I think it's really

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.530 
rest of the steps I think it's really
necessary<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:04.350> use<00:01:04.619> double-sided<00:01:05.489> tape<00:01:05.790> you

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
necessary to use double-sided tape you

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.440 
necessary to use double-sided tape you
can<00:01:06.659> see<00:01:06.869> here<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.409> didn't<00:01:07.710> cut<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.100> paper

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
can see here that I didn't cut the paper

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.469 
can see here that I didn't cut the paper
straight<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:10.320> no<00:01:10.740> worry<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.909> fold

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
straight but no worry we can just fold

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.499 
straight but no worry we can just fold
it<00:01:12.720> down<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.650> straight<00:01:14.310> perfect<00:01:15.000> seam<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
it down to a straight perfect seam and

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.429 
it down to a straight perfect seam and
then<00:01:16.110> tag<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.710> down<00:01:16.920> using<00:01:17.430> double-sided<00:01:17.820> tape

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
then tag it down using double-sided tape

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.620 
then tag it down using double-sided tape
and<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.100> see<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.490> after<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.210> put

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and here you can see that after I put

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.719 
and here you can see that after I put
the<00:01:21.780> double-sided<00:01:22.350> tape<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.400> press

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
the double-sided tape on there and press

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.690 
the double-sided tape on there and press
down<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.270> everything<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.380> perfect<00:01:26.310> looking

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
down on everything it's perfect looking

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.450 
down on everything it's perfect looking
there<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.030> no<00:01:27.240> tape<00:01:27.600> showing<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.350> later<00:01:29.100> we

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
there is no tape showing and later we

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.090 
there is no tape showing and later we
can<00:01:29.579> even<00:01:29.759> cover<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> seam<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.590> everything

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
can even cover the seam so everything

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.760 
can even cover the seam so everything
else<00:01:32.250> look<00:01:32.610> perfect<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.869> I'm<00:01:34.049> making<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.500> feel

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
else look perfect here I'm making a feel

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.429 
else look perfect here I'm making a feel
fold<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.460> not<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> permanent<00:01:36.360> fold<00:01:36.600> just

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
fold this is not the permanent fold just

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.620 
fold this is not the permanent fold just
so<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.890> stand<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.400> box<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.150> work<00:01:39.390> on

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
so I can stand the box up and work on

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.230 
so I can stand the box up and work on
one<00:01:39.960> side<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.590> how<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.460> create<00:01:41.970> these

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
one side and how you create these

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.780 
one side and how you create these
perfect<00:01:42.570> crease<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.290> go<00:01:43.920> straight<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
perfect crease is go straight to the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.210 
perfect crease is go straight to the
edge<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.509> box<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.560> pull<00:01:46.979> your

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
edge of the box and then pull your

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.700 
edge of the box and then pull your
fingers<00:01:47.790> upward<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.840> create<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.380> perfect

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
fingers upward to create that perfect

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.639 
fingers upward to create that perfect
diagonal<00:01:50.670> seat<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> point<00:01:52.439> to

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
diagonal seat I think the point to

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.609 
diagonal seat I think the point to
having<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.250> perfect<00:01:53.909> looking<00:01:54.299> present<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.110> that

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
having a perfect looking present is that

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.060 
having a perfect looking present is that
you<00:01:55.829> won't<00:01:56.009> let<00:01:56.340> any<00:01:56.640> paper<00:01:57.570> edges<00:01:58.200> expose<00:01:58.770> or

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
you won't let any paper edges expose or

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.730 
you won't let any paper edges expose or
tape<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.869> that's<00:02:01.350> what<00:02:01.530> we're<00:02:01.710> doing<00:02:02.009> here

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
tape so that's what we're doing here
