this summer the new one is supposed to

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.310 
this summer the new one is supposed to

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
come out but anyway um another concern

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.830 
come out but anyway um another concern
is<00:02:46.620> if<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.460> interferes<00:02:47.790> with<00:02:48.210> signal<00:02:48.630> and

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
is if it interferes with signal and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.650 
is if it interferes with signal and
thank<00:02:49.170> goodness<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.770> doesn't<00:02:50.250> um<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:51.180> has<00:02:51.420> i

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
thank goodness this doesn't um it has i

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.450 
thank goodness this doesn't um it has i
mean<00:02:51.690> i<00:02:51.870> haven't<00:02:52.170> had<00:02:52.380> any<00:02:52.560> drop<00:02:52.800> calls<00:02:53.100> or

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
mean i haven't had any drop calls or

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.550 
mean i haven't had any drop calls or
anything<00:02:53.610> like<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.540> only<00:02:54.870> con<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.470> i

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
anything like that the only con that i

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.580 
anything like that the only con that i
find<00:02:55.830> every<00:02:56.700> button<00:02:57.240> is<00:02:57.540> really<00:02:57.900> easy<00:02:58.110> to

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
find every button is really easy to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.710 
find every button is really easy to
access<00:02:59.100> but<00:02:59.580> i<00:02:59.610> think<00:03:00.000> this<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.270> not<00:03:00.420> just

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
access but i think this is not just

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.840 
access but i think this is not just
specific<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.440> phone<00:03:01.710> but<00:03:02.160> any<00:03:02.370> phone

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
specific to this phone but any phone

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.400 
specific to this phone but any phone
case<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:04.310> sticks<00:03:05.310> out<00:03:05.460> here<00:03:05.940> on

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
case that sticks out here on

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.900 
case that sticks out here on
horizontally<00:03:07.410> if<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.590> can<00:03:07.770> see<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:08.760> gonna

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
horizontally if you can see it's gonna

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.050 
horizontally if you can see it's gonna
be<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> little<00:03:09.540> bit<00:03:09.780> harder<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.640> type<00:03:11.640> that

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
be a little bit harder to type that

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.870 
be a little bit harder to type that
letter<00:03:12.960> like<00:03:13.350> if<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.770> wanted<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.310> type<00:03:14.460> of<00:03:14.640> p

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
letter like if you wanted to type of p

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.570 
letter like if you wanted to type of p
or<00:03:15.180> something<00:03:15.480> like<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.630> at<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.590> edge<00:03:16.800> but<00:03:17.520> I

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
or something like that at the edge but I

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.610 
or something like that at the edge but I
mean<00:03:17.820> you'll<00:03:18.060> just<00:03:18.270> have<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.570> use<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:19.290> side<00:03:19.590> of

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
mean you'll just have to use the side of

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.070 
mean you'll just have to use the side of
your<00:03:19.860> finger<00:03:20.280> but<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:21.150> know<00:03:21.300> what<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.450> mean<00:03:21.600> you

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
your finger but you know what I mean you

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.650 
your finger but you know what I mean you
just<00:03:22.290> can't<00:03:22.350> do<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.190> but<00:03:23.940> it's<00:03:24.120> not<00:03:24.300> really<00:03:24.540> a

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
just can't do that but it's not really a

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.780 
just can't do that but it's not really a
big<00:03:24.750> deal<00:03:24.959> but<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.280> something<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.610> I

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
big deal but it is something that I

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.030 
big deal but it is something that I
wanted<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.330> mention<00:03:27.690> because<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:28.920> know

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
wanted to mention because it you know

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.270 
wanted to mention because it you know
it's<00:03:29.610> three-dimensional<00:03:30.650> but<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.890> just<00:03:32.100> love

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
it's three-dimensional but I just love

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.120 
it's three-dimensional but I just love
that<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.640> is<00:03:32.670> 3d<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.570> know<00:03:33.690> how<00:03:33.840> 3d<00:03:34.650> nail<00:03:34.890> art

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.860 
another concern is how it feels in my
hands<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.250> also<00:03:41.730> how<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.060> feels<00:03:42.270> on<00:03:42.480> my<00:03:42.540> ears

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
hands and also how it feels on my ears

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.780 
hands and also how it feels on my ears
and<00:03:43.140> at<00:03:43.440> first<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.770> was<00:03:43.890> worried<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.250> this

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
and at first I was worried that this

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.540 
and at first I was worried that this
part<00:03:45.150> would<00:03:45.360> hurt<00:03:45.810> but<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.890> doesn't<00:03:47.310> hurt<00:03:47.400> at

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
part would hurt but it doesn't hurt at

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.390 
part would hurt but it doesn't hurt at
all<00:03:47.640> it's<00:03:47.970> um<00:03:48.270> durable<00:03:49.050> plastic<00:03:49.800> I<00:03:49.980> think<00:03:50.010> or

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
all it's um durable plastic I think or

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.470 
all it's um durable plastic I think or
maybe<00:03:50.430> it's<00:03:50.730> acrylic<00:03:51.380> maybe<00:03:52.380> it's<00:03:52.620> acrylic

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
maybe it's acrylic maybe it's acrylic

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.290 
maybe it's acrylic maybe it's acrylic
but<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:54.690> super<00:03:54.930> durable<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:56.250> it's<00:03:56.850> not<00:03:57.060> so

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
but it's super durable but it's not so

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.210 
but it's super durable but it's not so
hard<00:03:57.570> that<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:57.870> like<00:03:58.050> digs<00:03:58.350> into<00:03:58.530> your<00:03:58.830> ears<00:03:59.040> or

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
hard that it like digs into your ears or

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.580 
hard that it like digs into your ears or
anything<00:03:59.550> and<00:03:59.700> I<00:04:00.150> just<00:04:00.360> love<00:04:00.660> having<00:04:01.020> this<00:04:01.350> on
