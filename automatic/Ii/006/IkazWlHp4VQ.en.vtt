00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:09.680
 hello today i will tell you how i bought 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.680
 samsung phone laptop 2 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:17.760
 I got a buggy first but it's 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.260
 probably all devices he long 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.090
 turns on the screen here I click it 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.650
 responds for quite some time 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:33.540
 seconds I lock the screen and turn it on 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.489
 again he responds long this i think 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.390
 for all devices this is not a glitch 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:45.539
 standard option means now main 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:50.489
 I put the SIM card on the phone works well 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:54.590
 but after half an hour or an hour he loses 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.329
 network and now shows this icon 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:02.660
 crossed out 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:05.339
 forbidden sign here instead of network sticks 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.140
 rebooting the device is again 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.020
 network everything is fine for half an hour 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.670
 the device and again loses the network with the wrong 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.759
 not all this is a terrible glitch 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.880
 impossible if the slug is not their screen 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.369
 how can you still come to terms with this 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.009
 I canâ€™t live with a glitch tomorrow 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:33.119
 reverse tried i thought so sim card 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.780
 depends here generally put micro sim 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.290
 and I specifically went to the cellular salon 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.520
 connections 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.670
 they were not given a new sim card micro 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.119
 sim standard officially I thought 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.540
 did something in the operator went to 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.360
 another mobile operator tried on 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:59.369
 He worked there a little longer somewhere 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.969
 three or two hours but the same glitch threw 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.460
 i.e. lost network after reboot 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:10.060
 device found another glitch 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:14.760
 who discovered I set the time 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:19.680
 so that he has the source of time 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:23.069
 so that he takes it from the net from the internet and 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.650
 as you can see I have here 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:30.880
 1941 and if you look here it is worth 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.069
 041 i.e. the device shows two 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:40.599
 time some kind of its original 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:42.220
 and new here and if blocking the tap then he 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:48.569
 shows here 041 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:51.220
 And if you unlock the volume shows 1941 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.090
 This is also a terrible glitch with which 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.650
 impossible to reconcile 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.840
 how many reviews did not look about 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.450
 it was not said so here i am 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.330
 added a picture be careful 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.430
 look be careful when 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.880
 buy at all i'm disappointed so 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.630
 tomorrow I bring back all good 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.320
 devices and fast phones 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.320
 until
