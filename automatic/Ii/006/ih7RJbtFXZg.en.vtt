traffic for your major roads but there
isn't<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.680> lot<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:59.009> traffic<00:01:59.310> coverage<00:01:59.729> this

doesn't have as extensive traffic
coverage<00:02:01.979> as<00:02:02.130> I've<00:02:02.369> seen<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.759> other<00:02:02.969> cars<00:02:03.390> so

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
coverage as I've seen on other cars so

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.539 
coverage as I've seen on other cars so
that<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.530> little<00:02:04.710> strike<00:02:04.979> against<00:02:05.430> this

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
that that's a little strike against this

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.809 
that that's a little strike against this
system<00:02:06.119> I've<00:02:06.869> also<00:02:07.140> noticed<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.550> system

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
system I've also noticed that the system

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.760 
system I've also noticed that the system
is<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.910> little<00:02:09.000> bit<00:02:09.149> sluggish<00:02:09.479> when<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.319> push<00:02:10.619> the

various<00:02:11.069> icons<00:02:11.280> sometimes

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
various icons sometimes

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.830 
various icons sometimes
things<00:02:12.489> don't<00:02:12.700> happen<00:02:12.970> right<00:02:13.299> away<00:02:13.569> and<00:02:13.780> I

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
things don't happen right away and I

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.210 
things don't happen right away and I
have<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.049> push<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.379> couple<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:14.680> times<00:02:14.920> or

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
have to push it a couple of times or

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.100 
have to push it a couple of times or
it's<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.549> little<00:02:15.790> slow<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.150> work<00:02:16.480> the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
it's just a little slow to work the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.020 
it's just a little slow to work the
Pandora<00:02:17.470> function<00:02:17.890> will<00:02:18.010> work<00:02:18.190> if<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.760> append

all running on my phone and my phone is
connected<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.340> system<00:02:21.569> for<00:02:22.569> whether<00:02:22.840> this

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
connected to the system for whether this

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.800 
connected to the system for whether this

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
actually comes through satellite radio

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.180 
actually comes through satellite radio
and<00:02:26.170> here<00:02:26.530> it's<00:02:26.680> showing<00:02:26.830> me<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.069> local

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
and here it's showing me the local

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.750 
weather for San Francisco and hourly
pattern<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:30.010> can<00:02:30.069> also<00:02:30.250> switch<00:02:30.489> it<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.670> a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
pattern I can also switch it to a

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.930 
pattern I can also switch it to a
36-hour<00:02:31.360> or<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.170> daily<00:02:33.159> one<00:02:33.489> which<00:02:33.670> will<00:02:33.819> give

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
36-hour or a daily one which will give

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.270 
36-hour or a daily one which will give
me<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.120> five-day<00:02:34.810> forecast<00:02:35.049> when<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.069> go<00:02:36.220> to

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
me a five-day forecast when I go to

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.479 
me a five-day forecast when I go to
OnStar<00:02:36.819> here<00:02:37.980> actually<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.069> is<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.370> real

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
OnStar here actually this is the real

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.949 
OnStar here actually this is the real
party<00:02:39.909> trick<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.239> this<00:02:40.360> car<00:02:40.599> this<00:02:40.780> little

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
party trick of this car this little

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.839 
party trick of this car this little
cross<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:41.409> one<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.739> first<00:02:41.980> cars<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.640> come

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
cross is one of the first cars to come

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.449 
cross is one of the first cars to come
with<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.450> 4G<00:02:44.110> data<00:02:44.379> connection<00:02:44.859> that's<00:02:45.010> part<00:02:45.400> of

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
with a 4G data connection that's part of

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.640 
with a 4G data connection that's part of
OnStar<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.209> they<00:02:46.750> use<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.200> enable<00:02:47.379> a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
OnStar and they use that to enable a

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.280 
OnStar and they use that to enable a
Wi-Fi<00:02:48.099> hotspot<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:49.299> to<00:02:49.390> test<00:02:49.629> this<00:02:49.810> Wi-Fi

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
Wi-Fi hotspot so to test this Wi-Fi

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.470 
Wi-Fi hotspot so to test this Wi-Fi
hotspot<00:02:50.739> I've<00:02:50.980> got<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.220> nexus<00:02:51.609> 7<00:02:51.640> tablet<00:02:51.940> here

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
hotspot I've got a nexus 7 tablet here

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.750 
hotspot I've got a nexus 7 tablet here
and<00:02:52.569> I've<00:02:52.660> got<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.870> band<00:02:53.680> with<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.190> app<00:02:54.400> here<00:02:54.700> to

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
and I've got a band with the app here to

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.430 
and I've got a band with the app here to
tell<00:02:54.910> me<00:02:55.000> how<00:02:55.120> fast<00:02:55.450> this<00:02:55.720> connection<00:02:56.170> runs

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
tell me how fast this connection runs

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.110 
tell me how fast this connection runs
looks<00:02:57.220> like<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:57.489> actually<00:02:57.579> an<00:02:57.790> average

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
looks like it's actually an average

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.550 
looks like it's actually an average
speed<00:02:58.329> of<00:02:58.450> 12<00:02:58.690> megabits<00:02:58.959> per<00:02:59.109> second<00:02:59.470> so

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
speed of 12 megabits per second so

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.099 
speed of 12 megabits per second so
that's<00:02:59.739> really<00:03:00.250> fast<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:01.390> might<00:03:01.540> wonder<00:03:01.870> why

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
that's really fast you might wonder why

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.289 
that's really fast you might wonder why
you'd<00:03:02.890> want<00:03:03.159> a<00:03:03.340> Wi-Fi<00:03:03.640> hotspot<00:03:03.790> in<00:03:04.030> your<00:03:04.150> car

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
you'd want a Wi-Fi hotspot in your car

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.640 
you'd want a Wi-Fi hotspot in your car
if<00:03:04.450> most<00:03:04.599> of<00:03:04.720> your<00:03:04.780> devices<00:03:05.319> are<00:03:05.440> connected

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
if most of your devices are connected

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.729 
if most of your devices are connected
out<00:03:06.250> of<00:03:06.519> LTE<00:03:06.849> anyway<00:03:07.510> well<00:03:08.230> it's<00:03:08.530> good<00:03:08.709> for

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
out of LTE anyway well it's good for

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.110 
out of LTE anyway well it's good for
tablets<00:03:09.280> if<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.489> have<00:03:09.579> wireless<00:03:09.760> only

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
tablets if you have wireless only

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.539 
tablets if you have wireless only
tablets<00:03:10.629> and<00:03:10.810> actually<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:12.250> Wi-Fi

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
tablets and actually the Wi-Fi

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.039 
tablets and actually the Wi-Fi
connection<00:03:12.609> in<00:03:13.030> this<00:03:13.120> car<00:03:13.390> is<00:03:13.659> going<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:13.930> be

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
connection in this car is going to be

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.720 
connection in this car is going to be
have<00:03:14.379> a<00:03:14.409> little<00:03:14.650> stronger<00:03:15.069> signal<00:03:15.489> than<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
have a little stronger signal than the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.550 
have a little stronger signal than the
one<00:03:15.879> on<00:03:15.909> your<00:03:16.060> phone<00:03:16.419> because<00:03:16.690> this<00:03:17.260> car<00:03:17.440> has<00:03:17.530> a

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
one on your phone because this car has a

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.379 
one on your phone because this car has a
more<00:03:17.739> robust<00:03:18.130> antenna<00:03:18.489> so<00:03:18.669> you<00:03:18.760> might<00:03:18.910> get<00:03:19.180> a

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
more robust antenna so you might get a

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.780 
more robust antenna so you might get a
connection<00:03:19.810> further<00:03:20.590> out<00:03:20.829> then<00:03:21.190> when<00:03:21.669> your

connection further out then when your

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.580 
connection further out then when your
phone<00:03:21.970> might<00:03:22.239> might<00:03:22.660> drop<00:03:22.930> at<00:03:23.139> this<00:03:23.230> car<00:03:23.380> watch

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
phone might might drop at this car watch

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.140 
phone might might drop at this car watch
they<00:03:23.709> have<00:03:23.829> a<00:03:23.859> connection<00:03:24.190> for<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.700> longer

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
response and I would actually like to

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.849 
response and I would actually like to

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.440 
see more apps on here too and I would
also<00:03:32.980> like<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.220> see<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.549> 4G<00:03:33.849> connection<00:03:34.209> power

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450

before<00:04:44.669> I<00:04:44.880> like<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.449> actually<00:04:45.630> and<00:04:46.169> that<00:04:46.380> will

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
before I like it actually and that will

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.740 
before I like it actually and that will
raise<00:04:46.680> your<00:04:46.889> fuel<00:04:47.099> economy<00:04:47.160> quite<00:04:47.789> a<00:04:47.820> bit<00:04:48.120> fuel

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
raise your fuel economy quite a bit fuel

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.010 
raise your fuel economy quite a bit fuel
economy<00:04:48.900> on<00:04:49.139> that<00:04:49.260> model<00:04:49.590> is<00:04:49.919> 25<00:04:50.880> City<00:04:51.300> 36

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.719 
economy on that model is 25 City 36
highway<00:04:52.440> so<00:04:52.949> you'll<00:04:53.070> probably<00:04:53.190> average<00:04:53.580> about

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
highway so you'll probably average about

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.420 
highway so you'll probably average about
30<00:04:54.060> with<00:04:54.270> that<00:04:54.860> that's<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:56.039> pretty<00:04:56.250> big

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
30 with that that's a pretty big

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.969 
30 with that that's a pretty big
advantage<00:04:56.550> over<00:04:56.970> this<00:04:57.180> so<00:04:58.139> we<00:04:58.289> have<00:04:58.409> adaptive

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
advantage over this so we have adaptive

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.100 
advantage over this so we have adaptive
cruise<00:04:59.250> control<00:04:59.370> I<00:04:59.639> can<00:04:59.909> set<00:05:00.419> that<00:05:00.630> with<00:05:00.930> the

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
cruise control I can set that with the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.620 
cruise control I can set that with the
buttons<00:05:01.530> on<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:01.830> steering<00:05:02.070> wheel<00:05:02.490> here<00:05:02.909> and<00:05:03.060> a

buttons on the steering wheel here and a
radar<00:05:04.229> looking<00:05:04.530> forward<00:05:05.010> will<00:05:05.639> slow<00:05:06.599> this<00:05:07.020> car

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
radar looking forward will slow this car

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.870 
radar looking forward will slow this car
down<00:05:07.349> to<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.919> speed<00:05:08.159> of<00:05:08.190> slower<00:05:08.550> traffic

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.270 
down to the speed of slower traffic
ahead<00:05:09.449> I've<00:05:09.599> got<00:05:09.840> blind<00:05:10.139> spot<00:05:10.380> monitors<00:05:10.889> too

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
ahead I've got blind spot monitors too

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.339 
ahead I've got blind spot monitors too
so<00:05:11.580> that<00:05:11.789> will<00:05:11.909> flash<00:05:12.180> an<00:05:12.360> icon<00:05:12.720> in<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.169> side

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
so that will flash an icon in the side

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:14.810 
so that will flash an icon in the side
mirrors<00:05:13.710> that<00:05:13.800> there's<00:05:13.979> a<00:05:14.039> car<00:05:14.220> in<00:05:14.430> my<00:05:14.460> blind
