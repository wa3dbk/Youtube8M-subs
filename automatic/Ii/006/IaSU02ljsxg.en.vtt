00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.140 
where's my jets by the way the real
reason<00:01:24.190> I<00:01:24.250> was<00:01:24.369> saying<00:01:24.640> all<00:01:24.790> that<00:01:24.909> stuff

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
reason I was saying all that stuff

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.749 
reason I was saying all that stuff
before<00:01:25.270> this<00:01:25.630> is<00:01:25.810> because<00:01:26.110> I<00:01:26.440> fucking<00:01:27.430> tried

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
before this is because I fucking tried

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.210 
before this is because I fucking tried
this<00:01:28.030> five<00:01:28.899> times<00:01:29.320> and<00:01:29.710> always<00:01:29.890> got

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
this five times and always got

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.100 
this five times and always got
disconnected<00:01:30.610> from<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:30.970> EA<00:01:31.090> servers<00:01:31.630> I<00:01:31.899> never

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
disconnected from the EA servers I never

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.499 
disconnected from the EA servers I never
got<00:01:32.259> a<00:01:32.320> chance<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.649> even<00:01:32.950> pick<00:01:33.220> my<00:01:33.369> team<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.450> I

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
got a chance to even pick my team so I

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.420 
got a chance to even pick my team so I
guess<00:01:34.659> whatever<00:01:34.990> happens<00:01:35.470> it's<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.950> must<00:01:36.220> have

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
guess whatever happens it's it must have

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.450 
guess whatever happens it's it must have
cleared<00:01:37.090> itself<00:01:37.360> up<00:01:38.070> all<00:01:39.070> right<00:01:39.190> I'm<00:01:39.250> gonna<00:01:39.340> be

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
cleared itself up all right I'm gonna be

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.749 
cleared itself up all right I'm gonna be
the<00:01:39.580> Jets

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the Jets

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.919 
the Jets
looks<00:01:42.759> like<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.000> Jets<00:01:43.210> have<00:01:43.240> been<00:01:43.330> upgraded

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
looks like the Jets have been upgraded

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.760 
looks like the Jets have been upgraded
they're<00:01:44.050> now<00:01:44.170> overall<00:01:44.770> ranking<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.130> 87<00:01:46.710> when<00:01:47.710> I

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
they're now overall ranking of 87 when I

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.969 
they're now overall ranking of 87 when I
was<00:01:47.890> playing<00:01:48.160> in<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:50.350> offline<00:01:50.740> modes

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
was playing in the the offline modes

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.770 
was playing in the the offline modes
before<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:51.369> updated<00:01:51.729> my<00:01:51.940> roster<00:01:52.420> they<00:01:52.570> were<00:01:52.660> in

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
before I updated my roster they were in

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.749 
before I updated my roster they were in
85<00:01:53.259> so<00:01:53.710> I<00:01:53.770> guess<00:01:53.950> they<00:01:54.130> they<00:01:54.429> actually

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
85 so I guess they they actually

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:55.740 
85 so I guess they they actually
recognized<00:01:55.119> they're<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.330> little<00:01:55.420> bit<00:01:55.600> better

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
recognized they're a little bit better

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:07.410 
recognized they're a little bit better
