you avoid a rear collision by stopping

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.630 
you avoid a rear collision by stopping
itself<00:00:47.030> before<00:00:47.149> it<00:00:47.329> reaches<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:48.550> car<00:00:49.550> in

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
itself before it reaches the car in

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.790 
itself before it reaches the car in
front<00:00:49.819> of<00:00:49.969> it<00:00:50.229> and<00:00:51.229> it's<00:00:51.409> going<00:00:51.499> to<00:00:51.559> do<00:00:51.679> it

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
front of it and it's going to do it

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.200 
front of it and it's going to do it
automatically<00:00:52.339> so

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
automatically so

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.049 
automatically so
the<00:00:55.480> key<00:00:55.719> word<00:00:55.960> here<00:00:55.989> was<00:00:56.469> supposedly<00:00:57.250> all<00:00:57.879> the

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
the key word here was supposedly all the

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.580 
the key word here was supposedly all the
way<00:00:58.180> subtle<00:00:58.870> is<00:00:58.960> from<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.260> stop<00:00:59.440> itself

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
way subtle is from the stop itself

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.460 
way subtle is from the stop itself
automatically<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.949> what<00:01:03.039> I'm<00:01:03.129> gonna<00:01:03.280> do<00:01:03.550> is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
automatically so what I'm gonna do is

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.810 
automatically so what I'm gonna do is
pull<00:01:05.470> up<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.710> all<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:05.920> side<00:01:06.100> of<00:01:06.190> campus<00:01:06.520> here
