00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
what we're going to do these have been

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.469 
what we're going to do these have been
in<00:01:50.079> the<00:01:50.170> fridge<00:01:50.469> for<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:51.070> little<00:01:51.280> bit<00:01:51.429> I<00:01:51.820> think

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
in the fridge for a little bit I think

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.910 
in the fridge for a little bit I think
what<00:01:52.689> I'm<00:01:52.780> going<00:01:52.929> to<00:01:52.990> do<00:01:53.170> is<00:01:54.689> rehydrate<00:01:55.689> them

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
what I'm going to do is rehydrate them

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.940 
what I'm going to do is rehydrate them
by<00:01:56.939> sticking<00:01:57.939> a<00:01:58.119> man<00:01:58.329> some<00:01:59.320> water<00:01:59.499> for<00:01:59.920> a

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
by sticking a man some water for a

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.160 
by sticking a man some water for a
little<00:02:00.219> bit<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:02.020> will<00:02:02.289> dehydrate<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.869> roots

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
little bit this will dehydrate the roots

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.669 
little bit this will dehydrate the roots
back<00:02:05.829> and<00:02:06.219> they<00:02:07.119> will<00:02:07.390> get<00:02:08.080> started<00:02:08.350> a<00:02:08.530> lot

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
back and they will get started a lot

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.700 
back and they will get started a lot
quicker<00:02:09.220> in<00:02:09.550> soil<00:02:10.500> rehydrated<00:02:11.500> these<00:02:11.680> a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
quicker in soil rehydrated these a

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.590 
quicker in soil rehydrated these a

some holes here and the soil I'm using
is<00:02:27.450> kind<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.960> sandy<00:02:28.620> peat<00:02:29.450> mix<00:02:30.620> with<00:02:31.620> some

little bit of maybe a half inch of the
green<00:02:41.700> onion<00:02:42.090> okay<00:02:45.800> okay<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.880> I'm<00:02:48.240> going<00:02:48.360> to

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
green onion okay okay and I'm going to

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.020 
green onion okay okay and I'm going to
whip<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.990> really<00:02:49.320> well<00:02:52.580> I'm<00:02:53.580> just<00:02:53.760> using

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
whip this in really well I'm just using

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.980 
whip this in really well I'm just using
a<00:02:54.300> trace<00:02:54.960> that<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:55.350> use<00:02:56.340> for<00:02:56.820> when<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.390> stood<00:02:57.870> my

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
a trace that I use for when I stood my

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.810 
a trace that I use for when I stood my
seed<00:02:58.320> starting<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:58.980> thought<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.640> would<00:02:59.790> work

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
seed starting I thought this would work

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.360 
seed starting I thought this would work
pretty<00:03:00.209> good<00:03:00.300> we'll<00:03:00.990> see<00:03:01.230> how<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.530> works<00:03:01.680> out

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
pretty good we'll see how it works out

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.870 
pretty good we'll see how it works out
if<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.209> does<00:03:03.360> as<00:03:03.570> well<00:03:03.750> as<00:03:04.050> I'm<00:03:04.230> hoping<00:03:04.770> if<00:03:05.700> I

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
if it does as well as I'm hoping if I

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.410 
if it does as well as I'm hoping if I
need<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.300> adjust<00:03:06.570> my<00:03:06.930> container<00:03:07.830> I'll<00:03:08.459> do<00:03:08.850> that

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
need to adjust my container I'll do that

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.440 
need to adjust my container I'll do that
but<00:03:09.959> right<00:03:10.140> now<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.410> think<00:03:10.709> it'll<00:03:11.040> be<00:03:11.280> fine<00:03:11.940> just

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
but right now I think it'll be fine just

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.000 
but right now I think it'll be fine just
going<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.660> water<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.020> in<00:03:13.140> really<00:03:13.500> good<00:03:13.680> around

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
going to water it in really good around

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.260 
going to water it in really good around
it<00:03:14.280> here<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.320> then<00:03:16.320> I'll<00:03:16.470> put<00:03:16.680> them<00:03:16.800> under<00:03:17.040> my

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
it here and then I'll put them under my

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.000 
it here and then I'll put them under my
