00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 hello very good everyone here and 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.589
 welcome another day more to the channel 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.000
 welcome to a new video more this 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.080
 time it is a special video of a 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.349
 interest 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.790
 4 that has personally made me 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.619
 grace enough mentions are winks to 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.869
 the pirate movie of the Caribbean as 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.060
 it can be for example the island of turtle 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.609
 or the lost island that you can 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.560
 find a boat made with shells 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.109
 of turtle do not remember exactly what 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.289
 island is but good this is about the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.399
 kraken steak to meet with 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.680
 the kraken you have to come to this 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.680
 position of the map that exactly is the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.690
 coordinate that I will put on the map 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.769
 this 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:49.379
 what is position 630 660 which is a 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.570
 voice bell or voucher to have the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.899
 diver bell you have to go for the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.280
 sequence 56 I'm not entirely sure 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.469
 good is a sequence that nothing else 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.850
 start teach you the missions 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.379
 underwater if you do not have the missions 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.400
 submarines because logically you can not 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.680
 do it yet but let's 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.180
 you come here and you do the mission of 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.550
 step diving you do it I think 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.240
 that there is an elite plane made us 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.730
 the cannons of 500 but if we come to 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.490
 this boat from here that is going now 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.780
 same as we arrive we will see that there 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.180
 tentacles in the entrance that 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.760
 as we approach 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.800
 they are building now our 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.940
 tentacles that go are worth to see the 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.110
 'crack' what you have to do because 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.480
 people take the right and there's no 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.770
 absolutely nothing what you have to 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.660
 to do is to stay here in the window 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.430
 still during a ratillo looking towards 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.500
 it and the cinematic of the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.500
 'crack' here I leave you with her 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.750
 as you can see is the extra that 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.940
 I entrust to one 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.280
 a poor whale, so imagine 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.840
 How big is the octopus that more 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.640
 that an octopus would even say that a 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.979
 Squid does not look good at all 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.470
 I was waiting when they told me there was a 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.360
 tlc a dlc sorry a steak of the crÃ¡ that 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.770
 I imagined a piece of octopus more 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.090
 big that the galleons 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.840
 but much bigger but good there 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.840
 what to describe
