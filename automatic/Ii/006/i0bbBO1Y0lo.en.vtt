00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.000
 well once explained that is the fax 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.640
 jones let's start with the commands good 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.680
 let's start explaining how it is created 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.539
 a faction well to create a faction 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.660
 or group we put in the chat 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.310
 believe 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.440
 space 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.770
 and the name of the faction we're going to put 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.430
 producer 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.430
 tutorial 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.300
 we have already created a faction 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.260
 and now for 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:50.070
 in that we build such we have here 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.070
 a small area on a piece of base 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:59.100
 how to make sure is this area here 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:02.970
 is that we are good because the only thing 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.470
 you have to do is put that space 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.470
 klain is worth 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.760
 and already this area 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.680
 from our base 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.350
 with a size of 16 16 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.350
 It is protected by us 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.250
 to put a description to the faction 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.720
 and put efe of space before 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.720
 space and description 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.770
 okay now 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.829
 for 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.109
 to put some user in our 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.170
 faction the maximum are five vouchers for 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:56.689
 that country 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.689
 you have to describe efe envite 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.000
 and the name of the player is worth 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.680
 OK 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.160
 guerrilla in this case is not for 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.110
 here he would have to register for 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:19.220
 join the function efe joint space and 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.569
 the name of the faction that in this case 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.180
 OK 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.430
 well once this is done we are going to 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.880
 explain how a faction is exposed 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.490
 ally or enemy or neutral or whatever 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:38.080
 ok we wrote efe space 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.080
 n my space 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.560
 and the name of the faction we want 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.560
 with the enemy 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.890
 if what we want is to put it neutral 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.930
 then neutral 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:58.110
 or if what we want is to put the ally 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.110
 al and is worth the name of the faction 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.939
 we already have the basic concepts of 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.939
 factions 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:13.640
 now we are going to use a tool 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.750
 that is called efe mch with efe 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.750
 We can look 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.340
 what are the areas planned by a 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.260
 faction what are the lines with what 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.260
 which in all the town all 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.989
 yes I believe in one side because the 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.989
 area that we have created 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.420
 in this case 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.260
 a friend I asked him to make a 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.860
 test and there if we put the subject 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:51.640
 let's see here last ford is worth and 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.700
 we have there are 222 sticks of those sticks 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.720
 means each stick or each square of 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:03.010
 those that is a territory of 16 x 16 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.780
 is worth 73 16 x 16 equals 1 of 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.020
 power 1 line 2 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.910
 otherwise now it's just to be guided 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.890
 one moves 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.780
 the principle of 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:22.440
 get oriented with the 3 and now it seems more 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.440
 from this 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.180
 this has been all 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.250
 greetings and see you in the next 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.250
 tutorial see you later
