00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 and there it is there is not often of 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.370
 pilots anyway but that's 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.750
 amazing that I saw you leap into 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.040
 the news of new technologies 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.349
 we will talk about an innovation that 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.639
 regards health first a number 7 to 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.969
 8 million French suffer 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.359
 hypertension 7 8 million French 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.580
 have high blood pressure you 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.369
 are maybe among those there and this 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.920
 could not actually be useful 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.359
 then and globally the numbers 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.740
 still a lot more dramatic because 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.619
 that's 7 million deaths a year 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.440
 that's what's huge in the world 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.450
 he 31% of French hyper tension and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.030
 especially that's what the figaro 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.559
 yesterday half of those who are 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.610
 hypertensive finally do not know it 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.500
 they ignore each other 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.460
 they do not know why because we are 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.750
 says that very often it's very 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.460
 complicated to come to take his tension 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.170
 so he sold himself 1 of 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.640
 tensiometers but this one a big 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.520
 advantage is that you go the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.410
 connect directly to your smartphone 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.120
 or your ipod and you're going 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.530
 to be able to take your tension alone 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.800
 when you want it and especially 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.030
 see a follow up of your own tension 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.189
 with a grave that will show you 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.650
 precisely if you are more tense the 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.049
 morning or evening and and be able to follow that 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.159
 quite simply enough what I 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.820
 offers you is to look at how 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.680
 it works precisely and media 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.090
 directly on your iphone you can 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.890
 so direct your attention 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.840
 you will see that and then I will 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.200
 shows my results I did this 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.060
 morning 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:32.890
 now it's teasing it kept me 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:34.100
 [Music] 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.280
 all 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.320
 this product is a connected blood pressure monitor 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.630
 so the idea is to bring all 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.250
 services that are needed when 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.659
 you must follow your tension at 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.070
 you the first thing you 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.509
 ask the doctors it's about you 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.340
 equip at home continue your 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.930
 tension and in this case what is 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.240
 important is to take several 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.009
 measures to average them 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.630
 note over a period of time from 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.380
 a few weeks and then send them to 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.390
 your doctor 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.990
 using the tensiometer all this 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:08.899
 is done automatically so 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.459
 the use is extremely simple game 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.290
 it's a blood pressure monitor, so it's 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.209
 just an armband I pass around 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.130
 of my arm the peculiarity is that it 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.569
 is equipped with this connector which allows 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.880
 connect it directly to smartphones 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.650
 so from the moment you plug in 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.060
 you simply have to click on 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.810
 start on your smartphone so that 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.880
 the measure is taken 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.680
 you have a result so is immediate 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.840
 your blood pressure measurement 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.420
 so the systole ya d'a of the diastole 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.040
 is also your heart rate and 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.260
 gave himself without you having to do 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.810
 anything is recorded is 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.850
 added to your tracking to your curves and 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.489
 share with your tweaks that will access 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.490

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:50.569
 that he will receive by mail your data 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.569
 [Music] 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.720
 the idea is that more and more we 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.599
 will be equipped with objects that allows us to 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.190
 follow the parameters of our health 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.650
 the idea is to enrich services 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.590
 available is provided by these objects 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.760
 and share them with people who 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.840
 are important to you so that can 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.440
 to be the doctor in the case of a tube 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.660
 hypertension 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.489
 it can be your sports coach or 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:21.310
 your nutritionist for example it takes 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.959
 the little cord but also if you 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.950
 connect the disk directly and 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.140
 what's interesting is that you 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.819
 can finally revisited full 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.830
 everyday things like that for you 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.140
 see we saw it quickly in the subject 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.150
 a scale to take your 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.430
 weight you can besides the airlock and 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.680
 my results this morning tilted the 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.989
 moral then we do not come from the trace of 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.030

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.739

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.670
 that's it and well now 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.290
 now right now they are coming 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.579
 with the experience like me that's where I 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.530
 you do it at 13 5 months already but no 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.510
 if the attention is normal that's 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.630
 so here are some objects that can 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.370
