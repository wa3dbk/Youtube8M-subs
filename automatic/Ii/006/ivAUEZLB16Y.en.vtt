you can either use a common bench

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.810 
you can either use a common bench
grinder<00:00:10.050> or<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:10.920> can<00:00:11.070> use<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> slow<00:00:11.519> speed

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
speed grinder it doesn't heat up the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.650 
speed grinder it doesn't heat up the
tool<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.890> allows<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:18.420> bit<00:00:18.510> more

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
tool and it allows you a little bit more

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.480 
tool and it allows you a little bit more
control<00:00:19.109> because<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.770> not<00:00:19.920> removing<00:00:20.279> stock

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
control because it's not removing stock

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.160 
control because it's not removing stock

very similar to how you sharpen your

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.089 
very similar to how you sharpen your
other<00:00:30.210> tools<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:31.500> difference<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.040> get

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
other tools the difference is you get

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.340 
other tools the difference is you get
this<00:00:32.610> tool<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.120> being<00:00:33.270> rolled<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.079> stone

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
this tool is being rolled on the stone

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.080 
this tool is being rolled on the stone
where<00:00:34.950> your<00:00:35.070> flat<00:00:35.309> tools<00:00:35.550> are<00:00:35.760> being<00:00:35.910> held

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
where your flat tools are being held

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.959 
where your flat tools are being held
square<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.630> stone<00:00:39.110> simply<00:00:40.110> turn<00:00:40.410> my<00:00:40.969> slow

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
square to the stone simply turn my slow

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.540 
square to the stone simply turn my slow
speed<00:00:42.210> grinder<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.800> also<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.190> wet

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
speed grinder on and this is also a wet

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.119 
speed grinder on and this is also a wet
grinder<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:46.079> also<00:00:46.230> helps<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.770> keep<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
grinder so it also helps to keep the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.790 
grinder so it also helps to keep the
tools<00:00:47.309> even<00:00:47.489> cooler<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:49.050> I've<00:00:49.320> come<00:00:49.559> up<00:00:49.649> with

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
tools even cooler and I've come up with

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.020 
tools even cooler and I've come up with
a<00:00:49.829> little<00:00:50.129> rest<00:00:50.399> here<00:00:50.700> there<00:00:50.940> are

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
a little rest here there are

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.029 
a little rest here there are
commercially<00:00:51.510> available<00:00:51.680> versions<00:00:52.680> or<00:00:52.890> you

can make your own and this allows me to
put<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> tool<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.280> socket<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.000> I've

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
put the tool in the socket and I've

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.910 
put the tool in the socket and I've
already<00:00:57.750> checked<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.260> make<00:00:58.289> sure<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.680> I'm

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
already checked to make sure that I'm

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.970 
already checked to make sure that I'm
gonna<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.550> at<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> right<00:00:59.910> place<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.420> my<00:01:00.600> stone

because what you want to do is maintain
the<00:01:04.460> angle<00:01:05.540> that<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.780> chisel<00:01:07.020> came<00:01:07.320> from<00:01:07.470> the

factory put the tool in the socket bring
it<00:01:10.680> down<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> stone<00:01:12.080> we're<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.229> going<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
it down to the stone we're just going to

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.710 
it down to the stone we're just going to
rock<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.590> back<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:13.979> forth

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.530 

with<00:01:20.500> gouges<00:01:21.430> especially<00:01:22.000> it's<00:01:22.150> easier<00:01:22.450> to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
with gouges especially it's easier to

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.300 
with gouges especially it's easier to
tell<00:01:22.780> that<00:01:22.960> you've<00:01:23.110> you've<00:01:23.530> cleaned<00:01:24.220> that

tell that you've you've cleaned that
edge<00:01:24.490> up<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:24.850> might<00:01:25.000> find<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.420> little<00:01:25.450> burr<00:01:25.840> on

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
edge up you might find a little burr on

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.260 
edge up you might find a little burr on
the<00:01:26.200> inside<00:01:26.620> right<00:01:26.890> here<00:01:27.310> nothing<00:01:28.030> you<00:01:28.120> can

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
the inside right here nothing you can

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.600 
the inside right here nothing you can
see<00:01:28.510> but<00:01:28.720> you<00:01:28.810> can<00:01:28.930> feel<00:01:28.960> it<00:01:29.230> in<00:01:29.920> this<00:01:30.160> case<00:01:30.400> for

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
see but you can feel it in this case for

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.130 
see but you can feel it in this case for
this<00:01:30.700> tool<00:01:30.970> I<00:01:31.000> found<00:01:31.210> that<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.540> one<00:01:31.690> inch<00:01:31.870> dowel

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
this tool I found that a one inch dowel

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.850 
this tool I found that a one inch dowel
it<00:01:32.920> matches<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.730> profile<00:01:34.120> very<00:01:34.420> well<00:01:34.660> and<00:01:35.050> I

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
it matches the profile very well and I

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.500 
it matches the profile very well and I
just<00:01:36.040> take<00:01:36.190> some<00:01:36.220> 220<00:01:36.910> sandpaper<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:39.360> push<00:01:40.360> it

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
just take some 220 sandpaper and push it

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.720 
just take some 220 sandpaper and push it
away<00:01:40.720> from<00:01:40.900> me

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
away from me

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.190 
away from me
it<00:01:42.730> only<00:01:42.940> takes<00:01:43.210> two<00:01:43.360> or<00:01:43.480> three<00:01:43.630> passes<00:01:43.810> and

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
it only takes two or three passes and

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.050 
it only takes two or three passes and
you'll<00:01:44.320> feel<00:01:44.500> that<00:01:44.560> burr<00:01:45.220> is<00:01:45.460> gone

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
you'll feel that burr is gone

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.210 
you'll feel that burr is gone
as<00:01:46.120> I<00:01:46.780> said<00:01:46.990> sharpening<00:01:47.500> straight<00:01:47.800> tools<00:01:48.010> is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
as I said sharpening straight tools is

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.670 
as I said sharpening straight tools is
very<00:01:48.460> similar<00:01:48.790> but<00:01:49.540> since<00:01:49.840> we<00:01:50.530> have<00:01:50.650> a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
very similar but since we have a

keeping it flat and then roll it over
and<00:02:06.930> hit<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:07.960> other<00:02:08.080> side<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:10.090> give<00:02:10.210> us<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.420> nice
