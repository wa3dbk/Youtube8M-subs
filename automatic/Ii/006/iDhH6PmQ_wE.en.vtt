00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.269 
it's not race then it just won't give
you<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.010> things<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.400> need<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.640> build<00:00:24.060> it

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
you the things that you need to build it

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.030 
you the things that you need to build it
that's<00:00:26.779> yeah<00:00:27.779> here's<00:00:27.990> me<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.830> don't<00:00:29.220> know

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
all you got to test your math I mean you

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.069 
all you got to test your math I mean you
can't<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.579> build<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.120> say<00:00:54.420> yeah<00:00:54.600> that's<00:00:54.899> all

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
can't just build it say yeah that's all

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.099 
can't just build it say yeah that's all
right<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:56.010> know<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.219> gotta<00:00:56.750> have<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.840> build<00:00:58.050> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
right you know you gotta have to build a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.970 
right you know you gotta have to build a
correct<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.710> mean<00:00:59.190> the<00:01:00.180> ramp<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.570> bumpy<00:01:01.430> because

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
game specific and go into true going to

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.070 
game specific and go into true going to
know<00:01:31.870> let<00:01:32.140> own<00:01:33.040> a<00:01:33.070> game<00:01:33.310> type<00:01:33.550> label<00:01:33.940> not<00:01:34.780> race

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
know let own a game type label not race

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.190 
know let own a game type label not race
not<00:01:35.650> rice<00:01:35.830> spawn<00:01:36.190> but<00:01:36.520> race<00:01:36.760> flag<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.810> has<00:01:38.080> to

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
not rice spawn but race flag it has to

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:47.840 
not rice spawn but race flag it has to
be<00:01:38.290> rice<00:01:38.500> flag<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.250> then<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.700> you<00:01:43.510> do<00:01:43.660> that

okay<00:01:49.140> then<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.229> do<00:01:50.350> that<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:52.180> make<00:01:52.330> another

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
okay then you do that you make another

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:04.340 
okay then you do that you make another
one<00:01:54.270> same<00:01:55.270> things<00:01:58.229> Reese<00:01:59.229> flag

you got that but when you do it it's not
going<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.630> do<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:07.900> right<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.649> so<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.040> have<00:02:09.340> to

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
going to do it right you so you have to

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.600 
going to do it right you so you have to
go<00:02:11.340> here<00:02:12.340> go<00:02:13.710> back<00:02:14.710> to<00:02:14.860> advance<00:02:15.160> if<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:15.490> going

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
go here go back to advance if it's going

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.400 
go here go back to advance if it's going
to<00:02:15.670> be<00:02:15.820> your<00:02:15.940> first<00:02:16.180> check<00:02:16.450> mark<00:02:16.720> got<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.290> put

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
to be your first check mark got to put

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.040 
to be your first check mark got to put
number<00:02:17.650> one<00:02:17.910> then<00:02:18.910> where<00:02:19.330> your<00:02:19.480> second<00:02:19.810> check

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
number one then where your second check

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.410 
number one then where your second check
mark<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.730> go<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:22.030> go<00:02:22.960> to<00:02:23.020> two<00:02:23.850> well<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:25.000> like

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
mark is go to that go to two well I like

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.160 
mark is go to that go to two well I like
to<00:02:25.450> do<00:02:25.630> i<00:02:25.660> do<00:02:25.870> box<00:02:26.290> with<00:02:26.770> point<00:02:27.250> five<00:02:27.750> top<00:02:28.750> point

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
to do i do box with point five top point

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.850 
to do i do box with point five top point
10<00:02:32.100> point<00:02:33.100> 14<00:02:33.670> bottom<00:02:33.940> in<00:02:34.210> length<00:02:34.660> 5<00:02:35.200> point<00:02:35.590> 0

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
10 point 14 bottom in length 5 point 0

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.440 
10 point 14 bottom in length 5 point 0
because<00:02:36.700> that's<00:02:36.910> how<00:02:37.120> big<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.840> pieces<00:02:42.450> so

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
because that's how big the pieces so

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.980 
because that's how big the pieces so
then<00:02:43.600> yeah<00:02:44.140> that's<00:02:44.709> pretty<00:02:44.920> much<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.160> um<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:46.630> lot

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
then yeah that's pretty much it um a lot
