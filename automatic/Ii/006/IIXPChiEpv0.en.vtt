00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
probably really offensive but okay sorry

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.890 
probably really offensive but okay sorry
about<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> accents<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.490> tried<00:00:20.939> enough<00:00:21.270> anyways

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
about the accents I tried enough anyways

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.109 
about the accents I tried enough anyways
we<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:23.010> an<00:00:23.570> odd<00:00:24.570> character<00:00:24.900> here<00:00:25.939> if<00:00:26.939> this

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
we have an odd character here if this

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.120 
we have an odd character here if this
guy<00:00:27.330> would<00:00:27.390> shut<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:27.930> all<00:00:28.740> right<00:00:29.480> lasers

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
guy would shut up all right lasers

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.590 
guy would shut up all right lasers
lasers<00:00:32.130> are<00:00:32.489> weak<00:00:33.350> but<00:00:34.350> they're<00:00:34.559> sustained<00:00:35.600> so

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
lasers are weak but they're sustained so

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.630 
lasers are weak but they're sustained so
it's<00:00:36.719> kind<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:36.989> those<00:00:37.680> Touhou<00:00:38.370> games

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it's kind of like those Touhou games

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.069 
it's kind of like those Touhou games
where<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.210> choice<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.780> character

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
where you have a choice of a character

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.720 
where you have a choice of a character
that<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.410> shoot<00:00:40.860> bullets<00:00:41.070> or<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.640> have

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
that can like shoot bullets or you have

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.979 
that can like shoot bullets or you have
character<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.390> shoot<00:00:42.540> lasers<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
character that can shoot lasers and

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.540 
character that can shoot lasers and
lasers<00:00:45.989> are<00:00:46.110> weak<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:46.980> hit<00:00:47.160> things

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
lasers are weak but you can hit things

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.420 
lasers are weak but you can hit things
with<00:00:47.730> them<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> lot<00:00:48.180> more<00:00:48.920> it's<00:00:49.920> kind<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> useful

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
with them a lot more it's kind of useful

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.490 
with them a lot more it's kind of useful
she<00:00:51.059> has<00:00:51.180> other<00:00:51.329> abilities<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.199> for<00:00:52.410> now

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
she has other abilities but for now

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.310 
she has other abilities but for now

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
we'll just do this even though it takes

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:08.230 
we'll just do this even though it takes
forever<00:00:55.440> and

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.929 

and<00:01:08.720> I<00:01:08.810> can<00:01:08.960> hover<00:01:09.140> which<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:09.650> kind<00:01:09.830> of<00:01:09.860> cool

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and I can hover which is kind of cool

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.959 
and I can hover which is kind of cool
it's<00:01:12.360> not<00:01:12.509> like<00:01:12.689> protoman<00:01:13.110> chill<00:01:13.969> chill

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969

umbrella thing except for it's a little

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.109 
umbrella thing except for it's a little
better<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.130> actually<00:01:20.250> let<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.640> cover<00:01:20.850> one

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
first they don't fall fast what's gonna

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.090 
first they don't fall fast what's gonna
be<00:01:23.700> pretty<00:01:23.880> useful<00:01:24.530> or<00:01:25.530> sometimes<00:01:25.829> it<00:01:25.979> can

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
be pretty useful or sometimes it can

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.649 
be pretty useful or sometimes it can
hate<00:01:26.250> yep<00:01:26.429> and<00:01:26.670> that's<00:01:26.789> the<00:01:26.969> opposite<00:01:27.299> you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
charging for a second you're kind of

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.960 
charging for a second you're kind of
defensive<00:02:01.289> starting<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.740> and

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.460 

or<00:02:06.970> you<00:02:07.180> can<00:02:07.330> order<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.900> a<00:02:07.960> normal<00:02:08.290> Church

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470

you<00:02:10.600> can<00:02:10.750> actually<00:02:10.840> charge<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.290> place<00:02:11.590> to

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
you can actually charge the place to

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.010 
you can actually charge the place to
think<00:02:12.670> about<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.000> six<00:02:13.240> charge<00:02:13.570> shots<00:02:13.840> which

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
think about the six charge shots which

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.780 
think about the six charge shots which
could<00:02:14.200> shoot<00:02:14.590> one<00:02:14.830> after<00:02:15.250> another<00:02:15.280> without

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
could shoot one after another without

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.820 
could shoot one after another without
any<00:02:15.970> downtime<00:02:16.270> after<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.900> which<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.680> pretty

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
any downtime after that which is pretty

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.410 
any downtime after that which is pretty
cool<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.340> probably<00:02:18.820> actually<00:02:19.030> should<00:02:19.330> have

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
cool I probably actually should have

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.210 
cool I probably actually should have
charged<00:02:19.660> before<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.140> mob<00:02:20.290> sci-fi<00:02:20.740> valve<00:02:20.980> in

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
charged before the mob sci-fi valve in
