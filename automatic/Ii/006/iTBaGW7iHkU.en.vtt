three<00:01:06.180> different<00:01:06.479> kinds<00:01:06.680> those<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.979> tankless

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
three different kinds those the tankless

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.429 
three different kinds those the tankless
is<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:08.909> an<00:01:09.299> efficient<00:01:09.720> unit<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
is really an efficient unit but the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.780 
is really an efficient unit but the
problem<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.070> quite<00:01:11.189> expensive<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
problem is it's quite expensive to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.580 
problem is it's quite expensive to
install<00:01:11.909> because<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> redo<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.409> gas

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
install because you have to redo the gas

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.890 
install because you have to redo the gas
you<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.400> add<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> little<00:01:14.670> dedication<00:01:14.909> for

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
you have to add a little dedication for

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.530 
you have to add a little dedication for
the<00:01:16.369> electronic<00:01:17.369> ignition<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.390> also

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
the electronic ignition and you also

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.210 
the electronic ignition and you also
have<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> large<00:01:19.350> enough<00:01:19.470> gas<00:01:19.770> size<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
have to have a large enough gas size to

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.929 
have to have a large enough gas size to
go<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.939> as<00:01:21.450> far<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:23.159> economy

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
go to it so as far as the economy

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.880 
go to it so as far as the economy
version<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.810> gas<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.320> leisure<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
version the gas and leisure if you

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.109 
version the gas and leisure if you
already<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.580> place<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.000> to

already have that in place it's going to
be<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> cheaper<00:01:27.600> option<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.229> when<00:01:28.890> looking
