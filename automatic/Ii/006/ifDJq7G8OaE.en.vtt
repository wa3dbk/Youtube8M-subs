is went bought these they're just

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.340 
is went bought these they're just
plastic<00:00:19.949> spacers<00:00:20.779> just<00:00:21.779> set<00:00:21.990> those<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.260> there

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
plastic spacers just set those on there

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.330 
plastic spacers just set those on there
then<00:00:25.350> that's<00:00:25.560> gonna<00:00:27.650> sit<00:00:28.650> him<00:00:28.769> up<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.130> top

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
then that's gonna sit him up on top

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.810 
then that's gonna sit him up on top
there<00:00:29.550> then<00:00:30.330> you're<00:00:30.480> gonna<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.779> space<00:00:31.219> so<00:00:32.219> it

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
there then you're gonna have space so it

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.370 
there then you're gonna have space so it
allows<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.420> wheel<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:34.670> you<00:00:35.670> know<00:00:35.930> not<00:00:36.930> rub<00:00:37.230> up

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
allows the wheel to you know not rub up

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.080 
allows the wheel to you know not rub up
on<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.920> metal<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:41.160> now<00:00:41.399> what<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.610> got<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.250 
on the metal here so now what I got is a
spacer<00:00:43.520> then<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> wheel<00:00:44.899> then<00:00:45.899> another

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
spacer then the wheel then another

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.459 
spacer then the wheel then another
spacer<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.039> top<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.960> did<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.320> for

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
you do let's get a straight edge here

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.280 
you do let's get a straight edge here
and<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.470> just<00:03:40.500> kind<00:03:41.130> of<00:03:41.220> see<00:03:42.080> what<00:03:43.080> do<00:03:43.200> you

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.890 
and you just kind of see what do you
want<00:03:43.500> these<00:03:43.650> little<00:03:43.860> wheels<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:45.060> fall<00:03:45.330> in<00:03:45.570> line

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
want these little wheels to fall in line

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:55.449 
want these little wheels to fall in line
with<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:46.950> access<00:03:47.730> hit<00:03:49.010> here<00:03:50.010> so

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.949 

these<00:03:56.459> wheels<00:03:56.700> are<00:03:56.849> a<00:03:56.909> lot<00:03:57.150> skinnier<00:03:57.599> than

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
these wheels are a lot skinnier than

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.470 
these wheels are a lot skinnier than
these<00:03:58.860> wheels<00:03:59.159> here<00:03:59.459> so<00:03:59.760> what<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.000> gotta<00:04:00.180> do

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
these wheels here so what you gotta do

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.630 
these wheels here so what you gotta do
is<00:04:01.379> that<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.709> want<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:01.980> put<00:04:02.159> it<00:04:02.280> right<00:04:02.400> in<00:04:02.549> the

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
is that you want to put it right in the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.780 
is that you want to put it right in the
middle<00:04:02.819> so<00:04:03.150> we<00:04:03.989> get<00:04:04.560> some<00:04:04.769> more<00:04:04.950> different

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
middle so we get some more different

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.229 
middle so we get some more different
size<00:04:05.970> spacers<00:04:06.599> here<00:04:07.159> try<00:04:08.159> to<00:04:08.190> calculate<00:04:08.519> the

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
size spacers here try to calculate the

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.580 
size spacers here try to calculate the
thickness<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:10.670> this<00:04:11.670> here<00:04:12.319> plus<00:04:13.319> what<00:04:13.560> you

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
thickness of this here plus what you

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.250 
thickness of this here plus what you
need<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.720> can<00:04:15.720> see<00:04:15.930> right<00:04:16.109> there<00:04:16.310> yes<00:04:18.260> it

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
need so you can see right there yes it

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.439 
need so you can see right there yes it
makes<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.739> line<00:04:20.100> right<00:04:20.340> now<00:04:20.549> Center

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
makes it a line right now Center

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:27.350 
makes it a line right now Center
perfectly<00:04:25.430> all<00:04:26.430> right<00:04:26.490> now<00:04:26.580> I've<00:04:26.940> got<00:04:27.090> all<00:04:27.120> the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
perfectly all right now I've got all the

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.680 
perfectly all right now I've got all the
road<00:04:27.539> wheels<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:29.220> carriage<00:04:29.880> wheels<00:04:30.240> in<00:04:30.510> there

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
road wheels and carriage wheels in there

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:39.740 
road wheels and carriage wheels in there
both<00:04:31.169> sides<00:04:37.370> these<00:04:38.370> are<00:04:38.550> actually<00:04:38.910> up<00:04:39.030> just<00:04:39.479> a

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
both sides these are actually up just a

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:47.840 
both sides these are actually up just a
tad<00:04:40.050> bit<00:04:40.110> more<00:04:44.479> it's<00:04:45.479> all<00:04:45.600> right
