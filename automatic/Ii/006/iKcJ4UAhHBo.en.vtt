00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.879
 new video on the game with multichannel 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.049
 here is one of today again knows 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.929
 me maybe by do it yourself 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.490
 inspiration or great role there 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.530
 There are also many other videos of me 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.330
 I have you on this channel 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.920
 other times a successful box 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.869
 and today I want you 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.090
 something from the one channel would be great 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.160
 tells then introduce this 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.840
 knitting with it can be great 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.269
 Simple bracelets like this one 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.710
 You can work or even that for 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.439
 use other things 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.450
 These bands that you do with it that is 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.340
 super easy and really fun 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.590
 the instructions are on the back of the pack 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.320
 you need thin wool for that 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.030
 the needle is to work around the whole 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.500
 at it 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.780
 or you can do another 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.489
 use hooks or a crochet hook altogether 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.260
 how it works best for you 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.260
 i use this hard one is for 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.899
 me the needle is easier with me 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.640
 just not so good in the hand and has 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.930
 we still need a little bit of wool and 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.600
 then all can go already 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.579
 so you start with the knitliesel in 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.369
 which you the thread once through the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:11.850
 middle is going to drop out and down 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.580
 The fan once wrapped around a pin then 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.060
 let yourself in again and run inside 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.939
 Give it to the right of the next pin from 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.640
 above and then he intersects with himself 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.270
 even the colors and runs around the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.890
 next pin 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.520
 and rejoices with himself 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.470
 and again around the next pin and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.750
 this time he crosses himself with himself 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.929
 but now comes right back 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:46.110
 outward and is here for the first 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:48.360
 pin where the apartment is running inside and 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.100
 then through the knitting nipples 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.159
 over it i want to live around all around 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.549
 the next two pins also hold him 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.009
 firmly and take now the lower thread 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.610
 and pry powder in the middle 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.459
 see a little bit below and fall 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.390
 take the next one on the bottom and 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.790
 drop 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.790
 you have in our life 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:22.900
 drop and now really the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:28.170
 always want to take the bottom 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.170
 thread here shiver over and meaningless 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.200
 gibbs 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.230
 I pull the whole thing once and tight 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.510
 all slip down through and 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.940
 the whole fire is running through the 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.260
 through the track through children is a 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.420
 a bit transparent there are also here 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.310
 made of wood with this one can do the whole thing 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.370
 see that here in the video 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.250
 still and so I work the whole forest 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.850
 but I put as I said the thread 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:30.700
 Always take the pins from currencies 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.700
 the lower threads and put them over 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.420
 and soon you will see how the whole 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.770
 am looking the whole is longer and 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.500
 how to change the whole country 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.760
 as you can see, here is the whole thing 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.730
 tape in it 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.080
 someone is coming out of the thread and me 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.080
 work a bit further now 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.180
 pulling up 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.120
 gibbs 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:07.439
 that was again superior to the thread 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:07.439
 and pull up and hand over 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.840
 and down after the whole one 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.020
 a bit relaxed 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.790
 and a little bit down here 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.790
 could work well on top 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:34.459
 and if the whole is long and is with 

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:34.459
 her a nail 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.640
 cuts into ride 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.789
 now pulls the thread once through all 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.940
 we have to go from below respectively 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.000
 by 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.469
 Not 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.280
 once through the last one on 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.729
 watch really on it I would 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.830
 only through the 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:40.789
 bender does not see through the eyes themselves 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:45.529
 and then you can lose weight 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:48.779
 simply press up him pull out 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:50.969
 pull tight on top and the whole thing 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:52.919
 looks like this 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:55.550
 then you have such a small country that 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:58.289
 For example, you can wear a bracelet 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.699
 looks really cute and if 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.469
 The whole thing has faked me 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.999
 my channel great role over for it 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:05.150
 He does not do many great things to you 

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:07.279
 can make with crochet knit 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.110
 so a little something with the knitting 

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:11.819
 very different things and as I said 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.520
 I am always looking for an abo 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:16.589
 Just pass by and see you next 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.460
 but times for on a video in which 

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:19.460
 game with multi-channel
