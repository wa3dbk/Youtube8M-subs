 or 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.380
 this Friday January 29 they showed up at 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.690
 the facilities of the general prosecutor's office 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.820
 three of those allegedly responsible 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.849
 attack to juan manuel oaks student 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.650
 of nursing and the first in 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.070
 show was mónica patricia bouquets 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.070
 towers 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.570
 then elías delgadillo and finally 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.059
 daniel zanni who did not declare to the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.210
 means the public ministry hosting 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.130
 Article 20 constitutional 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:43.280
 [Music] 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:51.250
 to test aggression towards us 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:52.960
 [Music] 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.260
 because it does not give any statement of 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.260
 front 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.329
 and then 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.460
 [Music] 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.290
 in the place there was also the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.659
 Licensed Rosario Lomas Salinas 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.439
 defender of sweet the minor involved 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.439
 however, he did not state in the case 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.440
 legal I do not know then not the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.440
 legal representative because he questions me 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.270
 I am private and I am not obligated 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.220
 clear but as it is the part that is 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.340
 being accused as we can be 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.340
 tell 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.190
 the defense attorney explained that this is 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.280
 a legal strategy 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:47.420
 We already knew what records exist that 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.700
 probanza have been collected and we define that 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.160
 there is not enough data to have a 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.140
 clear story on the basis of which power 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.640
 issue a statement then the most 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.150
 convenient for defense is if not 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.510
 I have a clear story who how 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.550
 when where based on what I'm going to 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.930
 state accurately if you already had a 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.180
 clear inquiry in which there 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.640
 very specific imputations and not to a 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.680
 single account assignment alone 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.150
 then that absurdity that I lend myself to 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.860
 declare about something that does not fit 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.180
 clear even further when they already 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.770
 are in conditions that 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.210
 They clarified the file and issued their 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.290
 statement then we will already know those 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.000
 details 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.400
 you're going to need some charge with a ham 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.400
 a face-off in this phase is not feasible 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.180
 serious injuries 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.280
 a concrete fact appears and the 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.329
 classification of the fact as it can 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.859
 modify 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.910
 later the legal classification 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.010
 a premeditation 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.810
 [Music] 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.329
 it is a story that refers then the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.730
 prosecutor finally in which he 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.650
 mention that you have published that 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.750
 is the one that pours in the one that is said 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.150
 offended up there but there are no others 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.090
 data that corroborate stay here in 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.040
 saltillo are going information either not 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.950
 know but they can be the beginning then 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.739
 they are simply came to testify 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.159
 are not yet subject to any process not 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.709
 they have an obligation of their experience 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.209
 if they were free to take advantage of 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.709
 occasion then if they acquire a series 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.640
 of legal obligations to remain in 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.049
 the city ​​otherwise 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.180
 [Music] 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.560
 there are many legal formulas 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.349
 It is a class of crimes that are not serious 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.360
 to get his freedom rather than 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.910
 never the leg 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.890
 about it everardo rosales commented 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.450
 effectively today's comparison 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.760
 in the morning people discuss 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.160
 declare on injuries caused by 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.470
 manuel in gender these people are 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.690
 reserved the right to declare 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.690
 taking advantage of article 20 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.110
 and more, however, this representation 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.600
 social will continue with the integration of 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.450
 man 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.040
 in this case for nothing 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.340
 good as regards this authority and 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.340
 do 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.889
 there is a friend 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.829
 there is a procedure that you have to 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.030
 perform when the offended 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.270
 that is, with this benefit 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.160
 it could be fixed again well we were 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.170
 integrating for the crime of injuries and 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.520
 omission degree of attempt already threw up 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.860
 while the file is not concluded 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.260
 we can see the aggravates if indeed 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.540
 was cited the offended to speak for 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.600
 that in the birds of the procedure and 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.280
 so this person submits we can be 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.580
 us people in case you do not know 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:54.379
 turn to court 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.379
