habitat and we have some space here and

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.490 
habitat and we have some space here and
there<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.239> notice<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:13.080> has

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
there it is you notice that it has

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.760 
there it is you notice that it has
really<00:02:13.770> beige<00:02:14.160> kind<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.910> color<00:02:15.150> brown<00:02:16.050> horns

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
really beige kind of color brown horns

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.340 
really beige kind of color brown horns
recycling<00:02:17.670> symbol<00:02:17.940> right<00:02:18.330> on<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.660> chest<00:02:19.050> and

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
recycling symbol right on the chest and

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.970 
recycling symbol right on the chest and
I<00:02:19.740> guess<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.250> bin<00:02:20.640> as<00:02:20.910> its<00:02:21.390> back<00:02:22.020> which<00:02:22.680> is

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
I guess the bin as its back which is

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.080 
I guess the bin as its back which is
kind<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.460> weird

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
kind of weird

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.870 
kind of weird
hey<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.960> bred<00:02:25.380> some<00:02:25.620> more<00:02:25.860> legendary<00:02:26.370> dragons

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
hey we bred some more legendary dragons

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.710

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.270 
you'll notice the dragon he's shaking
the<00:02:35.700> bin<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.390> think<00:02:37.290> that's<00:02:37.530> what<00:02:37.709> he's<00:02:37.920> doing

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
the bin I think that's what he's doing

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.100 
the bin I think that's what he's doing
I'm<00:02:38.790> not<00:02:38.850> sure<00:02:39.150> let<00:02:39.330> me<00:02:39.390> know<00:02:39.630> what<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.930> think

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
he's doing I think he's shaking the bin

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.870 
he's doing I think he's shaking the bin
his<00:02:42.570> symbol<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.320> shaking<00:02:43.830> as<00:02:43.950> well<00:02:44.250> that's<00:02:44.610> a

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
his symbol is shaking as well that's a

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.729 
his symbol is shaking as well that's a
really<00:02:45.180> strange<00:02:45.540> thing<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:46.020> see<00:02:46.200> when<00:02:46.680> he

really strange thing you see when he

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.010 
really strange thing you see when he
shakes<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.190> bin<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.940> symbol<00:02:48.390> shakes<00:02:48.660> that's

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
shakes the bin the symbol shakes that's

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.560 
shakes the bin the symbol shakes that's
the<00:02:49.290> animation<00:02:50.070> we're<00:02:50.220> gonna<00:02:50.400> move<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:51.030> what

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
the animation we're gonna move on what

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.750 
the animation we're gonna move on what
we're<00:02:51.810> gonna<00:02:51.989> do<00:02:52.320> now<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:53.600> try<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:55.550> check<00:02:56.550> out

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
we're gonna do now is try to check out

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.500 
we're gonna do now is try to check out
the<00:02:56.940> next<00:02:57.209> evolution<00:02:58.550> at<00:02:59.550> level<00:02:59.910> 4<00:03:00.180> there<00:03:00.390> it

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
the next evolution at level 4 there it

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.710 
the next evolution at level 4 there it
is<00:03:00.600> next<00:03:01.320> evolution<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.970> notice<00:03:03.270> that<00:03:03.450> he<00:03:03.600> has

is next evolution you notice that he has

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.140 
is next evolution you notice that he has
two<00:03:03.959> bins<00:03:04.230> now<00:03:04.470> he<00:03:04.800> had<00:03:04.920> one<00:03:05.280> bin<00:03:05.580> before<00:03:05.790> him

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
two bins now he had one bin before him

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.330 
two bins now he had one bin before him
you<00:03:06.330> know<00:03:06.450> one<00:03:06.780> bin<00:03:07.080> was<00:03:07.350> like<00:03:07.590> fine<00:03:07.950> now<00:03:08.280> he

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
you know one bin was like fine now he

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.440 
you know one bin was like fine now he
has<00:03:08.610> do<00:03:08.910> bins

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
has do bins

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.720 
has do bins
one<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.440> them's<00:03:10.590> blue<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.160> other<00:03:11.280> one<00:03:11.520> is

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
one of them's blue the other one is

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.180 
one of them's blue the other one is
black<00:03:12.000> cymbal<00:03:12.690> recycling<00:03:13.350> bin<00:03:13.620> right<00:03:13.890> on<00:03:14.070> the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
black cymbal recycling bin right on the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.090 
black cymbal recycling bin right on the
chest<00:03:14.520> what<00:03:15.209> else<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:16.200> horns<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.800> course

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
chest what else is the horns of course

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.020 
chest what else is the horns of course
his<00:03:17.370> horns<00:03:17.730> has<00:03:17.910> gone<00:03:18.120> bigger<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:19.670> hair<00:03:20.670> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
his horns has gone bigger the hair the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.820 
his horns has gone bigger the hair the
green<00:03:21.269> hair<00:03:21.540> he's<00:03:21.750> still<00:03:22.019> shaking<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.620> bin

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
green hair he's still shaking the bin

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.070 
green hair he's still shaking the bin
actually<00:03:23.250> there's<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.519> total<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.090> four<00:03:24.450> bins<00:03:24.780> if

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
actually there's a total of four bins if

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.410 
actually there's a total of four bins if
you<00:03:25.170> look<00:03:25.380> at<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.709> correctly<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.459> could<00:03:27.269> be

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
you look at it correctly I could be

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.550 
you look at it correctly I could be
wrong<00:03:27.600> though<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:27.959> looks<00:03:28.140> like<00:03:28.230> there's<00:03:28.530> four

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
wrong though it looks like there's four

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.750 
wrong though it looks like there's four
bins<00:03:30.049> there<00:03:31.049> are<00:03:31.140> actually<00:03:31.410> small<00:03:31.830> bins<00:03:32.130> in<00:03:32.489> my

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
bins there are actually small bins in my

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.930 
bins there are actually small bins in my
opinion<00:03:33.480> that's<00:03:34.230> my<00:03:34.380> opinion<00:03:34.680> I'm<00:03:34.950> not<00:03:34.980> 100%

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
opinion that's my opinion I'm not 100%

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.050 
opinion that's my opinion I'm not 100%
sure<00:03:36.000> but<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:37.500> guess<00:03:37.769> his<00:03:37.980> whole<00:03:38.160> anime<00:03:38.730> game

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
sure but I guess his whole anime game

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.740 
sure but I guess his whole anime game
animation<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:40.200> gonna<00:03:40.410> be<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.769> been<00:03:41.750> shaking

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
animation is gonna be this been shaking

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.140 
animation is gonna be this been shaking
kinda<00:03:43.380> thing<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.709> he's<00:03:44.250> kind<00:03:44.489> of<00:03:44.730> doing

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
kinda thing that he's kind of doing

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.800 
kinda thing that he's kind of doing
they're<00:03:45.709> shaking<00:03:46.820> alright<00:03:47.820> so<00:03:48.299> that's<00:03:48.660> the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
they're shaking alright so that's the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.050 
they're shaking alright so that's the
second<00:03:49.320> form<00:03:49.620> as<00:03:49.829> well<00:03:50.040> we're<00:03:50.340> gonna<00:03:50.459> move<00:03:50.760> on

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
second form as well we're gonna move on

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.800 
second form as well we're gonna move on
and<00:03:51.299> check<00:03:51.890> out<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.160> next<00:03:54.170> evolution<00:03:56.540> here<00:03:57.540> it

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
and check out the next evolution here it

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.530 
and check out the next evolution here it
is<00:03:58.140> in<00:03:58.700> final<00:03:59.700> form<00:04:00.680> he<00:04:01.680> has<00:04:01.769> more<00:04:02.010> bins

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
is in final form he has more bins

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.509 
is in final form he has more bins
definitely<00:04:03.540> more<00:04:03.780> bins<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:04.470> now<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.310> could

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
definitely more bins and now you could

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.789 
definitely more bins and now you could
definitely<00:04:05.730> make<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.239> out<00:04:06.510> there's<00:04:06.750> six<00:04:07.380> bins

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
definitely make it out there's six bins

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.360 
definitely make it out there's six bins
there's<00:04:08.579> a<00:04:08.670> really<00:04:08.910> small<00:04:09.269> square<00:04:09.840> bins<00:04:10.370> one

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
there's a really small square bins one

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.420 
there's a really small square bins one
on<00:04:11.519> each<00:04:11.700> side<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:12.500> also<00:04:13.500> notice<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.130> he's

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
on each side you also notice that he's

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.340 
on each side you also notice that he's
doing<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.760> sort<00:04:14.970> of<00:04:15.030> animation<00:04:15.660> right<00:04:15.870> there<00:04:16.140> I

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
doing a sort of animation right there I
