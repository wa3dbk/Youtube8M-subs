00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.389
 hello and welcome to gamer express 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.339
 destiny has come out since a good 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.450
 week and already we start to look 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.789
 in the rearview mirror 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.859
 waiting for the fateful test that we 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.810
 will soon deliver benjamin on the most 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.250
 huge output of this comeback in term 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.570
 budget and turnover 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.279
 in particular it is a new 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.929
 license of unprecedented scale in 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.669
 contrast in terms of the scores of 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.369
 test one is far from the goal that 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.050
 would have set activision-blizzard 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.789
 unlock a quality bonus of 2.5 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.469
 millions of dollars indeed the average 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.750
 scores achieved so far 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.489
 is around 77 percent then 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.239
 that it is the bar of 90 that he would have 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.920
 had to reach 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.050
 remember however that a note between 7 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.699
 and 8 out of 10 is far from bad 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.100
 note in passing that the last raid 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.289
 uploaded yesterday on destiny has already been 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.000
 defeated by a clan named point guard 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.199
 if you already play to know 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.239
 also that the frequency of 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.769
 public events was doubled without 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.510
 doubt that most players 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.460
 have now finished the story mode 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.870
 available at launch ubisoft us 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.640
 today serves a new trailer 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.500
 dedicated to assassin's coop mode 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.659
 creed unity remember that the goal 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.189
 of a trailer is to present a game 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.229
 in its best light to do 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.299
 discover certain aspects and give 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.470
 want to play 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.880
 and yes, several things bothered me 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.590
 in this new trailer for 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.820
 start I find that music is 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.829
 very poorly chosen and it's totally 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.540
 subjective more annoying aside 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.579
 some great shots on 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.259
 the city the video shows only the 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.710
 fight and assassins who walk to 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.360
 slow motion 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.979
 so it's true a little variation 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.509
 in usable weapons and no doubt 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.430
 a good idea but I have a little trouble 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.200
 with the concept of the discreet assassin 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.670
 who walks with an ax to see you tomorrow 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 not to mention the fact that it starts to 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.670
 do a little bit of free violence 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.710
 for a single game finally and maybe 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.229
 especially what's missing in this trailer 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.030
 dedicated to the coop is the coop 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.649
 so I leave you alone judge but do not 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.899
 do not tell me that the murderer with 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.210
 his green clown coat is not a little 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.979
 ridiculous despite everything we say ah 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.320
 if the unit is expected to stand firm 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.509
 November 13th on pc and ps 4 and 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.760
 xbox one the tokyo game show begins 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.770
 officially tomorrow 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.360
 conferences have already taken place and two 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.370
 new images were released to 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.229
 start with the event within 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.830
 whose release is scheduled for 14 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.210
 October 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.650
 we change our point of view with this 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.750
 trailer since his narrator and 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.520
 the disturbing character hooded 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.500
 that was surreptitiously seen in 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.060
 first videos the silence pursuit 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.830
 that pitiless staging in his 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.600
 images stands out as a metaphor for 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.790
 the terrifying situation of the hero 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.530
 unable to escape the grip of this 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.090
 horrible character on his mind in 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.950
 effect the policeman prisoner of an asylum 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.480
 disused seems to be clearly losing 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.220
 the mind and one wonders with a 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.050
 some concern but that is not the one 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.060
 there not wanted if the end of the game does not 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.620
 do not reserve a fashionable final twist 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.720
 Hollywood but she remains optimistic 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.490
 and it is impossible for the moment to 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.140
 to distinguish between the real and 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.760
 the imaginary in situations 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.860
 which the unfortunate hero is 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.420
 confronted and that's good because 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.610
 this allows us even before we have 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.390
 started playing to identify us a 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.450
 little to him 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.660
 the game will be released on pc and ps3 ps4 xbox 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.890
 360 and xbox on the day issue we 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.800
 just say n who ask 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.660
 info about final fantasy 15 an article from 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.670
 game in farmer that has been removed since 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.680
 but fortunately not before being 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.840
 recovered in screenshot shows that 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.720
 square enix will release a playable demo of 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.820
 ff 15 on ps4 xbox one current 2015 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.620
 this downloadable demo will answer the 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.390
 sweet name of the sky and she gets 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.070
 will obviously focus on the beginning of the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.780
 game it would seemingly be possible 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.209
 to obtain access tickets to this demo 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.890
 by buying final fantasy type-0 and day 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.600
 which will be released March 17 in the United States 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.860
 so we can hope that the demo will be 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.690
 available around March or 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.680
 next april comes on purpose it's over 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.780
 for today we meet again tomorrow 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.430
 but by then do not forget to see the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.180
 world with a benevolent eye 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.180
 and critical
