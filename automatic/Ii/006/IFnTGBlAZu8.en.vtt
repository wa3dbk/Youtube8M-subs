00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:14.460
 continuing to innovate is always a 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.000
 distressing for me so a good bush 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.730
 huh 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.270
 when this bird was created it was thought 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.710
 for a big future and not for him to 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.390
 just for that moment 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.490
 We're always looking for things. 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.920
 that have a process of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.040
 enchantment every year for her to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.590
 really she has two people 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.020
 Not what I'm going to see this year and 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.559
 we have achieved this over the past 17 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.559
 years 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.090
 I really enjoyed doing all the fast had 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.210
 a break from Granny who is a 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.180
 very very romantic thing 2 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.590
 it was all an income that does not want 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.109
 It was the most beautiful, but it was a 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.949
 that touched me very much because 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.619
 was remembered by my grandmother but all 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.900
 the other trees were made with the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.780
 same affection with the same grip with 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.610
 same thought with the same love 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.020
 to pass the love of people with 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.689
 lagoon rodrigo de freitas and the beach of 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.189
 insurance and there I think she saw 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.280
 that would be a very good thing not only 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.579
 to the city as it was for those who will see 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.680
 the tree and I think she's from 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.750
 Congratulations on believing that 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.750
 project that really is a success 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.799
 winning, we have an element that 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.890
 we will put in the water that we always 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.619
 floated in the lagoon this time she 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.490
 there will be a table that is a 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.920
 underneath it is just a great 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.360
 novelty we are going to use that we 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.360
 we do not use this element
