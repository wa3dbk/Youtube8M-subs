00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 I often see such comments on the Internet 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.089
 they say comics are for kids 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.240
 graphic novels I'm in kindergarten 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.639
 read and all in the same spirit and of course 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.070
 I absolutely disagree with that 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.289
 for example comics freak angels owner 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.029
 two needle awards and nominations for 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.830
 British Fantasy Prize 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.590
 Here is a childish book such 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.269
 of course no and yes age 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.400
 restrictions African african say themselves 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.449
 for myself and in our country the comic was 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.510
 published by publisher 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.759
 xl media thanks for that as always 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.610
 otherwise I probably never read 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.680
 would his link to them in the description of the video 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.440
 the plot of the book tells us about events 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.840
 after the apocalypse but everything looks 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.420
 a little softer than we used to see in 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.149
 postapocalypse ah what usually for us 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.520
 world after the end of the world of course tough 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.949
 ruin semi zombies wandering through the streets 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.770
 lack of food then and no streets 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.030
 probably in short fallout flipper 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.780
 ace and complete obscurantism nothing holy to 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.420
 phreak angel everything postapocalypse 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.299
 a little bit different for example people have food 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.850
 there is clean water in principle even goes 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.500
 life if not peer then and special 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.799
 ruin it and then there is everything enough 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.740
 I sincerely note that I am reviewing on 1 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.360
 tom further can of course change but 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.720
 first there it produces exactly 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.950
 impression impression of sincerity 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.200
 calm post apocalypse 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.939
 which you can even dream 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.280
 in our vanity time 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.500
 where everyone owes wildly for someone though 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.540
 even stoop radio small money 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.670
 some way the same thought 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.070
 slips and comic characters 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.350
 what seems to be after the apocalypse and life 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.630
 between these speeches we have become sweeter 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.030
 We find out what these heroes seem to be and 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.299
 to blame for what happened at the end of the world and 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.460
 heroes call themselves rick angels plot 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.130
 tells that in England 23 years 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.979
 12 babies were born back and here are six 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.930
 years ago, it was the end of the world 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.079
 there are 12 babies this is wreck 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.460
 angels and people with unusual abilities 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.009
 having the ability to read minds 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.500
 communicate through thoughts and in general 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.300
 poking around in the heads of people he is the first 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.530
 doesn't tell how the world was brought 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.960
 of such a condition 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.820
 but 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.730
 show that the ability of these same 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.980
 phreak angels are extremely great for example in 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.440
 the beginning of the book during a meeting with alice 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.420
 howl chip or district of london which 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.520
 by the way is known to most of the story 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.300
 scars holmes and and by criminal influence 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.880
 Jack the Ripper 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.790
 comes to the area in short alice with 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.260
 bypassed and bad intentions 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.980
 it turns out that the phreak angel killed her 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.690
 family 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.090
 she of course like all sensible people in 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.190
 whatever situation is sincere year and you 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.200
 shouts that will kill everyone and everyone 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.350
 involved in the murder of her family 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.780
 I note that she'll put on just Cipolla 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.940
 someone got her a hard idea 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.640
 go scream an angel and arrange there 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.180
 moorie actually and sent another 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.860
 phreak angel let's call him 12 he was 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.170
 banished once upon a time from this 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.480
 community and apparently because 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.730
 worked some kind of lewdness later we 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.550
 we find out that from the family of Alice most likely 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.680
 killed precisely he and of course afrikantov 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.040
 I have to calm the girl Alice 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.220
 Of course not trya calm and calm down 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.170
 it is here that their abilities are revealed 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.970
 further shows us that africa angels 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.130
 like they themselves are not happy with their 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.530
 abilities they understand that it is early or 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.200
 late their involvement in the end of the world so and 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.720
 they will be involved but for now 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.210
 excellent and africa angels have towers on 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.790
 which they stand have lives that 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.830
 they live on these towers they stand 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.740
 watch the match and sex protect it 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.900
 in theory, the first volume introduces us to everything 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.120
 environment that is, it serves as such 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.670
 an introduction to the history of africa angels 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.790
 the reader will be shown life will show that all 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.310
 around the flooded will show the main characters 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.770
 and of course the scene of the battle that 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.760
 by the way once again confirm age 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.270
 restrictions 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.760
 blood much killing is really cruel 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.400
 already the beginning itself shows that the story will be 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.320
 sometimes tragic is probably not the case. 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.290
 Tome well in the second and third are the first 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.450
 community suspects 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.250
 angels phreak angel who is clearly 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.360
 overdoing to use their 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.610
 of opportunities 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.350
 Yes, not everything can be done if you have 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.720
 the ability to pick other people's brains 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.450
 african gella there is code that they 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.490
 apparently observe seriously do not go 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.620
 thoughts and don't use people 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.870
 and itâ€™s also seen that many characters 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.539
 a little bit got all the characters 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.370
 different someone explosive someone calm 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.590
 here he wants to hold on to everything 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.020
 far away and i'm wanging that in some kind of house 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.080
 there must be epic squabbles and just 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.360
 sad moments but not in this here like me 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.860
 already talked stupidly familiarity with the world and 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.530
 know this correctly 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.139
 otherwise it would be hard to grasp the characters 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.330
 many each individual each with 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.580
 their cockroaches well and plus feeling 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.220
 responsibility angels apparently have 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.530
 understanding that they did something wrong 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.599
 once the end of the world has come and this is for sure 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.090
 will be in one of the main topics on 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.400
 throughout all the houses because they 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.039
 sympathize with everything that happens 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.349
 cover edition hard stuff not 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.639
 glossy what I like so much to on 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.620
 glossy often prints 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.080
 fingers are not very cool 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.810
 page all numbered it too 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.789
 comfortable paper is hard nice and very 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.240
 it all fits comic style 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:27.550
 because colors and panning are soft 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.190
 comics are nice but not too bright what 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.570
 allows the reader to feel 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.509
 postapokalipsis and here he looks here 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.130
 to nothing I have already said that the end of the world 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.070
 here is quite positive therefore 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.169
 colors are soft but not dark 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.310
 quality is by no means gloomy 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.530
 translation at height 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.050
 clear font and no errors 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.900
 just not on the cover before 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.389
 there is a mistake on the cover and it's sad 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.699
 because everything is so perfect here you are 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.219
 You can this book she simply masterpiece 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.950
 and in such a prominent place kosyachok you name 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:02.310
 the author 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.740
 sorry about this I have to say basically 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.210
 he catches his eye this cant when 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.940
 toms stand together 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.460
 however, this fact is by no means 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.030
 spoils the reading itself and the story that we 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.060
 serve 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.310
 comic book authors raven or duffeld 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.580
 I tried to glory about them, I more 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.740
 tell in review 2 there is africa angels in 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.630
 Overall, Iâ€™m not really pleased with me 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.210
 In fact, even happy that he discovered 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.610
 we are used to such a story 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.950
 only batman and spiderman and other 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:35.160
 super heroes but no guys world of comics 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.960
 far deeper you just need to dig phreak 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.480
 angels not only interesting to read 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.700
 like a story with literate characters 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.160
 but it was nice to see England in the new 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.680
 light i'm just a fan of england itself 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.080
 and I noticed that everyone always draws her 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.890
 dark mystical tones in such styles 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.830
 so that there is a thick fog right guest and 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.350
 everything is completely different here people 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.930
 moves on boats to create some 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:04.260
 machines steam towers but at the same time 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.760
 a bunch of real buildings places that's nice then 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.920
 there is a future but it is not very far 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.350
 of course they are anyway these building 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.960
 suffered from doomsday but still 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.820
 cool to behold such references to 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.160
 reality if someone knows Andrew 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.200
 it will be two unpleasant for him 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.390
 see and at the end of the book by the way just 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.250
 There is a note in which all the references 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.810
 good-naturedly indicated by the authors that 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.610
 allows us to pay attention to everything 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.190
