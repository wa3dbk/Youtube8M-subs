but<00:02:59.780> yeah<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:00.710> don't<00:03:01.070> they're<00:03:01.700> not<00:03:01.880> actually

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
but yeah I don't they're not actually

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.640 
but yeah I don't they're not actually
imitable<00:03:02.540> but<00:03:02.780> they're<00:03:02.900> put<00:03:03.320> some<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.530> their

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
imitable but they're put some of their

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.740 
imitable but they're put some of their
programming<00:03:04.160> is

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.930 

oh<00:03:09.810> yeah<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.770> we<00:03:11.130> do<00:03:11.250> have<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.460> classic<00:03:11.640> metal

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
oh yeah and we do have the classic metal

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.160 
oh yeah and we do have the classic metal
sonic<00:03:12.210> model<00:03:12.600> there's<00:03:12.750> another<00:03:12.900> thing<00:03:15.170> yeah

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
sonic model there's another thing yeah

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.230 
sonic model there's another thing yeah
we<00:03:16.680> can<00:03:16.860> notice<00:03:17.160> supersonic<00:03:17.820> there's<00:03:18.030> not

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
we can notice supersonic there's not

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.820 
we can notice supersonic there's not
much<00:03:18.480> there<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.780> think<00:03:18.960> there<00:03:19.320> but<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.620> think

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
much there I think there but I think

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
much there I think there but I think
they're<00:03:19.950> trying<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.220> make<00:03:20.280> us<00:03:20.400> think<00:03:20.520> that

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
they're trying to make us think that

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.120 
they're trying to make us think that
they<00:03:20.970> scrapped<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.570> by<00:03:21.720> including<00:03:22.710> only

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
they scrapped it by including only

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.830 
they scrapped it by including only
assets<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:23.910> we're<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.300> previous<00:03:24.600> demo

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
assets that we're in the previous demo

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.720 
assets that we're in the previous demo
but<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.560> reason<00:03:25.710> why<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.010> think<00:03:26.190> that<00:03:26.520> they're

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
but the reason why I think that they're

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.430 
but the reason why I think that they're
just<00:03:27.000> tricking<00:03:27.360> us<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.630> because<00:03:27.780> there's

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
just tricking us is because there's

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.380 
just tricking us is because there's
something's<00:03:28.980> missing<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.880> were<00:03:30.120> in<00:03:30.300> the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
something's missing that were in the

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.670 
something's missing that were in the
first<00:03:30.570> demo<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:30.930> there's<00:03:31.080> also<00:03:31.200> some<00:03:31.470> things

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
first demo but there's also some things

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.740 
first demo but there's also some things
that<00:03:31.770> weren't<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.880> first<00:03:33.120> demo<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:33.540> are

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
that weren't in the first demo that are

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.210 
that weren't in the first demo that are
already<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.020> there<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:34.320> it's<00:03:34.470> kind<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.770> a<00:03:34.920> sign

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
already in there so it's kind of a sign

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.640 
already in there so it's kind of a sign
it's<00:03:35.580> like<00:03:35.790> an<00:03:36.230> example<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.410> course<00:03:37.500> we

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
it's like an example that of course we

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.190 
it's like an example that of course we
still<00:03:37.800> have<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:37.980> achievement<00:03:38.520> called

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
still have the achievement called

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.940 
still have the achievement called
supersonic<00:03:40.200> which<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:40.500> also<00:03:40.650> something

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
supersonic which is also something

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.090 
supersonic which is also something
leaked<00:03:41.250> out<00:03:41.459> on<00:03:41.790> Steve<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:43.620> just<00:03:43.830> shows<00:03:43.950> an
