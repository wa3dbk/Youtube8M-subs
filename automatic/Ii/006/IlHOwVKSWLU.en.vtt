00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.150
 in order to keep our body in 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.710
 the norm must drink as I have 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 said the right water 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.930
 why we have to consider our ph 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.529
 environment the fact is that acid-base 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.710
 balance for our body is 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.660
 slightly alkaline indicator there are some 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.010
 environments in our bodies which 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.680
 are directly acidic 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.079
 these are environments when they are connected 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.739
 directly from the function defined 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.600
 organ or system 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:56.309
 there is also an opinion that ph we should 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.460
 take sour that is some water must 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.680
 still be more sour than alkaline 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.250
 but I will emphasize again 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.850
 and in general it is sensitive and deep mine 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.060
 the belief that ph is sour he is present 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.939
 only then is it somewhere 6 and 9 6 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.820
 8 and then naturally there can be water 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.729
 could be with this indicator if we 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.130
 really fit uttermost 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.799
 norm that is if the person is healthy 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.840
 physical and healthy energetically then 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.140
 it is an indisputable fact 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.360
 now at this stage when a person 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.509
 is in these conditions in these 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.840
 traditions of nutrition traditions of the system 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.450
 in which he lives is brought up 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.479
 evolving we cannot recommend 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.450
 other indicators of water as weak 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.149
 only as weakly alkaline 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.430
 why because we are sour 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.690
 almost constantly 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.420
 We are in the use of our usual 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.750
 food all processes inside 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.650
 our body go through 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.280
 redox reactions 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:12.209
 they are necessary moments in 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.630
 in our exchange, but when we eat food 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.680
 which is absorbed through education 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.090
 more 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.730
 acids than alkalis we own body 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.910
 we enter that is a ph indicator except 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.840
 shifted to the acidic side I already 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:34.190
 said it was incompatible with life 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.050
 and the health of our body and therefore 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.170
 the body uses its own reserves 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.870
 to neutralize this problem that is 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.110
 the body uses its own calcium 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.650
 magnesium from bones and skeleton is washed away 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.660
 this is what develops the disease to 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.850
 after u sail or exchange violation 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.489
 due to the lack of minerals we 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.489
 sour food we sour 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.890
 improper use of drinks because 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.030
 that all the drinks that are presented on 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.610
 Ukraineâ€™s market has a sour ph and sharply 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.610
 positive indicator 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.280
 redox 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.959
 pvp capacity 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.670
 vodichka toraya processed so 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.510
 the way pak I told 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:25.200
 has a ph index slightly alkaline then 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:29.459
 there is it from 7.5 to 9.6 it is weak 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.660
 alkaline background and negative in 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.290
 figure from -30 to minus 300 that is 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.540
 what we can get with 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.310
 hyacinths are underway 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.650
 such water here at this stage of ours 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.920
 existence she helps 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.930
 neutralize 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.579
 those processes that occur inside 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.989
 us destructive 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:59.170
 and restores us the water becomes 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.819
 antioxidant is a property which 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.230
 give own negative 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.790
 electronic engineers that she is saturated and 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.209
 becomes a kind of healing 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.849
 prophylactic water which can 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.669
 restore our body to neutralize 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.889
 then exposure to food and the environment 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.160
 on us on our bodies remove this 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.710
 destructive effect of oxidizing 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.880
 oxidant reactions that we get 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.610
 now more than we get 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.550
 reducing agents so here is the complex 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.479
 water purification that offers 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.690
 hyacinth is sufficient 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:45.229
 for cooking water at home 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.380
 high quality conditions that is it 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:51.020
 water that almost matches 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.210
 our cellular water this water will 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.849
 easy to digest 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.909
 the body will not waste energy on 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:01.430
 assimilation of this water and naturally that 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:04.970
 the energy that will be released she 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.949
 will go on you putting down our 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.470
 health to increase our 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.389
 disability on termination 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.699
 aging processes within us that is 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.990
 general background state of the body on 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:19.669
 The use of this water is improving and 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.280
 if we still stick 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.820
 proper drinking regimen ie this 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.400
 almost 30 milliliters of water on 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.690
 a kilo of weight is right 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:35.560
 drinking mode drinking some water husband 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:39.520
 sips during the day or you can 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.340
 break water intake if 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.130
 man will teach to this volume of water but 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.930
 better if water is drunk and sips in 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.590
 during the day then it is better absorbed 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.420
 and it is more natural for the body 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.070
 because constantly in the body 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:59.760
 creates the right environment which 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:02.650
 aligns this some water does not need to immediately 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.260
 force your body to use 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.200
 plenty of water because you 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:12.100
 you understand that when a person does not 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.890
 accustomed to the correct drinking regime it 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:18.580
 immediately affects his excretory 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:20.650
 system so if there are any 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.740
 kidney problems 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.750
 have any chronic diseases 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.680
 there are times when man is not at all 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:31.840
 drinks little water he thinks it's his 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.510
 a certain rate then you need 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.080
 gradually accustom yourself to the right 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:40.870
 drinking some water and the right mode 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.280
 then here it will be all 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.070
 first stage 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.160
 recovery in order to recover 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.980
 cellular respiration to the cell 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.500
 started breathing and if the cell starts 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.390
 breathe that 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.520
 organs respiratory organs of the cell 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.580
 mitochondria begin normally 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.490
 generate energy that is this 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:07.090
 energy that said yes it will 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:10.030
 enough to restore at first 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:13.919
 the stage of those moments that a bunch of theory 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.919
 you fix in your body
