00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.830
 to put us out of work we stopped 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.970
 in the purchases now we 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.090

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.440
 entitled the pearls of the forum dofus us 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.890

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.449
 forum 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.820
 hoping you're typing a 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.289
 good dose of laughter this show will be 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.439
 always presented by jean kevin and me 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.450

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.059
 foam so we will introduce you 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.710
 the first pearl of the show take 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.450
 the time to read image by pressing 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.460
 pause it's really worth it 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.710
 the first thing that shocks me in this 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.300
 message is that apparently the player 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.579
 has a team stopped with a 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.290
 silouate panoplie and me who thought that 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.629
 his servers did not have any 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.579
 panoplies in his name do not ask us 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.350
 please translate what is there 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.399
 to score the kikoolol does not do 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.559
 part of our contract 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.059
 what I learned from this message 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.800
 is that he was banished a 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.850
 character without any reason 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.350
 well let's go to number 2 here we 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.819
 find one of our subscribers who has 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.039
 surely had to buy the pack of the maj in 

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:13.259
 cardboard because it makes a post far to 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.060
 denounce classes cheap and prepare 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.020
 so a nerve of these classes for them 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.389
 next updates 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.759
 by the way I would like to know who is the 

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:22.979
 mother of dofus someone who also speaks 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.799
 badly of my mother I have already disassembled them 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.599
 so let's move on to number 3 want in 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.279
 speaking of moms we are entitled to 

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:31.770
 a multitude of ways to insult the 

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:33.630
 moms on the part of razer demons it's 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.969
 a forum moderator for the uneducated 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.560
 to your friend jean kÃ©vin moderators 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.340
 did they have to describe these kinds of things 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.799
 even for trolling 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.450
 of course it's well known that 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.450
 forum moderators are all powerful 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.159
 for example I know that heretics was 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.529
 banned from the forum for incitement to 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.310
 suicide that's funny let's move on to 

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:55.349
 number 4 so here I'm stunned me who 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.039
 I'm so famous you never ask 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:57.599
 autograph 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.099
 I find it super cute 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:01.489
 personally keeps hope 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:04.229
 I will send his skate park a box 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:05.580
 you do not have the right to troll he has 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.250
 been super polished at least 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.020
 let's go to the last issue this time 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.700
 we can not find words 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.680
 but someone who addresses himself to flush 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.600
 months in person I have never seen 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.340
 a level of 3 as high I have 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.130
 find this guy to make my 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.050
 professor me I especially think that this 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.970
 guy is trying to get banned from the forum 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.160
 in the most original way possible 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.570
 that's all for this first 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.730
 issue of forum beads 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.250
 we hope you enjoyed the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.690
 video if that's not the case you can 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.490
 always insulted rhetoric in the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.490
 comments that our boss
