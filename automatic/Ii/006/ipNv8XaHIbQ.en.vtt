00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.060 
within a lot longer it's just past Ray's
Hill<00:03:02.480> tunnel<00:03:02.720> but<00:03:03.080> it's<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.290> nice<00:03:03.500> preserved

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
Hill tunnel but it's a nice preserved

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.060 
Hill tunnel but it's a nice preserved
section<00:03:04.610> my<00:03:05.270> guess<00:03:05.510> is<00:03:05.780> they<00:03:06.170> probably<00:03:06.440> paved

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
section my guess is they probably paved

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
section my guess is they probably paved
it<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:07.520> later<00:03:08.209> time<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:09.340> test<00:03:10.340> asphalt<00:03:10.940> and

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
it in later time to test asphalt and

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.490 
it in later time to test asphalt and
what-have-you<00:03:11.630> because<00:03:11.959> they<00:03:12.080> did<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.470> a

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
what-have-you because they did that a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.710 
what-have-you because they did that a
lot<00:03:12.739> four<00:03:13.520> years<00:03:13.760> after<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.270> tunnel<00:03:14.450> was

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
lot four years after the tunnel was

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.250 
lot four years after the tunnel was
closed

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
another nice section of road even got

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.040 
another nice section of road even got
paint<00:03:25.459> lines<00:03:25.700> on<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.000> but<00:03:26.360> once<00:03:26.570> again<00:03:26.720> I'm

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
paint lines on it but once again I'm

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.540 
paint lines on it but once again I'm
sure<00:03:27.230> those<00:03:27.410> were<00:03:27.470> experimental

you<00:06:15.210> had<00:06:15.389> to<00:06:15.509> go<00:06:15.659> through<00:06:15.930> this<00:06:16.080> tunnel<00:06:16.409> one

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
you had to go through this tunnel one

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.890 
you had to go through this tunnel one
lane<00:06:17.039> each<00:06:17.280> way<00:06:17.520> can<00:06:17.819> you<00:06:17.849> imagine<00:06:18.180> tractor

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
lane each way can you imagine tractor

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.959 
lane each way can you imagine tractor
trailers<00:06:19.379> coming<00:06:20.219> in<00:06:20.340> opposite<00:06:20.819> directions

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:23.969 
and this is this little hump is the only

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:26.869 
and this is this little hump is the only
thing<00:06:24.210> that's<00:06:25.099> dividing<00:06:26.099> the<00:06:26.249> road<00:06:26.460> that's

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:26.879 
thing that's dividing the road that's

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:29.749 
thing that's dividing the road that's
already<00:06:27.270> very<00:06:27.689> narrow<00:06:28.110> I<00:06:28.460> can't<00:06:29.460> even<00:06:29.550> imagine

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
already very narrow I can't even imagine
