00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.510
 the days go by slowly and many times 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.000
 we were alone 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.740
 but then there are happy times for 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.310
 let be in friendship 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.439
 Look, we are 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.570
 a destination skillfully drove the 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.570
 hours and the company gushed 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.340
 there were nights 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.490
 to the love of them we understood 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.370
 words 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.329
 the words that we then leave for 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.659
 go up more 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.370
 we started being the companions that 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:54.040
 know above the voice 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.820
 or the signal 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.860
 Yes now 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.660
 Gentle words can rise 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.660
 those that do not say things anymore 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.020
 float lightly on the air 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.330
 because we are locked in 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.490
 world 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.490
 sarmento sos of accumulated history 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.050
 and there is the company that we form 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:26.100
 leafy presence 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:29.210
 behind each one he veils his house the field 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.210
 distance 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.150
 but silent 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.070
 I want to tell you something 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.460
 I just want to tell you that we are all 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.460
 together 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.170
 Sometimes when speaking, someone forgets his arm 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.170
 over mine 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.049
 and I, even if I 'm quiet, I thank you 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.409
 because the pass in the bodies already 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.750
 we want to tell you how all 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.300
 we brought our lives here for 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.720
 count them 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.500
 long with each other in the 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.400
 corner we talk 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.439
 so many months that we do not know well 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.439
 for us the external pain 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.880
 and the weather 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.880
 everything is understood 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.350
 but silent 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:39.090
 I want to tell you something, I just want to tell you 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.090
 that we are all together
