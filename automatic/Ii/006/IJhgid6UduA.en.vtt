00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.710

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.400
 Drivers are attached somewhere in person 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.210
 attached 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.610
 Likely here to me I always pay on it 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.620
 attention because here I myself remembering 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.030
 his school years that is poison was hanging out 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.650
 how to face 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.810
 in the hole there was no 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.760
 supervision that is went to school graduated 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.760
 school and everything is left to itself 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.570
 occupation they are from the pores everything is always going 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.180
 somehow there with each other 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.830
 get organized here and go there 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.070
 playing baseball that is so 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.680
 nice to watch it that people are always here 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.479
 the most from childhood 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.630
 as if accustomed to such a joint 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:52.700
 activity she sees due to this 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.700
 them and this is formed their not Japanese 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.610
 consciousness is not feeling like that 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.790
 whether it is taken separately from 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.360
 personalities and that is exactly how you feel 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.920
 part of society part of some group 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.270
 Well, I think that it is very 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.730
 right feeling right 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.060
 education because man is one 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.860
 as if nothing of itself is 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.860
 group society is already a force 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.030
 Well, in general, you know, here it’s raining 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.350
 Japanese movies always when you watch u 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.310
 There are already many films about the school about 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.370
 studentship 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.470
 about all these here they are not a book tsu but then 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.730
 there are music clubs about interests 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.810
 some are always like that 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.700
 romantic movies 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.130
 in the sense that there are some adventures 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.840
 There experiences such they are very good 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.350
 yes that's how our Soviet something 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.160
 so remind from some kind of this 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.490
 there is a ball probably something that always us 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.800
 marine blind this class is good what 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.800
 Well , they have a nice Japanese childhood 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.120
 Well, of course there are people that you apparently 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.400
 anyway turn any 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.930
 tactics sea ​​and so on then at work 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.700
 in them is stress itself but still in childhood 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.760
 anyway, it looks like 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:26.610
 but not quite carefree 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:28.770
 but quite so joyous or something 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.690
 beauty note i understood why here 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.950
 I like it here because here 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.110
 very quietly you can hear only birds singing there 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.989
 tea because it is a seaport 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.620
 there is no such city 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.550
 there is no strong noise 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.260
 speaking there screaming there in general here 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.470
 such a nature primordial palaces themselves 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.640
 sometimes reminds of sales in Russia 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.950
 somewhere from there well except maybe 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.980
 in Japanese everything is well-groomed and beautiful then 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.280
 there is even in some such park trees 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.310
 anyway all the same trimmed and trash 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.829
 nowhere is everything very civilized 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.829
 no poop there is no way 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.250
 feel so relax pointers 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.930
 Immediately everywhere there is good on Hokkaido 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.290
 j i think choose sudan a week 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.290
 all the same 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.430
 we 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.430
 resources 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:02.950
 here he speaks and understand cheese please 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.409
 what is the mass of any cheese for every taste 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.529
 Lesha 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:10.219
 that is, he himself very much trades prices 1600 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.219
 yen aggression 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.830
 repent and 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.220
 on the market themselves gums 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.520
 200 grams of oil for 1200 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.930
 baht drinking yoghurt as much as 500 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.100
 years to 500 milliliters 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.300
 and what is this report already 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.180
 as if everything should be expensive 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.810
 but none the less 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.810
 rivers cheese 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.470
 various services 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.700
 Huge selection of grain Hokkaido known 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.790
 the fact that there are many farms 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:53.270
 plenty of space to graze goats drag 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:56.380
 not goats and sheep cows therefore it is full here 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.380
 any super local 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.080
 something very expensive of course only if 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.080
 as a gift to someone brace 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.310
 on average, I think three times more expensive than 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:10.310
 ordinary cheese 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.480
 so but the most famous souvenirs from 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:20.960
 so up to this crude nailed means 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:23.820
 type white young man is cookies and 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:28.580
 serving cookies 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.580
 with dark and milk white chocolate 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.620
 if you brought someone this raw 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:38.520
 koibito it means you were on 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.850
 what kind of business card will help 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.850

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:49.699
 this car started to lose if the bottles 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.699
 who should be hazardous or not 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:07:03.509
 yes even Japanese technology once 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:05.610
 treatment is it like if there was gasoline all 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:08.479
 scary stories i think 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.479
