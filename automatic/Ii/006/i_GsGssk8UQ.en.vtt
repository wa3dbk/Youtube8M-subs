00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.790
 this lesson we are with you 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.000
 study works 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.750
 by material 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.279
 Yandex 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:22.279
 it allows you to make weaving elastic 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.380
 which expands our possibilities for example 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.020
 today we will create with you 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.059
 elastic bead and bead band 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.570
 so let's see how to create 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.730
 such a product within this to i will not 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.379
 show the performance of the entire product 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.370
 because it will take a lot 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.650
 time, I will only show a similar pattern and 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.320
 we will make a bracelet according to the principle 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.030
 such weaving and so we have in the arsenal 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.320
 should be spandex 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.719
 This elastic latex is not. further to us 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.280
 need two types of beads and 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.829
 same in diameter also bead 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.910
 smaller diameter further here such beads 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.460
 and beads of the seventh number why 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:14.149
 beads number 7 but because when working with 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:19.299
 spandex is best to use beads 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:21.710
 large size for example 7 6 5 number and 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.600
 so choose a spandex and a half long 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.689
 meters 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.299
 Leave the rest on the coil and 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.770
 let's start typing beads and beads like this 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.520
 here is a set first 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.509
 bead bead bead bead 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.590
 alternating this way creating a long 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:46.570
 strip on the volume of your head after 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.340
 how long is the required length 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.990
 consider one fact 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.630
 as we will short weave in 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.659
 circle we need to do 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:01.540
 rapport pattern unchanged and so if we 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.490
 finished weaving beads 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.090
 the next element comes with us bead 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.979
 green and other oblong 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.799
 bead that's exactly the same 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.620
 sequences we have to finish 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.690
 after this initial end of weaving 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.959
 we pass into the final bead 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.959
 circular weaving like this 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:32.980
 all ring closed 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:36.069
 she mind saved and we continue 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.900
 weaving further now we type one 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:44.709
 a large bead further we cut off the second 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.430
 the end of the spandex from the coil leaving in 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:03:01.480
 Stock about a meter and pass a large 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:03:03.689
 bead directing weaving back here 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.340
 so further recruit 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:10.629
 a sequence of three elements and 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.209
 the fourth element is this 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.519
 large bead typing necessary 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:21.340
 the number of elements pass into the bead 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:23.760
 on the first row directing the end to 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.760
 the opposite direction 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:34.349
 This is the way to further seize the club. 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:37.030
 on the bead turning the weave forward 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.870
 dragging the same weave to not 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.389
 fell apart 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:45.729
 he himself is not following the same principle 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.739
 each time four elements path plate them 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:50.500
 the last 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:54.280
 front row bead before 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:59.470
 finish the second round recruit three 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:03.060
 element without a set of beads and pass in 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.060
 the first bead closing the ring 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:21.730
 to make spandex more comfortable 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:24.790
 pull the first turns of the bead a little bit 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.580
 hole expand and you can safely 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.240
 pull the thread and so second row with us 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.360
 ready now we will perform 3 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.360
 central row 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:41.030
 in principle, the set of elements will be almost 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:45.200
 in the same way we will replace large ones 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:48.620
 beads with alternating yellow beads and here 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:52.600
 such small beads and so 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.600
 we are now recruiting a yellow bead 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.190
 well in this way 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.270
 Next, type in a sequence of 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:25.740
 three elements as in the previous ring 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:28.790
 and here's a little bead 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.780
 go through the bead on the second lap and 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:36.680
 back back to the dialed bead 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.680
 guiding pletenie forward 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.039
 working with spandex you need a little bit to 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.000
 get used to it because it is somewhat 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.460
 other material 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.349
 it doesn't slide as well as fishing line or 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:58.699
 Pollock but it has a lot of other 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:02.180
 advantages and so on we recruit three 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:05.509
 element and complete here so yellow 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.860
 beads and such alternation we complete 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.410
 third ring 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.840
 if during weaving you will remain 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.449
 small ends of the thread braid yet 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.810
 long enough I recommend trimming 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:20.539
 the ends of the threads in the final stage of each 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.599
 circle but not in the middle of weaving 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:26.270
 because connecting the two ends of the thread you 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:29.300
 tie a knot of hiding under 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:32.150
 bead if you have one left 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.669
 the tip of it will tighten the knot will 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:38.030
 problematic and there is the likelihood 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:41.060
 that this nodule will be visible so 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:45.159
 Now I am typing the last stage of the three 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.159
 items and make a bundle 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:10.060
 delay too but at the same time do not give 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:13.419
 thread tears we fill the knot under 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:17.340
 the bead and the remaining ends are cut further 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:21.340
 cut off a large enough stock of thread and 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:24.450
 in any link on the third ring we pass 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.450
 in any of the key elements 

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:36.229
 and so here from this stage we will go 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:41.989
 make the next lap the fourth lap y 

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:45.049
 we will be similar in recruitment as 2 fifth and 

00:07:41.989 --> 00:07:47.649
 the last lap will be like a set of 

00:07:45.049 --> 00:07:49.609
 1 so try it yourself 

00:07:47.649 --> 00:07:52.999
 continue this weaving 

00:07:49.609 --> 00:07:55.999
 I got this set of 

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:59.769
 elastic bracelet and hairband 

00:07:55.999 --> 00:07:59.769
 try to do the same
