finality I'll just show you under the
bonnet<00:04:10.030> now<00:04:10.300> this<00:04:10.630> tractor<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:12.190> I'll<00:04:12.400> show

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
bonnet now this tractor and I'll show

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.210 
bonnet now this tractor and I'll show
you<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:13.090> probe<00:04:13.330> leads<00:04:13.570> and<00:04:13.900> why<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.710> plug

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
you the probe leads and why the plug

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.780 
you the probe leads and why the plug
leads<00:04:15.430> is<00:04:16.230> color<00:04:17.230> coded<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:18.160> was<00:04:18.310> because<00:04:18.670> of

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
leads is color coded it was because of

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.510 
leads is color coded it was because of
the<00:04:18.940> farmers<00:04:19.450> as<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:20.739> know<00:04:20.890> farmers<00:04:21.370> are<00:04:21.489> a

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
the farmers as you know farmers are a

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.360 
the farmers as you know farmers are a
bit<00:04:21.820> on<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.090> thick<00:04:22.330> side<00:04:22.470> so<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.860> farmers

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
bit on the thick side so the farmers

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.880 
bit on the thick side so the farmers
could<00:04:24.880> actually<00:04:25.180> tell<00:04:25.660> which<00:04:25.930> was<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.710> right

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
could actually tell which was the right

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.700 
could actually tell which was the right
cylinder<00:04:27.460> so<00:04:27.730> that<00:04:27.760> demarked<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.720> leads<00:04:28.930> for

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
cylinder so that demarked the leads for

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.290 
cylinder so that demarked the leads for
that<00:04:29.890> simple<00:04:30.310> reason<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.880> that's<00:04:31.060> why<00:04:31.240> the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
that simple reason and that's why the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.920 
that simple reason and that's why the
color<00:04:31.660> coded<00:04:32.170> so<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:34.060> was<00:04:34.240> easy<00:04:34.450> for<00:04:34.720> them<00:04:34.900> to

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
color coded so it was easy for them to

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.280 
color coded so it was easy for them to
identify<00:04:35.350> them<00:04:35.890> I<00:04:35.980> came<00:04:36.430> down<00:04:36.700> a<00:04:36.730> unit<00:04:37.570> with

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
identify them I came down a unit with

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.000 
identify them I came down a unit with
John<00:04:38.640> to<00:04:39.640> show<00:04:39.850> him<00:04:40.150> this<00:04:40.540> pre<00:04:40.870> force<00:04:41.200> that<00:04:41.680> I'm

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
John to show him this pre force that I'm

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.860 
John to show him this pre force that I'm
doing<00:04:42.280> I<00:04:42.780> cannot<00:04:43.780> get<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.230> base<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:45.600> it's<00:04:46.600> for

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
doing I cannot get the base and it's for

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.890 
doing I cannot get the base and it's for

and the f-block is tracked on it and it

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.870 
and the f-block is tracked on it and it
just<00:05:51.840> needs<00:05:52.260> another<00:05:52.410> Block<00:05:52.919> in<00:05:53.099> it<00:05:53.220> which<00:05:53.639> I

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
just needs another Block in it which I

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.839 
just needs another Block in it which I
got<00:05:54.090> about<00:05:54.330> block<00:05:54.780> Paul<00:05:55.260> and<00:05:55.650> I'm<00:05:56.550> going<00:05:56.760> to

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
got about block Paul and I'm going to

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.420 
got about block Paul and I'm going to
rebuild<00:05:57.240> the<00:05:57.419> engine<00:05:57.599> and<00:05:58.050> when<00:05:58.889> I<00:05:58.919> finish

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
rebuild the engine and when I finish

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.640 
rebuild the engine and when I finish
with<00:05:59.580> it<00:05:59.759> it'll<00:06:00.060> more<00:06:00.330> than<00:06:00.479> likely<00:06:00.630> look<00:06:01.349> as

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
with it it'll more than likely look as

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.100 
with it it'll more than likely look as
good<00:06:01.979> if<00:06:02.220> not<00:06:02.310> better<00:06:02.490> than<00:06:03.120> my<00:06:03.300> crap<00:06:03.599> master

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110
