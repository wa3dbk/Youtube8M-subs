was still gonna be watching I think they

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.410

had<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> laptops<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.729> hospital<00:01:57.299> which<00:01:57.390> is

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420

an<00:01:57.600> awesome

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
an awesome

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.380 
an awesome
would<00:02:00.720> be<00:02:00.840> very<00:02:01.079> easy<00:02:01.500> for<00:02:01.740> Peter<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.850> struggle

in<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.290> conference<00:02:04.799> tournament<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.640> think

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
in the conference tournament and I think

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.719

the<00:02:06.689> fact<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.200> his<00:02:07.500> parents<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.250> his<00:02:08.340> family

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
the fact that his parents and his family

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.570 
the fact that his parents and his family
were<00:02:08.849> back<00:02:09.060> home<00:02:09.300> struggling<00:02:10.069> he<00:02:11.069> channeled

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
that energy in a positive direction and

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.130
