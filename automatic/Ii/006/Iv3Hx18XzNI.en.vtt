00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.810
 My name is German and saxophonist 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.540
 remember that this is a channel for 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.519
 rock for beginners 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.620
 the idea is to play the songs alone 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.260
 from the rock band that you like and 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.320
 pass it on so you can play and 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.090
 remember that this time I'm going to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.460
 play a solo with tenor sax if you play 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.289
 You must touch the fifths from 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.510
 note of I tell you 7 and if I tell you I'm 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.340
 playing a mi on the tenor or you should play 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.000

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.229
