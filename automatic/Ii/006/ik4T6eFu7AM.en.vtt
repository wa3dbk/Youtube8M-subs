00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
which can lead to combos and stuff but

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.369 
which can lead to combos and stuff but
if<00:02:10.390> you're<00:02:10.569> following<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:11.110> end<00:02:11.230> up<00:02:11.290> getting

the chris lead to a you winning

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.330 
the chris lead to a you winning
basically<00:02:14.110> because<00:02:14.349> you're<00:02:14.470> hitting<00:02:14.620> harder

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
basically because you're hitting harder

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
ended up getting the combo and because I

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.130 
ended up getting the combo and because I
was<00:02:20.590> lower<00:02:20.830> than<00:02:20.920> him<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.849> was<00:02:22.090> focusing<00:02:22.930> on

protection<00:03:55.989> and<00:03:56.290> my<00:03:56.380> helmet<00:03:56.650> which<00:03:57.370> means<00:03:57.580> my

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
protection and my helmet which means my

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.880 
protection and my helmet which means my
helmet<00:03:58.000> is<00:03:58.090> actually<00:03:58.360> better<00:03:58.480> than<00:03:58.570> his<00:03:58.890> even

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
helmet is actually better than his even

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.140 
helmet is actually better than his even
though<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.010> offered<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.400> same<00:04:00.519> defense<00:04:00.820> points

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
though I offered the same defense points

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.300 
though I offered the same defense points
my<00:04:01.510> legs<00:04:01.750> are<00:04:02.019> twice<00:04:02.410> as<00:04:02.440> good<00:04:02.739> as<00:04:02.860> his<00:04:03.040> because

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
my legs are twice as good as his because

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.160 
my legs are twice as good as his because
they<00:04:03.489> are<00:04:03.549> ironed<00:04:03.880> instead<00:04:04.269> of<00:04:04.360> chain<00:04:04.870> and

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
they are ironed instead of chain and

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.410 
they are ironed instead of chain and
they<00:04:05.440> have<00:04:05.560> protection<00:04:06.070> and<00:04:06.250> his<00:04:06.910> aren't<00:04:07.150> even

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
they have protection and his aren't even

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.060 
they have protection and his aren't even
enchanted<00:04:07.900> my<00:04:08.260> weapon<00:04:08.530> is<00:04:08.560> just<00:04:08.769> a<00:04:08.799> tiny<00:04:08.980> bit

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
enchanted my weapon is just a tiny bit

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.830 
enchanted my weapon is just a tiny bit
better<00:04:09.310> than<00:04:09.430> his<00:04:09.610> unless<00:04:09.850> he<00:04:10.000> somehow<00:04:10.120> got

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
better than his unless he somehow got

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.930 
better than his unless he somehow got
has<00:04:11.019> enchanted<00:04:11.170> already<00:04:11.709> but<00:04:12.400> I<00:04:12.430> doubt<00:04:12.610> that

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
has enchanted already but I doubt that

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.090 
has enchanted already but I doubt that
and<00:04:13.120> his<00:04:13.600> boots<00:04:13.840> are<00:04:14.140> better<00:04:14.560> than<00:04:14.739> mine<00:04:14.890> by

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
and his boots are better than mine by

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.009 
and his boots are better than mine by
half<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:15.489> that<00:04:15.580> makes<00:04:15.730> up<00:04:15.880> for<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.090> iron<00:04:16.750> legs

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
half so that makes up for the iron legs

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.349 
half so that makes up for the iron legs
so<00:04:17.620> basically<00:04:17.890> my<00:04:18.010> protections<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:18.880> my<00:04:19.150> chest

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
so basically my protections and my chest

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.270 
so basically my protections and my chest
plate<00:04:19.600> are<00:04:20.080> the<00:04:20.260> only<00:04:20.380> things<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:20.859> my<00:04:21.010> helmet

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
plate are the only things and my helmet

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.210 
plate are the only things and my helmet
I<00:04:21.340> guess<00:04:21.489> only<00:04:22.120> thinks<00:04:22.419> oh<00:04:22.510> my<00:04:22.690> god<00:04:22.840> whoo<00:04:23.260> okay

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 
unfortunate um I think I would rather go

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:01.050 
unfortunate um I think I would rather go
with<00:05:56.560> the<00:05:59.400> projectile<00:06:00.400> protection<00:06:00.880> um

with the projectile protection um

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.330 
with the projectile protection um
because<00:06:01.900> people<00:06:02.349> think<00:06:02.409> a<00:06:02.529> deathmatch<00:06:02.740> bows

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.629 
and even though deathmatch bows aren't
like<00:06:06.060> necessarily<00:06:07.259> game-changing<00:06:08.639> it's

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
like necessarily game-changing it's

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:10.950 
like necessarily game-changing it's
better<00:06:09.880> to<00:06:10.000> have<00:06:10.090> projectile<00:06:10.630> protection

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960
