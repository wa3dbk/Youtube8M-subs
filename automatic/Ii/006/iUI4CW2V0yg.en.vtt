would and the way I'm going to be doing
that<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:50.910> by<00:00:51.000> using<00:00:51.180> simple<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:51.899> very

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
that is just by using simple but very

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.500 
that is just by using simple but very
effective<00:00:52.280> killstreaks<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.969> killstreaks<00:00:54.390> I

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
effective killstreaks the killstreaks I

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.810 
effective killstreaks the killstreaks I
suggest<00:00:54.960> using<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.710> or<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> UAV<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
suggest using to do this or the UAV the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.330 
suggest using to do this or the UAV the
counter<00:00:57.210> UAV<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.989> orbital<00:00:58.440> vsat<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:59.280> you

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
counter UAV and the orbital vsat now you

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.889 
counter UAV and the orbital vsat now you
may<00:00:59.640> be<00:00:59.670> thinking<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.329> class<00:01:00.600> setup

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
may be thinking that this class setup

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.389 
may be thinking that this class setup
isn't<00:01:01.079> very<00:01:01.379> overpowered<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.219> not

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
isn't very overpowered and it's not

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.740 
isn't very overpowered and it's not
going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.670> get<00:01:02.789> me<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> whole<00:01:03.149> lot<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.329> kills<00:01:03.600> in

going to get me a whole lot of kills in
the<00:01:03.840> game<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.530> at<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.650> very<00:01:04.739> early<00:01:05.220> stages<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the game but at the very early stages of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.520 
the game but at the very early stages of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
black ops 2 these three kill streaks

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.080 
black ops 2 these three kill streaks
will<00:01:07.650> be<00:01:07.770> super<00:01:08.130> effective<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.700> helping<00:01:08.790> you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.080 
your counter UAV now the counter UAV is
then<00:01:22.799> going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.100> make<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> game<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> whole<00:01:23.850> load

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
then going to make the game a whole load

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.240 
then going to make the game a whole load
harder<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.630> enemy<00:01:24.930> team<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:25.890> not

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
harder for the enemy team because not

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.499 
harder for the enemy team because not
only<00:01:26.280> are<00:01:26.580> they<00:01:26.759> playing<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.090> brand<00:01:27.390> new

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
game in a new situation and environment

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.980 
game in a new situation and environment
but<00:01:29.790> they<00:01:29.909> now<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> do<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.750> without<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
but they now have to do it without a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.569 
but they now have to do it without a
radar<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> fight<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> fact<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.310> your

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
radar and the fight the fact that your

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.640 
radar and the fight the fact that your
team<00:01:32.820> still<00:01:33.119> has<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> radar<00:01:33.720> with<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> UAV

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
team still has a radar with the UAV

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.140 
team still has a radar with the UAV
still<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> massive<00:01:35.909> advantage

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
still up this is a massive advantage

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.330 
still up this is a massive advantage
when<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.630> get<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> UAV<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.500> counter<00:01:37.829> UAV<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
when you get the UAV the counter UAV and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.060 
when you get the UAV the counter UAV and
you<00:01:38.729> totally<00:01:39.030> block<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.509> enemy's<00:01:39.840> radar

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
you totally block the enemy's radar

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.649 
you totally block the enemy's radar
using<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> counter<00:01:41.490> UAV<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> first<00:01:42.360> few

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
weeks of black ops 2 is going to be more

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.740 
weeks of black ops 2 is going to be more
effective<00:01:44.970> than<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.180> ever<00:01:45.329> will<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.720> again

this is because as an older call of

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.210 
this is because as an older call of
duty's<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.570> UAV<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> standard<00:01:49.770> killstreak

with all these UAVs and counter UAVs
it's<00:02:17.960> going<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.350> make<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.560> incredibly<00:02:18.680> easy

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070

located enemies you will also be able to

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.980 
located enemies you will also be able to
learn<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.760> maps<00:02:22.940> incredibly<00:02:23.480> fast<00:02:23.690> because

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
learn the maps incredibly fast because

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.270

you<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:24.350> your<00:02:24.440> team<00:02:24.680> will<00:02:24.860> be<00:02:24.920> able<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.100> say

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
you and your team will be able to say

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.830 
you and your team will be able to say
how<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:25.520> map<00:02:25.820> players<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.330> flows<00:02:26.570> as

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
how the map players and flows as

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.200 
how the map players and flows as
regarding<00:02:27.650> where<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.860> enemies<00:02:28.220> move<00:02:28.460> to<00:02:28.700> but

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
regarding where the enemies move to but

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.610 
regarding where the enemies move to but
more<00:02:29.420> importantly<00:02:29.960> you<00:02:30.080> will<00:02:30.110> have<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.350> huge
