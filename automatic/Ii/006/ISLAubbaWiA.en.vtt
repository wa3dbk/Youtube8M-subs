00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.870
 together our two countries are determined to 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:10.230
 stay engaged side by side with all our 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.470
 allies in afghanistan and I do not have 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.490
 afraid to say it in afghanistan is played 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.810
 an essential part 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.570
 France has proposed to its allies 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.220
 the Atlantic alliance a strategy for 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.410
 allow the Afghan people and its 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.260
 legitimate government to build the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.720
 peace if these proposals are accepted 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.970
 France will propose at the summit of 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.170
 Bucharest to strengthen its presence 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:41.309
 military we can not accept 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.660
 a return of the Taliban and al Qaeda 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:50.239
 in kabul defeat is forbidden 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.239
 even if the victory is difficult 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.189
 and we owe our Afghan friends to our 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.409
 fallen soldiers to the wounded and 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:18.039
 to their family can leave once 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:21.369
 the mission accomplished according to oussama ben 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:24.159
 laden is dead the terrorists are 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.569
 seriously affected in the rest of 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.450
 Afghanistan progress has been 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:31.090
 obtained by our allies this is the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.509
 situation militates and the formation of 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.509
 Afghan forces 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.000
 m 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.000
 on this day when I am invested with the 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.430
 highest offices of the state 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.620
 I address the French a message of 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.500
 trust 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.580
 we are a big country 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.640
 in its history 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.710
 always cope with the trials and 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.630
 to meet the challenges of 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.300
 him 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.080
 every night 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.370
 he managed by remaining himself 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:58.000
 always in elevation and openness 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.180
 never in lowering and retreating 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.990
 this is the mandate I received 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.800
 straighten France in justice 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:12.350
 to open a new path in europe 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.590
 contribute to world peace as well as to 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.310
 preservation of the planet 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.040
 I measure today even weight of 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.250
 constraints that our country is doing 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.250
 face 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.410
