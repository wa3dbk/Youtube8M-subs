00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.420
 so the purpose of our actions 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.389
 set correctly 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:12.179
 gas distribution mechanism 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:16.760
 for this I used two pins 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:21.230
 with marks on one level means 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:31.529
 put the pistons in the middle position 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:34.009
 for this we turn the crankshaft at the sentry 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.009
 arrow 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:45.809
 so now we don't have that position 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:49.690
 which we need interests us 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.589
 set as follows 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.839
 this cylinder 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:01:01.769
 walked this piston went to the working stroke then 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:01.769
 i mean down sets 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.030
 I'm not comfortable doing this alone 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.030
 so I put about 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.600
 just like that 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.580
 here it is to put 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.320
 means in this position what we should 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:42.040
 reach now we have timing belt removed 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.850
 we twist only if they say it means 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.100
 have established 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.130
 crankshaft exactly in this position 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:55.000
 when 1 or 4 cylinder 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.810
 the piston goes down in this position 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.979
 means put in any way 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.409
 fixed 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:08.789
 fixed crankshaft possible 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:13.620
 in a way which is then 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.620
 pin and we basically do not need it now 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.000
 mean then we have to find the point 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:31.060
 will fall. 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:36.600
 mean in this after colin shaft 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:42.790
 installed means looking for a place of fixation 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:45.150
 camshafts mean and here we are already 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.920
 cool camshaft 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:54.430
 also means clockwise and 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:58.260
 look here in this hole means to 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:03.040
 we got there 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.579
 control point it means you saw that 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.769
 she came here and we catch her here 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:14.739
 traffic jam caught fixed 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:22.980
 fixed further follows this 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:22.980
 way now unscrew a second 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:38.340
 further twist this gear here 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.660
 after the camshaft is fixed 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.109
 loosen this bolt to gear 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.269
 spun freely mean with this 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.750
 I will note the camshaft should already be 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.480
 fixed means 6 I will 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.470
 spin freely on 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.709
 Our engines do not have any tags for 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.060
 mount belt mount 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:05.290
 means unscrewed gear 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.079
 set remming crankshaft fixed 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.760
 camshaft fixed there means 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:16.320
 put on dress timing belt and 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:20.440
 set the tension on the roller 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.930
 rather not so well, in general, then yes will not give 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.780
 set the tension correctly 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:32.220
 videos that draw attention movie 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.220
 he has a tensioner 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.770
 This is the label I have it not quite 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.770
 right now 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:57.860
 so this is how they should 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:05:00.290
 here these measures coincide 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.040
 This means now I will show it on 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.040
 old videos 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:18.950
 Here's an old movie and here for 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:23.160
 use tension I took advantage 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:30.350
 the old so-called family key to 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:36.720
 bike hook it up this way and 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:40.140
 we put tension that is yes and we stretch 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:49.040
 it means he will be on one hand all this 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:49.040
 it was inconvenient to do but the meaning is 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:03.500
 we expose all this a little 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:06.680
 turns better first time better 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:10.710
 drag and make a few turns 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:15.229
 then weaken install these 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:20.690
 Tag correctly and lock nuts 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:23.990
 in fact, everything is removed from the ax 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.539
 who hung 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:33.060
 it means 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:37.680
 stopper kalevala camshaft stopper 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:41.340
 here in this traffic jam means install 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:44.930
 everything in place and then i will show the subject 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:47.729
 zavedetsya to cheer yet 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:50.219
 if you have after this manipulation 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:53.460
 the check will be lit but the engine 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:59.370
 will work means you installed not 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:01.620
 completely correct gas distribution then 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:05.509
 I mean, one of the sensors is not exactly yours 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:11.120
 falls means trial and error 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:14.580
 found out that the error appears if 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:18.389
 look adapter 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:22.069
 then the deviation will be more than 12 degrees in 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:24.259
 this or that side means it is possible 

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:28.169
 correct 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:31.909
 in the presence of an adapter it's all done 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:35.009
 no problem no adapter you need exactly 

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:37.889
 fix or set exactly as 

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:41.159
 camshaft and crankshaft in this case 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:46.969
 the error of the error will not be well here in general 

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:46.969
 and all the good the engine is started will show
