00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
even be able to hear that at all it's

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.950 
even be able to hear that at all it's
it's<00:01:56.220> super<00:01:56.759> super<00:01:56.970> faint<00:01:57.360> unless<00:01:57.690> it's<00:01:57.869> like

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it's super super faint unless it's like

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.690 
it's super super faint unless it's like
a<00:01:58.020> 1v1<00:01:58.470> in<00:01:58.680> Search<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.160> Destroy<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.580> get

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
a 1v1 in Search and Destroy and you get

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.219 
a 1v1 in Search and Destroy and you get
a<00:01:59.729> headset<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:01.050> nearly

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
a headset on it's going to be nearly

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.380 
a headset on it's going to be nearly
impossible<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.920> hear<00:02:02.070> dead<00:02:02.250> silence<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:03.240> by

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
impossible to hear dead silence just by

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.900 
impossible to hear dead silence just by
itself<00:02:03.720> so<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.310> that's<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:05.610> kind<00:02:05.850> of

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
itself so that that's you know kind of

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.279 
itself so that that's you know kind of
interesting<00:02:06.390> there<00:02:06.539> so<00:02:06.720> that<00:02:06.750> silence<00:02:07.170> is

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
interesting there so that silence is

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.800 
interesting there so that silence is
very<00:02:07.560> very<00:02:07.800> powerful<00:02:08.009> now<00:02:08.369> next<00:02:09.119> up<00:02:09.300> let's

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
very very powerful now next up let's

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.890 
very very powerful now next up let's
take<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> look<00:02:10.380> at<00:02:10.530> amplify<00:02:11.280> versus<00:02:12.120> regular<00:02:12.390> so

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
take a look at amplify versus regular so

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.810 
take a look at amplify versus regular so
in<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.200> clip<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:14.280> were<00:02:14.430> going<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.670> have

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
in this clip you were going to have

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.130 
in this clip you were going to have
amplify<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.720> person<00:02:16.020> we're<00:02:16.110> looking

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
amplify on the person we're looking

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.570 
amplify on the person we're looking
behind<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.650> going<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.860> have<00:02:16.950> amplify<00:02:17.430> on

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
behind is going to have amplify on

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.280 
behind is going to have amplify on
where's<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.000> enemy<00:02:18.270> it's<00:02:18.720> not<00:02:18.900> going<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.170> have

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
where's the enemy it's not going to have

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:33.240 
where's the enemy it's not going to have
anything<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.160> check<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.490> out

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.280 

wow<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.790> was<00:02:34.970> insane<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:35.750> as<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:35.870> guys<00:02:36.050> saw

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
wow that was insane so as you guys saw

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.890 
wow that was insane so as you guys saw
there<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.980> range<00:02:37.310> was<00:02:37.670> not<00:02:37.940> affected<00:02:38.720> like

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
there the range was not affected like

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.930 
there the range was not affected like
the<00:02:39.080> distance<00:02:39.620> at<00:02:39.860> which<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.310> could<00:02:40.489> hear<00:02:40.790> him

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
the distance at which you could hear him

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.570 
the distance at which you could hear him
from<00:02:41.120> was<00:02:41.690> not<00:02:41.870> affected<00:02:42.319> but<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.830> volume<00:02:43.099> was

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
from was not affected but the volume was

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.670 
from was not affected but the volume was
dramatically<00:02:44.569> increased<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.530> was

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
dramatically increased that was

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.860 
dramatically increased that was
absolutely<00:02:46.489> insane<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:47.180> know<00:02:47.269> if<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.690> have<00:02:47.840> a

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
absolutely insane you know if you have a

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.380 
absolutely insane you know if you have a
headset<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.680> you're<00:02:49.220> running<00:02:49.340> amplify<00:02:50.090> and

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
headset and you're running amplify and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.240 
headset and you're running amplify and
the<00:02:50.480> other<00:02:50.629> team<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:50.959> not<00:02:51.170> using<00:02:51.620> dead<00:02:51.769> silence

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
the other team is not using dead silence

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.789 
the other team is not using dead silence
it's<00:02:52.790> almost<00:02:53.150> like<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.390> constant<00:02:53.959> UAV<00:02:54.140> your<00:02:54.680> to

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
it's almost like a constant UAV your to

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.289 
it's almost like a constant UAV your to
be<00:02:54.890> able<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.099> hear<00:02:55.220> them<00:02:55.340> clomping<00:02:56.180> around

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
be able to hear them clomping around

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.690 
be able to hear them clomping around
from<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.319> know<00:02:57.440> halfway<00:02:57.920> over<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.310> map<00:02:58.489> so

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
from you know halfway over the map so

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.699 
from you know halfway over the map so
that<00:02:58.730> was<00:02:58.970> pretty<00:02:59.150> crazy<00:02:59.360> now<00:02:59.750> I<00:02:59.959> next<00:03:00.560> up

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
that was pretty crazy now I next up

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.940 
that was pretty crazy now I next up
let's<00:03:01.340> take<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.670> look<00:03:01.910> at<00:03:02.060> amplify<00:03:02.720> versus<00:03:03.709> dead

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
let's take a look at amplify versus dead

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.860 
let's take a look at amplify versus dead
silence<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:04.610> in<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:04.849> clip<00:03:05.150> you're<00:03:05.750> gonna

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
silence so in this clip you're gonna

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.839 
silence so in this clip you're gonna
have<00:03:06.079> amplify<00:03:06.620> on<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:07.220> enemy<00:03:07.430> is<00:03:07.670> going<00:03:07.790> to

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
have amplify on the enemy is going to

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:18.710 
have amplify on the enemy is going to
have<00:03:07.970> dead<00:03:08.180> silence<00:03:08.569> on<00:03:08.720> check<00:03:09.379> it<00:03:09.500> out

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.230 

alright<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:19.830> dead<00:03:20.040> science<00:03:20.400> was<00:03:20.580> definitely<00:03:21.180> a

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
alright so dead science was definitely a

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.060 
alright so dead science was definitely a
little<00:03:21.480> bit<00:03:21.720> more<00:03:21.900> audible<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.590> clip<00:03:22.860> but

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
little bit more audible in that clip but

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.940 
little bit more audible in that clip but
it<00:03:23.490> was<00:03:23.640> not<00:03:23.970> countered<00:03:24.750> completely<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.770> was

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
it was not countered completely it was

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.040 
it was not countered completely it was
still<00:03:26.310> pretty<00:03:26.550> faint<00:03:27.000> compared<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.960> the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
still pretty faint compared to the

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.840 
still pretty faint compared to the
normal<00:03:28.500> footstep<00:03:29.070> noise<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:29.520> you<00:03:29.580> guys<00:03:29.700> want

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
normal footstep noise so you guys want

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.040 
normal footstep noise so you guys want
to<00:03:29.910> hear<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.060> for<00:03:30.150> yourself<00:03:30.210> I'm<00:03:30.750> going<00:03:30.990> to

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
to hear it for yourself I'm going to

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.810 
to hear it for yourself I'm going to
play<00:03:31.170> two<00:03:31.230> clips<00:03:31.650> back<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.070> back<00:03:32.220> here<00:03:32.520> the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
play two clips back to back here the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.790 
play two clips back to back here the
first<00:03:33.120> one<00:03:33.360> is<00:03:33.390> regular<00:03:33.990> verse<00:03:34.200> regular<00:03:34.560> no

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
first one is regular verse regular no

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.650 
first one is regular verse regular no
perks<00:03:35.100> involved<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.760> bass<00:03:36.060> sound<00:03:36.450> of

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
perks involved the bass sound of

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.450 
perks involved the bass sound of
footsteps<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.500> second<00:03:37.890> one<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.010> this

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
footsteps the second one is this

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.310 
footsteps the second one is this
amplified<00:03:39.030> versus<00:03:39.450> dead<00:03:39.660> silence<00:03:40.110> footsteps

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
amplified versus dead silence footsteps

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.230 
amplified versus dead silence footsteps
again<00:03:40.770> and<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.430> guys<00:03:41.490> will<00:03:41.670> be<00:03:41.820> able<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:42.030> hear

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
again and you guys will be able to hear

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.120 
again and you guys will be able to hear
the<00:03:42.600> amplified<00:03:43.110> verse<00:03:43.350> dead<00:03:43.560> silence<00:03:44.010> is

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
the amplified verse dead silence is

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.670 
the amplified verse dead silence is
still<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.940> little<00:03:45.360> bit<00:03:45.600> less<00:03:45.900> than<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.500> regular

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
still a little bit less than the regular

00:03:46.680 --> 00:04:05.290 
still a little bit less than the regular
check<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.130> out

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.720 

so<00:04:05.960> yeah<00:04:06.140> there<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:06.530> have<00:04:06.650> an<00:04:06.770> amplified<00:04:07.310> does

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
so yeah there you have an amplified does

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.480 
so yeah there you have an amplified does
kind<00:04:08.480> of<00:04:08.780> counter<00:04:09.230> dead<00:04:09.410> silence<00:04:09.830> but<00:04:10.370> it

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
kind of counter dead silence but it

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.190 
kind of counter dead silence but it
doesn't<00:04:10.850> do<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:11.090> all<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.690> way<00:04:11.840> like<00:04:12.050> I've

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
doesn't do it all the way like I've

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.870 
doesn't do it all the way like I've
heard<00:04:12.410> a<00:04:12.530> lot<00:04:12.560> of<00:04:12.770> myths<00:04:13.130> that<00:04:13.400> amplify

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
heard a lot of myths that amplify

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.970 
heard a lot of myths that amplify
doesn't<00:04:14.270> do<00:04:14.390> anything<00:04:15.050> to<00:04:15.260> dead<00:04:15.440> silence<00:04:15.830> and

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
doesn't do anything to dead silence and

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.289 
doesn't do anything to dead silence and
dead<00:04:16.130> silence<00:04:16.430> is<00:04:16.549> still<00:04:16.730> completely<00:04:16.880> quiet

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
dead silence is still completely quiet

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.300 
dead silence is still completely quiet
that's<00:04:18.019> not<00:04:18.290> true<00:04:18.560> if<00:04:18.769> you're<00:04:18.950> going<00:04:19.190> up

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
that's not true if you're going up

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.590 
that's not true if you're going up
against<00:04:19.640> a<00:04:19.700> team<00:04:19.880> of<00:04:20.030> people<00:04:20.150> with<00:04:20.450> dead

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
against a team of people with dead

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.270 
against a team of people with dead
silence<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.110> stuff<00:04:21.260> on<00:04:21.440> amplified

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
silence and stuff on amplified

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.580 
silence and stuff on amplified
definitely<00:04:22.850> can't<00:04:23.120> help<00:04:23.390> but<00:04:23.870> dead<00:04:24.140> silence

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
definitely can't help but dead silence

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.620 
definitely can't help but dead silence
is<00:04:24.710> definitely<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.790> more<00:04:25.970> powerful<00:04:26.360> perk

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
is definitely the more powerful perk

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.840 
is definitely the more powerful perk
even<00:04:26.990> when<00:04:27.110> you<00:04:27.140> have<00:04:27.440> amplify<00:04:28.100> on<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.550> the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
even when you have amplify on and the

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.460 
even when you have amplify on and the
other<00:04:29.000> team<00:04:29.240> has<00:04:29.360> dead<00:04:29.600> silence<00:04:29.990> again<00:04:30.110> you

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
other team has dead silence again you

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.140 
other team has dead silence again you
have<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.650> take<00:04:30.830> into<00:04:30.980> effect<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.820> fact<00:04:32.060> that

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
have to take into effect the fact that

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.430 
have to take into effect the fact that
people<00:04:32.420> going<00:04:32.540> to<00:04:32.600> be<00:04:32.660> shooting<00:04:32.930> throwing

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
people going to be shooting throwing

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.350 
people going to be shooting throwing
grenades<00:04:33.590> objectives<00:04:34.550> all<00:04:34.700> kinds<00:04:35.120> of<00:04:35.150> things

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
grenades objectives all kinds of things

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.730 
grenades objectives all kinds of things
going<00:04:35.600> off<00:04:35.750> so<00:04:36.140> it's<00:04:36.290> still<00:04:36.500> going<00:04:36.590> to<00:04:36.680> be

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
going off so it's still going to be

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.710 
going off so it's still going to be
pretty<00:04:36.980> difficult<00:04:37.280> to<00:04:37.700> hear<00:04:38.000> so<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:38.630> know

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
pretty difficult to hear so you know

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.720 
pretty difficult to hear so you know
although<00:04:39.050> amplify<00:04:39.710> can<00:04:40.010> be<00:04:40.130> good<00:04:40.310> in<00:04:40.430> certain

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
although amplify can be good in certain

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.220 
although amplify can be good in certain
scenarios<00:04:40.820> especially<00:04:41.720> if<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:41.870> other<00:04:41.990> team

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
scenarios especially if the other team

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.230 
scenarios especially if the other team
doesn't<00:04:42.560> have<00:04:42.830> dead<00:04:43.100> silence<00:04:43.460> on<00:04:43.640> dead

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
doesn't have dead silence on dead

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.480 
doesn't have dead silence on dead
silence<00:04:44.630> is<00:04:44.750> still<00:04:44.990> definitely<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:46.280> more

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
silence is still definitely the more

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.460 
silence is still definitely the more
powerful<00:04:46.880> perk<00:04:47.270> this<00:04:47.480> year's<00:04:47.750> so<00:04:48.020> if<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:48.380> had
