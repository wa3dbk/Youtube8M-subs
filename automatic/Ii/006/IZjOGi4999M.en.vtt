00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hey my love is after three weeks 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.700
 I'm back at the start today 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.490
 I allowed myself a little break the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.290
 absolutely had to be and do today 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.380
 I again something very delicious and indeed 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.440
 is there with me a Brussels sprouts curry with 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.199
 sweet potatoes and banana and raisins me 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.330
 Show you the ingredients and me 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.070
 I read it in a magazine have 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.140
 but never tried it though 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.060
 because I really like brussels sprouts 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.980
 I just think that's incredible 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.050
 yummy of course I like those too 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.969
 other ingredients but I think it 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.040
 will taste very good and show now 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.620
 I quickly tell you totally so we do 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.000
 I need two sweet potatoes 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.989
 cut here sometimes too small 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.430
 have some Brussels sprouts you can of course 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.870
 I'm here to refresh take 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.079
 taken frozen 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:58.800
 That's about 750 grams four tablespoons 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:06.240
 sultanas a banana a big one 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:13.049
 onion three tablespoons tomato paste five 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:20.220
 tablespoon curry a cup of cream and 300 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:22.439
 milliliters of vegetable stock so first 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.650
 will of course heat oil in the pan 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.650
 and the onions are seared 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.450
 now the curry is added with 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.830
 and three tablespoons of tomato paste 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.330
 it smells really really good yes 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.530
 I just love that taste of 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.090
 curry it's just totally good 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:31.390
 I believe the curry fans among you 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.390
 know or know that very well 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.930
 so now I'll give the same course 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.930
 the brussel sprouts into it 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.900
 and of course on my sweet potatoes 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.810
 I think that will be something tonight 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.940
 really tasty as it already looks so good 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.650
 it is just colorful and it is 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.030
 healthy 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.670
 I'm really looking forward to that 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.670
 to taste afterwards 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.820
 so after a bit of it all 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:58.680
 I 've added 300 now 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:04:00.170
 milliliters of broth with enough 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.980
 completely off 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.980
 and a cup of cream 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:30.100
 I have to go from now on 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.950
 try the animal it tastes now 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.080
 already incredibly delicious though that still 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.510
 not even finished I think when 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.470
 because the brussels sprouts water like that 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.570
 bit into it and the 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.790
 Brussels sprouts Wahlamt is soft I think 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.950
 this colleague tastes with this 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.380
 cream and the sweet potatoes i believe 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.270
 That's going to be really good, anyway 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.540
 it is worth definitely times 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.040
 try it out so that certainly begins 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.500
 right away to cook 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.320
 I'll give you my quiet sultanas now 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.420
 with pure and even already 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.100
 Let's put the lid on the whole thing 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.100
 simmer for 15 minutes 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.070
 so my dear followers 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.850
 Simmer for 10 minutes 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:28.750
 the whole thing and the camera 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.670
 also fog immediately and to this 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.550
 all I give now the bananas 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:38.530
 Add and stir the whole thing again 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:42.190
 a little bit around and that's ours 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.140
 Brussels sprouts curry finished I'm glad 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.420
 right on it is right to try 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.340
 so maybe it should be now 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.970
 simmer five more minutes that's enough 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.770
 also completely out of it requires more 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:58.080
 really not the cream is complete 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.080
 sucked in and turned creamy 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.970
 so now we go with you 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.650
 over to serving 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.020
 So as I said I can barely 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.690
 wait to try and see it 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.840
 really good with the raisins and the 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.060
 Bananas and brussels sprouts are incredible 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.910
 yummy you can of course 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.070
 Eat rice if you like it or not 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.150
 as i enjoy simply without rice because 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.650
 it's just a vegetable curry and there 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.560
 You really have to be able to do that too 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.510
 dispense carbohydrates and the whole 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.940
 So enjoy what I have now, of course 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.560

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.570
 You all saw how easy that was 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.240

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.890

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.770
 Do you think that each steams here? 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:50.500

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.770
 I really cook very well 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.600

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.920

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.790
