why<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.229> don't<00:02:10.619> think<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:11.190> won't<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.459> a

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
why I don't think you won't have a

why I don't think you won't have a
problem<00:02:11.700> with<00:02:11.910> saggy<00:02:12.090> bottom<00:02:12.270> even<00:02:12.599> though

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
problem with saggy bottom even though

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.530 
problem with saggy bottom even though
looks<00:02:12.980> like<00:02:13.100> this<00:02:13.220> might<00:02:13.370> be<00:02:13.580> one<00:02:13.730> but<00:02:14.390> you

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
looks like this might be one but you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.809 
looks like this might be one but you
will<00:02:14.660> have<00:02:14.750> that<00:02:14.930> problem<00:02:14.990> because<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.860> this

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
will have that problem because of this

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.610 
will have that problem because of this
part<00:02:17.120> right<00:02:17.180> here<00:02:17.300> which<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.410> hard

color red and white and then your third
piece<00:02:33.830> right<00:02:34.040> here<00:02:34.070> is<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.459> little<00:02:34.520> law

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
piece right here is this little law

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.720 
piece right here is this little law
insert<00:02:36.260> this<00:02:36.620> little<00:02:36.920> back<00:02:37.130> plate<00:02:37.430> that<00:02:37.610> goes

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
insert this little back plate that goes

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.990 
insert this little back plate that goes
right<00:02:38.000> in<00:02:38.150> here<00:02:38.450> in<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:39.140> clinic<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:40.000> that

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
right in here in the clinic and that

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.729 
right in here in the clinic and that
basically<00:02:41.239> is<00:02:41.570> there's<00:02:42.319> a<00:02:42.410> little<00:02:42.530> bit<00:02:42.680> of

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
basically is there's a little bit of

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.490 
basically is there's a little bit of
shock<00:02:42.980> proof<00:02:43.280> falls<00:02:43.850> on<00:02:44.030> its<00:02:44.150> back<00:02:44.390> on<00:02:44.500> right

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
shock proof falls on its back on right

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.199 
shock proof falls on its back on right
really<00:02:45.739> nice<00:02:45.980> design<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.730> know<00:02:46.850> makes<00:02:47.060> it

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
really nice design you know makes it

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.540 
really nice design you know makes it
distinct<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.920> does<00:02:49.130> come<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.430> two

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
distinct and this does come in two

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.330 
distinct and this does come in two
colors<00:02:49.910> red<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:50.660> white<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.739> can<00:02:51.950> switch

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
colors red and white so you can switch

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.890 
colors red and white so you can switch
out<00:02:52.459> these<00:02:52.670> back<00:02:52.850> lights<00:02:53.120> for<00:02:53.300> whatever<00:02:53.510> mood

they're awesome um they got the triple
layer<00:03:43.579> design<00:03:43.910> so<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.180> on<00:03:44.600> there<00:03:44.959> squeezing

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
layer design so you on there squeezing

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.690 
layer design so you on there squeezing
out<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.620> little<00:03:45.980> air<00:03:46.130> bubbles<00:03:46.459> which<00:03:46.610> you

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
out the little air bubbles which you

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
out the little air bubbles which you
don't<00:03:46.850> get<00:03:46.940> a<00:03:46.970> lot<00:03:47.030> of<00:03:47.180> because<00:03:47.510> they<00:03:47.630> have

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
don't get a lot of because they have

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.569 
don't get a lot of because they have
this<00:03:47.870> like<00:03:48.049> silicon<00:03:48.769> membrane<00:03:48.980> under<00:03:49.400> that

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
this like silicon membrane under that

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.030 
this like silicon membrane under that
adheres<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.329> anti-static<00:03:51.079> and<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:51.739> goes<00:03:51.890> on

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
adheres to it anti-static and it goes on

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.430 
adheres to it anti-static and it goes on
real<00:03:52.250> nice<00:03:52.489> but<00:03:53.239> even<00:03:53.570> if<00:03:53.690> for<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.049> little<00:03:54.290> air

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
real nice but even if for the little air

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.800 
real nice but even if for the little air
bubbles<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:54.920> stuff<00:03:55.010> all<00:03:55.549> you<00:03:55.670> got<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:55.820> do<00:03:56.000> just

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
bubbles and stuff all you got to do just

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.720 
bubbles and stuff all you got to do just
gonna<00:03:56.959> do<00:03:57.170> they<00:03:57.290> give<00:03:57.500> I'll<00:03:57.680> give<00:03:58.430> it<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.579> little

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
gonna do they give I'll give it a little

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.250 
gonna do they give I'll give it a little
rubdown<00:03:58.970> with<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.299> squeegee<00:03:59.510> they<00:03:59.750> provided

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
rubdown with the squeegee they provided

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.710 
rubdown with the squeegee they provided
and<00:04:00.410> um<00:04:00.620> then<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.370> just<00:04:01.549> peel<00:04:02.150> off<00:04:02.329> that<00:04:02.360> top

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
and um then you just peel off that top

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.819 
and um then you just peel off that top
layer<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.140> there<00:04:03.350> you<00:04:03.410> go<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:03.620> then<00:04:03.650> you're

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
layer and there you go and then you're

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.800 
layer and there you go and then you're
looking<00:04:04.010> pristine<00:04:04.190> and<00:04:04.400> everything<00:04:04.880> and<00:04:05.060> this

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
looking pristine and everything and this

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.020 
looking pristine and everything and this
one<00:04:06.049> I've<00:04:06.200> only<00:04:06.440> got<00:04:06.709> one<00:04:06.739> air<00:04:07.489> bubble<00:04:07.880> on<00:04:08.000> the

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
one I've only got one air bubble on the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.729 
one I've only got one air bubble on the
whole<00:04:08.209> thing<00:04:08.450> it's<00:04:08.750> right<00:04:08.989> there<00:04:09.230> I<00:04:09.440> don't<00:04:09.650> you

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
whole thing it's right there I don't you

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.440 
whole thing it's right there I don't you
can<00:04:09.859> kind<00:04:10.010> of<00:04:10.040> see<00:04:10.160> it<00:04:10.280> right<00:04:10.519> there<00:04:10.549> and<00:04:11.090> the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
can kind of see it right there and the

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.120 
can kind of see it right there and the
light<00:04:11.630> when<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:11.930> light<00:04:12.079> goes<00:04:12.290> over<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:12.680> but<00:04:12.890> I

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
light when the light goes over it but I

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.670 
light when the light goes over it but I
got<00:04:14.120> one<00:04:14.299> everything<00:04:15.109> all<00:04:15.230> of<00:04:15.260> us<00:04:15.380> on<00:04:15.530> the

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
got one everything all of us on the

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.920 
got one everything all of us on the
screen<00:04:15.890> so<00:04:15.920> I<00:04:16.039> don't<00:04:16.220> care<00:04:16.390> anti<00:04:17.390> fingerprint

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
screen so I don't care anti fingerprint

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.680 
screen so I don't care anti fingerprint
but<00:04:18.169> I<00:04:18.200> believe<00:04:18.560> they<00:04:18.709> have<00:04:18.890> one<00:04:19.130> that's

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
but I believe they have one that's

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.360 
but I believe they have one that's
anti-fingerprint<00:04:20.690> but<00:04:20.959> i'm<00:04:21.650> not<00:04:21.799> sure<00:04:21.859> you

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
anti-fingerprint but i'm not sure you

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.450 
anti-fingerprint but i'm not sure you
check<00:04:22.550> their<00:04:22.700> websites<00:04:23.060> which<00:04:23.210> easy<00:04:23.390> calm<00:04:23.810> um

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
check their websites which easy calm um

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
but they got a ton of cases

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.540 
but they got a ton of cases
and<00:04:27.080> that<00:04:27.320> type<00:04:27.530> of<00:04:27.560> stuff<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:28.280> know<00:04:28.370> really

case is not the easiest case in the
world<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:39.980> get<00:04:40.190> on<00:04:40.480> first<00:04:41.480> you<00:04:41.720> start<00:04:41.960> out<00:04:42.140> with

world to get on first you start out with

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.180 
world to get on first you start out with
this<00:04:42.620> little<00:04:42.890> law<00:04:43.100> with<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.730> DSP<00:04:45.190> adaptable

this little law with the a DSP adaptable
polymer<00:04:46.730> thingy<00:04:47.030> you<00:04:47.810> just<00:04:47.990> push<00:04:48.140> button<00:04:48.530> side

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
polymer thingy you just push button side

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.180 
polymer thingy you just push button side
in<00:04:48.920> first<00:04:49.220> and<00:04:49.550> snap<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.300> down<00:04:50.630> like<00:04:50.840> that

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
in first and snap it down like that

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.330 
in first and snap it down like that
that's<00:04:52.190> pretty<00:04:52.370> easy<00:04:52.640> and<00:04:52.940> then<00:04:54.040> they'll<00:04:55.040> earn

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
that's pretty easy and then they'll earn

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.070 
that's pretty easy and then they'll earn
II<00:04:55.430> just<00:04:55.730> kind<00:04:56.390> of<00:04:56.420> pull<00:04:56.600> it<00:04:56.690> out<00:04:56.780> like<00:04:56.930> that

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
II just kind of pull it out like that

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.530 
II just kind of pull it out like that
and<00:04:57.140> there<00:04:57.410> you<00:04:57.470> go<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.860> you're<00:04:58.010> on<00:04:58.130> and

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
and there you go and you're on and

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.020 
and there you go and you're on and
that's<00:04:59.540> giving<00:04:59.840> you<00:04:59.900> that<00:05:00.050> nice<00:05:00.200> red<00:05:01.030> rubber
