if<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.330> was<00:02:48.600> colored<00:02:48.900> i'm<00:02:49.050> pretty<00:02:49.260> sure<00:02:49.350> that

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
if that was colored i'm pretty sure that

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.320 
if that was colored i'm pretty sure that
would<00:02:49.620> have<00:02:49.710> been<00:02:49.770> purple<00:02:50.190> i<00:02:50.370> may<00:02:51.180> be<00:02:51.240> wrong

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
would have been purple i may be wrong

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.110 
would have been purple i may be wrong
but<00:02:51.570> only<00:02:52.530> we<00:02:52.890> can<00:02:53.040> only<00:02:53.190> tell<00:02:53.460> in<00:02:53.730> two<00:02:53.880> years

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
but only we can only tell in two years

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.560 
but only we can only tell in two years

of<00:03:00.270> felt<00:03:00.510> like<00:03:00.600> there<00:03:01.290> wasn't<00:03:01.470> much<00:03:01.740> going<00:03:02.010> on

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
of felt like there wasn't much going on

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.790 
of felt like there wasn't much going on
in<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.090> sense<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.480> we<00:03:04.020> got<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.350> quick<00:03:04.590> cut

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
in the sense that we got a quick cut

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.860 
in the sense that we got a quick cut
away<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.220> kages<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.880> can't<00:03:06.420> believe<00:03:06.540> they

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
away to the kages I can't believe they

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.050 
away to the kages I can't believe they
off-screen<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.710> fight<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.280> mean<00:03:08.790> when<00:03:08.970> they

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
off-screen that fight I mean when they

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.210 
off-screen that fight I mean when they
get<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.300> animating<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.050> really<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.920> really

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
get to animating this I really I really

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.210 
get to animating this I really I really
hope<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.630> they<00:03:12.810> add<00:03:13.050> some<00:03:13.410> filler<00:03:13.710> stuff<00:03:14.040> in

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
hope that they add some filler stuff in

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.440 
hope that they add some filler stuff in
there<00:03:14.370> where<00:03:14.580> they<00:03:14.670> show<00:03:14.880> us<00:03:15.030> what<00:03:15.240> happened

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
there where they show us what happened

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.010 
there where they show us what happened
because<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.530> sort<00:03:16.710> of<00:03:16.770> off<00:03:16.980> screaming<00:03:17.370> crap

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
because this sort of off screaming crap

the<00:03:35.220> fight<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.700> think<00:03:36.150> I'm<00:03:36.270> allowed<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.660> be<00:03:36.720> a

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
the fight I think I'm allowed to be a

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.570 
the fight I think I'm allowed to be a
little<00:03:36.959> disappointed<00:03:37.170> in<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.709> think<00:03:38.400> about

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
little disappointed in that think about

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.720 
little disappointed in that think about
it<00:03:38.760> okay<00:03:39.320> but<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.350> Kakashi<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.130> guy<00:03:41.250> were<00:03:41.550> kind

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
it okay but a Kakashi and guy were kind

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.540 
it okay but a Kakashi and guy were kind
of<00:03:41.760> useless<00:03:42.950> let's<00:03:43.950> just<00:03:44.100> be<00:03:44.220> honest<00:03:44.459> they

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
of useless let's just be honest they

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.670 
of useless let's just be honest they
didn't<00:03:44.790> do<00:03:44.880> too<00:03:45.030> much<00:03:45.110> and<00:03:46.110> it's<00:03:46.230> obvious<00:03:46.650> that

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
didn't do too much and it's obvious that

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.530
