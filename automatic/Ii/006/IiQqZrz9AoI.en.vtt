00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.740
 floors which can be fully 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.880
 closes they are called and I will not be called 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.070
 it said how to make such a floor 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.399
 now tell 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:15.540
 like a mirror 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.630
 this is possible if you use 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.360
 bulk solutions work with them one 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.050
 pleasure 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.590
 poured and told 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.680
 then the self-leveling floor will start pumping it 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.680
 as if by magic evenly 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.680
 distributed over the entire surface 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.140
 the truth will be expensive but you can and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.250
 save less mix 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.050
 first level the surface 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.400
 cement mortar 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.270
 for this perky kent on 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.850
 distance of a meter from each other and their height 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.200
 should be reduced by 5 millimeters and how 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.200
 this is the distance for the medals on the court 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.740
 only flaw 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.700
 will have to wait for the screed to dry 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.700
 only 28 days later 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.380
 then the floor is sure to sweep or 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.550
 vacuum cleaner mustafin than not get 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.550
 sleek asher shawai 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.750
 but on this prep 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.300
 work does not end 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.260
 the surface must have been tried 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
 then the self-leveling floor will be taken more reliably 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.940
 while the primer dries prepare the solution 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.259
 We fall asleep precisely mixture year and not vice versa 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.659
 otherwise there will be lumps 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.270
 if the room is big for one you donâ€™t 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.119
 can handle the solution quickly 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:30.729
 freezes 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.079
 and someone had to constantly 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.609
 stirring and pour out the visitors 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.049
 the solution on almost immediately by reflection 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.040
 his roller 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.670
 Well, to be what does not fit is needed only 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.220
 and ringed out of the solution then the whole 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.720
 air 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.070
 when the work is finished give full 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.220
 dry out 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.240
 after four hours it will already be possible 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.780
 walk a day later and generally put 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.060
 any topcoat what is it 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.120
 will except over linoleum or tile 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.530
