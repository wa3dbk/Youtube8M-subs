00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello tankers with you sledge 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.400
 So today I decided to remove this Vidosik 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.280
 In short, how to increase the fps in the game in tanks 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.049
 that is, that's how it is you now we 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.929
 shorter do it with the program 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.330
 that is , you can download this program 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.590
 I will have a link to it under the video 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.230
 called on twitter 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.500
 that's for tanks that's shorter then create 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.599
 let's see here when you download it yes here 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.490
 This program, that is , you have an archive 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.080
 trip up to unzip it here with us 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.489
 there will be such a daddy tracker called 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.620
 look carefully read further 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.120
 do that is very simple very easy 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.800
 done now i'll show you all 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.899
 fad that is everything is clear nowhere 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.590
 Nothing wrong so now look 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.719
 to the law 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.860
 but opened the daddy yes here I am a little bit 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.539
 side go now my computer c 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.500
 games go to the game folder for you 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.879
 the game is installed here is the world of tanks all 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.550
 now we just have to show 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.649
 remember turned out to be under what will you 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.510
 the archive of the dacha download that is copy and 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.370
 paste into the root folder of tanks 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.119
 see the way which world of tanks 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.430
 paste paste so i will copy replacements 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.310
 but because we have been here I have 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.110
 she as if you still will not have her 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.689
 you just copied look further 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.280
 here you need to do so now consider 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.049
 Now you have appeared so now these two files 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.820
 first we need with one file took 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.799
 Now let's see which one is shorter 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.180
 see what you need to do here 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.680
 look first where on poke 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.200
 shortcut yes that's what's where 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.200
 written in 15 look here two yes 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.270
 you look 15 and the second in this again then 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.340
 there is nothing means why they are needed 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.060
 I will explain to you later that is the beginning you 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.670
 poke on a label in 15 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.909
 click now here to modify 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.009
 resources year fuck here you press all the hour 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.860
 here it goes with us 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.840
 modification that is here with the help of this 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.420
 programs from us fps will increase ariana 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.640
 somewhere well maybe 20 at least 10 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.310
 15 raise fps also let you have been 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.770
 30 to 40 40 here and so about 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.350
 That principle is not to interfere with it 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.509
 there will be no damage to the schedule then there is a schedule 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.640
 you will have exactly the same way I play 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.110
 the graph is not affected in any way by the principal 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.020
 So 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.940
 this this and what we do this with 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.860
 using the program we will unload you 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.000
 say correctly and we will have less 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.680
 The processor is loaded with a game, that is, everything 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.560
 resource modification completed 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.570
 so from all we close by 2 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.060
 class look further you need to do something 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.900
 there is open now at 25 is about to 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.550
 poke at her look at her click 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.850
 so allow this simple opinion to rotate 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.320
 me firewall it as if to any request 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.450
 he reacts well, I specifically 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.160
 installed here and see you here 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.230
 will indicate the path to the game folder then 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.030
 there is prescribed here let 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.739
 principle he look like he will you 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.800
 way daoud father games world of tanks 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.340
 Well, how would you be there before the way 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.170
 In my opinion 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.280
 some kind of drink is about to be 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:06.500
 look here now question about so 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.150
 will indicate the path here so it will be up 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.250
 about and further to be written c-game 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.560
 100 see what to do here it seemed 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.200
 opens just like that 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.660
 this will point the way and erase everything so sometimes 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.310
 then press enter and here you are 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.980
 found a way that is, it will find its way in 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.049
 I already found and see what we are 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.820
 Further do as moo Vicoy urine need 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.790
 disabled need to turn on about now 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.489
 I'll tell you about the smoke from the exhaust pipe tea 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.500
 here we unload processor power here 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.450
 see off now smoke from 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.010
 destroyed tanks will be disabled 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.560
 plus the fact that you turn it off and because 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.420
 that a lot of enemies before hiding behind 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.610
 destroyed tank there smokes them even 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.200
 for the gameplay it will be better even our any 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.739
 smoke any fog heavily load 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.019
 CPU 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.670
 here's a demi plan further when fired 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.590
 leave it for now 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.270
 the effect of the explosion of shells this too 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.459
 leave so here's the effect 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.140
 hitting the tank here it is too 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.330
 leave the effect of destruction 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.270
 the effect of the destruction of the tank that is it that 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.980
 such when you hit a tank is killed 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.110
 he is in tatters scattering there all sorts 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.239
 slivers shards from it flies off it too 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.920
 reserve principle beautifully well, who is 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.610
 don't really need can turn it off too 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.290
 unload the processor so normal here 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.660
 You can also disable that is to increase 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.549
 fps here's the further effect of hitting 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.530
 objects that is, you can turn it off 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.840
 the effect of the destruction of objects that is here 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:29.720
 this is the most basic here we turn it off 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:35.060
 one hundred percent so so allow now 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.830
 it will turn off all-all disabled effect 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.720
 Destruction of objects will disable us very 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.490
 the processor is very heavily loaded 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.350
 there is this we are straight hundred pounds off 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.760
 you even here with the help of this 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.430
 disable only one effects somewhere 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.740
 tasty fps on 10 grow here further 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.690
 than we have here the effect of the movement of trees in 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.400
 In principle, I leave it as if u 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.680
 you are very weak jelly to know what is 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.340
 walking in the wind blowing on the trees is not so 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.890
 too garden 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.900
 that's how someone would have a very weak iron 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.400
 Yes, do not pull the odd can turn off 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.090
 this fps also goes up to about 5 where 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.190
 units here next 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.260
 cloud display effect if the sky 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.250
 no, that is, leave the sky here 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:15.530
 here one two three 4 points just disconnect 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.140
 you fps somewhere at 20 will grow at least by 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.700
 a dozen units here let's all 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.860
 happy all while sanya was with you 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.990
 here is subscribed to my channel like 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.940
 do not like dislikes 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.630
 leave comments all good luck 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.630
 bye everyone
