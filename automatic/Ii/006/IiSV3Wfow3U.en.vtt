 quiet kid I'm not going to eat you 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.710
 It turns out that I saw you fall and I thought that 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.530
 an animal like you should not walk 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:35.150
 just here with you you are alone 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:37.900
 you are only many animals 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.900
 meet me 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.910
 also almost everyone was scared away 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.890
 when they see me coming, they run out to 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.070
 shelter they lack time for 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:55.040
 get rid of the medium that interesting does not 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:57.970
 say was for the heart actually 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.490
 they say it took away their appetite 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:07.960
 it's like you have a special power 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:11.470
 well, it's really quite powerful 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.510
 ideal for you to get to a 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.410
 small haven of tranquility near 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.410
 that big rock 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.540
 You want me to accompany you, see someone else 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.619
 huge warthog around here that 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.090
 accidentally have some fangs 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.200
 sharp and the power to chase away 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.409
 predators 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.990
 I am you but you and I have the houses 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:40.750
 with identical sheets as friends 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:48.340
 quiet I would say as the acquaintances or 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.340
 good to the grave 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.620
 of agreement then walking in agreement 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.170
 known 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.150
 hey act of a thing is worth if not 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.570
 you thought to eat me what kind of boar 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.130
 majareta in 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.130
 I am an insectivore 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.200
 Well, it's all right, I just did not know that 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.910
 personally I have some weakness for 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.240
 the sayings that creep you who live 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.520
 see that I prefer the salty pump 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.920
 this could be the beginning of a 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.920
 beautiful relationship of hearts
