00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
going to be very high in sugar it's

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.810 
going to be very high in sugar it's
going<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.750> be<00:03:13.290> very<00:03:13.320> low<00:03:13.800> in<00:03:13.980> protein<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.490> it's

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
going to be very low in protein and it's

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.080

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
going to be high in carbs this is uh

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.910 
going to be high in carbs this is uh
only<00:03:18.090> has<00:03:18.239> nine<00:03:18.540> grams<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:19.170> carbs<00:03:19.500> in<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.739> so

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
only has nine grams of carbs in it so

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.440 
only has nine grams of carbs in it so
it's<00:03:20.070> low<00:03:20.310> in<00:03:20.489> carbs<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.060> it's<00:03:21.209> high<00:03:21.420> in

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
it's low in carbs and it's high in

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.780 
it's low in carbs and it's high in
protein<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:22.320> low<00:03:22.800> in<00:03:22.980> sugar<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.459> exact

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
protein is low in sugar the exact

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.660 
protein is low in sugar the exact
opposite<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.540> what<00:03:24.600> those<00:03:24.870> other<00:03:25.670> sugary

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
whey protein that's going to go in there

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.580 
whey protein that's going to go in there
too<00:03:57.980> when<00:03:58.980> dump<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.400> on<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:00.690> if<00:04:01.260> those<00:04:01.410> of
