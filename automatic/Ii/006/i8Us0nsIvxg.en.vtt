 but how did tv plug always start 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.659
 we have this stigma of having to do 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.060
 a movie us as a sign 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.489
 I expected a lot of time to put a 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.470
 lots of whims like cinema like 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.870

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.459

 video and on this platform the language 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.760
 simple and colloquial that they use in their 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.820
 stories has allowed them to win 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.160
 tremendous popularity getting by 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.100

 improvised on the subject all were 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.709
 cinema and acting and the quality of their 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.650
 parodies that impact in colombia
