00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.010
 6th place of jaime martinez d'ailleurs 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.959
 it's steve guard at 33 years 9th world 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.580
 its its tenth finals world cup 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:14.020
 it's a little pulidor of the seven 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.720
 World Cup finals because it was two 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.060
 2nd time in 2012 with milo second in 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.990
 2013 with nido the first time he 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.539
 came here it was in the final in 2005 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.130
 with piano heap he had finished the 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.210
 sixth place he's every time the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.059
 shot 6th 2nd 2nd 5th for example enough 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.949
 ranking but he misses the final 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:40.319
 he does not want it and castling and his 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.319
 accomplice canal 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.970
 not too available 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.800
 or 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.750
 and I lie a jump very very well and this 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.020
 who makes a reasonable game path 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.540
 quickly but we feel it continues 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.430
 really he's not going faster than his 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.430
 mare we see her African strategy 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.430
 have missed their little luck in 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.430
 is short 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:45.580
 our good obstacle to jump but that's it 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.280
 I was going to say will count more than well 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.220
 filled a village of asome rome 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.620
 yeah that's not heating the box if he 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.430
 stayed really in his tempo in 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.410
 his strategy 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.120
 the reason is a signed by and swiss 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.090
 with the Olympic champion steeve 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.369
 diabaye the mare french saddle payet 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.200
 of the laroque which is again a beautiful 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.800
 introduction well done for the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.940
 two Swiss 1 that they are that's good 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.280
 returned to this in this 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.090
 steve competition so who will take a 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.099
 priori 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.099
 a good place the fifth but yes 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.310
 it's very well played he passes 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.840
 Martin Fuchs front and set back 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.400
 also by the way if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.290
 yes he is faster than penelope 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.470
 Leprévost Penélope has therefore dropped the 6th 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.470
 square
