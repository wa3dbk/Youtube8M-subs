00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 bellot sport has created an exclusive 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.060
 version of the new 208 gti for 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.849
 participate in the 24 hours of 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.940
 nürbürgring eduardo bueno has stolen this 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.469
 very coveted piece to prove it very 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.469
 background in the jarama circuit 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.099
 jackie stewart world champion 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.419
 formula 1 on three occasions defined it 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.369
 as the green hell 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.050
 nürbürgring may be the most 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.060
 dangerous and respected by all 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.849
 pilots but it is the circuit with which 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.170
 all pilots dream through the 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.360
 amateur circuit fight that has run and 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.239
 it will probably mark a before and a 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.739
 later in my career as a pilot 22 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.239
 kilometers of straight travel 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.250
 endless in which cars 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.530
 they take off from the asphalt their fast tracing 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.050
 make unique the 24 hours of 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.640
 nürbürgring people is a things that 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.719
 it was indescribable but 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.010
 probably the most circuit 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.010
 emblematic of the world 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.340
 during a weekend, thousands live together 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.469
 of amateurs who feel true 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.089
 passion for competition together with 200 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.100
 Cars looking for a vote on the podium 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.110
 probably the hardest to hoist the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.630
 the time changes is very usual 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.980
 It's raining that he stops managing the 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.600
 traffic 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.100
 pablo martín de andrés has had the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.600
 opportunity to run in hell 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.580
 green thanks to the selection of pilots 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.200
 which carries out period 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.090
 this call was held in 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.220
 eight European countries and among the most 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.140
 of 5 andy data that there was in Spain only 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.850
 there were five that after facing 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.650
 different tests crowned Gonzalo 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.940
 martín de andrés as national ambassador 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.930
 to run alongside other pilots 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.940
 European 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.310
 and that is that I threw out an entire offensive 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.440
 sports with the new 208 have a 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.000
 rally version another spectacular 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.740
 of more than 800 horses with the and 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.840
 Sebastian then ran in the mythical 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.940
 rise so steve and then it 's is 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.030
 with which they occupied the first three 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.960
 positions in the 24 hours of euros 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.790
 aesthetically attracts attention 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.280
 the aerodynamics has been worked up 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.360
 the limits allowed by the regulation 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.280
 find support and the best 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.170
 stability is fundamental because the 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.690
 average speed is very high in nürburg 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.190
 on the display you can see all the information 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.630
 of the car and with the buttons on the 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.140
 steering wheel handle the main 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.140
 functions 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.350
 one of the first things that stands out from 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.300
 this car is that the clutch is 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.750
 very high you have to release it very 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.280
 Slowly and start carefully 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.780
 the clutch you do not have to go back to 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.490
 use it from now on we just 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.580
 we drive the car with the cams of 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.580
 steering wheel 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.810
 to the acceleration that the change has 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.060
 It works superbly well so 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.739
 it's also front interaction and it's from 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.739
 the most balanced we have tried 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.629
 fast you do not have to be afraid you can go 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.150
 quietly with the pedal fully 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.400
 it has very well although maybe it takes about 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.319
 settings more typical of nürbürgring but 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.470
 goes more common circuits like this 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.250
 The jarama is too soft 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.010
 In slow areas gas must be supplied 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.420
 progressively 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.250
 because it has 330 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.250
 I feel that they can lose 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.159
 of the things that I like the most is the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.230
 braking that you have can brake very 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.579
 late and when you think that you're not going to 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.240
 enter the curve and you will go long 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.130
 you come in perfectly 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.020
 and it's balanced because it's a car that 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.330
 It does not stand out for anything but it 's good at 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.430
 lathe suspension engine brakes 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.440
 stability in the curve step the box 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.160
 of changes everything has an optimal point of 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.160
 functioning 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.719
 for the pilots to run in hell 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.730
 green is a milestone in its 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.040
 sports careers for engineers 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.599
 a whole mechanical challenge that 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.730
 becomes pride as in this case 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:56.000
 when they reach the first three 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.150
 podium positions 22 kilometers of 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.280
 travel with more than 80 years of history 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.349
 it is the afternoon sun the loneliness of the 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.519
 night the cold of the morning and the taste 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.069
 of triumph 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:11.260
 nürbürgring is the green hell 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.260
 or just a different circuit
