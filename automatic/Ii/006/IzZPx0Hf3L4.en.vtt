to be easy to counter so you just pull

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.799 
to be easy to counter so you just pull
straight<00:00:45.930> down<00:00:46.910> just<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.570> mag

right right now I've got the m5 k and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.780 
right right now I've got the m5 k and
here's<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> reason<00:01:07.500> why<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.580> it's

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
here's the reason why I like this it's

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.210 
here's the reason why I like this it's
not<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.150> accurate<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.869> mp7<00:01:10.140> let's<00:01:10.979> look<00:01:11.070> at

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
not as accurate as the mp7 let's look at

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.600 
not as accurate as the mp7 let's look at
the<00:01:11.310> recoil<00:01:12.680> pretty<00:01:13.680> harsh<00:01:13.920> vertical<00:01:14.430> recoil

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the recoil pretty harsh vertical recoil

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.450 
the recoil pretty harsh vertical recoil
all<00:01:15.150> right<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.409> controllable<00:01:16.950> let's

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
all right but it's controllable let's

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.340 
all right but it's controllable let's
see<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.570> don't<00:01:18.689> want<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> waste<00:01:18.960> too<00:01:19.229> much

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
see you I don't want to waste too much

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.560 
see you I don't want to waste too much
ammo<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:20.430> right<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:20.970> that's<00:01:21.030> controllable

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
ammo all right but that's controllable

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.820 
ammo all right but that's controllable
so<00:01:21.750> angle<00:01:22.170> want<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> tell<00:01:22.560> me<00:01:22.650> how<00:01:22.740> much

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
so angle want you tell me how much

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
so angle want you tell me how much
damage<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.250> does<00:01:24.920> did<00:01:25.920> 25<00:01:26.220> damage<00:01:26.670> and

damage just does did 25 damage and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.390 
damage just does did 25 damage and
that's<00:01:27.390> why<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.229> kit<00:01:28.530> they<00:01:29.009> buffed

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
that's why I like this kit they buffed

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.670 
that's why I like this kit they buffed
the<00:01:29.579> damage<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.479> mp7<00:01:30.900> does<00:01:31.380> less

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the damage on it the mp7 does less

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.069 
the damage on it the mp7 does less
damage<00:01:31.710> per<00:01:32.310> bullet<00:01:32.659> alright<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.960> has<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
damage per bullet alright but it has a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.810 
damage per bullet alright but it has a
highly<00:01:34.350> controlled<00:01:34.799> recoil<00:01:35.340> with<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> great

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
highly controlled recoil with a great

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.330 
highly controlled recoil with a great
hipfire<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.509> hasn't<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.439> has<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.890> higher

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
hipfire this hasn't this has a higher

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.660 
hipfire this hasn't this has a higher
recoil<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.750> destroys<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:41.390> quickly<00:01:43.670> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
recoil but it destroys you quickly and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.780 
recoil but it destroys you quickly and
on<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.030> next<00:01:45.210> kit<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.810> with<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.649> m16<00:01:47.340> being

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
on to the next kit so with the m16 being

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.359 
on to the next kit so with the m16 being
nerfed<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.810> recoil<00:01:49.350> being<00:01:49.590> changed<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.130> my

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
nerfed the recoil being changed in my

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.359 
nerfed the recoil being changed in my
opinion<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> m16<00:01:51.479> recoil<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.140> not<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.860> bad

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
opinion the m16 recoil is not that bad

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.580 
opinion the m16 recoil is not that bad
and<00:01:53.729> I'll<00:01:54.210> make<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> video<00:01:54.689> specifically<00:01:55.320> on

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and I'll make a video specifically on

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.660 
and I'll make a video specifically on
that<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.280> some<00:01:56.640> other<00:01:56.670> kits<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.860> m416<00:01:58.860> might

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
that and some other kits but m416 might

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.850 
that and some other kits but m416 might
be<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.570> new<00:02:00.780> flavor<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.320> week<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.710> let's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
be the new flavor of the week so let's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.910 
be the new flavor of the week so let's
take<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.040> look<00:02:02.310> at<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> recoil<00:02:02.820> pattern<00:02:03.240> and

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
take a look at the recoil pattern and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.580 
take a look at the recoil pattern and
without<00:02:04.920> countering<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.869> man<00:02:06.869> looks<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.409> lot

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
without countering it man looks a lot

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.070 
without countering it man looks a lot
like<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> old<00:02:08.099> m16<00:02:08.670> powder<00:02:08.910> doesn't<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.450> so

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
like the old m16 powder doesn't it so

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.840 
like the old m16 powder doesn't it so
how<00:02:10.319> do<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.470> counter<00:02:10.590> that

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
how do you counter that

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.720 
how do you counter that
you<00:02:12.690> pull<00:02:12.960> straight<00:02:13.290> down<00:02:13.320> that's<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.310> there's

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
you pull straight down that's it there's

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.100 
you pull straight down that's it there's
not<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.910> lot<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.090> horizontal<00:02:15.630> swayed<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.900> this

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
not a lot of horizontal swayed to this

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.680 
not a lot of horizontal swayed to this
gun<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.370> let's<00:02:17.790> see<00:02:17.940> what<00:02:18.060> we<00:02:18.180> could<00:02:18.300> do<00:02:18.450> from

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
gun so let's see what we could do from

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.450 
gun so let's see what we could do from
some<00:02:19.290> distance<00:02:19.680> because<00:02:19.860> obviously<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.310> is

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
some distance because obviously this is

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.210 
some distance because obviously this is
assault<00:02:20.730> kit<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:22.590> know<00:02:22.680> that's<00:02:22.950> that's

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
assault kit and you know that's that's

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.900 
assault kit and you know that's that's
what<00:02:23.430> we<00:02:23.550> want<00:02:23.790> with<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.210> is<00:02:24.510> some<00:02:25.080> distance

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
what we want with this is some distance

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.130 
what we want with this is some distance
burst<00:02:26.910> burst<00:02:29.000> do<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.090> one<00:02:30.210> more<00:02:30.240> time<00:02:30.360> revive

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
burst burst do it one more time revive

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.700 
burst burst do it one more time revive

they did mess with some of the other

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.150 
they did mess with some of the other
reloads<00:02:36.120> like<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.750> AEK<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.350> AEK<00:02:37.770> is<00:02:37.920> probably

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
reloads like the AEK the AEK is probably

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.580 
reloads like the AEK the AEK is probably
going<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.370> be<00:02:38.430> one<00:02:38.490> of<00:02:38.550> my<00:02:38.670> go-to<00:02:38.820> kits<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.590> one
