00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello good today I bring you this cute 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.280
 design are some skulls 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.480
 but they like they are very easy to 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.619
 do and will teach them what they use 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.390
 use black enamel black pointer 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.180
 white pointer and also the crisis more 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.370
 what white 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.140
 I explain to you to use those 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.350
 they are is basically two colors but 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.480
 in different ways the first thing they're going to 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.510
 to do is grab your black enamel and 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.280
 paint your nails for example that I 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.320
 I advanced here in I bring the painted nail 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.050
 in black then they will paint the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.590
 black mesh then they will grab your enamel 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.129
 of white pointer and they will mark their 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.129
 skull 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.510
 it does not matter if they have chacao 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.510
 now we are going to fix it 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.620
 they will mark what is coming but first 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:03.270
 the bottom part and then they 're going to score 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.270
 what is the skull 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.040
 if we stay as I say they are going to 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:16.200
 right now we correct it 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.200
 then they are going to make your skull from the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 skull 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.690
 How can you give the skull with the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.690
 same pointer but as it does not come out 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.690
 that I'm going to use white enamel 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.439
 you use white enamel to paint 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.439
 skull 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.219
 and since you have the skull painted 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.600
 completely does not matter if you get a 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.690
 little crashes 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.360
 now we are going to accommodate it 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.980
 and today you have it all white so 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.980
 what he's going to do is grab your black dot 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.860
 and you have to give them the black pointer you're going to 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:08.740
 mark you will mark the outline of the 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.740
 skull you're going to mark for example here 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.980
 and then here 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.800
 now if the skulls 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.200
 and that were 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.050
 I really liked this design for now 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.240
 day of the Dead 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.910
 you can use it for halloween 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.340
 and this I loved 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.290
 and then with the same tip you go to 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.360
 mark as it is well well dry by 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.520
 example myself the glazes I use 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:53.840
 They are flying, you are going to mark 3 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:58.300
 lines to create the mouth 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.300
 and then it's going to be an inverted heart 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.739
 for the nose 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.209
 well I get a little choco and then 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.420
 you're going to give the droplets were going to be the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.420
 eyes 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.579
 are you going to do this like this 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.519
 a little door set up crooks like this is going 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.890
 to be said then the last thing would be 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.469
 give it a finish with a glaze 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.980
 transparent a shine and you will stay 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:31.959
 and they will stay as they are here I hope 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.750
