00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 before starting the video I would like to 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.830
 ask you to curry in my 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.100
 facebook page follow me without knot 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.100

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.540
 save people save on youtube the fall of 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.550
 48 78 with another video for you 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.010
 and today is the day to break paradigms not 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.230
 talk about manga and anime football 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.789
 heavy topics I would talk about a 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.099
 cartoon 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.720
 but there is no cartoon of course 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.130
 which is but I'm talking about a production 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.289
 American 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.540
 for many it may not be a novelty 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.750
 perhaps some have followed from 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.140
 child but anyway I just saw 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.309
 I started doing what about 20 days ago and finished 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.649
 yesterday and I talk about avatar besides dengue 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.410
 a work produced by nickelodeon of 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.649
 2005 to 2008 with episodes already more or 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.260
 less 22 minutes like any anime in 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.770
 any common design and which 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.390
 lasted 61 episodes in three seasons and 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.539
 You must be wondering more. 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.330
 because now that you have more than 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.549
 18 years old decided to see a drawing and why 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.439
 avatar and why are you going to talk about 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.689
 There are so many animals that you 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.799
 could have seen in that time and then the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.740
 ball 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.450
 relax, I'll explain my good 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.790
 brother he is an addict of it netflix 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.500
 came to say netflix practically yes 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.110
 launches every day with something new and 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.180
 he sees everything and he said that avatar is 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.829
 very good as well as several other 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.140
 people throughout the year while I 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.030
 grew up while seeing naruto right there in 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.369
 At age 12, everyone was talking about 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.040
 avatar which was good and I always had this 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.159
 scrotum prejudice about why the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.700
 audio was not in Japanese yes I am a 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.500
 great investment of thinking that he could only 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.049
 should see Japanese productions only 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.810
 there should be anime even though the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.880
 own avatar is very inspired if 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.770
 inspired animals in the formats 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.780
 of current animes 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.520
 anyway I'm very close to this 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.320
 set of elements fire air earth event 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.429
 and through some conversations in the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.890
 Half-sea-to- type vacation is the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.680
 format of the design to the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.469
 screenplay and the young 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.840
 first of all I decided to give it a chance 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:19.790
 even because he had had on netflix launched 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.519
 a new season and that's when I decided 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.500
 give it a try and I simply addicted 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.989
 for those who do not know avatar 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.299
 it has its own mythology based on 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.609
 elements of Chinese culture and 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.159
 Japanese as this mythology 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.239
 in the world there are four nations 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.180
 nomads of the air 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.180
 the tribe of water the nation of fire and kingdom 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.730
 of the land within each nation there is a 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.769
 certain views and hierarchical attitude 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.019
 different nations live each 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.560
 different and within each nation there are 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.870
 the dominators of each element is in the 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.060
 there are water dominators in the 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.579
 earth there is a domineering earth in the air 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.010
 is exclusively to maintain the 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.500
 balance between the four nations 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.810
 There is a guy who reincarnates I think 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.389
 which is 100 years old but I 'm not sure 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.099
 and this affection is the avatar that 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.769
 controls the four elements and is 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.840
 extremely powerful which happens to 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.569
 a fascist way the realm of fire 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.489
 decided to dominate the world and what happens 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.159
 as they knew the next avatar 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:26.870
 would be reincarnated among the nomads of the air 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:29.180
 they attack a weight and decimate is to do 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.949
 really a genocide of the dominators 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.840
 air but on getting a little 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:39.260
 unconscious until he eventually escaped 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.169
 this freezing at sea was one hundred years 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.949
 and two boys a girl one 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:48.409
 boy the two brothers find the avatar 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:50.479
 frozen and begin the adventure 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.250
 the goal of the avatar is very clear to 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:54.349
 hold the four elements and it 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.939
 defeat the lord of the fire by preventing 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.790
 he dominates the world by bringing back 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.680
 peace he had mastered the 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.949
 obvious mind because he was from the tribe of 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.319
 air, then there was earth and fire 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:08.540
 thus subdivided each season 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.530
 in the first one in thesis it is called a 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.540
 water book 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.739
 in the second the book of the earth and the last 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.959
 fire book 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.849
 yes the central block is very simple 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.009
 target audience is for kids 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:21.380
 What can you tell with oscar do 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:24.950
 design and a few little jokes months to 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.480
 relieve the tension a little, but the subject 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.390
 various themes 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.730
 inside avatar are very complex 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.010
 including psychological development of 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.520
 each character's development 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.890
 novels is and even on the global issue 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.080
 because the avatar does not stop being a 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.540
 mediator of peace and who has to deal with 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.060
 paradigms is what it should 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.160
 make to end the lord of the fire 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.020
 He has to go there just to kill more 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.300
 this was not what the monks 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.280
 taught he is a page preacher 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.280
 It will end, he will seek peace with 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.980
 violence is not a little incoherent and there 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.140
 a series of questions and 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.170
 psychological philosophical 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.510
 besides growing, even you are and are 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.890
 the presence of the growth of the 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.670
 characters that they start in the first 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:16.130
 season as weak and 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.040
 evolving and becoming practically 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.350
 adults and they do not become pass 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.090
 only a year to the end but they do not 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.250
 they kind of do not end up like adults anymore 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.960
 they have a very mature head 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.760
 one thing is clear also the 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.510
 animation development is small 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.370
 Season 1, I think it hits you. 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.980
 was not very large then the 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.530
 animation was pretty much so, but in 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:42.170
 second and third 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.260
 Look at the stuff there, do not you fucking talk 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.180
 there are many animals the final fight is for 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.300
 take the hat, I swear to God, it's a fuck 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:54.370
 Cock so that's my people I 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:58.820
 I chose avatar as kzk recommends 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:00.830
 exactly the 22nd case it recommends not 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.740
 It's an anime is not a manga 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:08.690
 it's not a movie, it 's nothing, it's a drawing 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:11.540
 American and is an avatar or if you 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.940
 have netflix or do you want to watch 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.230
 This is what I recommend, thank you all 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.150
 who watched the video if they liked 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.640
 would like to subscribe favorite in 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:23.150
 do not forget to watch 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:25.820
 vote because it is very good because it varies 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:29.170
 little of the average anime and because house and 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.170
 Recommend here
