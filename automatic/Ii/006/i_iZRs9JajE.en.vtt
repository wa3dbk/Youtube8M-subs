00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
a browser is pretty much the exact same

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.289 
a browser is pretty much the exact same
as<00:01:42.030> before<00:01:42.180> no<00:01:43.049> differences<00:01:43.880> but<00:01:44.880> let's<00:01:45.180> have

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
as before no differences but let's have

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.899 
as before no differences but let's have
enough<00:01:45.479> apps

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.880 

let's<00:01:50.909> open<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.360> another<00:01:51.630> app<00:01:51.810> app<00:01:52.500> store<00:01:52.860> for

let's open of another app app store for

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.289 
let's open of another app app store for
our<00:01:53.220> example<00:01:54.950> okay<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:55.979> was<00:01:56.280> seven<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.790> FAFSA

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
our example okay I was seven is FAFSA

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.929 
our example okay I was seven is FAFSA
did<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.630> see<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.280> was<00:01:59.280> eight<00:01:59.520> still

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
did you see that I was eight still

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.100 
did you see that I was eight still
loading<00:02:01.460> even<00:02:02.460> though<00:02:02.670> both<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.299> them<00:02:03.780> are

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
loading even though both of them are

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.480 
loading even though both of them are
leaning<00:02:04.710> stalls

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
leaning stalls

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.350 
leaning stalls
it's<00:02:06.149> pretty<00:02:06.570> strange

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.730 

later<00:02:13.360> those<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.990> Nam<00:02:14.430> weather<00:02:18.870> okay<00:02:19.870> pretty

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
later those of Nam weather okay pretty

better<00:02:34.710> you<00:02:35.710> see<00:02:35.920> here<00:02:36.160> how<00:02:36.340> smooth<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:37.300> not<00:02:37.570> a

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
better you see here how smooth is not a

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.840 
better you see here how smooth is not a
control<00:02:38.200> center<00:02:38.440> our<00:02:38.710> pops<00:02:39.040> up<00:02:39.250> on<00:02:39.520> I<00:02:39.730> was

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
control center our pops up on I was

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.510 
control center our pops up on I was
eight<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:41.260> now<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.560> does<00:02:41.770> here<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.220> likes

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:03.620 

and<00:02:57.130> let's<00:02:57.760> try<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.300> a<00:02:58.450> search<00:02:58.870> function<00:03:01.590> okay

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
and let's try is a search function okay

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:11.580 
and let's try is a search function okay
no<00:03:04.630> docks<00:03:06.720> exactly<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.900> same<00:03:09.570> maybe<00:03:10.570> but<00:03:11.560> just

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
no docks exactly the same maybe but just

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.750 
no docks exactly the same maybe but just

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
see it feels good actually smooth I know

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.270 
see it feels good actually smooth I know
is<00:04:17.710> eight<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.970> just<00:04:19.560> as<00:04:20.560> smooth<00:04:20.799> and<00:04:21.040> I<00:04:21.130> was

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
is eight and just as smooth and I was

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.180 
is eight and just as smooth and I was
seven

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.950 

well<00:04:27.190> you<00:04:27.460> can<00:04:27.610> basically<00:04:28.120> decide<00:04:28.449> yourself

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
well you can basically decide yourself

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.810 
well you can basically decide yourself
which<00:04:29.110> one<00:04:29.590> do<00:04:29.770> you<00:04:29.830> like<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:30.220> best<00:04:30.430> I<00:04:30.790> believe

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
which one do you like the best I believe

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.600 
which one do you like the best I believe
that<00:04:31.600> those<00:04:31.870> are<00:04:31.930> pretty<00:04:32.590> great<00:04:32.919> and<00:04:33.160> fluent

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
that those are pretty great and fluent

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.379 
that those are pretty great and fluent
and<00:04:33.760> smooth<00:04:34.139> but<00:04:35.139> maybe<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:35.770> was<00:04:36.130> 7<00:04:36.460> is<00:04:36.729> just<00:04:36.760> a

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
and smooth but maybe I was 7 is just a

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.409 
and smooth but maybe I was 7 is just a
little<00:04:37.770> better<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:39.100> faster<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.760> open<00:04:40.120> a<00:04:40.180> box

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
little better and faster to open a box

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.159 
little better and faster to open a box
but<00:04:40.930> just<00:04:41.380> because<00:04:41.979> of<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:43.000> apps<00:04:43.240> in<00:04:43.510> here<00:04:43.840> are

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
but just because of the apps in here are

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.310 
but just because of the apps in here are
more<00:04:44.740> optimized<00:04:45.430> for<00:04:45.639> a<00:04:45.699> 7<00:04:46.150> than<00:04:46.630> they<00:04:46.810> are<00:04:46.840> for

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
more optimized for a 7 than they are for

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.400 
more optimized for a 7 than they are for
iOS<00:04:47.560> 8<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.850> developers<00:04:49.419> will<00:04:49.780> probably<00:04:50.380> a

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
iOS 8 the developers will probably a

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.680 
iOS 8 the developers will probably a
pager<00:04:50.830> I<00:04:51.310> was<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.729> tabs<00:04:52.000> in<00:04:52.389> the<00:04:52.690> near<00:04:52.840> future<00:04:54.690> so

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
pager I was a tabs in the near future so

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.480 
pager I was a tabs in the near future so
let's<00:04:55.870> open<00:04:55.990> up<00:04:56.199> a<00:04:56.260> heavy<00:04:56.590> web<00:04:56.860> site<00:04:57.130> we

that
f7<00:05:31.050> was<00:05:31.470> a<00:05:31.500> lot<00:05:32.010> faster<00:05:33.890> unless<00:05:34.890> of<00:05:35.250> knobs<00:05:35.520> a

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
f7 was a lot faster unless of knobs a

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:45.020 
f7 was a lot faster unless of knobs a
desktop<00:05:36.240> version<00:05:38.330> desktop<00:05:43.280> again<00:05:44.280> i'll<00:05:44.520> seven

beated up
whoa<00:05:47.930> there<00:05:48.930> is<00:05:49.020> a<00:05:49.050> big<00:05:49.350> difference

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.970 

this<00:05:54.750> is<00:05:54.930> ready<00:05:56.870> and<00:05:57.870> what<00:05:58.200> what's<00:05:58.770> happening

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
this is ready and what what's happening

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.460 
this is ready and what what's happening
and<00:05:59.880> this<00:06:00.419> is<00:06:00.480> ready<00:06:00.870> a<00:06:01.020> lot<00:06:01.590> later<00:06:02.810> so<00:06:03.810> well<00:06:04.080> as

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
and this is ready a lot later so well as

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.010 
and this is ready a lot later so well as
looks<00:06:05.040> like<00:06:05.220> right<00:06:05.460> now<00:06:05.490> I<00:06:06.030> was<00:06:06.360> seven<00:06:06.780> a

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
looks like right now I was seven a

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.470 
looks like right now I was seven a
smoother<00:06:07.890> faster<00:06:08.220> and<00:06:08.640> better<00:06:08.910> than<00:06:09.180> I<00:06:09.300> was

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
smoother faster and better than I was

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.659 
smoother faster and better than I was
eight<00:06:09.750> but<00:06:10.050> I<00:06:10.590> believe<00:06:11.070> that<00:06:11.100> the<00:06:11.550> new

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
eight but I believe that the new

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.240 
eight but I believe that the new
functionality<00:06:12.150> and<00:06:12.480> I<00:06:12.540> was<00:06:12.720> eight<00:06:13.070> makes<00:06:14.070> it

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
functionality and I was eight makes it

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.140 
functionality and I was eight makes it
up<00:06:14.430> and<00:06:14.700> I<00:06:15.830> also<00:06:16.830> eat<00:06:17.010> the<00:06:17.040> store<00:06:17.370> pretty<00:06:17.880> great

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150
