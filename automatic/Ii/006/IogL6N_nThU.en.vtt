00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.470
 Good day in this video I you 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.309
 I'll show you how to make such a friend out of here. 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:15.030
 liter plastic bottle 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:18.150
 good auto bird feeder and see 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.310
 we will need the bottle itself and any 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.310
 tank where water will be collected 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:32.850
 installable this our bottle and on 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:36.050
 level as we want it to be with us 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.840
 water level we make one hole 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:45.239
 I make it a hot nail here 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:50.030
 everything is ready for me not to waste 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:57.690
 your time and I 'm doing at this level 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:01:00.649
 here 's a bit wider it can be done here 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:10.260
 and we got one here 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:14.900
 hole and private recruit here 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.900
 a little water in this tank 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.820
 shorter now we will type and and we type 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.330
 water here in this jar 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:30.360
 what is convenient let's say one hole because 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:34.259
 what if we have water somewhere further where u 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.409
 let's take us to the chicken coop we take to the bank 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.850
 just a pen 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:44.850
 go under the tap we collect water here cover 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.659
 twists here we allow one 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.899
 finger closed and brought into place 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.110
 Now we will do this process for now. 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:59.630
 we pause and look here I 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:06.659
 here a little water poured and like this 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:09.020
 water is brought and set right 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.020
 here 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:22.870
 and as you can see these it can not be seen here 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.610
 here it is these laws of physics 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.330
 here hermetically on top should be 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.390
 the lid is closed it will be until 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:37.540
 fill until it overlaps this 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:44.750
 our hole as soon as the hole is closed 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:45.620
 all the water is established and this is all 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.340
 capacity 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.859
 that there is in our banks will pour out 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:57.200
 as long as the water runs out 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:03:02.120
 instead of 5 liter can be used 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:06.430
 let's say 10 liter 20 liter not 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:10.400
 important does not matter that the main condition to 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.379
 here was hermetically sealed a 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.900
 so that 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:17.630
 there was such a vacuum here water 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.799
 approached she closed this vacuum 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.739
 pillow and all 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:27.950
 and she herself like that 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.630
 It works like this one can say 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.250
 This is the simplest option. 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.829
 and trust me that these drinkers 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.700
 work much better than any 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:46.910
 purchased who knows how much money is 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.099
 we take on throws out on the garbage roughly 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.549
 by saying 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:55.510
 any such capacity can be found well 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:58.129
 or use some kind of wash there 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.819
 any capacity is optional 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:04.190
 she was round can there be square and 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.099
 so on and so forth you see it 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.030
 now still goes on until she 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.030
 will overlap 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.700
 all kind 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.880
 if we're still a little bit and and and like that he 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:26.250
 there were bulbucks go air goes there and 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:30.390
 as soon as this idea tilts everything and 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.070
 here it is blocked and as it decreases 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.940
 bird fits speed 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.360
 from here if we assume you want so that 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.050
 she is 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.100
 so that the bird does not shit here if we 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:48.180
 let's take a little more on above 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.100
 capacity so that we suppose there was no 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.860
 here is the garbage and try 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:59.580
 do this gap from jar to 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:03.810
 the edges than already so that the bird is only 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:09.330
 let's say the beak could go in there to drink 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:12.150
 and leave here is such a situation all the successes I 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.640
 I think that this principle is the simplest 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.480
 such a principle 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.850
 auto drinkers useful to all poultry farmers to 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:26.750
 See you at the meeting subscribe 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.750
