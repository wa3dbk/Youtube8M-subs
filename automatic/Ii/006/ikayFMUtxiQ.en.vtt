00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.260 

hey<00:00:01.319> guys<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.589> thought<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.610> make<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.760> quick<00:00:03.090> video

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hey guys I thought to make a quick video

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.740 
hey guys I thought to make a quick video
just<00:00:03.890> kinda<00:00:04.890> because<00:00:05.640> i<00:00:06.000> was<00:00:06.240> confused<00:00:06.450> about

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
just kinda because i was confused about

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.660 
just kinda because i was confused about
this<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.350> maybe<00:00:07.890> some<00:00:08.189> other<00:00:08.250> people<00:00:08.610> are

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
this and maybe some other people are

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.430 
this and maybe some other people are
having<00:00:08.730> problems<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.360> so<00:00:09.660> i<00:00:09.870> think<00:00:10.320> i

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
having problems of this so i think i

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.789 
having problems of this so i think i
figured<00:00:10.650> this<00:00:10.889> out<00:00:11.330> with<00:00:12.330> these<00:00:12.480> sliders<00:00:12.960> for

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
figured this out with these sliders for

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.210 
figured this out with these sliders for
the<00:00:13.950> local<00:00:14.460> server<00:00:14.960> i<00:00:15.960> figured<00:00:16.830> out<00:00:16.949> i<00:00:17.010> think

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
the local server i figured out i think

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.970 
the local server i figured out i think
about<00:00:17.609> halfway<00:00:18.020> it's<00:00:19.020> kind<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.529> normal

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
about halfway it's kind of the normal

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.820 
about halfway it's kind of the normal
point<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.550> like<00:00:20.760> for<00:00:21.420> example<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:22.380> harvest

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
point so like for example the harvest

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.759 
point so like for example the harvest
amount<00:00:23.189> if<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.029> put<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.330> over<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.560> won't

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
amount if you put it over here you won't

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.080 
amount if you put it over here you won't
be<00:00:25.890> able<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.099> harvest<00:00:26.250> anything<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:26.910> if<00:00:27.000> you

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
be able to harvest anything so if you

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.910 
be able to harvest anything so if you
try<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.269> pick<00:00:27.480> up<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.689> rock<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.529> won't<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.859> able

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
try to pick up a rock you won't be able

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.429 
try to pick up a rock you won't be able
to<00:00:29.099> get<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.369> if<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.390> put<00:00:30.570> out<00:00:30.720> about<00:00:30.900> half<00:00:31.170> way

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
to get it if you put out about half way

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.770 
to get it if you put out about half way
it'll<00:00:32.430> be<00:00:32.550> able<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:32.940> pick<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.210> one<00:00:33.510> which

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
it'll be able to just pick up one which

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.319 
it'll be able to just pick up one which
is<00:00:33.809> kind<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.380> normal<00:00:34.739> amount<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.090> put<00:00:36.239> it

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
is kind of normal amount if you put it

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.740 
is kind of normal amount if you put it
all<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> way<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.170> max<00:00:37.410> was<00:00:37.739> three<00:00:38.280> i<00:00:38.910> noticed

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
all the way the max was three i noticed

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.150 
all the way the max was three i noticed
when<00:00:39.899> i<00:00:39.960> picked<00:00:40.200> up<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.410> rock<00:00:40.500> i<00:00:40.710> got<00:00:40.860> three

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
when i picked up a rock i got three

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.430 
when i picked up a rock i got three
rocks<00:00:41.399> when<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.760> went<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> go<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:42.870> berry<00:00:43.079> bush<00:00:43.290> I

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
rocks when I went to go for berry bush I

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.889 
rocks when I went to go for berry bush I
got<00:00:43.620> three<00:00:43.920> fibers<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.610> or<00:00:45.350> three<00:00:46.350> berries<00:00:46.770> so

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
got three fibers and or three berries so

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.139 
got three fibers and or three berries so
I<00:00:48.899> think<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.800> midway<00:00:50.190> point<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.730> about<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
I think the midway point is about the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.560 
I think the midway point is about the
normal<00:00:52.309> except<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.520> few<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.789> them<00:00:54.090> I'm<00:00:54.329> not

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
normal except for a few of them I'm not

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.189 
normal except for a few of them I'm not
sure<00:00:54.840> what<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> XP<00:00:55.860> multiplier<00:00:56.489> does<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.600> just

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
sure what the XP multiplier does I just

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.920 
sure what the XP multiplier does I just
left<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.649> half<00:00:58.890> way<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.359> seemed<00:01:00.359> yet<00:01:00.600> normal

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
left it half way and seemed yet normal

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.359 
left it half way and seemed yet normal
XP<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:02.039> not<00:01:02.190> quite<00:01:02.670> sure<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.739> but<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
XP so I'm not quite sure on that but the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.730 
XP so I'm not quite sure on that but the
players<00:01:05.850> distance<00:01:06.390> Dino<00:01:06.659> resistance<00:01:07.380> needs

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
players distance Dino resistance needs

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.280 
players distance Dino resistance needs
to<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.100> about<00:01:08.340> here<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.140> it's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
to be about here just because if it's

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.260 
to be about here just because if it's
zero<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:11.040> won't<00:01:11.220> they<00:01:11.490> won't<00:01:11.640> take<00:01:11.880> any<00:01:12.060> damage

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
zero it won't they won't take any damage

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.050 
zero it won't they won't take any damage
it<00:01:12.659> seems<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.100> max<00:01:14.430> they<00:01:14.850> don't

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it seems like and if it's max they don't

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.730 
it seems like and if it's max they don't
seem<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> take<00:01:15.540> any<00:01:15.780> damage<00:01:15.930> because<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.439> too

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
seem to take any damage because it's too

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.770 
seem to take any damage because it's too
much<00:01:16.920> resistance<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> point<00:01:18.509> where<00:01:18.659> they

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
much resistance to the point where they

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.210 
much resistance to the point where they
won't<00:01:18.930> even<00:01:19.170> notice<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.799> you're<00:01:19.920> hitting

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
won't even notice that you're hitting

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.800 
won't even notice that you're hitting
them<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.009> then<00:01:23.130> set<00:01:23.670> player<00:01:24.090> damage<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
them so and then set player damage and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.690 
them so and then set player damage and
die<00:01:24.960> no<00:01:25.020> damage<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.470> full<00:01:25.950> i<00:01:26.189> set<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
die no damage to full i set the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.719 
die no damage to full i set the
structure<00:01:27.299> damage<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> same<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
structure damage to the same as the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.840 
structure damage to the same as the
player<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.119> dino<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.750> because<00:01:31.350> I'm<00:01:31.590> not

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
player in dino just because I'm not

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.410 
player in dino just because I'm not
matching<00:01:33.689> them<00:01:33.780> up

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
matching them up

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.120 
matching them up
but<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:37.520> keep<00:01:37.729> it<00:01:37.939> so<00:01:38.180> that<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:39.049> mean<00:01:39.530> I<00:01:39.710> seem<00:01:39.979> to

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
but to keep it so that I mean I seem to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.359 
but to keep it so that I mean I seem to
be<00:01:40.250> enjoying<00:01:41.380> normal<00:01:42.380> damage<00:01:42.530> dinosaurs<00:01:43.189> I've

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
be enjoying normal damage dinosaurs I've

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.999 
be enjoying normal damage dinosaurs I've
just<00:01:43.610> been<00:01:43.790> testing<00:01:44.270> on<00:01:44.479> Dodos<00:01:45.409> kind<00:01:45.830> of<00:01:45.890> just

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
just been testing on Dodos kind of just

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.160 
just been testing on Dodos kind of just
running<00:01:46.189> up<00:01:46.430> to<00:01:46.460> punching<00:01:46.939> them<00:01:47.090> seems<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:48.080> be

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
running up to punching them seems to be

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.830 
running up to punching them seems to be
doing<00:01:48.320> normal<00:01:48.740> damage<00:01:51.039> so<00:01:52.039> I<00:01:52.399> think<00:01:52.810> those<00:01:53.810> are

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
doing normal damage so I think those are

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.510 
doing normal damage so I think those are
supposed<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.229> be<00:01:54.320> unfold<00:01:54.680> just<00:01:55.009> put<00:01:55.190> these<00:01:55.340> up

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
supposed to be unfold just put these up

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.670 
supposed to be unfold just put these up
a<00:01:55.610> little<00:01:55.640> bit<00:01:56.090> but<00:01:56.810> for<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.170> most<00:01:57.320> part<00:01:57.470> of

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
a little bit but for the most part of

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.950 
a little bit but for the most part of
the<00:01:57.740> rest<00:01:57.920> of<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:58.100> settings<00:01:58.659> halfway<00:01:59.659> seems
