now what you're thinking what's the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.400 
now what you're thinking what's the
point<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.629> keypad<00:00:51.989> when<00:00:52.170> they<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.379> just

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
point of a keypad when they can just

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.250 
point of a keypad when they can just
lock<00:00:52.710> pick<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> door<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.449> this

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
lock pick the door and not in this this

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.139 
lock pick the door and not in this this
is<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.469> double<00:00:55.829> wide<00:00:56.010> door<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:56.820> they<00:00:56.940> lock

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
is a double wide door so if they lock

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.490 
is a double wide door so if they lock
pick<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> first<00:00:57.719> door<00:00:57.930> they<00:00:58.170> only<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.410> about

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
pick the first door they only have about

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.170 
pick the first door they only have about
two<00:00:58.829> seconds<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> get<00:00:59.609> through<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.820> second

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
two seconds to get through the second

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.529 
two seconds to get through the second
door<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.699> that<00:01:02.699> stops<00:01:03.120> them<00:01:03.300> from<00:01:03.359> doing

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
door so I'm that stops them from doing

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.329 
door so I'm that stops them from doing
that<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> keypad

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
that so they have to have a keypad

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.679 
that so they have to have a keypad
cracker<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:06.030> through<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:06.630> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
cracker to get through this and not a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.960 
cracker to get through this and not a
lot<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.960> classes<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.770> ever<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.490> so

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
lot of classes on this ever have that so

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.350 
lot of classes on this ever have that so
it's<00:01:09.119> pretty<00:01:09.180> good<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.939> could<00:01:12.180> be

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it's pretty good so if this could be

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.600 
it's pretty good so if this could be
just<00:01:12.840> pointless<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.680> if<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.340> server

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
just pointless to you if on your server

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.600 
just pointless to you if on your server
you<00:01:15.229> every<00:01:16.229> class<00:01:16.530> that's<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.070> thief<00:01:17.340> or

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
you every class that's a thief or

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.399 
you every class that's a thief or
anything<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.150> has<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> keypad<00:01:19.049> cracker

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
anything like that has a keypad cracker

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.249 
anything like that has a keypad cracker
there's<00:01:20.009> no<00:01:20.130> point<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.430> doing<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.259> just

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
there's no point in doing this so just

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.429 
there's no point in doing this so just
uh<00:01:22.350> don't<00:01:23.280> waste<00:01:23.520> your<00:01:23.670> props<00:01:23.970> there<00:01:24.810> make

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
to ID right here it's just bigger cuz I

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.000 
to ID right here it's just bigger cuz I
had<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.359> fill<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.690> doorway<00:03:22.019> then<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:22.829> have

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
had to fill in the doorway then I have

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.920 
had to fill in the doorway then I have
this<00:03:23.159> little<00:03:23.370> window<00:03:23.669> I<00:03:23.699> just<00:03:24.000> blocked<00:03:24.629> it<00:03:24.810> up

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
this little window I just blocked it up

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.240 
this little window I just blocked it up
so<00:03:25.019> they<00:03:25.139> can<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.409> jump<00:03:25.590> through<00:03:25.799> it<00:03:25.919> and<00:03:26.159> then

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
so they can to jump through it and then

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.379 
so they can to jump through it and then
I<00:03:26.310> could<00:03:26.459> maybe<00:03:26.549> shoot<00:03:26.819> through<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.090> if<00:03:27.269> they

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
I could maybe shoot through it if they

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.629 
I could maybe shoot through it if they
even<00:03:27.599> get<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:27.930> far<00:03:27.989> which<00:03:28.769> some<00:03:29.370> people

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
even get this far which some people

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.460 
even get this far which some people
might<00:03:29.790> then<00:03:30.599> you<00:03:30.690> just<00:03:30.900> open<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.229> door<00:03:31.379> with

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
might then you just open the door with

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.659 
might then you just open the door with
the<00:03:31.560> key<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:31.919> you're<00:03:32.159> inside<00:03:32.810> I<00:03:34.069> really<00:03:35.069> think

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
the key and you're inside I really think

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:36.860 
the key and you're inside I really think
this<00:03:35.760> is<00:03:35.909> a<00:03:35.940> good<00:03:36.120> base<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.329> you<00:03:36.690> should

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
this is a good base and you should

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.180 
this is a good base and you should
really<00:03:37.079> all<00:03:37.109> try<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.650> out<00:03:37.799> not<00:03:37.979> a<00:03:38.010> lot<00:03:38.159> of

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
really all try it out not a lot of

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.619 
really all try it out not a lot of
people<00:03:38.370> build<00:03:38.669> bases<00:03:39.060> here<00:03:39.209> mostly<00:03:39.479> because

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
people build bases here mostly because

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.869 
people build bases here mostly because
it's<00:03:39.810> right<00:03:40.049> next<00:03:40.199> to<00:03:40.349> spawn<00:03:40.650> but<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:41.549> makes<00:03:41.729> it

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
it's right next to spawn but it makes it

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.930 
it's right next to spawn but it makes it
more<00:03:41.970> fun<00:03:42.209> for<00:03:42.449> me<00:03:42.510> because<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.260> am<00:03:44.159> really<00:03:44.790> good

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
more fun for me because I am really good

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.110 
more fun for me because I am really good
at<00:03:44.970> darker<00:03:45.329> P<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.840> my<00:03:46.079> own<00:03:46.229> opinion<00:03:47.120> so

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
at darker P in my own opinion so

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.759 
at darker P in my own opinion so
somebody's<00:03:48.900> probably<00:03:49.049> hitting<00:03:49.260> my<00:03:49.409> base<00:03:49.590> or

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
somebody's probably hitting my base or

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.430 
somebody's probably hitting my base or
something<00:03:50.069> so<00:03:50.819> if<00:03:51.540> they're<00:03:51.810> right<00:03:52.019> at<00:03:52.169> spawn

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
something so if they're right at spawn

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.869 
something so if they're right at spawn
and<00:03:52.620> they're<00:03:52.709> just<00:03:52.919> bread<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.310> guns<00:03:53.639> out<00:03:53.849> of

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
and they're just bread and guns out of

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.550 
and they're just bread and guns out of
their<00:03:54.060> ATM<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:54.690> they're<00:03:54.810> walking<00:03:55.229> right<00:03:55.530> up

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560
