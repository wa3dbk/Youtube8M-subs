00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.549

 where only the best compete 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 For the first time we have a fumigator in 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.050
 the scene race counts the troops to 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.360
 face the best runners in the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.190
 world 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.070
 that junk terrifies me in the heights 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.110
 need help do not know what the key is not 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.150
 it's how fast comfortable but how are you flying 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.810
 fast you can fly much higher than 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.130
 what do you think 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.960

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:58.960

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.070
 goodbye 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.480
 the average majority and I'm already the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.580
 chupacabras 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.810
 we will live many adventures together 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.320
 to laugh help dance 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.950
 but we will not do it to kittens 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.950
 to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.289
 It is like a divine dawn after 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.530
 a life full of darkness as a fertilizer 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.510
 fresh on a grass field 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.930
 dying 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.210
 poetry is not your thing Manito 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.720
 It represents 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.720
 you are a car 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.950
 very fat identity problem 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.950
 do you think you can win 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.540
 but with my coat has been humiliated 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.940
 go to your village paleto 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.900
 warm 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.900
 of hard sand storm 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.509
 of overcoming the most touching is 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.800
 as a faithful friend that is not the story of 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.800
 a pepero is very touching 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.790

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.090
 that later you say you're crying and I do not 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.090
 I cry I am British
