hey<00:00:00.659> guys<00:00:00.900> so<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.800> video<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.490> just<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.879> go

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
hey guys so this video is just to go

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.720 
hey guys so this video is just to go
through<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.840> f16<00:00:04.799> build<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.370> some<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.609> the

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
through the f16 build and some of the

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.550 
through the f16 build and some of the
lengths<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.330> specifications<00:00:07.109> here<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.440> what

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
lengths and specifications here and what

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.830 
lengths and specifications here and what
I<00:00:07.589> used<00:00:07.980> side<00:00:08.880> this<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.179> late<00:00:09.570> have<00:00:09.719> been

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
I used side this is late have been

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.169 
I used side this is late have been
pretty<00:00:10.080> busy<00:00:10.320> recently<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.280> I'm<00:00:11.580> just<00:00:11.969> getting

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
pretty busy recently so I'm just getting

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.049 
pretty busy recently so I'm just getting
the<00:00:12.330> chance<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.750> post<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.170> now<00:00:13.670> so<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:14.940> a

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
the chance to post this now so just a

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.650 
the chance to post this now so just a
quick<00:00:15.210> overview<00:00:16.010> of<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.190> plane<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.359> built

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
quick overview of this plane it is built

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.620 
quick overview of this plane it is built
with<00:00:18.960> just<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.529> foam<00:00:20.250> board<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.939> KF<00:00:21.270> m2

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
with just this foam board and a KF m2

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.359 
with just this foam board and a KF m2
airfoil<00:00:22.050> with<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.320> half<00:00:22.529> inch<00:00:22.769> pink<00:00:23.100> foam

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
airfoil with the half inch pink foam

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.330 
airfoil with the half inch pink foam
from<00:00:23.699> Home<00:00:23.880> Depot<00:00:24.109> this<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.320> actually<00:00:25.769> staples

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
from Home Depot this is actually staples

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.099 
from Home Depot this is actually staples
foam<00:00:26.609> board<00:00:26.880> which<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> lot<00:00:27.510> heavier<00:00:27.810> than

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
foam board which is a lot heavier than

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.640 
foam board which is a lot heavier than
the<00:00:28.260> stuff<00:00:28.529> from<00:00:28.740> Dollar<00:00:28.980> Tree<00:00:30.500> because<00:00:31.500> of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the stuff from Dollar Tree because of

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.229 
the stuff from Dollar Tree because of
this<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.340> use<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.669> heavier<00:00:33.000> foam

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
this because I use this heavier foam

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.639 
this because I use this heavier foam
board<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.600> made<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:34.020> little<00:00:34.170> more<00:00:34.290> tail

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
board it made it a little more tail

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.049 
board it made it a little more tail
heaviest<00:00:34.980> ride<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.250> put<00:00:35.399> more<00:00:35.610> weight<00:00:35.820> up

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
heaviest ride to put more weight up

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.150 
heaviest ride to put more weight up
front<00:00:36.390> here<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.230> bet<00:00:37.410> if<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.950> built

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
front here but I bet if you just built

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.069 
front here but I bet if you just built
this<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.730> Dollar<00:00:39.120> Tree<00:00:39.210> foam<00:00:39.660> board

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
this with the Dollar Tree foam board

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.020 
this with the Dollar Tree foam board
that'd<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.410> completely<00:00:41.100> soft<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.730> it'd<00:00:41.879> be<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
that'd be completely soft and it'd be a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.000 
that'd be completely soft and it'd be a
lot<00:00:42.239> easier<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.200> get<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> lot<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.649> weight<00:00:43.860> up

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
lot easier to get a lot of weight up

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.920 
lot easier to get a lot of weight up
here<00:00:44.219> because<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.030> or<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.600> get<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
here because of that or to get the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.389 
here because of that or to get the
center<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.379> gravity<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.829> correct<00:00:47.100> spot

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
center of gravity in the correct spot

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.310 
center of gravity in the correct spot
because<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.030> I'd<00:00:48.539> use<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.020> battery

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
because of that I'd use this battery

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.430 
because of that I'd use this battery
gens<00:00:50.280> ace<00:00:50.430> 2500<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> bit<00:00:51.660> heavy<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
gens ace 2500 it's a bit heavy but you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.779 
gens ace 2500 it's a bit heavy but you
know<00:00:52.530> what<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.739> point<00:00:52.920> actually<00:00:53.129> flew<00:00:53.489> just

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
know what this point actually flew just

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.350 
know what this point actually flew just
fine<00:00:54.030> with<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.390> extra<00:00:54.809> weight<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:55.140> front<00:00:56.360> so

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
fine with this extra weight up front so

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.569 
fine with this extra weight up front so
the<00:00:57.629> basic<00:00:57.960> design<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.670> this

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
the basic design of this is that this

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.960 
the basic design of this is that this
this<00:01:02.579> basically<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:04.460> fuselage<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.820> you

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
this basically this fuselage here you

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.520 
this basically this fuselage here you
can<00:01:06.090> see<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.390> kind<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> rectangle<00:01:07.500> shape

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
can see it's kind of a rectangle shape

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.070 
can see it's kind of a rectangle shape
and<00:01:08.010> then<00:01:08.700> everything's<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.630> kind<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.900> like

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
and then everything's just kind of like

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.140 
and then everything's just kind of like
put<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.860> these<00:01:11.040> are<00:01:11.250> glued<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.640> and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
put on you like these are glued on and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.750 
put on you like these are glued on and
these<00:01:13.140> back<00:01:13.439> tails<00:01:13.860> are<00:01:14.100> glued<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.640> is

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
these back tails are glued on this is

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.670 
these back tails are glued on this is
not<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.119> best<00:01:15.270> way<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.990> it'd<00:01:16.350> be<00:01:16.470> better

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
not the best way to do it it'd be better

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.120 
not the best way to do it it'd be better
to<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:16.890> make<00:01:17.189> us<00:01:17.340> straight<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:19.560> see<00:01:19.619> they're

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
to just make us straight you see they're

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.530 
to just make us straight you see they're
glued<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:20.729> would<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.909> best<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.360> this

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
glued on here would be best if this

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.340 
glued on here would be best if this
whole<00:01:21.780> thing<00:01:22.080> was<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.560> backplate<00:01:24.350> if

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
whole thing was just the backplate if

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.980 
whole thing was just the backplate if
you<00:01:25.560> look<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.009> wing<00:01:26.400> right<00:01:26.700> here<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.750> kind

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you look this wing right here this kind

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.350 
you look this wing right here this kind
of<00:01:28.080> looks<00:01:28.259> like<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.560> Delta<00:01:28.890> fighter<00:01:29.340> from<00:01:29.939> RC

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
of looks like the Delta fighter from RC

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.609 
of looks like the Delta fighter from RC
test<00:01:30.600> flight<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:30.990> actually<00:01:31.320> kind<00:01:31.590> of

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
test flight that's actually kind of

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.280 
test flight that's actually kind of
where<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> got<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.540> ideas<00:01:33.540> looking<00:01:33.960> at<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
where I got the ideas looking at the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.319 
where I got the ideas looking at the
Delta<00:01:34.979> fight<00:01:35.130> or<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> while<00:01:35.460> ago<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.030> was<00:01:36.270> just

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
Delta fight or a while ago I was just

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.219 
Delta fight or a while ago I was just
like<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.630> know<00:01:36.689> what<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.960> kind<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.170> looks

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
like you know what that kind of looks

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.050 
like you know what that kind of looks
like<00:01:37.380> an<00:01:37.560> f16<00:01:37.829> wing<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> base

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
like an f16 wing and that was the base

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.899 
like an f16 wing and that was the base
of<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.360> design<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.340> what<00:01:41.340> I'm<00:01:41.460> using<00:01:41.490> here

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
of this design so what I'm using here

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.710 
of this design so what I'm using here
are<00:01:43.189> elevate<00:01:44.189> are<00:01:44.369> sorry<00:01:44.670> ailerons<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.570> an

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
are elevate are sorry ailerons and an

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.330 
are elevate are sorry ailerons and an
elevator<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.409> back<00:01:46.619> two<00:01:46.979> different

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
elevator in the back two different

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.850 
elevator in the back two different
servos<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.790> these<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.479> work<00:01:48.720> together<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
servos and these just work together to

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.090 
servos and these just work together to
serve<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.549> elevator<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:52.560> also<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:52.950> you

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
serve as the elevator and also if you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.850 
serve as the elevator and also if you
move<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:53.460> servos<00:01:54.420> more<00:01:54.780> forward<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.590> both

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
move these servos more forward on both

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.399 
move these servos more forward on both
of<00:01:56.070> these<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:57.119> would<00:01:57.299> even<00:01:57.869> bring<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> center

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
of these it would even bring the center

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.050 
of these it would even bring the center
of<00:01:58.469> gravity<00:01:58.890> more<00:01:59.130> forward<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.700> think<00:01:59.939> that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
of gravity more forward and I think that

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.249 
of gravity more forward and I think that
you'd<00:02:00.180> probably<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.630> still<00:02:00.899> run<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
you'd probably have to still run like a

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.620 
you'd probably have to still run like a
2,200<00:02:02.100> milliamp<00:02:02.610> hour<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.590> anyway<00:02:04.590> for

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
2,200 milliamp hour in here anyway for

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.660 
2,200 milliamp hour in here anyway for
measurements<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:06.840> thirty<00:02:07.439> four<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.640> half

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
measurements it's thirty four and a half

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.400 
measurements it's thirty four and a half
inches<00:02:09.179> long

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.780 

the<00:02:11.860> wingspan<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:14.100> well<00:02:15.100> first<00:02:15.340> actually<00:02:15.730> I'll

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
the wingspan is well first actually I'll

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.540 
the wingspan is well first actually I'll
go<00:02:15.970> over<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:16.420> middle<00:02:16.870> section<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:18.190> four

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
go over this middle section it is four

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.090 
go over this middle section it is four
inches<00:02:18.790> wide<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:21.990> so<00:02:22.990> that's<00:02:23.440> one<00:02:23.620> thirty<00:02:23.830> six

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
inches wide and so that's one thirty six

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.660 
inches wide and so that's one thirty six
and<00:02:24.280> two<00:02:24.520> inches<00:02:24.850> tall<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:26.110> it's<00:02:26.290> four<00:02:26.740> by<00:02:27.610> two

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
and two inches tall so it's four by two

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.140 
and two inches tall so it's four by two
and<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:29.710> wingspan<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:31.860> 28<00:02:32.860> inches<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.550> that

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
and the wingspan is 28 inches and that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.480 
and the wingspan is 28 inches and that
includes<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:35.380> four<00:02:35.650> inches<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.220> middle

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
includes the four inches in the middle

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:43.860 
includes the four inches in the middle
so<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:37.000> each<00:02:37.240> wing<00:02:37.570> is<00:02:38.110> 12<00:02:38.560> inches<00:02:40.140> here<00:02:42.870> 12

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
so it each wing is 12 inches here 12

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.290 
so it each wing is 12 inches here 12
inches<00:02:44.230> here<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.800> then<00:02:45.490> these<00:02:45.730> this<00:02:46.060> little

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
inches here and then these this little

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.880 
inches here and then these this little
tip<00:02:46.480> cord<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:46.930> 4<00:02:47.290> inches<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.800> this<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.070> kfm<00:02:48.640> 2

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
tip cord is 4 inches and this is a kfm 2

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.830 
tip cord is 4 inches and this is a kfm 2
so<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.010> just<00:02:51.250> goes<00:02:51.430> from<00:02:51.610> 2<00:02:51.850> inches<00:02:51.880> to<00:02:52.270> six

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
so it just goes from 2 inches to six

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.590 
so it just goes from 2 inches to six
inches<00:02:52.990> here<00:02:53.440> in<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.650> middle<00:02:54.420> then<00:02:55.420> these

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
inches here in the middle then these

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.860 
inches here in the middle then these
ailerons<00:02:56.140> they're<00:02:56.650> just<00:02:56.920> this<00:02:57.670> is<00:02:58.000> an<00:02:58.300> inch

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
ailerons they're just this is an inch

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.540 
ailerons they're just this is an inch
and<00:02:59.080> a<00:02:59.140> quarter<00:02:59.380> by<00:03:00.300> like<00:03:02.070> inch<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.400> quarter

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
and a quarter by like inch and a quarter

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.330 
and a quarter by like inch and a quarter
by<00:03:03.700> 10<00:03:04.120> inches<00:03:04.530> for<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.560> ailerons

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
by 10 inches for the ailerons

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.810 
by 10 inches for the ailerons
and<00:03:06.460> then<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.950> tails<00:03:09.280> back<00:03:10.060> here<00:03:10.510> this<00:03:11.380> is<00:03:11.820> 5

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
and then the tails back here this is 5

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.380 
and then the tails back here this is 5
inches

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
inches

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.700 
inches
at<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:14.410> root<00:03:14.760> 2<00:03:15.760> inches<00:03:16.060> at<00:03:16.240> the<00:03:16.360> tip<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:16.870> it

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
at the root 2 inches at the tip and it

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:25.800 
at the root 2 inches at the tip and it
is<00:03:19.890> 5<00:03:20.890> inches<00:03:21.130> out<00:03:22.710> 5<00:03:23.710> inches<00:03:24.100> wide<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:25.150> those

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
is 5 inches out 5 inches wide and those

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.200 
is 5 inches out 5 inches wide and those
are<00:03:25.990> also<00:03:26.110> glued<00:03:26.500> on<00:03:26.620> there<00:03:26.800> be<00:03:27.040> better<00:03:27.280> if<00:03:27.940> you

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
are also glued on there be better if you

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.290 
are also glued on there be better if you
did<00:03:28.390> like<00:03:29.100> if<00:03:30.100> you<00:03:30.280> had<00:03:30.460> straight<00:03:30.850> across<00:03:31.060> the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
did like if you had straight across the

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.940 
did like if you had straight across the
bottom<00:03:31.450> so<00:03:31.660> basically<00:03:32.080> what<00:03:32.290> I<00:03:32.320> did<00:03:32.530> first<00:03:32.740> is

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
bottom so basically what I did first is

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.000 
bottom so basically what I did first is
I<00:03:33.100> made<00:03:33.340> this<00:03:33.630> made<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.870> center<00:03:35.320> fuselage<00:03:35.830> and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
I made this made the center fuselage and

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.800 
I made this made the center fuselage and
I<00:03:36.130> glued<00:03:36.340> everything<00:03:36.730> on<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.390> then<00:03:37.600> if<00:03:37.720> you

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
I glued everything on and then if you

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.500 
I glued everything on and then if you
angle<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.320> up<00:03:38.470> here<00:03:38.890> in<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.730> front<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.210> I<00:03:40.360> just

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
angle it up here in the front and I just

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.930 
angle it up here in the front and I just
have<00:03:40.600> one<00:03:40.810> piece<00:03:41.050> extending<00:03:41.740> out<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.640> this

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
have one piece extending out so this

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.550 
have one piece extending out so this
extension<00:03:43.330> little<00:03:43.990> piece<00:03:44.200> here<00:03:44.500> is<00:03:46.320> 8<00:03:47.320> and<00:03:47.530> a

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
extension little piece here is 8 and a

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.370 
extension little piece here is 8 and a
half<00:03:47.590> inches<00:03:48.100> long<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.700> there's<00:03:49.600> five<00:03:49.960> inches

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
half inches long and there's five inches

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.100 
half inches long and there's five inches
here<00:03:50.710> where<00:03:50.890> this<00:03:51.070> just<00:03:51.340> angles<00:03:51.820> up<00:03:52.110> thinking

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
here where this just angles up thinking

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.200 
here where this just angles up thinking
yet<00:03:53.440> they're<00:03:53.620> kind<00:03:53.890> gives<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.250> S<00:03:54.370> 16<00:03:54.940> look

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
yet they're kind gives the S 16 look

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.300 
yet they're kind gives the S 16 look
nice<00:03:55.960> made<00:03:56.200> like<00:03:56.350> this<00:03:56.530> little<00:03:56.740> canopy<00:03:57.610> here

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
nice made like this little canopy here

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.890 
nice made like this little canopy here

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.040 
here that just I don't know I just kind
of<00:04:06.250> designed<00:04:06.700> this<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.150> look<00:04:07.300> like<00:04:07.330> a<00:04:07.570> canopy

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
of designed this to look like a canopy

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.020 
of designed this to look like a canopy
and<00:04:08.290> then<00:04:08.410> that's<00:04:08.560> where<00:04:08.740> I<00:04:08.800> put<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.100> battery

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.890 

that's<00:04:13.030> B<00:04:14.490> microjet<00:04:15.490> version<00:04:15.910> 3<00:04:16.210> by<00:04:16.420> Grayson

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
that's B microjet version 3 by Grayson

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.520 
that's B microjet version 3 by Grayson
six<00:04:17.230> by<00:04:17.410> four<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:18.070> have<00:04:18.730> a<00:04:18.820> 30<00:04:19.150> amp<00:04:19.330> esc<00:04:20.020> that

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
six by four I have a 30 amp esc that

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.930 
six by four I have a 30 amp esc that
runs<00:04:20.770> down

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
runs down

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.340 
runs down
this<00:04:22.120> tale<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:24.070> this<00:04:24.370> is<00:04:24.610> at<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.780> base<00:04:26.020> here

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
this tale so this is at the base here

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.900 
this tale so this is at the base here
six<00:04:26.680> inches<00:04:27.240> at<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.360> top<00:04:28.750> three<00:04:29.590> inches<00:04:30.010> and

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
six inches at the top three inches and

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.450 
six inches at the top three inches and
it<00:04:31.090> is<00:04:33.630> eight<00:04:34.630> inches<00:04:35.080> tall<00:04:35.380> and<00:04:35.860> that's<00:04:36.070> way

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
it is eight inches tall and that's way

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.640 
it is eight inches tall and that's way
this<00:04:37.090> is<00:04:37.270> way<00:04:37.780> bigger<00:04:37.930> than<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.230> needs<00:04:38.290> to<00:04:38.560> be

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
this is way bigger than it needs to be

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.050 
this is way bigger than it needs to be
as<00:04:38.800> you<00:04:38.920> can<00:04:39.040> see<00:04:39.130> I've<00:04:39.250> kind<00:04:39.460> of<00:04:39.520> outlined<00:04:39.700> a

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
as you can see I've kind of outlined a

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.940 
as you can see I've kind of outlined a
smaller<00:04:40.420> tail<00:04:41.260> on<00:04:41.350> here<00:04:41.620> that<00:04:41.650> I'm<00:04:41.800> gonna

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
smaller tail on here that I'm gonna

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.500 
smaller tail on here that I'm gonna
probably<00:04:42.160> use<00:04:42.400> still<00:04:42.700> six<00:04:42.940> inches<00:04:43.240> at<00:04:43.390> the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
probably use still six inches at the

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.220 
probably use still six inches at the
base<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:44.250> three<00:04:45.250> inches<00:04:45.490> at<00:04:45.670> the<00:04:45.700> top<00:04:46.230> but

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
base and three inches at the top but

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.010 
base and three inches at the top but
it's<00:04:47.410> only<00:04:48.150> sorry<00:04:50.700> but<00:04:51.700> it's<00:04:51.820> only<00:04:51.940> six<00:04:52.780> and<00:04:52.930> a

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
it's only sorry but it's only six and a

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.530 
it's only sorry but it's only six and a
half<00:04:53.050> inches<00:04:53.590> tall<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:55.180> that's<00:04:55.300> about<00:04:55.420> it

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
half inches tall and that's about it

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.780 
half inches tall and that's about it
it's<00:04:56.320> pretty<00:04:56.500> simple<00:04:56.920> build<00:04:57.190> I<00:04:57.340> think<00:04:57.370> this<00:04:57.640> is

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
it's pretty simple build I think this is

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.580 
it's pretty simple build I think this is
enough<00:04:58.060> information<00:04:58.360> if<00:04:58.780> you<00:04:58.930> want<00:04:59.200> to<00:04:59.380> build

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
enough information if you want to build

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.560 
enough information if you want to build
this<00:04:59.740> you<00:04:59.890> could<00:05:00.040> do<00:05:00.160> it<00:05:00.280> on<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:01.030> back<00:05:01.210> here

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
this you could do it on the back here

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.110 
this you could do it on the back here
that's<00:05:01.870> put<00:05:02.410> a<00:05:02.440> little<00:05:02.620> piece<00:05:02.800> of<00:05:02.830> wood<00:05:03.130> that<00:05:03.400> I

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
that's put a little piece of wood that I

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.180 
that's put a little piece of wood that I
just<00:05:04.390> screw<00:05:04.660> us<00:05:04.750> into<00:05:05.080> sexually<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.800> mikey's

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
just screw us into sexually the mikey's

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.920 
just screw us into sexually the mikey's
RC<00:05:06.610> style<00:05:07.000> motor<00:05:07.240> mount<00:05:07.480> just<00:05:07.690> made<00:05:07.840> out

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
RC style motor mount just made out

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.380 
RC style motor mount just made out
popsicle<00:05:08.530> sticks<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:08.860> hot<00:05:09.070> glue<00:05:09.340> just<00:05:10.180> put

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
popsicle sticks and hot glue just put

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.930 
popsicle sticks and hot glue just put
right<00:05:10.570> there<00:05:10.750> in<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:10.930> back<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:12.040> that's<00:05:12.760> it

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
right there in the back and that's it

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.000 
right there in the back and that's it
it's<00:05:13.330> actually<00:05:13.690> this<00:05:13.840> plane<00:05:14.110> fly<00:05:14.350> is<00:05:14.470> really

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
it's actually this plane fly is really

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.590 
it's actually this plane fly is really
really<00:05:15.190> nice<00:05:15.460> they<00:05:15.670> I've<00:05:15.790> built<00:05:16.060> this<00:05:16.240> plane

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
really nice they I've built this plane

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.410 
really nice they I've built this plane
so<00:05:17.470> when<00:05:17.590> I<00:05:17.680> post<00:05:17.890> that<00:05:18.130> maiden<00:05:18.550> video<00:05:19.150> of<00:05:19.270> this

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
so when I post that maiden video of this

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.000 
so when I post that maiden video of this
like<00:05:19.690> a<00:05:19.990> couple<00:05:20.350> weeks<00:05:20.500> ago<00:05:20.650> that<00:05:20.890> was<00:05:20.980> the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
like a couple weeks ago that was the

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.350 
like a couple weeks ago that was the
first<00:05:21.250> time<00:05:21.370> I<00:05:21.430> flew<00:05:21.580> it<00:05:21.700> but<00:05:21.820> I<00:05:21.910> built<00:05:22.210> this

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
first time I flew it but I built this

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.640 
first time I flew it but I built this
point<00:05:22.600> over<00:05:22.810> a<00:05:22.870> year<00:05:23.140> ago<00:05:23.200> it's<00:05:23.410> just<00:05:23.440> been

point over a year ago it's just been

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.750 
point over a year ago it's just been
sitting<00:05:23.770> around<00:05:23.920> haven't<00:05:24.340> had<00:05:24.430> the<00:05:24.520> time<00:05:24.730> to

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
sitting around haven't had the time to

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.110 
sitting around haven't had the time to
fly<00:05:25.090> it<00:05:25.150> yet<00:05:25.860> I'm<00:05:26.860> really<00:05:27.100> happy<00:05:27.280> with<00:05:27.430> it<00:05:27.490> I<00:05:27.760> I

fly it yet I'm really happy with it I I
went<00:05:28.840> out<00:05:28.960> to<00:05:29.080> flag<00:05:29.290> size<00:05:29.680> hoping<00:05:30.340> just<00:05:30.460> go<00:05:30.880> out

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
went out to flag size hoping just go out

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.670 
went out to flag size hoping just go out
fly<00:05:31.240> it<00:05:31.300> see<00:05:31.750> how<00:05:31.900> it<00:05:31.930> worked<00:05:32.169> and<00:05:32.350> get<00:05:32.530> rid<00:05:32.650> of

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
problems just got more airplanes in a

problems just got more airplanes in a
small<00:05:37.870> apartment<00:05:37.930> but<00:05:38.530> that's<00:05:39.100> okay<00:05:39.310> it's

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
small apartment but that's okay it's

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.980 
small apartment but that's okay it's
worth<00:05:39.610> it's<00:05:39.910> nice<00:05:40.090> to<00:05:40.300> have<00:05:40.419> planes<00:05:40.780> that<00:05:40.930> fly

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
worth it's nice to have planes that fly

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.220 
worth it's nice to have planes that fly
well<00:05:41.730> I<00:05:43.200> route<00:05:44.200> all<00:05:44.500> the<00:05:44.680> wires<00:05:45.160> up<00:05:45.490> here

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
well I route all the wires up here

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.810 
well I route all the wires up here
receiver<00:05:47.230> is<00:05:47.680> right<00:05:47.919> here<00:05:48.130> that<00:05:48.310> just<00:05:48.580> fits

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
receiver is right here that just fits

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.510 
receiver is right here that just fits
right<00:05:49.090> under<00:05:49.690> here<00:05:50.020> I<00:05:50.260> just<00:05:50.650> taped<00:05:51.010> this<00:05:51.220> down

this<00:05:57.550> would<00:05:57.760> just<00:05:57.940> be<00:05:58.060> like<00:05:58.150> a<00:05:58.210> vacuum<00:05:58.690> in<00:05:59.050> here

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
this would just be like a vacuum in here

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.900 
this would just be like a vacuum in here
I<00:05:59.410> made<00:05:59.590> little<00:05:59.740> air<00:06:00.300> air<00:06:01.300> and<00:06:01.690> let's<00:06:01.930> here<00:06:02.410> and

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
I made little air air and let's here and

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.150 
I made little air air and let's here and
here<00:06:03.910> just<00:06:04.480> so<00:06:04.690> air<00:06:04.960> can<00:06:05.260> get<00:06:05.440> to<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:05.919> motor

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
here just so air can get to the motor

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.740 
here just so air can get to the motor
back<00:06:06.520> through<00:06:06.820> there<00:06:06.970> I<00:06:07.000> think<00:06:07.180> you<00:06:07.330> can<00:06:07.540> see

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
back through there I think you can see

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.470 
back through there I think you can see
that<00:06:07.990> I<00:06:08.280> just<00:06:09.280> didn't<00:06:09.490> want<00:06:09.640> this<00:06:09.790> propeller

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
that I just didn't want this propeller

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.630 
that I just didn't want this propeller
to<00:06:10.570> be<00:06:10.690> starved<00:06:11.110> of<00:06:11.200> air<00:06:11.350> back<00:06:11.590> here<00:06:11.640> and

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
to be starved of air back here and

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.050 
to be starved of air back here and
that's<00:06:13.210> about<00:06:13.360> it

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
that's about it

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.310
