00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Well, the curtain of today's program 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.500
 drive test that we shot back in 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.690
 the middle of December without tender and on the test 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.440
 we will have one of the most exciting new products 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.320
 Outgoing 2 thousand of the past 2013 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:23.340
 mazda 3 we estimate whether it will be hits 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:25.500
 come 2014 new mazda3 out 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.449
 any doubt kept the properties with 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.279
 its predecessor recognizability 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.170
 continuity of generations remained but 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.450
 at the same time the car changed radically 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.399
 Three became a solid material quality 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.969
 in the cabin is close to premium 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.309
 class and in fact was largely mazda3 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:46.350
 girls car recently given here 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:49.260
 all the way already talk about the car came out 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.420
 to the next technical level in the new 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.489
 generation appeared vaunted system sky 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.370
 an asset that makes a car and 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.969
 safer and easier and more economical to them 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.270
 towers and 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.949
 and of course design is not a whole design 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.520
 diamond need to meet him 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.520
 closer 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.040
 Rejoice Krasnoyarsk test this new 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.080
 mazda3 already appeared in our city 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.390
 modern goll in class threes you 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.670
 become the most spectacular and most certainly 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.610
 fresh looks when you look at mazda 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.000
 3 last generation understand that 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.560
 such a hot hatchback at a glance 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.990
 immediately understand the essence of the whole class 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.450
 mazda profile 3 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.670
 I also think very expressive 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.380
 Moreover, one can easily imagine that 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.310
 This is for example a small hatchback from 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.710
 maserati 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.630
 I change of course but on oleg alfa 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.340
 romeo obviously emotional so even 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.620
 little look to the passionate such 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.760
 even some such ferrari style 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.250
 just from Italian artists 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.590
 Maradona made the basis of the design of the machine 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.150
 ice concept car mazda tire aria pro one 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.710
 concept we talked in detail in 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.690
 December issue of the magazine box 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.340
 gear in brief I remind you that the key 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.410
 solutions migrated to modern 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.690
 serial brain in particular here this 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.180
 predatory and very harmonious lattice 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.520
 radiator and by the way clearly appeared 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.130
 that's an expressive line which 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.560
 looks good and in the rear mirrors 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.080
 kind of those you want to explain and at that 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.390
 At the same time, this character obviously gives 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.790
 and it is on all the latest brains here 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.520
 it will decide to appear and our chef york 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.860
 very nice everyone perfect this so new 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.570
 style forming story by the author 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.700
 concept tires arey and serial three 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.220
 is the new chief designer mazda and to 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.170
 Maeda thinks that soon his office 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.480
 will break from different rewards all 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.250
 The mirror's design is not attached to 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.900
 stand ahhh right on the door this 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.880
 Incidentally ray such acute see 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.100
 streamlined it too here just now 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.580
 the history of Italian sports says 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.580
 she yes yes 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.910
 test machine equipped with a 2-liter 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.890
 gasoline engine its power is 150 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.140
 horses for compact hatchback it 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.470
 very decent gearbox in our 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.200
 case six-speed automatic 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.620
 bay here honestly this is not 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.830
 switches itself retracts in the cut-off 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.930
 if in manual mode you don't throw gas and 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.020
 add turns then hangs or 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:21.330
 switches to the next best 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.100
 Traditions say honest box 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.440
 the maximum speed of 210 kilometers per 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.540
 hour but these are not the most important components 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.820
 much more important as the car picks up 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.500
 speed and how it is driven by a hundred 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.540
 updated troika dials in 9 seconds 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:43.130
 Specifically, everything here says that it is 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:45.300
 car driver so sharp tenacious 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.790
 speaking but play let's come on come on 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.850
 come on come on come on come on come on well 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.860
 start still well, well, well, I and this suspension 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.400
 They are clearly configured tightly but at the same time 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.680
 comfortable and this is the nature of the machine 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.500
 sit down and outside rest 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.329
 harmony is complete it is me even dear 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.049
 viewers lately almost all cars 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.209
 the same as with her when you can 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.700
 the manufacturer grope here some 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.920
 the character is correct and home fatsia 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.260
 character vivid obvious very character 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.930
 cue is clear and simple and obvious and 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.620
 unambiguous and this is the nature of the present 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.850
 hot and at least ergomnika excellent 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.770
 materials 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.530
 great like everything is fine and here 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.280
 Well, look at the wheel 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.990
 noted also very handy good by 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.400
 the impressions of these impressions 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.860
 carbon inserts 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.820
 notice them here and here there is even 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:44.320
 open the door they are not only in color and 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.509
 coloring stands out if you listen 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.380
 they are really textural as if the line 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:53.930
 Tuck Volohov real carbon fiber 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.030
 it feels like at night and you know at times 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.330
 total virtualization 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.860
 here is the appearance of physically protruding 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:06.110
 elements at the front here and 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.330
 primary school and these wings are here 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.130
 physically from the classroom materials here 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.090
 minus of course so they will be there at the end 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.349
 ends if you give probably but this 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.889
 old school story 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:20.810
 and in the center and in the center is not something there a 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.000
 tachometer tachometer middle set 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.590
 Only mazda 3 in top trim levels 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.500
 but everyone else at this place 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.060
 speedometer but we have a sleepy project 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.180
 little screen 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.570
 and notice when we turn off 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.600
 engine 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.980
 there we formed rare cases 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.030
 when there are minuses literally 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.520
 dig down 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.330
 trunk size is small but in the trunk 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.880
 a bit flimsy 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.310
 diesel engines are not offered plus and 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.060
 spectacular design is good dynamics and 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.400
 controllability 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.680
 the quality of the materials of the cabin as if from 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.750
 car class above ours 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.400
 grade costs 960,000 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.560
 thank you for providing the test 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.160
 Mazda's official dealer car 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.450
