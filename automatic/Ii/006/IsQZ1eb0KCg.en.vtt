planning it out for weeks and weeks

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.420 
planning it out for weeks and weeks
basically<00:03:15.049> we<00:03:15.169> had<00:03:15.349> this<00:03:15.500> system<00:03:16.099> we<00:03:16.250> made

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
basically we had this system we made

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.490 
basically we had this system we made
called<00:03:16.699> the<00:03:16.879> steps<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.449> a<00:03:17.540> relationship<00:03:18.109> and

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
called the steps of a relationship and

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.860 
called the steps of a relationship and
basically<00:03:18.829> they<00:03:19.699> were<00:03:19.759> like<00:03:20.000> physical<00:03:20.599> things

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
basically they were like physical things

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.869 
basically they were like physical things
you<00:03:21.019> would<00:03:21.169> do<00:03:21.379> that<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:22.459> know<00:03:22.549> got<00:03:22.759> you

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
you would do that you know got you

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.819 
you would do that you know got you
further<00:03:23.209> into<00:03:23.569> the<00:03:23.689> relationship<00:03:23.959> like<00:03:24.620> I

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
further into the relationship like I

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.610 
further into the relationship like I
think<00:03:25.459> we<00:03:25.549> called<00:03:25.699> them<00:03:25.819> basis<00:03:26.269> as<00:03:26.419> well<00:03:26.599> or<00:03:27.139> no

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
think we called them basis as well or no

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.879 
think we called them basis as well or no
step<00:03:27.979> two<00:03:28.159> step<00:03:28.400> so<00:03:28.639> first<00:03:29.239> step<00:03:29.479> was<00:03:29.659> like

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
step two step so first step was like

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.199 
step two step so first step was like
hugging<00:03:30.889> second<00:03:31.459> step<00:03:31.639> was<00:03:31.759> like<00:03:31.909> holding

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
hugging second step was like holding

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.420 
hugging second step was like holding
hands<00:03:32.479> third<00:03:33.259> step<00:03:33.620> was<00:03:33.859> I<00:03:34.040> don't<00:03:34.310> remember

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430

come over here and bam just gave her a

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.010 
come over here and bam just gave her a
kiss<00:06:13.669> I<00:06:13.700> wasn't<00:06:13.970> one<00:06:14.090> of<00:06:14.150> those<00:06:14.270> quick<00:06:14.570> ones<00:06:14.810> it

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
kiss I wasn't one of those quick ones it

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.240 
kiss I wasn't one of those quick ones it
was<00:06:15.110> like<00:06:15.289> I<00:06:15.410> actually<00:06:15.560> held<00:06:15.860> it<00:06:15.950> for<00:06:16.070> a<00:06:16.099> while

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
was like I actually held it for a while

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.680 
was like I actually held it for a while
so<00:06:16.430> that's<00:06:16.580> why<00:06:16.729> it<00:06:16.820> counts<00:06:17.150> as<00:06:17.270> the<00:06:17.360> kiss<00:06:17.539> it

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
so that's why it counts as the kiss it

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.790 
so that's why it counts as the kiss it
wasn't<00:06:17.870> one<00:06:17.960> of<00:06:17.990> those<00:06:18.110> quick<00:06:18.349> pecks<00:06:18.620> or

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
wasn't one of those quick pecks or

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.860 
wasn't one of those quick pecks or
something<00:06:19.160> and<00:06:19.310> she<00:06:20.030> was<00:06:20.150> super<00:06:20.419> happy<00:06:20.630> and

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870
