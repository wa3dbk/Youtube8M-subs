00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.480 

Here<00:00:00.690> I<00:00:00.719> am<00:00:00.840> out<00:00:01.170> at<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.380> farm<00:00:01.650> everybody<00:00:02.220> and

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
Here I am out at the farm everybody and

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.550 
Here I am out at the farm everybody and
to<00:00:02.790> be<00:00:02.909> perfectly<00:00:03.300> honest<00:00:03.750> this<00:00:03.929> is<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.170> video<00:00:04.500> I

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
to be perfectly honest this is a video I

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.179 
to be perfectly honest this is a video I
didn't<00:00:05.160> really<00:00:05.400> expect<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.910> be<00:00:06.089> making<00:00:07.160> take<00:00:08.160> a

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
didn't really expect to be making take a

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.350 
didn't really expect to be making take a
look<00:00:08.429> at<00:00:08.519> these<00:00:09.110> we<00:00:10.110> think<00:00:10.380> those<00:00:10.590> are<00:00:11.150> so<00:00:12.150> you

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
look at these we think those are so you

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.940 
look at these we think those are so you
might<00:00:12.509> look<00:00:12.690> at<00:00:12.840> those<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.469> might<00:00:13.650> say

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
might look at those and you might say

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.640 
might look at those and you might say
well<00:00:14.509> apparently<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.660> key<00:00:15.839> keeper<00:00:16.230> has<00:00:16.410> some

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
well apparently the key keeper has some

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.500 
well apparently the key keeper has some
competition<00:00:17.400> maybe<00:00:17.580> he's<00:00:17.820> going<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.090> lose<00:00:18.300> his

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
competition maybe he's going to lose his

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.700 
competition maybe he's going to lose his
title<00:00:18.949> but<00:00:19.949> that's<00:00:20.160> not<00:00:20.460> what<00:00:20.670> these<00:00:20.850> are<00:00:21.090> for

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
title but that's not what these are for

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
have no idea how this came to be I

wasn't expecting this to happen my dad
or<00:00:38.460> my<00:00:38.610> grandfather<00:00:39.149> or<00:00:39.450> someone<00:00:39.930> asked<00:00:40.829> them

or my grandfather or someone asked them

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.000 
or my grandfather or someone asked them
if<00:00:41.489> they<00:00:41.640> might<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:41.910> any<00:00:42.540> keys<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.829> would

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
if they might have any keys that would

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.720 
if they might have any keys that would
be<00:00:44.160> suitable<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.670> use<00:00:45.620> with<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.730> 1962

Chevrolet<00:00:48.300> grain<00:00:48.840> truck<00:00:49.140> see<00:00:50.039> some<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.670> you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
Chevrolet grain truck see some of you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.369 
Chevrolet grain truck see some of you
probably<00:00:50.910> knew<00:00:51.360> where<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
probably knew where this was going and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.119 
probably knew where this was going and
so<00:00:52.980> what<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:53.760> are<00:00:54.719> two<00:00:54.750> big<00:00:55.469> rings<00:00:55.800> of

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
so what I have here are two big rings of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.010 
so what I have here are two big rings of
keys<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:57.770> represent<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.309> possible

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
keys that represent the possible

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.330 
keys that represent the possible
permutations<00:01:01.020> that's<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:01.500> math<00:01:01.710> word<00:01:02.010> for

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
permutations that's your math word for

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.469 
permutations that's your math word for
the<00:01:02.460> day<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:03.799> variations<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.040> key<00:01:05.339> coding<00:01:05.970> that

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the day of variations in key coding that

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.270 
the day of variations in key coding that
General<00:01:06.960> Motors<00:01:06.990> would<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.650> used<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
General Motors would have used in the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.260 
General Motors would have used in the
1960s<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.229> hope<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.729> that<00:01:11.729> one<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.150> these

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
1960s and the hope is that one of these

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.429 
1960s and the hope is that one of these
keys<00:01:12.720> will<00:01:13.710> fit<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:15.150> lock<00:01:15.450> cylinder<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
keys will fit the lock cylinder in the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.010 
keys will fit the lock cylinder in the
grain<00:01:16.680> truck<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.090> find<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.780> here

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
grain truck and if I find one on here

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.429 
grain truck and if I find one on here
that<00:01:19.229> does<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.790> isn't<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.439> 1962

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
that does and now this isn't just 1962

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.170 
that does and now this isn't just 1962
that's<00:01:22.710> represented<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:23.549> because<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.850> key

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that's represented here because this key

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.100 
that's represented here because this key
tag<00:01:24.479> right<00:01:24.720> here<00:01:24.930> says<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.759> 1966<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.720> obviously

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
tag right here says to 1966 so obviously

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.310 
tag right here says to 1966 so obviously
there's<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.470> few<00:01:28.710> model<00:01:29.009> years<00:01:29.250> newer

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
there's a few model years newer

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.140 
there's a few model years newer
represented<00:01:31.320> by<00:01:31.470> these<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.400> hope<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.820> by

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
represented by these but the hope is by

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.179 
represented by these but the hope is by
going<00:01:33.450> through<00:01:33.689> these<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.290> trying<00:01:34.799> them<00:01:35.040> in

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
going through these and trying them in

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.950 
going through these and trying them in
the<00:01:35.280> lock<00:01:35.460> cylinder<00:01:35.790> hopefully<00:01:36.780> I'll<00:01:36.930> find

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the lock cylinder hopefully I'll find

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.649 
the lock cylinder hopefully I'll find
one<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.590> fits<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.130> when<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> do<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.909> can<00:01:39.450> take

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
one that fits and when I do I can take

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.469 
one that fits and when I do I can take
that<00:01:39.869> one<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> copy<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.640> made<00:01:41.970> or

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that one and have a copy of it made or

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.389 
that one and have a copy of it made or
maybe<00:01:42.840> even<00:01:42.960> order<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> key<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:43.979> day<00:01:44.220> and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
maybe even order a key in this day and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.990 
maybe even order a key in this day and
age<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.670> don't<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:44.970> if<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.560> ordinarily

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
age I don't know if you can ordinarily

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.520 
age I don't know if you can ordinarily
get<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> key<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.750> for<00:01:49.049> such<00:01:49.259> an<00:01:49.380> old

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
get a key like that for such an old

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.590 
get a key like that for such an old
vehicle<00:01:50.130> made<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> dealership<00:01:51.180> honestly

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
vehicle made of the dealership honestly

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.139 
vehicle made of the dealership honestly
I'd<00:01:51.810> kind<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.170> doubt<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.799> always<00:01:53.640> figured

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
I'd kind of doubt it I always figured

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.850 
I'd kind of doubt it I always figured
something<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.720> these<00:01:54.930> existed<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:55.799> I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
something like these existed but I

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.859 
something like these existed but I
didn't<00:01:56.159> really<00:01:56.280> know<00:01:56.579> for<00:01:56.790> sure<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
didn't really know for sure because the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.870 
didn't really know for sure because the
one<00:01:58.079> case<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.649> know<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:59.100> where<00:01:59.340> somebody

wasn't in here wonder if somebody was

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.030 
wasn't in here wonder if somebody was
thinking<00:04:02.840> about<00:04:02.900> borrowing<00:04:03.230> parts<00:04:03.680> off<00:04:03.829> this

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
thinking about borrowing parts off this

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.699 
thinking about borrowing parts off this
thing<00:04:04.510> so<00:04:05.510> they'd<00:04:05.659> been<00:04:05.840> in<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.049> glove<00:04:06.260> box

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
thing so they'd been in the glove box

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.530 
thing so they'd been in the glove box
I<00:04:08.500> want<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.590> what's<00:04:09.709> up<00:04:09.859> with<00:04:10.040> that<00:04:10.540> also

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
I want to what's up with that also

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.089 
I want to what's up with that also
thought<00:04:11.870> I<00:04:11.900> left<00:04:12.109> the<00:04:12.290> key<00:04:12.469> cylinder<00:04:12.920> on<00:04:13.069> the

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
thought I left the key cylinder on the

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.830 
thought I left the key cylinder on the
seat<00:04:13.459> clearly<00:04:13.849> I'm<00:04:14.000> going<00:04:14.180> to<00:04:14.269> have<00:04:14.420> to<00:04:14.569> find

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
seat clearly I'm going to have to find

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.430 
seat clearly I'm going to have to find
it<00:04:15.160> assuming<00:04:16.160> it's<00:04:16.340> still<00:04:16.459> out<00:04:16.759> here<00:04:17.000> shy<00:04:17.539> not

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
it assuming it's still out here shy not

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.240 
it assuming it's still out here shy not
in<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.769> while<00:04:19.479> now<00:04:20.979> I'm<00:04:21.979> not<00:04:22.160> so<00:04:22.430> sure

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
in a while now I'm not so sure

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.589 
in a while now I'm not so sure
let's<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.310> look<00:04:25.460> around<00:04:25.699> see<00:04:25.880> if<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.150> can<00:04:26.240> find<00:04:26.419> a

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
let's to look around see if I can find a

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.120 
let's to look around see if I can find a
because<00:04:26.780> I<00:04:26.870> definitely<00:04:27.050> did<00:04:27.470> not<00:04:27.500> put<00:04:27.860> it<00:04:27.949> back

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
because I definitely did not put it back

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.939 
because I definitely did not put it back
in<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.430> dash<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:30.139> didn't<00:04:30.500> hook<00:04:30.560> it<00:04:30.710> up<00:04:30.800> to

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
in the dash and I didn't hook it up to

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.629 
in the dash and I didn't hook it up to
the<00:04:31.070> electrical<00:04:31.550> connector<00:04:32.000> either<00:04:32.919> so<00:04:33.919> not

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
the electrical connector either so not

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.339 
the electrical connector either so not
sure<00:04:34.910> where<00:04:35.150> that's<00:04:35.330> gotten<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:35.870> be<00:04:36.020> but<00:04:36.289> I

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:36.349 
sure where that's gotten to be but I

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.279 
sure where that's gotten to be but I
must<00:04:36.500> have<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:36.889> take<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.099> look<00:04:37.930> well<00:04:38.930> it<00:04:39.080> looked

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
must have to take a look well it looked

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.420 
must have to take a look well it looked
all<00:04:39.440> over<00:04:39.470> this<00:04:39.889> truck<00:04:40.449> and<00:04:41.449> I<00:04:41.630> can't<00:04:41.990> find

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
all over this truck and I can't find

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.219 
all over this truck and I can't find
that<00:04:43.430> lock<00:04:43.699> assembly<00:04:44.060> anywhere<00:04:44.630> I<00:04:44.660> really

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
that lock assembly anywhere I really

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.110 
that lock assembly anywhere I really
don't<00:04:45.560> think<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:45.919> took<00:04:46.130> it<00:04:46.280> out<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.520> here<00:04:46.699> but<00:04:46.910> I

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
don't think I took it out of here but I

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.089 
don't think I took it out of here but I
guess<00:04:47.750> I<00:04:47.900> can<00:04:48.080> look<00:04:48.199> around<00:04:48.349> at<00:04:48.650> home

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
guess I can look around at home

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.279 
guess I can look around at home
well<00:04:49.910> I'm<00:04:50.120> afraid<00:04:50.240> somebody's<00:04:50.900> been<00:04:51.080> goofing

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
well I'm afraid somebody's been goofing

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:52.779 
well I'm afraid somebody's been goofing
around<00:04:51.500> with<00:04:51.830> this<00:04:51.949> truck<00:04:52.250> out<00:04:52.430> here<00:04:52.639> we've

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
around with this truck out here we've

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.420 
around with this truck out here we've
had<00:04:53.050> vandal<00:04:54.050> problems<00:04:54.500> before<00:04:54.889> out<00:04:55.099> on<00:04:55.250> this

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
had vandal problems before out on this

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.510 
had vandal problems before out on this
farm<00:04:55.789> and<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.620> don't<00:04:57.620> remember<00:04:57.860> that<00:04:58.190> mirror

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
farm and I don't remember that mirror

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.640 
farm and I don't remember that mirror
being<00:04:58.760> off<00:04:59.000> there<00:04:59.300> like<00:04:59.510> that<00:04:59.780> and<00:04:59.840> I'm<00:05:00.050> very

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
being off there like that and I'm very

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.129 
being off there like that and I'm very
sure<00:05:00.949> that<00:05:01.190> wasn't<00:05:01.400> open<00:05:01.849> and<00:05:02.630> I<00:05:02.720> don't<00:05:02.750> think

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
sure that wasn't open and I don't think

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.770 
sure that wasn't open and I don't think
that<00:05:03.409> dome<00:05:03.710> light<00:05:03.949> thing<00:05:04.220> was<00:05:04.370> loose<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:04.970> I

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
that dome light thing was loose and I

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.270 
that dome light thing was loose and I
certainly<00:05:05.990> don't<00:05:06.260> think<00:05:06.380> that<00:05:06.710> it's<00:05:06.830> diffuser

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
certainly don't think that it's diffuser

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.750 
certainly don't think that it's diffuser
lens<00:05:07.400> was<00:05:07.820> down<00:05:08.090> there<00:05:08.270> by<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:08.510> fuel<00:05:08.840> tank<00:05:09.169> so

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
lens was down there by the fuel tank so

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.730 
lens was down there by the fuel tank so
I'm<00:05:10.760> not<00:05:10.940> sure<00:05:11.240> what's<00:05:11.510> going<00:05:11.570> on<00:05:11.960> here<00:05:12.020> go

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
I'm not sure what's going on here go

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.860 
I'm not sure what's going on here go
ahead<00:05:12.949> and<00:05:13.070> shut<00:05:14.000> that<00:05:14.030> thing<00:05:14.240> and<00:05:14.630> I<00:05:14.690> guess

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
ahead and shut that thing and I guess

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.409 
ahead and shut that thing and I guess
I'll<00:05:15.080> just<00:05:15.110> have<00:05:15.530> to<00:05:15.710> take<00:05:16.639> a<00:05:16.669> look<00:05:16.880> around<00:05:17.090> at

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
I'll just have to take a look around at

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.020 
I'll just have to take a look around at
home<00:05:17.570> and<00:05:17.979> see<00:05:18.979> if<00:05:19.099> I<00:05:19.220> can<00:05:19.400> find<00:05:19.580> that<00:05:19.729> lock

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
home and see if I can find that lock

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.240 
home and see if I can find that lock
cylinder<00:05:20.510> someplace<00:05:20.960> because<00:05:21.260> I'm

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
cylinder someplace because I'm

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.920 
cylinder someplace because I'm
completely<00:05:22.759> baffled<00:05:23.000> as<00:05:23.389> to<00:05:23.419> where<00:05:23.750> it<00:05:23.810> would

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
completely baffled as to where it would

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.909 
completely baffled as to where it would
be<00:05:24.970> so<00:05:28.389> scabby

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
be so scabby

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.180 
be so scabby
good<00:05:30.919> night<00:05:31.159> for<00:05:31.460> now<00:05:31.580> grain<00:05:32.000> truck<00:05:32.389> I

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
good night for now grain truck I

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.320 
good night for now grain truck I
probably<00:05:34.190> will<00:05:34.639> be<00:05:35.320> back
