00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
in his most recent episode of building

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.480 
in his most recent episode of building
with<00:00:06.299> BdoubleO<00:00:06.870> BdoubleO<00:00:07.799> requested<00:00:08.400> a

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
with BdoubleO BdoubleO requested a

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.850 
with BdoubleO BdoubleO requested a
design<00:00:08.849> for<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> sugarcane<00:00:09.510> farm<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.500> doesn't

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
design for a sugarcane farm that doesn't

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.950 
design for a sugarcane farm that doesn't
use<00:00:11.010> pistons<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:12.150> discovered<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.660> if<00:00:12.870> you

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
use pistons and I discovered that if you

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.870 
use pistons and I discovered that if you
have<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> dispenser<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:14.130> dispenses<00:00:14.670> water

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
have a dispenser that dispenses water

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.660 
have a dispenser that dispenses water
inside<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.929> sugarcane<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.619> breaks<00:00:17.340> those

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
inside of a sugarcane it breaks those

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.480 
inside of a sugarcane it breaks those
parts<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> sugarcane<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.920> BdoubleO<00:00:19.920> also

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
parts of the sugarcane a BdoubleO also

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.310 
parts of the sugarcane a BdoubleO also
wanted<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.240> be<00:00:21.270> able<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.660> fit<00:00:21.840> inside<00:00:22.050> of

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
wanted this to be able to fit inside of

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.349 
wanted this to be able to fit inside of
a<00:00:22.410> tower<00:00:22.619> with<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.369> kind<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.850> circumference

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
a tower with this kind of circumference

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.410 
a tower with this kind of circumference
so<00:00:25.320> I've<00:00:25.619> come<00:00:25.859> up<00:00:25.920> with<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.460> design<00:00:26.670> now

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
so I've come up with this design now

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.660 
so I've come up with this design now
this<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.080> pretty<00:00:28.470> resource<00:00:28.980> light<00:00:29.189> it

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
this one is pretty resource light it

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.880 
this one is pretty resource light it
uses<00:00:29.970> for<00:00:30.210> dispenses<00:00:30.689> per<00:00:30.869> layer<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.380> have

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
uses for dispenses per layer I have

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.590 
uses for dispenses per layer I have
three<00:00:32.189> layers<00:00:32.399> as<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.820> now<00:00:32.940> but<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.329> stack

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
three layers as of now but you can stack

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.870 
three layers as of now but you can stack
it<00:00:33.719> up<00:00:33.809> as<00:00:33.960> high<00:00:34.140> as<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.380> want<00:00:34.520> so<00:00:35.520> when<00:00:35.790> you

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
it up as high as you want so when you

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.459 
it up as high as you want so when you
want<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.180> harvest<00:00:36.480> all<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> your<00:00:37.050> sugar<00:00:37.260> cane

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
want to harvest all of your sugar cane

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.200 
want to harvest all of your sugar cane
you<00:00:37.680> toss<00:00:37.950> an<00:00:38.399> item<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.030> pressure

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
you toss an item on to this pressure

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.029 
you toss an item on to this pressure
plate

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
plate

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.819 
plate
pick<00:00:42.039> it<00:00:42.160> back<00:00:42.280> up<00:00:42.340> and<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:44.079> sugar<00:00:44.199> cane<00:00:44.469> drops

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
pick it back up and the sugar cane drops

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.549 
pick it back up and the sugar cane drops
down<00:00:45.040> now<00:00:45.340> you<00:00:45.430> don't<00:00:45.640> need<00:00:45.730> to<00:00:45.969> use<00:00:46.149> this

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
down now you don't need to use this

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.139 
down now you don't need to use this
exact<00:00:47.559> way<00:00:47.710> to<00:00:47.769> start<00:00:48.219> and<00:00:48.370> harvest<00:00:49.030> the

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
exact way to start and harvest the

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.700 
exact way to start and harvest the
system<00:00:49.480> you<00:00:49.629> can<00:00:49.780> use<00:00:49.899> any<00:00:50.079> way<00:00:50.230> you<00:00:50.290> want<00:00:50.530> as

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
system you can use any way you want as

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.380 
system you can use any way you want as
long<00:00:50.739> as<00:00:51.100> you<00:00:51.219> turn<00:00:51.489> off<00:00:51.640> all<00:00:51.850> these<00:00:52.030> torches

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
long as you turn off all these torches

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.150 
long as you turn off all these torches
at<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.660> same<00:00:52.809> time<00:00:53.050> this<00:00:53.649> just<00:00:53.920> seemed<00:00:54.100> like

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
at the same time this just seemed like

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.799 
at the same time this just seemed like
the<00:00:54.250> simplest<00:00:54.670> way<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:54.879> do<00:00:55.089> it<00:00:55.180> in<00:00:55.329> my<00:00:55.480> opinion

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
the simplest way to do it in my opinion

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.899 
the simplest way to do it in my opinion
to<00:00:56.440> turn<00:00:56.649> it<00:00:56.769> back<00:00:56.860> off<00:00:56.979> you<00:00:57.220> just<00:00:57.250> activate

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
to turn it back off you just activate

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.340 
to turn it back off you just activate
the<00:00:58.000> thing<00:00:58.180> again

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.130 

and<00:01:03.039> you<00:01:03.519> do<00:01:03.670> not<00:01:03.850> have<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.479> replant

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
and you do not have to replant

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.649 
and you do not have to replant
everything<00:01:05.470> stays<00:01:06.220> planted<00:01:06.460> so<00:01:06.939> after<00:01:07.540> all

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
everything stays planted so after all

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.510 
everything stays planted so after all
the<00:01:07.750> sugar<00:01:07.930> cane<00:01:08.140> grows<00:01:08.380> back<00:01:08.619> you<00:01:09.159> can<00:01:09.340> simply

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
the sugar cane grows back you can simply

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.730 
the sugar cane grows back you can simply
re<00:01:09.850> harvest<00:01:10.299> and<00:01:10.540> you're<00:01:10.720> good<00:01:10.869> to<00:01:10.900> go<00:01:11.049> now

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
re harvest and you're good to go now

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.620 
re harvest and you're good to go now
this<00:01:11.860> isn't<00:01:12.070> very<00:01:12.430> practical<00:01:12.729> it<00:01:13.330> only

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
this isn't very practical it only

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.950 
this isn't very practical it only
harvests<00:01:14.290> a<00:01:14.440> maximum<00:01:15.159> of<00:01:15.250> 12<00:01:15.610> sugar<00:01:15.880> cane<00:01:16.149> /

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
harvests a maximum of 12 sugar cane /

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.050 
harvests a maximum of 12 sugar cane /
harvests<00:01:17.619> but<00:01:17.890> II<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.159> blow<00:01:18.399> mention<00:01:18.820> that<00:01:18.940> it

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
harvests but II to blow mention that it

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.330 
harvests but II to blow mention that it
doesn't<00:01:19.420> have<00:01:19.570> to<00:01:19.720> be<00:01:19.750> practical<00:01:19.990> so<00:01:20.649> this<00:01:21.220> is

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
doesn't have to be practical so this is

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.160 
doesn't have to be practical so this is
the<00:01:21.549> design<00:01:21.850> i<00:01:21.880> came<00:01:22.149> up<00:01:22.270> with<00:01:22.450> doesn't<00:01:23.080> use

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
the design i came up with doesn't use

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.710 
the design i came up with doesn't use
pistons<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.649> fits<00:01:23.890> inside<00:01:24.070> of<00:01:24.340> this<00:01:24.460> area<00:01:24.909> now

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
pistons and fits inside of this area now

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.539 
pistons and fits inside of this area now
this<00:01:25.750> design<00:01:26.320> also<00:01:26.590> fits<00:01:27.039> inside<00:01:27.159> of<00:01:27.430> the

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
this design also fits inside of the

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.639 
this design also fits inside of the
smaller<00:01:27.909> tower<00:01:28.210> that<00:01:28.450> BdoubleO<00:01:28.930> mentioned<00:01:29.350> so

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
smaller tower that BdoubleO mentioned so

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.260 
smaller tower that BdoubleO mentioned so
this<00:01:29.979> will<00:01:30.159> work<00:01:30.280> with<00:01:30.520> both<00:01:30.700> of<00:01:30.909> those<00:01:31.000> so<00:01:31.240> you

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
this will work with both of those so you

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.550 
this will work with both of those so you
have<00:01:31.390> some<00:01:31.539> extra<00:01:31.690> space<00:01:32.110> to<00:01:32.140> work<00:01:32.380> around

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
have some extra space to work around

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.249 
have some extra space to work around
with<00:01:32.799> edit<00:01:33.580> harvests<00:01:34.060> in<00:01:34.149> the<00:01:34.299> exact<00:01:34.659> same<00:01:34.899> way

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.430 

now<00:01:38.259> this<00:01:38.560> is<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:39.009> design<00:01:39.369> without<00:01:39.640> any<00:01:40.060> walls

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
now this is the design without any walls

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.020 
now this is the design without any walls
you<00:01:41.440> need<00:01:41.649> a<00:01:41.679> water<00:01:42.039> source<00:01:42.310> block<00:01:42.610> on<00:01:42.850> your

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
you need a water source block on your

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.389 
you need a water source block on your
highest<00:01:43.539> layer<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:44.020> for<00:01:44.770> dirt<00:01:45.130> blocks

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
highest layer and for dirt blocks

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.309 
highest layer and for dirt blocks
surrounding<00:01:45.640> it<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.300> then<00:01:46.720> you<00:01:46.810> plant<00:01:47.050> sugar

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
surrounding it and then you plant sugar

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.109 
surrounding it and then you plant sugar
cane<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:47.920> only<00:01:48.069> need<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.310> plant<00:01:48.550> one<00:01:48.610> and<00:01:49.000> will

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
cane you only need to plant one and will

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.749 
cane you only need to plant one and will
grow<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.630> facing<00:01:50.590> into<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.950> second<00:01:51.399> block<00:01:51.610> of

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
grow and facing into the second block of

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.969 
grow and facing into the second block of
sugar<00:01:51.940> cane<00:01:52.210> you<00:01:52.659> need<00:01:52.869> a<00:01:52.899> dispenser<00:01:53.319> facing

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
sugar cane you need a dispenser facing

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.740 
sugar cane you need a dispenser facing
that<00:01:54.100> way<00:01:54.159> filled<00:01:54.940> with<00:01:55.060> a<00:01:55.149> bucket<00:01:55.479> of<00:01:55.539> water

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
that way filled with a bucket of water

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.600 
that way filled with a bucket of water
so<00:01:56.110> you<00:01:56.140> can<00:01:56.470> have<00:01:56.679> as<00:01:56.890> many<00:01:57.069> of<00:01:57.280> these<00:01:57.369> layers

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
so you can have as many of these layers

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.190 
so you can have as many of these layers
as<00:01:57.819> you<00:01:57.940> want<00:01:58.090> but<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.390> need<00:01:58.539> to<00:01:58.630> three<00:01:58.899> space

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
as you want but you need to three space

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.199 
as you want but you need to three space
in<00:01:59.440> between<00:01:59.560> layers<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.580> let<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.789> sugar<00:02:00.940> cane

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
in between layers to let the sugar cane

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:04.080 
in between layers to let the sugar cane
grow<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.539> its<00:02:01.899> maximum<00:02:02.380> height<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:03.069> then<00:02:03.700> to

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
grow to its maximum height and then to

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.569 
grow to its maximum height and then to
get<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.569> dispensers<00:02:05.319> to<00:02:05.470> fire<00:02:05.709> you<00:02:06.340> need

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
get the dispensers to fire you need

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.669 
get the dispensers to fire you need
torches<00:02:06.909> so<00:02:07.299> you<00:02:07.360> get<00:02:07.899> torch<00:02:08.140> going<00:02:08.410> into<00:02:08.649> a

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
torches so you get torch going into a

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.670 
torches so you get torch going into a
block<00:02:09.250> going<00:02:10.060> into<00:02:10.269> another<00:02:10.780> torch<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.530> goes

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
block going into another torch that goes

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.949 
block going into another torch that goes
into<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.070> into<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.670> dispenser<00:02:13.180> because<00:02:13.780> the

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
into the into the dispenser because the

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.020 
into the into the dispenser because the
torch<00:02:14.200> going<00:02:14.440> into<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.799> dispenser<00:02:15.310> needs<00:02:15.880> to

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
torch going into the dispenser needs to

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.240 
torch going into the dispenser needs to
be<00:02:16.150> not<00:02:16.420> powered<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.200> then<00:02:17.380> simply<00:02:17.799> it<00:02:17.950> stacks

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
be not powered and then simply it stacks

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.830 
be not powered and then simply it stacks
up<00:02:18.430> like<00:02:18.609> that's<00:02:18.820> torch<00:02:19.299> on<00:02:19.450> top<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
up like that's torch on top of the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.140 
up like that's torch on top of the
dispenser<00:02:20.290> block<00:02:21.040> torch<00:02:21.670> on<00:02:21.790> top<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.060> that

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
dispenser block torch on top of that

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.810 
dispenser block torch on top of that
that<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.510> not<00:02:22.540> powered<00:02:23.079> and<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:24.040> continues<00:02:24.579> all

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
that is not powered and it continues all

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.610 
that is not powered and it continues all
the<00:02:24.880> way<00:02:25.209> up<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.570> you<00:02:25.660> can<00:02:25.780> stack<00:02:25.959> this<00:02:26.170> until

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
the way up so you can stack this until

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.140 
the way up so you can stack this until
we're<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.040> limit<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.579> it<00:02:28.239> still<00:02:28.510> works<00:02:28.750> great

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
we're a limit and it still works great

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.729 
we're a limit and it still works great
pulses<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.329> here<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:34.350> here's<00:02:35.350> what<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.590> looks

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
pulses on here and here's what it looks

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:36.960 
pulses on here and here's what it looks
like<00:02:35.859> when<00:02:36.070> it's<00:02:36.250> harvesting<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.820> looks

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
like when it's harvesting it looks

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.229 
like when it's harvesting it looks
pretty<00:02:37.060> cool<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:38.579> this<00:02:39.579> doesn't<00:02:39.790> break<00:02:40.060> these

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
pretty cool and this doesn't break these

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.660 
pretty cool and this doesn't break these
source<00:02:40.959> sugar<00:02:41.410> cane<00:02:41.650> blocks<00:02:41.890> because<00:02:42.220> sugar

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
source sugar cane blocks because sugar

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.789 
source sugar cane blocks because sugar
cane<00:02:42.910> cannot<00:02:43.209> be<00:02:43.329> swept<00:02:43.540> away<00:02:43.630> by<00:02:43.720> water<00:02:44.109> this

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
cane cannot be swept away by water this

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.009 
cane cannot be swept away by water this
device<00:02:45.220> uses<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.820> property<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.390> dispenses

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
device uses the property that dispenses

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.180 
device uses the property that dispenses
simply<00:02:47.530> destroy<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.160> sugar<00:02:48.340> cane<00:02:48.489> block<00:02:48.760> and

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
simply destroy the sugar cane block and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.990 
simply destroy the sugar cane block and
you<00:02:51.190> can<00:02:51.310> turn<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.579> off<00:02:51.670> like<00:02:51.880> this<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:54.519> it's

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
you can turn it off like this and it's

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.300 
you can turn it off like this and it's
completely<00:02:55.239> reset<00:02:55.780> for<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.049> new<00:02:56.200> harvest<00:02:56.440> so

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
completely reset for a new harvest so

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.770 
completely reset for a new harvest so
you<00:02:57.400> only<00:02:57.519> need<00:02:57.609> one<00:02:57.940> water<00:02:58.180> source<00:02:58.239> block<00:02:58.630> up

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
you only need one water source block up

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.360 
you only need one water source block up
here<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:59.170> know<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.410> like<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.799> design<00:03:00.100> where

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
here I know you like the design where

here I know you like the design where
the<00:03:00.459> water<00:03:00.640> could<00:03:00.790> be<00:03:00.910> falling<00:03:01.239> from<00:03:01.390> like<00:03:01.630> a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
the water could be falling from like a

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.050 
the water could be falling from like a
tower<00:03:01.930> above<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.980> can<00:03:03.130> do<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.370> too<00:03:03.579> as<00:03:03.790> long

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
tower above you can do that too as long

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.759 
tower above you can do that too as long
as<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.299> water<00:03:04.480> is<00:03:04.660> only<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.989> 1<00:03:05.230> wide<00:03:05.440> stout

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
as the water is only a 1 wide stout
