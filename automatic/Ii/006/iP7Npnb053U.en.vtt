00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 hello how about channel friends today we're going 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.660
 to put 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.230
 the nintendo 64 emulator with three 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.030
 very interesting games that at least in 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.740
 one point of view they were the best 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.740
 for this console 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:50.280
 let's download from the place store 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.320
 and this emulator as you can see there are several without 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.390
 But I'm going to do it with this 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.100
 emulator 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.050
 the mop in 64 plus 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.589
 I do not have downloaded, I 'm going to leave the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.530
 direct link to the place is in the 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:09.549
 description I will also leave you the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.440
 links to download the 3 roms of these 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.340
 games that were king kong's 4 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.540
 supermales 34 and zelda ocarina of time 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.380
 once 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.590
 download the emulator and install it 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.590
 we open it 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.690
 and we have these options this is the 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.980
 interface let's click on the start 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:36.080
 game and we will open the folders that 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.240
 we have in our sd or in our 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.640
 internal memory in this case I have 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.060
 an n64 folder where I recorded the error 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.830
 we click and here they will be in points 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.060
 and the archives 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.060
 I for example let's play 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.250
 once we have them, it appears and 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.750
 selected there we're going to start 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.100
 cancellation and resume 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.790
 ah 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.790
 ah 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.250
 here it is 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.560
 we already have it 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.000
 here is our 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.360
 It works very well 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.319
 to choose 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.210
 any letter 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.900
 It is difficult to handle with normal 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.819
 and this one starts the game 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.510
 It's all normal 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.819
 for lovers of that game too 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.870
 here when we go backwards they appear 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.560
 the options 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.330
 which for example is saving slots 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.460
 this 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.740
 we can save games 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.830
 for three lots if we give it here it 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.620
 guard 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.800
 you save that which saves the game and 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.840
 when we click here 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.940
 they ask us where we want to go back 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.069
 we give load slot 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.760
 and it comes back 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.680
 where was the last time we recorded 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.930
 as you see there studying I load the 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.840
 slot and it's repeating the last time 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.800
 I loaded a saved game 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.480
 we give in the menus and we can leave the 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.080
 emulator 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.950
 when we go out like this automatically for 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.950
 that when we started 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.690
 let's choose another game 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.359
 4 we go 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.720
 has begun 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.860
 and your game clock has just started 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.060
 let's open the last 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.400
 It is also automatically saved for 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.070
 the next time you start start in that 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.030
 part where we stayed and 2 564 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.030
 we resume 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.430
 and I 'm sure I stayed just 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.430
 start the game 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.710
 ah 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.720
 and in this way 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.760
