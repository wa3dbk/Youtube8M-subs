00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
review because I think the handle design

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.939 
review because I think the handle design
is<00:00:17.490> completely<00:00:18.270> unsafe<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.770> misleading

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949

whatsoever<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.719> only<00:00:54.960> thing<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.440> noticed

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
whatsoever the only thing that I noticed

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.420 
whatsoever the only thing that I noticed
was<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.520> handles<00:00:57.829> separating<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.980> little<00:00:59.250> bit

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
was the handles separating a little bit

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.619 
was the handles separating a little bit
and<00:01:01.160> this<00:01:02.160> little<00:01:02.550> piece<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.120> little<00:01:03.449> metal

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
and this little piece this little metal

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.060 
and this little piece this little metal
insert<00:01:04.170> came<00:01:04.559> off<00:01:04.739> from<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> sides<00:01:06.210> so

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
insert came off from one of the sides so

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.399 
insert came off from one of the sides so
there's<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.130> little<00:01:08.340> clue<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.820> what<00:01:09.000> happened

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
there's a little clue of what happened

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.060 
there's a little clue of what happened
that<00:01:10.409> little<00:01:11.070> insert<00:01:12.619> came<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.040> other

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
that little insert came out the other

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.920 
that little insert came out the other
side<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.549> still<00:01:14.880> haven't<00:01:15.180> been<00:01:15.270> able<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.630> find

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
side I still haven't been able to find

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.609 
side I still haven't been able to find
it<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.950> its<00:01:17.159> second<00:01:17.580> trip<00:01:18.140> after<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.380> two

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
it on its second trip after just two

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.740 
it on its second trip after just two
small<00:01:19.920> logs<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:22.950> started<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> handle<00:01:24.390> started

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
small logs it started the handle started

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.850 
small logs it started the handle started
wiggling<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.830> stopped<00:01:26.729> batoning<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:28.080> looked

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
wiggling so I stopped batoning I looked

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.560 
wiggling so I stopped batoning I looked
over<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.400> blade<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.939> saw<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.450> you

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
over to the blade and I saw that you

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.260 
over to the blade and I saw that you
could<00:01:30.780> twist<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> handle<00:01:32.130> 30<00:01:32.430> degrees<00:01:32.970> from

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
could twist the handle 30 degrees from

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.950 
could twist the handle 30 degrees from
the<00:01:33.479> blade

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the blade

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.580 
the blade
I<00:01:35.180> started<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.329> investigate<00:01:36.689> some<00:01:37.079> more<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
I started to investigate some more and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.480 
I started to investigate some more and
saw<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.310> handles<00:01:39.290> could<00:01:40.290> easily<00:01:40.530> come<00:01:41.340> off

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
saw the handles could easily come off

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.600 
saw the handles could easily come off
and<00:01:42.649> this<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.710> what<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.040> found<00:01:44.310> inside<00:01:45.409> to<00:01:46.610> two

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
and this is what I found inside to two

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.530 
and this is what I found inside to two
pieces<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.060> metal<00:01:48.770> welded<00:01:49.770> together<00:01:50.340> at<00:01:51.000> two

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
pieces of metal welded together at two

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.710 
pieces of metal welded together at two
spots<00:01:52.530> one<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.520> top<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:54.030> one<00:01:54.210> at<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.420> bottom

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
spots one on top of one at the bottom

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.020 
spots one on top of one at the bottom
and<00:01:55.140> they<00:01:55.740> could<00:01:55.950> be<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.750> mean

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
and they could be I mean

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.760 
and they could be I mean
try<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.869> do<00:01:59.049> this<00:01:59.170> with<00:01:59.409> one<00:01:59.619> hand<00:02:01.560> they<00:02:02.560> could

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
try to do this with one hand they could

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.440 
try to do this with one hand they could
be<00:02:02.920> separated<00:02:03.549> that<00:02:03.760> easily

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
be separated that easily

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.150 
be separated that easily
if<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:05.200> continue<00:02:05.680> batoning<00:02:07.440> if<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.619> continue

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
if I continue batoning if I continue

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.469 
if I continue batoning if I continue
baton<00:02:09.490> and<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.819> probably<00:02:10.149> would<00:02:10.390> have

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
baton and I probably would have

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.150 
baton and I probably would have
shattered<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:11.020> handle<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.590> blade<00:02:11.860> might

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
shattered the handle the blade might

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.800 
shattered the handle the blade might
have<00:02:12.310> been<00:02:12.540> flying<00:02:13.540> through<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.020> air<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:16.750> is

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
it does its job it keeps it the blade

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.990 
it does its job it keeps it the blade

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
point on the front so that you could

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.990 
point on the front so that you could
baton<00:03:04.750> pretty<00:03:05.049> easily<00:03:05.290> without<00:03:06.190> hurting

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.569 
problem I see in the biggest safety
concern<00:03:18.070> I<00:03:18.220> have<00:03:18.459> is<00:03:18.700> this<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:21.160> handle

concern I have is this this handle
design<00:03:22.560> online<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.829> bought<00:03:24.579> this<00:03:24.790> on<00:03:25.030> Amazon

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
design online I bought this on Amazon

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.280 
design online I bought this on Amazon
and<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:26.290> said<00:03:26.650> it's<00:03:26.859> a<00:03:26.950> full<00:03:27.190> tank<00:03:27.459> design<00:03:27.850> and

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
and it said it's a full tank design and

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.780 
and it said it's a full tank design and
when<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.440> comes<00:03:30.359> this<00:03:31.920> when<00:03:32.920> it's<00:03:33.370> completely

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
when it comes this when it's completely

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.390 
when it comes this when it's completely
assembled<00:03:34.420> you<00:03:35.079> could<00:03:35.260> see<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:35.739> from<00:03:36.190> the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
assembled you could see that from the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.729 
assembled you could see that from the
top<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:37.390> looks<00:03:37.450> like<00:03:37.959> it's<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.230> full<00:03:38.470> tank

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
top it looks like it's a full tank

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.970 
top it looks like it's a full tank
design<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:40.750> goes<00:03:40.959> all<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.200> way<00:03:41.410> around<00:03:41.769> it

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
design it goes all the way around it

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.210 
design it goes all the way around it
looks<00:03:42.160> like<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.340> full<00:03:42.609> tank<00:03:42.880> design<00:03:43.320> but<00:03:44.320> once

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
looks like a full tank design but once

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.830 
looks like a full tank design but once
you<00:03:45.400> have<00:03:45.609> a<00:03:46.290> knife<00:03:47.290> failure<00:03:47.739> like<00:03:48.070> this<00:03:48.310> and

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
you have a knife failure like this and

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.710 
you have a knife failure like this and
the<00:03:49.840> scales<00:03:50.200> of<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:51.640> handle<00:03:52.030> come<00:03:52.209> off<00:03:52.390> you

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
the scales of the handle come off you

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.599 
the scales of the handle come off you
could<00:03:52.930> see<00:03:53.140> that<00:03:53.290> it's<00:03:53.500> not<00:03:53.680> a<00:03:53.739> full<00:03:54.310> tank

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
could see that it's not a full tank

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.440 
could see that it's not a full tank
design<00:03:54.940> all<00:03:55.540> they<00:03:55.870> did<00:03:56.109> was<00:03:56.700> well<00:03:57.700> two<00:03:58.030> pieces

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
design all they did was well two pieces

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.300 
design all they did was well two pieces
of<00:03:58.570> metal<00:03:58.810> together<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.470> consider<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.250> a

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
of metal together and consider that a

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.240 
of metal together and consider that a
full<00:04:00.670> tank<00:04:00.910> design<00:04:01.209> which<00:04:01.390> I<00:04:01.570> do<00:04:01.630> not<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.440> I

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
full tank design which I do not and I

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.430 
full tank design which I do not and I
don't<00:04:03.489> think<00:04:03.670> this<00:04:03.820> is<00:04:03.970> a<00:04:04.000> safe<00:04:04.269> design<00:04:04.510> so

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
don't think this is a safe design so

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.170 
don't think this is a safe design so
that's<00:04:05.590> my<00:04:05.739> review<00:04:05.950> I'd<00:04:06.819> give<00:04:07.300> this<00:04:07.450> knife<00:04:07.750> a

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
that's my review I'd give this knife a

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.630 
that's my review I'd give this knife a
three<00:04:09.989> out<00:04:10.109> of<00:04:10.140> ten<00:04:13.040> just<00:04:14.040> because<00:04:14.400> of<00:04:14.549> the

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
three out of ten just because of the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.620 
three out of ten just because of the
plate<00:04:14.879> I<00:04:15.000> love<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.750> blade<00:04:16.970> just<00:04:17.970> consider<00:04:18.389> my

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
plate I love the blade just consider my

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.719 
plate I love the blade just consider my
first<00:04:18.900> outing<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.620> how<00:04:19.919> much<00:04:20.130> what<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.459> went

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
first outing of how much what I went

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.700 
first outing of how much what I went
through<00:04:20.850> it<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.389> with<00:04:21.750> no<00:04:21.959> blade<00:04:22.229> failures

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
through it and with no blade failures

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.909 
through it and with no blade failures
I'd<00:04:23.370> give<00:04:23.699> that<00:04:23.729> a<00:04:23.940> three<00:04:24.270> out<00:04:24.360> of<00:04:24.389> ten<00:04:24.919> but

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
I'd give that a three out of ten but

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.680 
I'd give that a three out of ten but
would<00:04:26.160> I<00:04:26.190> recommend<00:04:26.610> this<00:04:26.789> knife<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.180> anybody

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
would I recommend this knife to anybody

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.279 
would I recommend this knife to anybody
definitely<00:04:28.229> not<00:04:28.440> I<00:04:28.940> think<00:04:29.940> it's<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:31.050> terrible

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
definitely not I think it's a terrible

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.249 
definitely not I think it's a terrible
design<00:04:31.830> I<00:04:32.130> don't<00:04:32.820> know<00:04:32.940> what<00:04:33.690> happened<00:04:34.050> at<00:04:34.139> the

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
design I don't know what happened at the

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.240 
design I don't know what happened at the
factory<00:04:34.740> if<00:04:35.270> someone<00:04:36.270> just<00:04:37.199> didn't<00:04:37.979> make<00:04:38.100> this

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
factory if someone just didn't make this

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.189 
factory if someone just didn't make this
blade<00:04:38.550> properly<00:04:39.150> and<00:04:39.300> decided<00:04:39.720> to<00:04:39.750> weld<00:04:40.050> it

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
blade properly and decided to weld it

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.960 
blade properly and decided to weld it
together<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:40.590> don't<00:04:40.889> know<00:04:40.979> what<00:04:41.160> happened<00:04:41.490> but

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
together I don't know what happened but

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.749 
together I don't know what happened but
I<00:04:42.000> think<00:04:42.060> this<00:04:42.449> was<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.690> very<00:04:43.349> big<00:04:43.620> mistake<00:04:43.800> some

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
I think this was a very big mistake some

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.450 
I think this was a very big mistake some
sending<00:04:45.150> it<00:04:45.270> back<00:04:45.620> I'm<00:04:46.620> not<00:04:46.830> suing<00:04:47.220> anybody

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
sending it back I'm not suing anybody

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.499 
sending it back I'm not suing anybody
because<00:04:48.000> nobody<00:04:48.360> was<00:04:48.509> hurt<00:04:48.720> but<00:04:49.250> if<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.460> kept<00:04:50.789> I

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
because nobody was hurt but if I kept I

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.200 
because nobody was hurt but if I kept I
kept<00:04:52.410> whacking<00:04:52.889> at<00:04:53.039> that<00:04:53.220> would<00:04:53.430> I

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
kept whacking at that would I

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.420 
kept whacking at that would I
I<00:04:54.509> think<00:04:54.990> there's<00:04:55.289> a<00:04:55.349> big<00:04:55.590> probability<00:04:56.340> of

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430
