so really there's been of course over a

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.460 
so really there's been of course over a
thousand<00:00:48.550> papers<00:00:48.970> only<00:00:49.660> in<00:00:49.750> the<00:00:49.870> last<00:00:50.080> two

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
thousand papers only in the last two

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.950 
thousand papers only in the last two
decades<00:00:50.770> on<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.580> beneficial<00:00:52.420> effects<00:00:52.810> of

decades on the beneficial effects of

meditation on our biology on our

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.130 
meditation on our biology on our
biochemistry<00:00:57.160> we<00:00:58.030> know<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.420> metabolic<00:00:58.840> rate

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
biochemistry we know the metabolic rate

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.110 
biochemistry we know the metabolic rate
goes<00:00:59.530> down<00:00:59.560> we<00:01:00.190> know<00:01:00.370> that<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.820> immune<00:01:01.090> system

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
goes down we know that the immune system

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.770 
goes down we know that the immune system
seems<00:01:02.080> to<00:01:02.230> optimize<00:01:02.920> we<00:01:03.820> know<00:01:04.030> that<00:01:04.240> cortisol

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
seems to optimize we know that cortisol

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.280 
seems to optimize we know that cortisol
levels<00:01:05.170> decrease<00:01:05.650> adrenaline<00:01:06.430> decreases

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
levels decrease adrenaline decreases

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.750 
levels decrease adrenaline decreases
overall<00:01:08.290> there's<00:01:08.680> a<00:01:08.800> general<00:01:09.190> sense<00:01:09.550> of

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
overall there's a general sense of

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.690 
overall there's a general sense of
well-being<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:11.380> I<00:01:11.410> think<00:01:11.830> what<00:01:12.250> meditation

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
well-being but I think what meditation

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.820 
well-being but I think what meditation
also<00:01:13.150> does<00:01:13.570> in<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.870> brain<00:01:14.020> anyway

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
also does in the brain anyway

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.150 
also does in the brain anyway
it<00:01:15.400> increases<00:01:16.060> gamma<00:01:16.690> synchrony<00:01:17.440> it

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
it increases gamma synchrony it

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.100 
it increases gamma synchrony it
increases<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:18.940> coherence<00:01:19.540> in<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.869> brain

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
increases the coherence in the brain

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.920 
increases the coherence in the brain
other<00:01:20.860> than<00:01:21.220> decreasing<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.240> metabolic<00:01:22.660> rate

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
other than decreasing the metabolic rate

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.950 
other than decreasing the metabolic rate
in<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.320> body<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:23.830> that<00:01:24.460> has<00:01:24.960> beneficial

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
in the body and that has beneficial

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.609 
in the body and that has beneficial
effects<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:26.800> I<00:01:27.760> want<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.150> ask<00:01:28.300> you<00:01:28.570> first<00:01:29.380> of

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
effects and I want to ask you first of

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.059 
the thoughts that come along with those
emotions<00:03:17.209> you're<00:03:18.050> clearing<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.590> brain<00:03:18.800> into

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
emotions you're clearing the brain into

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.600 
emotions you're clearing the brain into
a<00:03:19.099> quiet<00:03:19.690> space<00:03:20.690> so<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.440> your<00:03:21.590> mind<00:03:21.830> can<00:03:22.580> be

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
a quiet space so that your mind can be

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.539 
a quiet space so that your mind can be
quiet<00:03:23.000> at<00:03:23.989> this<00:03:24.200> point<00:03:24.590> everything<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.370> going

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
quiet at this point everything is going

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.570 
quiet at this point everything is going
to<00:03:25.610> be<00:03:25.989> much<00:03:26.989> clearer<00:03:27.470> it's<00:03:28.010> going<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.370> be

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
to be much clearer it's going to be

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.509 
to be much clearer it's going to be
opening<00:03:29.569> channels<00:03:30.170> of<00:03:30.290> intuition<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.010> your

meditation<00:03:47.870> allows<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:48.319> to<00:03:48.470> do<00:03:48.620> this<00:03:48.830> so<00:03:49.459> you

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
meditation allows you to do this so you

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.550 
meditation allows you to do this so you
will<00:03:49.849> have<00:03:50.030> just<00:03:50.390> a<00:03:50.510> much<00:03:50.630> clearer<00:03:51.110> set<00:03:51.440> of

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
will have just a much clearer set of

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.940 
will have just a much clearer set of
channels<00:03:52.069> where<00:03:52.670> they<00:03:52.760> are<00:03:52.849> recalling

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
now you're in the present quiet mind and

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.580 
now you're in the present quiet mind and
everything<00:04:04.100> will<00:04:04.459> be<00:04:04.609> much<00:04:05.450> more<00:04:05.750> acute<00:04:06.470> in

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
everything will be much more acute in

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.319 
everything will be much more acute in
terms<00:04:06.829> of<00:04:06.950> awareness<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:07.609> now<00:04:08.150> you're

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
terms of awareness and now you're

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.009 
terms of awareness and now you're
allowing<00:04:08.540> intuition<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.950> boom<00:04:10.480> in<00:04:11.480> your<00:04:11.780> mind

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019

allowing intuition to boom in your mind
through<00:04:12.440> your<00:04:12.680> brain<00:04:12.920> so<00:04:13.850> you're<00:04:14.030> rebooting

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
through your brain so you're rebooting

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.930 
through your brain so you're rebooting
you<00:04:14.780> bring<00:04:15.049> your<00:04:15.859> rebooting<00:04:16.370> your<00:04:16.400> brain<00:04:16.820> but

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
you bring your rebooting your brain but

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.310 
you bring your rebooting your brain but
you're<00:04:17.150> also<00:04:17.450> it's<00:04:17.600> more<00:04:17.810> than<00:04:17.959> that<00:04:18.109> you're

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
you're also it's more than that you're

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.009 
you're also it's more than that you're
allowing<00:04:18.560> your<00:04:18.799> brain<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.190> blossom<00:04:19.690> into<00:04:20.690> what

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
many would argue is the next stage of

many would argue is the next stage of
