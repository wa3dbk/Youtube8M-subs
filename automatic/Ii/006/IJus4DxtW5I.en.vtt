00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.250
 Same house as vegeta 777 is 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.590
 almost the same and is with a pack of 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.850
 textures should very cool and if you guys 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.040
 they want to install a pact of textures 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.780
 go here mostly on my channel that is 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.820

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.580
 best textures pack that I would like 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.200
 I consider no and good is the house is 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.980
 igualita I think that gives me seven 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.690
 said is the pyramid here is the field 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.330
 of flowers your crops that serve us 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.700
 for ideas of our houses and here 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.310
 are the paths and what would be 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.720
 pretty little channels that stand out 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.720
 very much a temple that does not stay there 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.970

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.800
 where there are private houses attended them 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.840
 I say there are different portals that 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.570
 I believe that they have been with the votes of psc 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.070
 and here I do not know that it's here as I do not see 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.410
 the series that's because I do not have pc 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.840
 Well, it has nothing to do with it 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.840
 a mine I do not know how to work 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.069

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.300

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.830
