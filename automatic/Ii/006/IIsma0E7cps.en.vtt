00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
the different types of flow they come in

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.430 
the different types of flow they come in
on<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.430> back<00:00:32.610> here<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.510> again<00:00:33.899> tells<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.290> that

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
on the back here it again tells you that

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.290 
on the back here it again tells you that
they<00:00:34.620> are<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> number<00:00:35.100> one<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.550> says<00:00:36.000> that

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
they are the number one it says that

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.260 
they are the number one it says that
they<00:00:36.420> are<00:00:36.570> my<00:00:36.840> fit<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.590> they<00:00:37.739> expand<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.820> fit<00:00:39.059> to

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
they are my fit so they expand to fit to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.660 
they are my fit so they expand to fit to
your<00:00:39.390> body<00:00:39.660> shape<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.550> an

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
your body shape and that we have an

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.389 
your body shape and that we have an
applicator<00:00:42.239> tampon<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.350> clicks<00:00:43.680> into<00:00:44.160> place

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
applicator tampon that clicks into place

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.790 
applicator tampon that clicks into place
or<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.730> guess<00:00:44.910> locks<00:00:45.210> into<00:00:45.570> place<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.620> they

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
or I guess locks into place that they

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.740 
or I guess locks into place that they
have<00:00:47.160> an<00:00:47.309> easy<00:00:47.610> open<00:00:48.000> tab<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.420> smooth

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
have an easy open tab a smooth

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.290 
have an easy open tab a smooth
applicator<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.590> an<00:00:49.710> anti-slip<00:00:50.309> grip<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
applicator and an anti-slip grip now I

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.779 
applicator and an anti-slip grip now I
like<00:00:52.050> these<00:00:52.260> I'm<00:00:52.559> particularly<00:00:53.010> drawn<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.670> by

do<00:02:40.870> this<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.380> usually<00:02:41.680> do<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.920> bit<00:02:42.130> more<00:02:42.310> slowly

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
do this I usually do a bit more slowly

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.440 
do this I usually do a bit more slowly
and<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.150> bit<00:02:43.300> more<00:02:43.420> carefully<00:02:45.150> just<00:02:46.150> you<00:02:46.300> know

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450

it's<00:02:46.660> just<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.960> bit<00:02:47.140> easier<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.650> way<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.700> there

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
it's just a bit easier that way so there

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.630 
it's just a bit easier that way so there
we<00:02:49.270> go<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.660> then<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.230> tampon<00:02:50.710> will<00:02:51.430> have

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.200 
we go and then the tampon will have
attached<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.750> place<00:02:53.020> usually<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:58.060> can

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
attached in place usually and you can

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.030 
attached in place usually and you can
just<00:02:58.390> discard<00:02:58.750> this<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.260> do<00:02:59.380> make<00:02:59.620> sure<00:02:59.650> you

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040
