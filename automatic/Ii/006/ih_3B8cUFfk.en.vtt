finish<00:02:39.569> on<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.900> old<00:02:40.080> one<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.130> a

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
finish on the old one and this is a

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.320 
finish on the old one and this is a
slightly<00:02:41.810> matte<00:02:42.810> finish<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.940> could<00:02:45.120> be<00:02:45.209> better

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
slightly matte finish it could be better

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.170 
slightly matte finish it could be better
because<00:02:45.600> if<00:02:46.319> you've<00:02:46.500> got<00:02:46.680> slightly<00:02:47.670> warm

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
because if you've got slightly warm

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.500 
because if you've got slightly warm
hands<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:49.230> smooth<00:02:49.769> one<00:02:49.799> got<00:02:50.069> sticky<00:02:50.510> so

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
hands it's the smooth one got sticky so

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.699 
hands it's the smooth one got sticky so
that<00:02:51.720> could<00:02:51.930> be<00:02:51.959> an<00:02:52.110> improvement<00:02:54.709> going

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
that could be an improvement going

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.900 
that could be an improvement going
quickly<00:02:55.950> around<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.280> device<00:02:56.549> there's<00:02:56.850> a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
quickly around the device there's a

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.849 
quickly around the device there's a
couple<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.480> button<00:02:57.810> changes<00:02:58.350> only<00:02:58.560> label

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
couple of button changes only label

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.479 
couple of button changes only label
changes<00:02:59.489> here<00:03:00.859> all<00:03:01.859> the<00:03:01.980> buttons<00:03:02.340> look

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
changes here all the buttons look

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.270 
changes here all the buttons look
exactly<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.000> same<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.690> ports<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:04.980> that's

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
exactly the same and the ports so that's

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.789 
exactly the same and the ports so that's
good<00:03:06.239> now<00:03:06.630> let's<00:03:06.660> go<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.290> battery<00:03:07.620> latch

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
good now let's go to the battery latch

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.130 
good now let's go to the battery latch
which<00:03:08.760> was<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> little<00:03:09.180> bit<00:03:09.299> on<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.750> old<00:03:09.930> one

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
which was a little bit on the old one

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.090 
which was a little bit on the old one
and<00:03:10.640> looks<00:03:11.640> like<00:03:11.880> it's<00:03:12.060> similar<00:03:12.630> new<00:03:13.290> one<00:03:14.450> ok

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
and looks like it's similar new one ok

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.289 
and looks like it's similar new one ok
no<00:03:17.100> improvement<00:03:17.670> there<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.329> battery<00:03:18.810> latch

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
no improvement there the battery latch

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.789 
no improvement there the battery latch
um<00:03:21.799> dipen<00:03:22.799> getting<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.310> pan<00:03:23.549> out<00:03:23.670> as<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:25.590> works

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
um dipen getting the pan out as it works

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.880 
um dipen getting the pan out as it works
good<00:03:26.430> oh<00:03:27.000> my<00:03:27.690> god<00:03:27.870> stop<00:03:30.470> but<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.530> don't<00:03:31.769> know

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
good oh my god stop but I don't know

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.020 
good oh my god stop but I don't know
whether<00:03:32.040> it's<00:03:32.250> because<00:03:32.609> of<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.850> design

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
whether it's because of the design

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.970 
whether it's because of the design
because<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.870> way<00:03:34.079> out<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:34.530> we'll<00:03:34.590> see<00:03:34.859> about

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
because of way out so we'll see about

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.650 
because of way out so we'll see about
that<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:35.519> at<00:03:35.609> least<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.940> get<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.060> pin<00:03:36.329> out<00:03:36.450> this

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
that so at least and get a pin out this

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.050 
that so at least and get a pin out this
one<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:37.140> be<00:03:37.230> honest<00:03:37.560> I've<00:03:38.370> actually<00:03:38.549> lost<00:03:38.819> the

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
one to be honest I've actually lost the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.539 
one to be honest I've actually lost the
pen<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.420> one<00:03:39.660> haven't<00:03:40.380> used<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.769> at<00:03:41.310> all

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
pen and this one haven't used it at all

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.500 
pen and this one haven't used it at all
so<00:03:42.440> it's<00:03:43.440> not<00:03:43.680> too<00:03:43.920> much<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.370> worry<00:03:44.940> if<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.239> pen

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
so it's not too much of a worry if a pen

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.759 
so it's not too much of a worry if a pen
doesn't<00:03:46.079> work<00:03:46.819> looking<00:03:47.819> inside<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.780> can<00:03:49.590> see

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
doesn't work looking inside I can see

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.250 
doesn't work looking inside I can see
that<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.010> HDD<00:03:50.639> cable<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.209> installed<00:03:51.690> so<00:03:52.170> of

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.440 
course this device doesn't have a hard
drive<00:03:53.810> but<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.590> HDD<00:03:55.040> cable<00:03:55.400> is<00:03:55.520> there<00:03:55.850> if<00:03:56.120> you

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
drive but the HDD cable is there if you

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.090 
drive but the HDD cable is there if you

as far as that goes i think that's about
it<00:04:52.040> so<00:04:52.460> let's<00:04:52.870> let's<00:04:53.870> boot<00:04:54.200> it<00:04:54.350> up<00:04:54.850> and<00:04:58.780> you

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
it so let's let's boot it up and you

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.220 
it so let's let's boot it up and you
have<00:04:59.900> 26<00:05:00.380> what<00:05:00.770> our<00:05:01.040> battery<00:05:01.520> on<00:05:01.670> that<00:05:01.820> one<00:05:02.230> so

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
have 26 what our battery on that one so

differences are unexpected quieter

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.030 
differences are unexpected quieter
faster<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:13.030> slightly<00:05:14.030> more<00:05:14.630> efficient<00:05:15.140> usage

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
faster and slightly more efficient usage

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.830

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.540 
this is the tiny tiny fans in the top so
I<00:05:35.810> don't<00:05:35.990> know<00:05:36.080> if<00:05:36.140> this<00:05:36.230> is<00:05:36.290> first<00:05:36.890> boot<00:05:37.250> on

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
I don't know if this is first boot on

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.900 
I don't know if this is first boot on
windows<00:05:38.060> XP<00:05:38.240> here<00:05:39.020> but<00:05:39.830> some<00:05:42.610> that's<00:05:43.610> in

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
windows XP here but some that's in

already

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:49.339 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:56.760 

so<00:05:50.339> it's<00:05:50.520> silent<00:05:51.059> which<00:05:51.180> is<00:05:51.300> great

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.070

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
I can do a head-to-head with the SSD and

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:09.960 
I can do a head-to-head with the SSD and
