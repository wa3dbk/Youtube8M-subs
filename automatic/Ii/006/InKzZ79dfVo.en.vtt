big<00:02:53.870> Disney<00:02:54.230> sign<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:58.040> these<00:02:58.250> are<00:02:58.490> fake<00:02:59.000> and

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
big Disney sign so these are fake and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.610 
big Disney sign so these are fake and
this<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.900> real<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:01.160> this<00:03:01.459> isn't<00:03:01.959> but<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:03.170> mean

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
this is real and this isn't but I mean

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.320
