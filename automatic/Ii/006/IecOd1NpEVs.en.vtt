down our cooking pan so nothing sticks

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.760

and<00:00:55.559> go<00:00:56.250> ahead<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.879> make<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> shape<00:00:58.230> kind<00:00:58.620> of

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
and go ahead and make a shape kind of

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.260 
and go ahead and make a shape kind of
like<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.280> guess<00:00:59.789> bacon<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.829> that<00:01:01.910> it's<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.059> lot

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
like I guess bacon so that it's a lot

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.620 
like I guess bacon so that it's a lot
easier<00:01:03.420> than<00:01:03.899> actually<00:01:04.589> having<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.369> pour<00:01:05.760> it

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.789 

so<00:01:09.630> once<00:01:09.900> that's<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.470> we're<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
so once that's on there we're going to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.640 
so once that's on there we're going to
take<00:01:10.920> our<00:01:11.100> bacon<00:01:11.729> strip<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:13.110> put<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> on

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and I like to kind of give it a zigzag

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.469 
and I like to kind of give it a zigzag
so<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.229> could<00:01:16.350> still<00:01:16.619> see<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> bacon<00:01:17.479> but
