00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.779 
you look these two teams it was grazyna
and<00:00:57.570> adoro<00:00:57.899> getting<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> goals<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.250> Chicago

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and adoro getting the goals for Chicago

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.790 
and adoro getting the goals for Chicago
in<00:00:59.820> what<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.270> called<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.719> sloppy<00:01:01.140> victory

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
in what they called a sloppy victory

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.979 
in what they called a sloppy victory
they<00:01:02.280> ended<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.579> giving<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.300> goal<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
they ended up giving up a goal in the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.469 
they ended up giving up a goal in the
second<00:01:04.379> half<00:01:04.589> grazyna<00:01:05.280> had<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> leave<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.330> an

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
second half grazyna had to leave with an

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.870 
second half grazyna had to leave with an
injury<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.439> kind<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.740> offset<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> balance

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
injury so it kind of offset the balance

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.910 
injury so it kind of offset the balance
I<00:01:09.180> think<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.540> Chicago<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.350> second<00:01:10.740> half

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
I think for Chicago in that second half

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.679 
I think for Chicago in that second half
but<00:01:11.490> they'll<00:01:11.640> take<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.030> they<00:01:12.150> move<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
but they'll take it they move on to the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.700 
but they'll take it they move on to the
final<00:01:13.080> they've<00:01:13.229> been<00:01:13.380> there<00:01:13.470> more<00:01:13.650> than

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
final they've been there more than
