in<00:00:10.120> my<00:00:10.240> last<00:00:10.389> video<00:00:10.660> I<00:00:10.719> did<00:00:10.930> a<00:00:10.960> feature<00:00:11.170> on<00:00:11.320> the

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
in my last video I did a feature on the

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.770 
in my last video I did a feature on the
seismological<00:00:12.010> at<00:00:12.580> door<00:00:12.760> latches<00:00:13.480> that<00:00:13.510> get

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
seismological at door latches that get

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.390 
seismological at door latches that get
automatically<00:00:14.470> activated<00:00:14.950> during<00:00:15.190> an

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
automatically activated during an

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.980 
automatically activated during an
earthquake<00:00:15.550> so<00:00:16.209> when<00:00:16.420> there's<00:00:16.599> lateral

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
earthquake so when there's lateral

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.960 
earthquake so when there's lateral
movement<00:00:17.410> the<00:00:17.800> hooks<00:00:18.040> that<00:00:18.160> are<00:00:18.279> included<00:00:18.760> on

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
movement the hooks that are included on

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.210 
movement the hooks that are included on
these<00:00:19.119> latches<00:00:19.300> will<00:00:19.960> activate<00:00:20.439> and<00:00:20.680> keep<00:00:21.070> the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
these latches will activate and keep the

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.950 
these latches will activate and keep the
good<00:00:21.310> cabinet<00:00:21.669> doors<00:00:21.849> from<00:00:22.090> flying<00:00:22.360> open<00:00:22.779> in

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
good cabinet doors from flying open in

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.540 
good cabinet doors from flying open in
case<00:00:23.290> in<00:00:23.500> America<00:00:23.800> earthquake<00:00:24.189> so<00:00:24.279> having<00:00:24.430> a

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
case in America earthquake so having a

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.800 
case in America earthquake so having a
bunch<00:00:24.700> of<00:00:24.790> flying<00:00:25.000> projectiles<00:00:25.180> coming<00:00:25.599> at

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
bunch of flying projectiles coming at

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.479 
bunch of flying projectiles coming at
you<00:00:25.989> so<00:00:26.410> these<00:00:26.590> latches<00:00:26.800> are<00:00:27.099> designed<00:00:27.369> to

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:27.489 
you so these latches are designed to

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.310 
you so these latches are designed to
protect<00:00:27.610> you<00:00:27.880> from<00:00:28.029> that<00:00:28.270> but<00:00:28.899> there<00:00:29.020> are<00:00:29.050> some

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
protect you from that but there are some

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.720 
protect you from that but there are some
questions<00:00:29.529> regarding<00:00:30.130> well<00:00:30.310> how<00:00:30.430> do<00:00:30.489> you<00:00:30.579> open

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
questions regarding well how do you open

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.010 
questions regarding well how do you open
your<00:00:31.000> cabinet<00:00:31.149> doors<00:00:31.480> once<00:00:31.750> they've<00:00:31.899> been

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
your cabinet doors once they've been

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.300 
your cabinet doors once they've been
activated<00:00:32.349> for<00:00:32.529> example<00:00:32.890> what<00:00:33.010> if<00:00:33.100> both<00:00:33.250> of

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
activated for example what if both of

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.500 
activated for example what if both of
these<00:00:33.520> are<00:00:33.579> activated<00:00:34.120> after<00:00:34.360> an<00:00:34.420> earthquake

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
these are activated after an earthquake

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.389 
these are activated after an earthquake
how<00:00:34.899> would<00:00:35.020> you<00:00:35.079> get<00:00:35.200> back<00:00:35.320> in<00:00:35.530> your<00:00:35.680> doors<00:00:35.860> so

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
how would you get back in your doors so

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:37.410 
how would you get back in your doors so
I<00:00:36.430> just<00:00:36.640> wanted<00:00:36.790> to<00:00:36.880> show<00:00:36.940> you<00:00:36.970> really<00:00:37.210> quick

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
activate this one they see here okay so

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.790 
activate this one they see here okay so
that<00:00:43.390> one's<00:00:43.510> absolutely<00:00:43.900> will<00:00:44.380> pretend<00:00:44.650> that

that one's absolutely will pretend that
this<00:00:44.950> one's<00:00:45.130> also<00:00:45.310> latched<00:00:46.030> as<00:00:46.270> well<00:00:46.420> so<00:00:46.900> when

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
this one's also latched as well so when

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.360 
this one's also latched as well so when
you<00:00:47.110> open<00:00:47.140> it<00:00:47.440> up<00:00:47.560> there's<00:00:47.830> still<00:00:47.890> plenty<00:00:48.190> of

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
you open it up there's still plenty of

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.860 
you open it up there's still plenty of
room<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:49.030> just<00:00:49.180> put<00:00:49.330> your<00:00:49.420> finger<00:00:49.690> in<00:00:49.780> there

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
room to just put your finger in there

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.990 
room to just put your finger in there
and<00:00:50.320> open<00:00:50.470> up<00:00:50.650> their<00:00:50.890> cabinet<00:00:51.220> doors<00:00:51.400> so<00:00:51.880> it's

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
and open up their cabinet doors so it's

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.700 
and open up their cabinet doors so it's
not<00:00:52.120> an<00:00:52.300> issue<00:00:52.450> at<00:00:52.690> all<00:00:52.780> so<00:00:53.260> let<00:00:53.380> me<00:00:53.440> just<00:00:53.620> show

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
not an issue at all so let me just show

not an issue at all so let me just show
you<00:00:53.740> really<00:00:53.920> quick<00:00:54.160> on<00:00:54.280> how<00:00:54.430> long<00:00:54.720> this<00:00:55.720> hook

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
you really quick on how long this hook

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.140 
you really quick on how long this hook
is<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:57.160> as<00:00:57.220> you<00:00:57.340> can<00:00:57.460> see<00:00:57.550> it<00:00:57.670> goes<00:00:57.790> out<00:00:58.000> of<00:00:58.030> a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
is so as you can see it goes out of a

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.460 
is so as you can see it goes out of a
fair<00:00:58.420> amount<00:00:58.750> of<00:00:58.780> distance<00:01:00.540> you<00:01:01.540> sure<00:01:01.750> next<00:01:02.410> to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
fair amount of distance you sure next to

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.690 
fair amount of distance you sure next to
the<00:01:02.560> hook<00:01:02.710> over<00:01:02.890> here<00:01:05.220> okay<00:01:06.220> so<00:01:06.280> unless<00:01:06.549> you

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
the hook over here okay so unless you

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.340 
the hook over here okay so unless you
have<00:01:06.820> really<00:01:07.240> thick<00:01:07.479> cabinet<00:01:07.869> doors<00:01:08.079> like

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
have really thick cabinet doors like

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.870 
have really thick cabinet doors like
that<00:01:08.380> you<00:01:09.159> should<00:01:09.280> have<00:01:09.369> plenty<00:01:09.520> of<00:01:09.700> room<00:01:09.850> to

this
and<00:01:12.159> just<00:01:12.700> push<00:01:13.270> up<00:01:13.420> on<00:01:13.569> it<00:01:13.600> so<00:01:14.109> if<00:01:14.259> there's

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
and just push up on it so if there's

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.050 
and just push up on it so if there's
only<00:01:14.829> if<00:01:15.069> you<00:01:15.159> have<00:01:15.249> thick<00:01:15.429> cabinet<00:01:15.729> doors<00:01:15.880> for

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
only if you have thick cabinet doors for

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.550 
only if you have thick cabinet doors for
example<00:01:16.450> maybe<00:01:17.079> you<00:01:17.170> could<00:01:17.289> just<00:01:17.439> use<00:01:17.530> a

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
example maybe you could just use a

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.809 
example maybe you could just use a
butter<00:01:17.799> knife<00:01:17.890> or<00:01:18.009> something<00:01:18.369> like<00:01:18.429> that<00:01:18.490> so

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:18.819 
butter knife or something like that so

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.830 
butter knife or something like that so
let<00:01:18.969> me<00:01:19.030> just<00:01:19.179> show<00:01:19.299> it<00:01:19.329> one<00:01:19.509> more<00:01:19.539> time<00:01:19.749> so

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
let me just show it one more time so

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.719 
let me just show it one more time so
mister<00:01:22.840> mister<00:01:23.170> actually<00:01:26.340> okay<00:01:29.639> there's<00:01:30.639> an

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
mister mister actually okay there's an

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:31.469 
mister mister actually okay there's an
earthquake

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
earthquake

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.209 
earthquake
now<00:01:31.749> if<00:01:31.810> latched<00:01:32.289> I'll<00:01:32.679> pretend<00:01:32.920> this<00:01:33.039> one's

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
now if latched I'll pretend this one's

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.699 
now if latched I'll pretend this one's
awesome<00:01:33.340> latched<00:01:33.909> so<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:35.289> open<00:01:35.469> this<00:01:35.530> up

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:35.709 
awesome latched so you open this up

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:39.989 
awesome latched so you open this up
plenty<00:01:36.369> of<00:01:36.459> room<00:01:37.770> -<00:01:38.770> open<00:01:39.069> the<00:01:39.249> hook<00:01:39.399> and<00:01:39.700> then

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:39.999 
plenty of room - open the hook and then

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.120 
plenty of room - open the hook and then
your<00:01:40.119> County<00:01:40.359> doors<00:01:40.569> open<00:01:40.929> and<00:01:41.530> that's<00:01:41.829> how

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
your County doors open and that's how

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.539 
your County doors open and that's how
you<00:01:42.789> release<00:01:43.329> the<00:01:43.929> seismic<00:01:44.560> cabinet<00:01:45.369> door

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
you release the seismic cabinet door

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.399 
you release the seismic cabinet door
latches<00:01:45.939> after<00:01:46.389> an<00:01:46.509> earthquake<00:01:46.929> I<00:01:47.139> hope

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
latches after an earthquake I hope

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.129 
that's answered some of your questions
there<00:01:49.179> is<00:01:49.270> also<00:01:49.420> some<00:01:49.630> concerns<00:01:49.959> regarding

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:50.139 
there is also some concerns regarding

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:52.019 
there is also some concerns regarding
this<00:01:50.499> particular<00:01:50.799> cabinet<00:01:51.399> door<00:01:51.579> that<00:01:51.819> has<00:01:51.999> a

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:52.029 
this particular cabinet door that has a

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:54.269 
this particular cabinet door that has a
glass<00:01:52.359> face<00:01:52.689> on<00:01:52.929> it<00:01:53.109> so<00:01:53.529> don't<00:01:53.770> worry<00:01:53.889> in<00:01:54.189> a

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:54.279 
glass face on it so don't worry in a

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:55.649 
glass face on it so don't worry in a
future<00:01:54.579> part<00:01:54.819> I'm<00:01:54.969> going<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.119> be<00:01:55.179> including

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
future part I'm going to be including

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.440 
future part I'm going to be including
ways<00:01:56.319> of<00:01:56.499> protecting<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.880> items<00:01:58.149> in<00:01:58.299> there

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
ways of protecting the items in there

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.999 
ways of protecting the items in there
from<00:01:58.600> crashing<00:01:59.109> through<00:01:59.259> this<00:01:59.439> glass<00:01:59.770> so

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
from crashing through this glass so

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:00.959 
from crashing through this glass so
basically<00:02:00.279> you<00:02:00.399> will<00:02:00.490> just<00:02:00.639> want<00:02:00.789> to<00:02:00.850> lower

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
basically you will just want to lower

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.099 
basically you will just want to lower
the<00:02:01.119> friction<00:02:01.479> on<00:02:01.539> there<00:02:01.689> so<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:01.899> doesn't

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
the friction on there so it doesn't

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.499 
the friction on there so it doesn't
slide<00:02:02.289> and<00:02:02.619> impact<00:02:03.189> it<00:02:03.399> so<00:02:04.060> stay<00:02:04.299> tuned<00:02:04.479> for

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
slide and impact it so stay tuned for

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.510 
slide and impact it so stay tuned for
that<00:02:04.659> in<00:02:04.899> a<00:02:04.959> future<00:02:05.170> video<00:02:05.319> it<00:02:06.099> will<00:02:06.310> be

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
that in a future video it will be

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.890 
that in a future video it will be
covered<00:02:06.729> specific<00:02:07.450> for<00:02:08.440> glass<00:02:08.590> doors
