it's<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.890> straight-up<00:02:09.890> natural<00:02:10.429> way<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:10.640> guess

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
it's a straight-up natural way I guess

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.630 
it's a straight-up natural way I guess
just<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.450> fresh<00:02:11.660> juice<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:13.010> tequila<00:02:13.220> and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
just the fresh juice and the tequila and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.540 
just the fresh juice and the tequila and
all<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.820> good<00:02:13.940> stuff<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:15.110> oftentimes<00:02:15.800> Olay<00:02:16.310> is

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
all the good stuff so oftentimes Olay is

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.610 
all the good stuff so oftentimes Olay is
actually<00:02:17.090> an<00:02:17.240> independent<00:02:17.959> restaurant<00:02:18.410> and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
actually an independent restaurant and

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.260 
actually an independent restaurant and
so<00:02:18.890> pretty<00:02:19.190> much<00:02:19.370> everything<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:19.850> you<00:02:19.940> order

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
so pretty much everything that you order

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.360 
so pretty much everything that you order
here<00:02:20.480> they're<00:02:20.630> gonna<00:02:20.690> make<00:02:20.990> from<00:02:21.230> scratch<00:02:21.650> so

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
here they're gonna make from scratch so

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.280 
here they're gonna make from scratch so
when<00:02:22.700> you're<00:02:22.820> al-qaeda<00:02:23.000> chain<00:02:23.570> most<00:02:24.140> of<00:02:24.230> the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
when you're al-qaeda chain most of the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.770 
when you're al-qaeda chain most of the
times<00:02:24.470> it's<00:02:24.770> hard<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.250> make<00:02:25.459> those<00:02:25.780> exceptions

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
times it's hard to make those exceptions

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.510 
times it's hard to make those exceptions
if<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.320> want<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.560> little<00:02:27.770> bit<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:27.980> this<00:02:28.130> or<00:02:28.340> less

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
if you want a little bit of this or less

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.520 
if you want a little bit of this or less
of<00:02:28.700> that<00:02:28.880> but<00:02:29.420> here<00:02:29.720> they<00:02:29.989> pretty<00:02:30.170> much<00:02:30.320> make

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
of that but here they pretty much make

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.960 
of that but here they pretty much make
everything<00:02:30.830> fresh<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.250> I'm<00:02:31.430> sure<00:02:31.550> they<00:02:31.670> do<00:02:31.730> at

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
everything fresh and I'm sure they do at

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.400 
everything fresh and I'm sure they do at
many<00:02:32.120> other<00:02:32.209> independent<00:02:32.870> restaurants<00:02:33.230> so

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
many other independent restaurants so

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.350 
many other independent restaurants so
most<00:02:33.980> likely<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.370> margaritas<00:02:34.790> are<00:02:35.000> made<00:02:35.209> with

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
most likely the margaritas are made with

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.090 
most likely the margaritas are made with
fresh<00:02:35.390> lime<00:02:35.780> juice<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.020> not<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.500> sour<00:02:36.680> mix<00:02:36.920> so

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
fresh lime juice and not the sour mix so

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.250 
fresh lime juice and not the sour mix so
don't<00:02:37.340> be<00:02:37.430> afraid<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.790> ask<00:02:37.910> some<00:02:38.720> other<00:02:38.870> drinks

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
don't be afraid to ask some other drinks

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.870 
don't be afraid to ask some other drinks

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
too you can get that with the choice of

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.740

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
ask for that on the side so that things

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.060 
ask for that on the side so that things
hide<00:04:31.970> so<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:33.020> seven<00:04:33.289> who<00:04:33.380> looks<00:04:33.560> awesome

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
not knowing what it was because we

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.629

would<00:05:08.759> you<00:05:08.879> do<00:05:09.229> I<00:05:10.229> mean<00:05:10.560> this<00:05:10.710> sandwich<00:05:11.069> looks

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
would you do I mean this sandwich looks

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.179 
would you do I mean this sandwich looks
great<00:05:11.840> just<00:05:12.840> a<00:05:12.960> lot<00:05:13.139> of<00:05:13.259> cheese<00:05:13.469> on<00:05:13.680> it<00:05:13.710> so<00:05:14.159> I

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:14.189 
great just a lot of cheese on it so I

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:15.499 
great just a lot of cheese on it so I
mean<00:05:14.520> I<00:05:14.580> think<00:05:14.699> I<00:05:14.879> would<00:05:15.000> ask<00:05:15.150> those<00:05:15.270> questions

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
mean I think I would ask those questions

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:16.909 
mean I think I would ask those questions
and<00:05:15.960> if<00:05:16.020> they<00:05:16.080> could<00:05:16.229> light<00:05:16.590> on<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.770> cheese

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
and if they could light on the cheese

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:17.689 
and if they could light on the cheese
that<00:05:17.099> would<00:05:17.189> be<00:05:17.310> great

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
that would be great

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.029 
that would be great
usually<00:05:18.419> a<00:05:18.449> little<00:05:18.569> cheese<00:05:18.960> goes<00:05:19.169> a<00:05:19.199> long<00:05:19.379> way

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
usually a little cheese goes a long way

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.469 
usually a little cheese goes a long way
in<00:05:20.310> this<00:05:20.430> sandwich<00:05:20.729> it<00:05:20.909> looks<00:05:21.060> like<00:05:21.180> it's<00:05:21.330> on<00:05:21.449> a

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
in this sandwich it looks like it's on a

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.249 
in this sandwich it looks like it's on a
white<00:05:21.930> fun<00:05:22.590> so<00:05:23.400> maybe<00:05:23.789> I<00:05:23.909> would<00:05:24.150> just<00:05:24.449> eat<00:05:24.599> half

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
white fun so maybe I would just eat half

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.700 
white fun so maybe I would just eat half
of<00:05:25.409> it<00:05:25.560> and<00:05:26.400> maybe<00:05:26.580> nix<00:05:27.449> one<00:05:27.900> half<00:05:28.080> fix<00:05:28.379> it<00:05:28.590> has

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
of it and maybe nix one half fix it has

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.800 
of it and maybe nix one half fix it has
all<00:05:28.830> those<00:05:28.949> refined<00:05:29.340> carbs<00:05:29.759> and<00:05:29.969> enough<00:05:30.599> fiber

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
all those refined carbs and enough fiber

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.950 
all those refined carbs and enough fiber
and<00:05:31.939> the<00:05:32.939> one<00:05:33.090> good<00:05:33.240> thing<00:05:33.300> though<00:05:33.599> about<00:05:33.629> it

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
and the one good thing though about it

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.659 
and the one good thing though about it
being<00:05:34.110> a<00:05:34.409> independent<00:05:35.129> restaurant<00:05:35.460> is<00:05:35.520> that<00:05:35.610> a

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
being a independent restaurant is that a

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.300 
being a independent restaurant is that a
lot<00:05:35.819> of<00:05:35.909> times<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.590> tortillas<00:05:37.590> and<00:05:37.949> the<00:05:38.009> bread

and even if the chips are homemade they

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.029 
and even if the chips are homemade they
don't<00:05:40.080> have<00:05:40.229> any<00:05:40.349> of<00:05:40.469> those<00:05:40.530> artificial
