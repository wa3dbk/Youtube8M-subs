00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.170
 at anja for this temple blog.de I have 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.119
 me just the phone xperia z1 of sony 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.980
 get borrowed and in this video 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.439
 Let's have a look at the camera features 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.640
 take a closer look because the camera has 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.390
 here on the backside you can 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.230
 I think I read 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.450
 a 20 7 megapixel resolution is so 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.070
 a pretty good camera and we want 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.349
 Just start here 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.760
 See how it wants here and now 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.719
 I'll give you the different features 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.770
 show the one here with the camera 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.480
 Of course, one can completely choose 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.100
 take normal photos over the camera 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.480
 button 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.620
 that's us here you can go again 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.870
 Of course you can switch 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.880
 exactly adjust the size and so on 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.720
 but what we especially and now 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.850
 want to watch 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.920
 namely to the hand 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.660
 the features available here, the 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.760
 on the press on the 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.770
 bakken here you have seen and there 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.440
 Can you do a number of projects 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.449
 select once superior automatic 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.939
 sony then presents himself 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.880
 how exactly the camera button set 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.929
 It should be the perfect picture 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.310
 that comes out 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:13.479
 mostly very good, but you can also 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.490
 choose manually 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.740
 because you can just manually select everything 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.689
 quite interesting is the timeshift 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.819
 sequence that we now set 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.750
 we already know a similar function 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:26.370
 from samsung 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.350
 and if we are looking for selected now 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.000
 just press on the picture 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.250
 and then you move that way 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.040
 little bit there and there we can now 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.020
 that's why before and after inside 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.650
 one second each 30 pictures 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.390
 recorded 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.979
 Well, come on now, adjust that to me 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.720
 up here that's not a mission statement 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.430
 pictures taken can 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.110
 Now select exactly which image that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.390
 best of all is that's special of course 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.070
 handy if you are a child, for example 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.260
 photographed and you want exactly that 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.060
 point missing where it smiled for it 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.190
 is that, for example, well suited 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.020
 or if you wobble a bit 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.330
 and want to have a picture next to it 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.280
 does not look blurry for that 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.290
 this timeshift feature works well with it 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.600
 Got the perfect picture 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.800
 you simply also okay that's a 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.989
 the functions of the Sony Nex camera go 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.870
 we have here with the Jews so rather 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.310
 effect that is rather a bauble and 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.860
 not quite as convenient as you can 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.320
 namely select 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.930
 What kind of effects do you want? 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.930
 this time around and just pick from dry 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.200
 am replaced and that should be such a 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.360
 look a little bit like when you're under 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.489
 water and bread right there you can see here 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.050
 and then I can also train 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.290
 press the button and then it will turn on 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.030
 corresponding picture taken 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.590
 as I said, it's more of a bauble 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.959
 There are different packs here 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.519
 can choose 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.790
 for example, that you have dinosaurs 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.000
 which then run through the picture or here 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.349
 again the fish when good 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.750
 as I said, the gimmick but one 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.360
 very nice effect we still have 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.950
 we also have hanno swivel panorama 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.970
 so you can just a panoramic picture 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.610
 make that out of here, too 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.370
 and that works like anyone rama 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.810
 function 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.610
 Just click here and then 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.970
 we just have to pan is gone 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.989
 here with both cameras along and then 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.360
 we will be done that 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.360
 panoramic picture opened and we can 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.400
 looking at us then is a nice one 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.660
 panorama picture go again 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.940
 back 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.390
 and pick another effect out of it 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.710
 There are still image effects because you have just 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.490
 different functions we to 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:41.190
 example from instagram and so on 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.810
 know different effects socialite 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.470
 there is still one with it one can 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.140
 livestream with facebook gets it 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.510
 on facebook a link is displayed and can 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.400
 then something livestream what ever you 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.290
 want to pass him is still interesting 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.480
 we can not do that now 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.060
 just try this is different to her 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.550
 be from the eiffel tower in paris 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.200
 click on info to become one 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.400
 couple provides information on 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.250
 eiffel tower is displayed 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.590
 Finally, we gdf the google 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.660

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.250
 Camera function of the onyx already since 1 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.910
