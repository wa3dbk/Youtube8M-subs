 and we talked 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.120
 to me 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.890
 What's up with kids here General I 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.020
 I bring a trick hunted for the call of 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.039
 duty dishes 2 for the zombie mode in the 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.200
 mod map 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.090
 and this trick discovered it and I swam 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.710
 more and nothing less than me team alicante 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.779

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.290
 see and of sniper that are with me the 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:35.379
 game and so on and nothing is a trick hunted 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.550
 that we have discovered and nothing here what 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.090
 I bring for this trick will you need 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.969
 minimum two people and it's a trick to 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.730
 both 2 3 and 4 players for this 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.999
 trick comes I will recommend you that you 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.159
 do the tomahawk and the good thing about 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:53.260
 this trick is that all the players 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.670
 can shoot the zombies even me 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.649
 that I am the one who is doing the trick 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.379
 well that even that gets into the trick 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.519
 can it's also for the zombies to 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.670
 they have to come here to the first 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.470
 dog you look right here at the 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.850
 first cell there is nothing else to enter and 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.760
 later with the day they were made 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.890
 looking towards the corner of the couple and 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.360
 just like I do in the video then 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.729
 to reanimate what you have to do is 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.040
 come running running you're going to 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.600
 see or you can also go to the roof as 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.920
 I've done 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.689
 the last videos that I leave the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.540
 description the other way issues 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.979
 it's better because here here is 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.930
 what you should do is jump hit 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.479
 jumps until you see that I put the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.369
 X to climb once I put you x 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.689
 to climb what you have to do is 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.210
 stay still and wait for 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:42.329
 our your friends tell you d 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.680
 encourage you to be revived we are just 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.689
 you have already seen the video where it is or not 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.399
 Juan just when they start to revive 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.439
 and where does he put such a person is 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.270
 reviving when that starts to 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.460
 disappear when you have to give it two 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.549
 times to the X the first to paste 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.049
 the jump and the second to climb 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.439
 then what we will do is that at 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.240
 revive leaves us right here worth here what 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.420
 what we will achieve is to nail real 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.560
 stay right down this is a double trick 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.690
 we will get the barrier to be in the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.040
 downstairs and our classmates are 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.170
 They can be placed next to the 23-f 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.870
 without opening the door very important that 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.549
 door does not have to open the second 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.080
 trick from this would be to paste a 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.670
 jump or give the Xs once 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.959
 we are halfway and what we are going to 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.060
 get is that the barrier goes from 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.790
 be down to the top that is a lot 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.160
 better because being below the one that is 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.870
 in trick you do not see the zombies but you see the 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.760
 give him the X, we will go up and if you look 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.920
 the zombie goes from being down to up 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.150
 up then then we will get 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.100
 have it in front and you can shoot 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.810
 we also the trick 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.300
 our colleagues see where they are put 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.250
 in this case next to the dog and what 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.780
 what we are going to achieve will be to kill 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.400
 the zombies very easily among the 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.870
 four so I do not expect anything that has 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.540
 liked this great discovery that 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.820
 we have made deep line favorites 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.720
 subscribe they take out if you are not so 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.720
 until next time
