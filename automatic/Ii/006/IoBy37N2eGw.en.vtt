00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.360 

so<00:00:08.170> what<00:00:08.980> I'm<00:00:09.100> trying<00:00:09.340> to<00:00:09.370> do<00:00:09.520> here<00:00:09.820> is<00:00:11.370> time

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.370 
so what I'm trying to do here is time

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.730 
so what I'm trying to do here is time
the<00:00:12.670> spark

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
the spark

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.679 
the spark
the<00:00:13.830> purpose<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.250> taking<00:00:14.490> off<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.790> cover<00:00:16.460> is

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
the purpose of taking off this cover is

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.260 
the purpose of taking off this cover is
so<00:00:18.689> that<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.960> can<00:00:18.990> adjust<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.680> timing<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.369> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
so that I can adjust the timing of the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.760 
so that I can adjust the timing of the
points<00:00:21.689> points

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
points points

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.990 
points points
they<00:00:23.070> actually<00:00:23.750> it<00:00:24.750> causes<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.880> condenser<00:00:26.880> to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
they actually it causes the condenser to

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.819 
they actually it causes the condenser to
sort<00:00:27.270> of<00:00:27.330> freak<00:00:27.539> out<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.900> deliver<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.320> burst<00:00:28.680> of

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
sort of freak out and deliver a burst of

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.310 
sort of freak out and deliver a burst of
electricity<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.630> that<00:00:30.630> goes<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.080> coil

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
electricity and that goes to the coil

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.770 
electricity and that goes to the coil
which<00:00:31.650> magnifies<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> voltage<00:00:32.580> a<00:00:32.669> lot<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
which magnifies the voltage a lot and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.880 
which magnifies the voltage a lot and
then<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.410> goes<00:00:34.650> to<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.949> spark<00:00:35.220> plug<00:00:35.460> and

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
then that goes to the spark plug and

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.520 
then that goes to the spark plug and
fires<00:00:37.890> off<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.220> spark<00:00:39.019> as<00:00:40.019> always<00:00:40.350> it's

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
fires off the spark as always it's

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.220 
fires off the spark as always it's
useful<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.400> check<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.449> with<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.720> trusty<00:00:43.110> dusty

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
useful to check in with the trusty dusty

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.590 
useful to check in with the trusty dusty
manual<00:00:43.769> as<00:00:44.430> far<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:44.610> confirming<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.420> have

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
manual as far as confirming that I have

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.810 
manual as far as confirming that I have
the<00:00:45.720> right<00:00:45.870> process<00:00:46.140> because<00:00:47.010> if<00:00:47.519> you<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.699> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the right process because if you do it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.840 
the right process because if you do it
wrong<00:00:48.000> you'll<00:00:48.989> blow<00:00:49.110> things<00:00:49.320> up<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.640> just

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
wrong you'll blow things up this is just

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.880 
wrong you'll blow things up this is just
a<00:00:50.940> multimeter<00:00:51.330> it's<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.260> my<00:00:52.440> own<00:00:52.559> we'll<00:00:52.710> set

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
a multimeter it's at my own we'll set

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.009 
a multimeter it's at my own we'll set
this<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:54.589> beeping<00:00:55.589> mode<00:00:56.479> so<00:00:57.479> the<00:00:57.659> the

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
this to the beeping mode so the the

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.200 
this to the beeping mode so the the
breaker<00:00:58.920> points<00:00:59.129> are<00:00:59.339> no<00:00:59.430> longer<00:00:59.670> touching<00:01:00.000> at

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
breaker points are no longer touching at

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.729 
breaker points are no longer touching at
this<00:01:00.330> point<00:01:01.790> now<00:01:02.790> they're<00:01:03.000> touching

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
this point now they're touching

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.410 
this point now they're touching
and<00:01:04.920> they<00:01:05.040> break<00:01:05.370> right<00:01:07.640> there<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.940> little<00:01:09.119> tiny

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and they break right there a little tiny

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.200 
and they break right there a little tiny
bit<00:01:09.630> late<00:01:09.840> okay<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:11.190> what<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.520> should<00:01:11.700> hear<00:01:11.970> is

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
bit late okay so what we should hear is

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.410 
bit late okay so what we should hear is
beeping<00:01:12.920> when<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.250> line<00:01:14.580> passes<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.390> front

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
beeping when this line passes in front

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.590 
beeping when this line passes in front
of<00:01:15.690> this<00:01:15.750> pointer<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:18.000> there's<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.300> beeping

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
of this pointer so there's the beeping

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.010 
of this pointer so there's the beeping
so<00:01:19.320> now<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.920> must<00:01:20.070> see<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:21.090> when<00:01:21.720> this

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
so now what we must see is when this

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.389 
so now what we must see is when this
mark<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.830> second<00:01:23.250> mark<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:24.680> passes<00:01:25.680> this

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
mark the second mark here passes this

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.280 
mark the second mark here passes this
pointer<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.270> there's<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.750> line<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.170> center

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
pointer and there's a line in the center

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.499 
pointer and there's a line in the center
of<00:01:28.440> that<00:01:28.530> pointer<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.940> beating<00:01:30.300> should

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
of that pointer and that beating should

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.880 
of that pointer and that beating should
stop

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.160 

it<00:01:36.890> pretty<00:01:37.070> much<00:01:37.160> does<00:01:37.460> it's<00:01:37.670> really<00:01:37.730> close

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
it pretty much does it's really close

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.570 
it pretty much does it's really close
close<00:01:39.170> enough<00:01:39.440> that<00:01:39.680> I<00:01:39.890> think<00:01:40.160> I'm<00:01:40.250> not<00:01:40.400> going

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
close enough that I think I'm not going

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.500 
close enough that I think I'm not going
to<00:01:40.640> worry<00:01:40.760> about<00:01:40.820> it<00:01:42.220> so<00:01:43.220> that<00:01:43.910> explains<00:01:44.210> at

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
to worry about it so that explains at

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.760 
to worry about it so that explains at
least<00:01:44.690> partly<00:01:44.990> why<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.260> engine<00:01:45.590> was<00:01:45.740> running

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
least partly why the engine was running

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.580 
least partly why the engine was running
so<00:01:46.130> well<00:01:46.310> before<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:47.390> even<00:01:47.690> bought<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:48.080> bike<00:01:48.260> I

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
so well before I even bought the bike I

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.310 
so well before I even bought the bike I
went<00:01:49.100> on<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.310> do<00:01:49.400> eBay<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.420> I<00:01:50.510> just<00:01:50.750> looked<00:01:50.990> let

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
went on to do eBay and I just looked let

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.210 
went on to do eBay and I just looked let
me<00:01:51.410> see<00:01:51.560> how<00:01:51.619> 175<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.460> see<00:01:52.580> what<00:01:52.729> was<00:01:52.820> available

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
me see how 175 to see what was available

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.730 
me see how 175 to see what was available
then<00:01:55.220> after<00:01:55.460> I<00:01:55.490> got<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.910> bike<00:01:56.030> I<00:01:56.590> just<00:01:57.590> kind<00:01:57.710> of

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
then after I got the bike I just kind of

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.960 
then after I got the bike I just kind of
went<00:01:57.920> through<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.220> started<00:01:58.490> buying<00:01:58.640> stuff

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
went through and started buying stuff

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.570 
went through and started buying stuff
and<00:01:59.450> what<00:02:00.440> was<00:02:00.560> cool<00:02:00.710> about<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:01.010> is<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.369> it

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
and what was cool about that is that it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.790 
and what was cool about that is that it
all<00:02:01.700> pretty<00:02:01.940> much<00:02:02.090> arrived<00:02:02.420> in<00:02:02.540> one<00:02:02.780> day<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:03.680> on

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
all pretty much arrived in one day so on

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.850 
all pretty much arrived in one day so on
one<00:02:03.979> day<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.160> got<00:02:04.400> all<00:02:04.580> of<00:02:04.729> this<00:02:04.820> this<00:02:05.180> huge<00:02:05.860> pile

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
one day I got all of this this huge pile

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.460 
one day I got all of this this huge pile
of<00:02:06.890> stuff<00:02:07.340> in<00:02:08.320> so<00:02:09.320> I<00:02:09.350> just<00:02:09.440> came<00:02:09.739> to<00:02:09.860> work<00:02:10.009> and

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
of stuff in so I just came to work and

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.900 
of stuff in so I just came to work and
saw<00:02:12.470> that<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:12.680> had<00:02:12.890> some<00:02:13.160> packages<00:02:15.730> also<00:02:16.730> that

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
saw that I had some packages also that

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.360 
saw that I had some packages also that
one<00:02:17.090> there<00:02:17.390> which<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.870> probably<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.260> shocks

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.880 

come<00:02:23.030> on<00:02:23.239> it's<00:02:23.930> like<00:02:24.080> Christmas

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.670 

who<00:02:29.400> shiny<00:02:30.360> new<00:02:30.570> levers

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.570 

Oh

project<00:03:49.800> that<00:03:49.890> I'm<00:03:50.010> actually<00:03:50.160> pretty<00:03:50.400> excited

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
project that I'm actually pretty excited

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.320 
project that I'm actually pretty excited
about<00:03:51.950> well<00:03:52.950> nothing<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.580> ever<00:03:53.760> too<00:03:54.000> easy<00:03:54.290> so<00:03:55.290> I

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
about well nothing is ever too easy so I

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.370 
about well nothing is ever too easy so I
pulled<00:03:57.330> off<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.720> old<00:03:57.840> one<00:03:58.430> took<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.489> new<00:03:59.700> one

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
pulled off the old one took the new one

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.070 
pulled off the old one took the new one
slipped<00:04:01.380> it<00:04:01.500> on<00:04:01.620> there<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.310> basically<00:04:02.700> fits

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
slipped it on there it basically fits

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.790 
slipped it on there it basically fits
but<00:04:04.080> I<00:04:04.880> like<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:05.910> top<00:04:06.330> it's<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.230> different<00:04:07.590> size

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
but I like a top it's a different size

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.460 
but I like a top it's a different size
as<00:04:08.370> when<00:04:08.790> they<00:04:08.910> sent<00:04:09.300> it<00:04:09.510> they<00:04:09.900> sent<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.320> with<00:04:10.410> a

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
as when they sent it they sent it with a

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.670 
as when they sent it they sent it with a
couple<00:04:10.709> of<00:04:10.890> spacer<00:04:11.280> bushings<00:04:11.700> which<00:04:12.680> are

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
couple of spacer bushings which are

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.960 
couple of spacer bushings which are
exactly<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.280> wrong<00:04:14.459> size

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
exactly the wrong size

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.360 
exactly the wrong size
so<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.780> spacer<00:04:16.140> bushings<00:04:16.470> are<00:04:16.859> completely

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
so the spacer bushings are completely

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.090 
so the spacer bushings are completely
useless<00:04:18.230> they're<00:04:19.230> neat<00:04:19.380> they<00:04:19.590> look<00:04:19.739> good<00:04:19.890> but

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
useless they're neat they look good but

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.620 
useless they're neat they look good but
they're<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.430> wrong<00:04:20.549> thing<00:04:20.790> and<00:04:21.390> I'm<00:04:21.510> gonna

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
they're the wrong thing and I'm gonna

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.620 
they're the wrong thing and I'm gonna
have<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:21.870> find<00:04:22.230> a<00:04:22.740> bolt<00:04:23.669> that<00:04:23.970> fits<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.650> lower

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
have to find a bolt that fits the lower

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.590 
have to find a bolt that fits the lower
fork<00:04:27.630> there<00:04:27.960> it's<00:04:28.800> like<00:04:28.890> it's<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.130> good<00:04:29.280> thing

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
fork there it's like it's a good thing

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.490 
fork there it's like it's a good thing

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
the first thing is the brake lever or

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.330 
the first thing is the brake lever or
the<00:04:46.020> excuse<00:04:46.350> me<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.590> clutch<00:04:46.800> lever<00:04:47.070> that<00:04:47.220> I

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
the excuse me the clutch lever that I

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.850 
the excuse me the clutch lever that I
got<00:04:47.600> doesn't<00:04:48.600> fit<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.290> this<00:04:49.470> is<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.710> old

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
got doesn't fit so this is the old

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.730 
got doesn't fit so this is the old
clutch<00:04:50.220> lever<00:04:50.460> now<00:04:51.560> turns<00:04:52.560> out<00:04:53.750> that<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:55.080> the

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
clutch lever now turns out that the the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.820 
clutch lever now turns out that the the
new<00:04:56.400> clutch<00:04:56.670> lever<00:04:56.910> here<00:04:57.290> that<00:04:58.290> pivot<00:04:58.680> hole

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
new clutch lever here that pivot hole

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.220 
new clutch lever here that pivot hole
that<00:04:59.010> you<00:04:59.100> can<00:04:59.250> see<00:04:59.490> is<00:04:59.640> too<00:04:59.880> small<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:00.900> the

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
that you can see is too small so the

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.010 
that you can see is too small so the
next<00:05:01.470> thing<00:05:01.830> was<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:03.560> brake<00:05:04.560> cable<00:05:04.830> here<00:05:05.310> is

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
next thing was the brake cable here is

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.480 
next thing was the brake cable here is
you<00:05:07.020> can<00:05:07.170> see<00:05:07.380> kind<00:05:07.530> of<00:05:07.680> poking<00:05:07.980> up<00:05:08.100> it's

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
you can see kind of poking up it's

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.770 
you can see kind of poking up it's
really<00:05:08.730> long<00:05:09.890> and<00:05:11.210> since<00:05:12.210> I<00:05:12.330> don't<00:05:12.390> actually

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.340 
really long and since I don't actually
have<00:05:13.020> a<00:05:14.000> break<00:05:15.000> right<00:05:15.330> now<00:05:15.360> I<00:05:15.540> will<00:05:15.990> tomorrow

the end here work is gonna work I think
it<00:05:22.080> will<00:05:22.230> but<00:05:22.800> I'm<00:05:23.460> not<00:05:23.700> positive<00:05:23.880> and<00:05:24.300> that's

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
it will but I'm not positive and that's

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.380 
it will but I'm not positive and that's
a<00:05:24.780> little<00:05:24.930> bit<00:05:25.080> worrying<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:29.280> clutch<00:05:30.000> cable

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
a little bit worrying the clutch cable

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.740 
a little bit worrying the clutch cable
itself<00:05:31.140> when<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:32.180> when<00:05:33.180> I<00:05:33.210> installed<00:05:33.630> the

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
itself when I when I installed the

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.820 
itself when I when I installed the
clutch<00:05:33.930> cable<00:05:34.170> here<00:05:36.230> you<00:05:37.230> should<00:05:37.470> be<00:05:37.590> able<00:05:37.680> to

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
clutch cable here you should be able to

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.200 
clutch cable here you should be able to
see<00:05:37.980> a<00:05:38.010> little<00:05:38.190> bit<00:05:38.340> of<00:05:38.460> free<00:05:38.640> play<00:05:38.790> I'm

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
see a little bit of free play I'm

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.120 
see a little bit of free play I'm
pressing<00:05:39.660> on<00:05:39.720> that<00:05:39.930> on<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:40.680> clutch<00:05:40.890> lever

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
pressing on that on the clutch lever

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.530 
pressing on that on the clutch lever
right<00:05:41.310> now<00:05:41.490> you<00:05:41.550> should<00:05:41.790> see<00:05:41.940> some<00:05:42.120> free<00:05:42.360> play

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
right now you should see some free play

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.450 
right now you should see some free play
right<00:05:42.750> here<00:05:42.780> it<00:05:43.710> should<00:05:43.920> just<00:05:44.100> have<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.280> little

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
right here it should just have a little

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.180 
right here it should just have a little
it<00:05:44.850> should<00:05:45.030> just<00:05:45.210> move<00:05:45.360> like<00:05:45.770> you<00:05:46.770> know<00:05:46.890> about

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
it should just move like you know about

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.360 
it should just move like you know about
that<00:05:47.430> much<00:05:47.670> freely<00:05:48.450> and<00:05:48.540> easily<00:05:48.660> and<00:05:49.370> since

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
that much freely and easily and since

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.180 
that much freely and easily and since
it's<00:05:50.520> not<00:05:50.700> that<00:05:51.150> means<00:05:51.390> that<00:05:51.660> the<00:05:52.190> clutch

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
it's not that means that the clutch

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.980 
it's not that means that the clutch
cable<00:05:53.640> is<00:05:54.630> actually<00:05:55.170> too<00:05:55.410> tight<00:05:55.740> and<00:05:56.340> so<00:05:56.990> the

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
cable is actually too tight and so the

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.170 
cable is actually too tight and so the
cable<00:05:58.440> length<00:05:58.620> or<00:05:59.040> the<00:05:59.310> housing<00:05:59.700> length<00:05:59.910> more

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
cable length or the housing length more

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.050 
cable length or the housing length more
precisely<00:06:00.570> is<00:06:01.320> too<00:06:01.680> long<00:06:02.070> the<00:06:02.640> cable<00:06:02.970> length

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
precisely is too long the cable length

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.340 
precisely is too long the cable length
is<00:06:03.270> a<00:06:03.300> little<00:06:03.390> bit<00:06:03.690> too<00:06:03.810> short<00:06:03.840> for<00:06:04.140> the

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
is a little bit too short for the

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.520 
is a little bit too short for the
housing<00:06:04.740> and<00:06:05.310> so<00:06:06.120> there's<00:06:06.690> not<00:06:06.960> enough<00:06:07.200> free

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
housing and so there's not enough free

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.580 
housing and so there's not enough free
play<00:06:08.510> which<00:06:09.510> means<00:06:09.540> that<00:06:10.080> the<00:06:10.170> clutch<00:06:10.410> is

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
play which means that the clutch is

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.090 
play which means that the clutch is
probably<00:06:11.070> slightly<00:06:11.340> engaged<00:06:13.070> or<00:06:14.070> disengaged

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
probably slightly engaged or disengaged

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.680 
probably slightly engaged or disengaged
however<00:06:15.000> you<00:06:15.060> want<00:06:15.180> to<00:06:15.240> phrase<00:06:15.480> it

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
however you want to phrase it

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.710 
however you want to phrase it
so<00:06:16.170> that's<00:06:16.380> frustrating<00:06:16.980> and<00:06:17.730> the<00:06:17.850> reason<00:06:18.270> the

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
so that's frustrating and the reason the

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.930 
so that's frustrating and the reason the
clutch<00:06:18.960> cable<00:06:19.170> doesn't<00:06:19.470> quite<00:06:19.740> fit<00:06:20.070> is<00:06:20.310> that's

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
clutch cable doesn't quite fit is that's

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.780 
clutch cable doesn't quite fit is that's
a<00:06:21.090> co<00:06:22.020> 160<00:06:22.950> clutch<00:06:23.220> cable<00:06:23.460> not<00:06:23.790> a<00:06:23.820> CL<00:06:24.150> 175<00:06:25.790> so

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
a co 160 clutch cable not a CL 175 so

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:36.420 
a co 160 clutch cable not a CL 175 so
it's<00:06:27.420> actually<00:06:27.780> for<00:06:27.930> a<00:06:27.960> different<00:06:28.260> bike

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.000 

they've<00:06:37.430> designed<00:06:37.790> just<00:06:38.150> for<00:06:38.300> me<00:06:38.600> it's<00:06:39.500> Altair

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.010 
they've designed just for me it's Altair

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.370 
they've designed just for me it's Altair
