let's just go over some details about

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.230 
let's just go over some details about
what<00:00:16.750> it<00:00:16.869> is<00:00:16.990> so<00:00:17.230> it<00:00:17.410> comes<00:00:17.650> in<00:00:17.860> at<00:00:17.980> 12<00:00:18.280> point<00:00:18.730> 6

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
what it is so it comes in at 12 point 6

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.960 
what it is so it comes in at 12 point 6
megabytes<00:00:19.630> so<00:00:19.929> it's<00:00:20.080> very<00:00:20.439> very<00:00:20.590> small<00:00:21.099> and<00:00:21.340> as

we're not we no one really knows for

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.619 
we're not we no one really knows for
sure<00:00:51.370> how<00:00:51.670> long<00:00:51.820> it's<00:00:52.000> going<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.180> take<00:00:52.270> but

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
sure how long it's going to take but

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.930

that's<00:00:53.260> it's<00:00:53.770> a<00:00:53.859> very<00:00:54.070> small<00:00:54.190> update<00:00:54.609> in

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
that's it's a very small update in

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.020 
that's it's a very small update in
itself<00:00:55.359> it's<00:00:55.989> gonna<00:00:56.230> it's<00:00:56.559> gonna<00:00:56.710> have

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
itself it's gonna it's gonna have

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.189 
itself it's gonna it's gonna have
basically<00:00:58.030> what<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.420> op<00:00:58.480> de<00:00:58.660> does<00:00:58.840> it<00:00:59.019> it's

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
basically what the op de does it it's

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.540 
basically what the op de does it it's
going<00:00:59.320> to<00:00:59.410> improve<00:00:59.500> performance<00:01:00.190> and

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
going to improve performance and

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.759 
going to improve performance and
responsiveness<00:01:01.329> around<00:01:01.929> the<00:01:02.079> entire<00:01:02.350> system

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
responsiveness around the entire system

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.830 
responsiveness around the entire system
that's<00:01:03.160> exactly<00:01:03.609> what<00:01:03.820> google<00:01:04.180> says<00:01:04.420> or

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
that's exactly what google says or

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.870 
that's exactly what google says or
that's<00:01:04.989> exactly<00:01:05.379> what<00:01:05.560> android<00:01:06.040> central<00:01:06.640> said

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
that's exactly what android central said

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.940 
that's exactly what android central said
and<00:01:07.150> apparently<00:01:07.869> i<00:01:08.110> think<00:01:08.380> they<00:01:08.530> got<00:01:08.710> it<00:01:08.770> from

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
and apparently i think they got it from

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.770 
and apparently i think they got it from
the<00:01:09.189> code<00:01:09.490> or<00:01:09.729> something<00:01:09.880> like<00:01:10.150> that<00:01:10.210> that<00:01:10.390> was

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
the code or something like that that was

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.950 
the code or something like that that was
404<00:01:11.650> over<00:01:11.799> 1.1<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:12.640> there's<00:01:13.180> also<00:01:13.420> adding

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
404 over 1.1 and there's also adding

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.320 
404 over 1.1 and there's also adding
Google<00:01:14.890> Wallet<00:01:15.009> to<00:01:15.340> your<00:01:15.460> app<00:01:15.640> lab<00:01:15.909> or<00:01:16.119> library

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
Google Wallet to your app lab or library

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.330 
Google Wallet to your app lab or library
so<00:01:16.840> you'll<00:01:17.140> be<00:01:17.259> seeing<00:01:17.650> that<00:01:17.830> when<00:01:18.040> you<00:01:18.130> get

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
so you'll be seeing that when you get

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.340 
so you'll be seeing that when you get
four<00:01:18.670> point<00:01:18.909> one<00:01:19.000> point<00:01:19.180> one<00:01:19.720> so<00:01:20.140> that's

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
four point one point one so that's

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.890 
four point one point one so that's
basically<00:01:20.560> it<00:01:20.950> just<00:01:21.100> a<00:01:21.490> lot<00:01:21.640> like<00:01:22.180> performance

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
basically it just a lot like performance

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.289 
basically it just a lot like performance
tweaks<00:01:23.140> here<00:01:23.439> and<00:01:23.500> there<00:01:24.299> responsiveness

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
tweaks here and there responsiveness

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.999 
tweaks here and there responsiveness
stuff<00:01:25.659> like<00:01:25.810> that<00:01:25.840> it's<00:01:26.140> already<00:01:26.500> running<00:01:26.860> on

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
stuff like that it's already running on

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.740 
stuff like that it's already running on
project<00:01:27.490> butter<00:01:27.700> or<00:01:27.939> whatever<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.329> system

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
project butter or whatever that system

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.990 
project butter or whatever that system
google<00:01:29.110> calls<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.530> very<00:01:30.040> smooth<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:30.640> slick

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
google calls it very smooth and slick

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.580 
google calls it very smooth and slick
and<00:01:31.180> now<00:01:31.270> apparently<00:01:31.750> they're<00:01:31.960> upgrading<00:01:32.229> a

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
and now apparently they're upgrading a

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.560 
and now apparently they're upgrading a
bit<00:01:32.799> more<00:01:32.950> just<00:01:33.189> to<00:01:33.340> make<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.640> bit<00:01:33.820> better<00:01:34.270> i

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
bit more just to make it a bit better i

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.109 
bit more just to make it a bit better i
guess<00:01:35.049> anyways<00:01:35.860> this<00:01:35.979> is<00:01:36.040> um<00:01:36.430> probably<00:01:36.909> gonna

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
guess anyways this is um probably gonna

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.850 
guess anyways this is um probably gonna
be<00:01:37.270> making<00:01:37.659> its<00:01:37.780> way<00:01:37.840> over<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.380> Galaxy

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
be making its way over to the Galaxy

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.889 
be making its way over to the Galaxy
Nexus<00:01:39.009> soon<00:01:39.399> as<00:01:39.579> well<00:01:39.759> but<00:01:39.970> as<00:01:40.180> far<00:01:40.479> as<00:01:40.540> I<00:01:40.840> know
