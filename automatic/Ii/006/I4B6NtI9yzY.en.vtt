00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.180
 hello very good to all and welcome to the 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.469
 channel of aysÃ©n 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.639
 I am being that you can follow me in 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.440
 twitter through my account that you the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.820
 I leave here below good today I'm going to 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.539
 talk about two cydia tweets that are 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.670
 for ios 5 and that are for the screen 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.560
 blocking the first tweet is called torch 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.080
 is available in the repository of 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.510
 mods my eye and it's completely free 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.789
 when we install torch, we go 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.189
 adjustments we look for torch that will appear 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.379
 here and here we can configure it 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.120
 we can disable it activate it 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.520
 we can change the icon it's worth to us 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.649
 will appear in the screen block or even 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.390
 We can add compatibility with others 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.960
 tweets like about the fai block or 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.610
 forecast or with ls cons is worth nothing else 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.320
 has nothing else is very simple and I'm going 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.239
 to teach how it works simply we 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.760
 let's go to the lock screen it's worth and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.950
 as you see we see a new incognito 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.739
 so that this one here that when 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.410
 we press the led lights up and when 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.640
 we press again sorry 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.640
 the led turns off 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.930
 of agreement is very simple and it works 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.650
 very well 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.290
 well the next tweet is called your blog 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.940
 and it's to change the animation of 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.650
 unlocking the lock screen 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.770
 as you see here I have an animation 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.600
 different I removed the slider and added 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.370
 an animation in plan then nothing that is 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.650
 as if you had a page 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.810
 well this tweet is available in the 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.910
 mod my eye repository and this one yes that 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.770
 payment is worth about 99 cents 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.990
 euros 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.409
 and nothing to configure it we go to the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.579
 adjustments again we go to your blog 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.429
 from here we can deactivate what is going to 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.649
 activate we can hide the slider 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.409
 as you see in this option here is worth 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.149
 It is now the visible slider but good 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.790
 I prefer to have it from its hidden occult 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.980
 sorry 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.320
 for good to enjoy a 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.570
 little bit more of the new animation 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.120
 we can hide the clock from what 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.380
 screen which I do not like because I 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.870
 I like to see work on the screen 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.280
 lock or we can show the status more 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.280
 the clock in the status bar 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.370
 we can tell him to ring us when 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.200
 we unlock what it sounds like or what 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.650
 that we have put by default in the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.650
 settings 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.370
 and nothing we have a lot of animations 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.690
 I'm going to teach you a little each one of 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.240
 these animations are valid for the 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.950
 You see the first one is move block screen 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.590
 ok when we are the screen 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.440
 lock just move and what 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.360
 we unlock the second is we add a 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.150
 translucent effect a layer 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.850
 translucent is worth as you see it is worth 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.130
 third this is very fucking worth with 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.130
 forgiveness of expression but I have 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.170
 tried before I've been a while 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.960
 until I figured out how to unlock the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.050
 I'll show you how it works when 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.780
 active is animation you can not 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.180
 unlocking it in no way is worth 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.370
 well tell us 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.900
 in the settings tells us that with two 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.560
 fingers what we have to do is a 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.180
 click father to unlock him carefully 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.159
 with this because if you are not well 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.349
 informed before can be a little 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.780
 complicated to figure out how to unlock 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:18.579
 well the next one is the one on the page 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.579
 what the screen is worth 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.560
 this one here I do not remember let's see it 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.380
 so we see a lock that if what 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.180
 move worth what we unlock the 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.870
 next is to rotate with two fingers 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.260
 so to see 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.299
 so that this is worth rotating and what 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.520
 we unlocked and the next one is also 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:45.710
 very cool voucher we appear 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.710
 bout and nothing with two fingers 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.470
 we unlock it 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.370
 For the moment, what I use is the 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.379
 of the book page 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.390
 which is the one I like the most and what else 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.950
 well we can always adjust a little bit 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.080
 sensitivity if we want to get more 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.209
 away or move it a little bit so that it 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.209
 unlock and nothing else is a tweet 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.700
 which is payment but good as you know 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.950
 you can find it in other repositories 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:16.220
 as today puts as in zanelli or many 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.220
 others 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.890
 nothing I hope you liked me 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.300
 I send a cordial greeting to all and 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.300
 see you soon, goodbye
