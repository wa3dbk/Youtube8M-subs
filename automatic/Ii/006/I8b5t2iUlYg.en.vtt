extra stamp rubber stamp images and what
we're<00:00:52.670> going<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:53.000> do<00:00:53.149> is<00:00:53.390> take<00:00:53.719> you<00:00:54.440> know<00:00:54.590> up

we're going to do is take you know up

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.200 
we're going to do is take you know up
maybe<00:00:55.129> what<00:00:55.399> would<00:00:55.550> have<00:00:55.670> been<00:00:55.760> a<00:00:55.820> throwaway

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
maybe what would have been a throwaway

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.110 
maybe what would have been a throwaway
piece<00:00:56.660> but<00:00:57.320> now<00:00:57.469> we<00:00:57.530> have<00:00:57.859> a<00:00:57.890> solid<00:00:58.219> circle<00:00:58.910> so

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
piece but now we have a solid circle so

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.009 
piece but now we have a solid circle so
as<00:01:00.109> you're<00:01:00.460> popping<00:01:01.460> out<00:01:01.670> your<00:01:02.120> rubber<00:01:02.390> stamps

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
as you're popping out your rubber stamps

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.320 
as you're popping out your rubber stamps
from<00:01:03.170> Stampin<00:01:03.620> Up<00:01:03.739> think<00:01:04.550> of<00:01:04.670> these<00:01:04.790> shapes<00:01:05.090> as

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
from Stampin Up think of these shapes as

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.870 
from Stampin Up think of these shapes as
being<00:01:05.660> another<00:01:05.990> stamp<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.009> I<00:01:07.310> thought<00:01:07.820> that

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
being another stamp so I thought that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.749 
being another stamp so I thought that
was<00:01:08.180> brilliant<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:08.810> we're<00:01:08.900> using<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:09.229> small

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
was brilliant so we're using the small

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.530 
was brilliant so we're using the small
circle<00:01:10.759> from<00:01:12.250> that<00:01:13.250> particular<00:01:13.460> image<00:01:14.270> and

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
circle from that particular image and

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.920 
circle from that particular image and
then<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.200> larger<00:01:15.590> circle<00:01:16.040> from<00:01:16.310> here<00:01:16.930> again

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
then the larger circle from here again

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.319 
then the larger circle from here again

going to see that image just right after

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.090 
going to see that image just right after
that<00:01:43.040> that<00:01:43.460> as<00:01:43.700> Versamark<00:01:44.479> dries<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:45.829> get<00:01:46.070> a

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
that that as Versamark dries you get a

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.060 
that that as Versamark dries you get a
tone-on-tone<00:01:46.670> appearance<00:01:47.540> of<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.990> verse<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.380> of

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
tone-on-tone appearance of a verse of of

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.539 
tone-on-tone appearance of a verse of of
of<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.909> watermark<00:01:50.590> okay<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:51.649> that<00:01:52.009> looks<00:01:52.159> good

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
of a watermark okay so that looks good

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.730 
of a watermark okay so that looks good
there<00:01:52.909> clip<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:54.020> over<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.350> do<00:01:54.439> it<00:01:54.469> on<00:01:54.590> the

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
there clip it over and do it on the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.440 
there clip it over and do it on the
other<00:01:54.770> side<00:01:56.890> ok<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:57.950> again<00:01:58.219> using<00:01:59.060> Versamark

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
other side ok so again using Versamark

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.779 
other side ok so again using Versamark
is<00:01:59.840> just<00:02:00.200> this<00:02:00.409> easy<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.310> make<00:02:01.549> some

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
is just this easy so you make some

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.600 
is just this easy so you make some
random<00:02:02.299> patterns<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.140> don't<00:02:03.890> forget<00:02:04.189> to<00:02:04.250> do

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
random patterns and don't forget to do

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.320 
random patterns and don't forget to do
the<00:02:04.640> top<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.020> lid

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.080

folder and before you get started with
your<00:03:59.970> strips<00:04:00.570> go<00:04:00.930> ahead<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.410> break<00:04:01.590> down<00:04:01.620> the

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
your strips go ahead and break down the

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.030 
your strips go ahead and break down the
fiber<00:04:02.250> on<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.850> three<00:04:03.209> largest<00:04:03.830> it'll<00:04:04.830> just

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
fiber on the three largest it'll just

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.509 
fiber on the three largest it'll just
make<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.489> bow<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:06.030> little<00:04:06.450> Bowie<00:04:06.660> oh<00:04:07.519> what's

make the bow a little Bowie oh what's
that<00:04:09.080> new<00:04:10.080> terminology<00:04:10.830> all<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.160> time<00:04:11.400> that

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
that new terminology all the time that

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.210 
that new terminology all the time that
comes<00:04:11.970> out<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.239> his<00:04:12.510> mouth<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:13.110> I'm<00:04:14.010> going<00:04:14.160> to

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
comes out of his mouth and I'm going to

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.159 
comes out of his mouth and I'm going to
go<00:04:14.340> ahead<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:14.850> consider<00:04:15.000> all<00:04:15.420> ready<00:04:15.840> you<00:04:16.140> all

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
go ahead and consider all ready you all

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.260 
go ahead and consider all ready you all
ready<00:04:16.229> then<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.650> circle<00:04:17.070> we<00:04:17.640> can<00:04:17.820> just<00:04:18.000> kind

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
ready then the circle we can just kind

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.590 
ready then the circle we can just kind
of<00:04:18.390> go<00:04:18.720> through<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.650> like<00:04:19.830> that<00:04:20.270> okay<00:04:21.270> when

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
of go through it like that okay when

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.320 
of go through it like that okay when
to<00:04:21.660> do<00:04:21.900> again<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.730> breaking<00:04:23.730> down<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.060> fiber

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
to do again the breaking down the fiber

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.010 
to do again the breaking down the fiber
kind<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:24.960> do<00:04:25.080> it<00:04:25.230> like<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.410> curling<00:04:25.920> ribbon<00:04:27.020> and

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
kind of do it like a curling ribbon and

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.480 
kind of do it like a curling ribbon and
don't<00:04:28.920> overplay<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.930> paper<00:04:31.230> but<00:04:31.950> again<00:04:32.250> just

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
don't overplay the paper but again just

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.320 
don't overplay the paper but again just
breaking<00:04:33.090> down<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.270> fiber<00:04:33.810> will<00:04:34.230> help<00:04:34.950> it

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
breaking down that fiber will help it

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.210 
breaking down that fiber will help it
have<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.360> little<00:04:36.630> more<00:04:36.870> life<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.800> you'll<00:04:38.040> have

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
have a little more life and you'll have

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.370 
have a little more life and you'll have
a<00:04:38.550> more<00:04:39.350> non<00:04:40.350> placebo<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.430> we<00:04:41.520> get<00:04:41.730> done<00:04:42.380> okay

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
a more non placebo and we get done okay

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.970 
a more non placebo and we get done okay
so<00:04:43.470> we<00:04:43.680> have<00:04:43.710> our<00:04:44.100> two<00:04:44.870> circles<00:04:45.870> so<00:04:46.560> again<00:04:46.770> when

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
so we have our two circles so again when

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.680 
so we have our two circles so again when
you<00:04:47.070> glue<00:04:47.250> those<00:04:47.400> together<00:04:47.700> and<00:04:48.210> we're<00:04:48.570> going

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
you glue those together and we're going

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.210 
you glue those together and we're going
to<00:04:48.720> form<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.170> circle<00:04:49.470> so<00:04:49.710> you've<00:04:49.830> got<00:04:49.860> two

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
to form a circle so you've got two

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.020 
to form a circle so you've got two
circles<00:04:50.760> on<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:52.560> next<00:04:52.920> size<00:04:53.130> what<00:04:53.670> we<00:04:53.760> want<00:04:53.940> to

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
circles on the next size what we want to

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.560 
circles on the next size what we want to
do<00:04:54.180> is<00:04:54.480> make<00:04:54.510> a<00:04:55.110> little<00:04:55.940> notch<00:04:56.940> out<00:04:57.210> of<00:04:57.480> the
