00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 jay people beauty radinho and bringing to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.390
 You guys are an episode of naruto. 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.950
 continuing the series of struggles though 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.050
 has defined the type of super difficult and 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.070
 have quoted the talks 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.740
 in itatiba versus swimming the tinga is of the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.630
 also because it's the companies here I left 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.910
 sasc to stay a little more like this 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.769
 with me and the manga obviously the little thing is not 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.840
 To make a crazy trick, let's go to the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.680
 end valley that makes more sense and dust 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.239
 in the day area, I'm not going to give in the area 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.790
 dark, I like the light 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.790
 to tell the truth for the cool tacho and 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:49.860
 improve the image is basically due to 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.550
 There it is, my friend, from the sky. Exploding, it takes Jesus. 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.410
 Luís takes too long to send an opponent who 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.629
 I'm getting sicker, I'm 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.129
 spending my replacement a lot 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.410
 to speak the truth is not he is not the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.860
 even fell same position and there are 1000 bullshit 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.479
 jucá old and tried to understand sea , and 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.799
 leave tata dirt take muggle will try 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:20.040
 get into the defense will goes and tries to do 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.840
 80 years tried one today do not know what the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.960
 says time as my replacement has been 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.670
 everything and I did not even see the right to hear it 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.320
 in fact it was not only replacing 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.700
 the romeo chakra also 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.700
 old face 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:44.930
 I 'm going to take this damage I will not spend the 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:47.030
 replacement of the atom the shit behind 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.180
 logical moved wrong here still number 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.380
 it was very well play3 control by the 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.280
 newspaper 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.380
 but in summary I'm dying for 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.860
 delay saving replacement even more 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.979
 that what the button that r 2 and r 2 is 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.200
 very sensitive each title after the finger 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.509
 and is already active while 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.480
 It makes me very intent, too. 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.430
 dude and it was me 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.440
 our old thousand hp now I called 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.330
 face what a trip 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.459
 let's give it but to start fighting 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.970
 Now, in order to start, do something. 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:27.370
 more serious here if not obvious provoked 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.410
 we lose and continue the burning 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.970
 run away now man 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.489
 basically I used as much of you as you 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.709
 future 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.560
 the attack on my uncle 's side had 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:43.720
 loaded was not to watch the team play 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:48.580
 the fucking replacement was the only one that gave 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.580
 read our old moves me all wrong 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:58.359
 the guy comes to me with the end bound in 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:03:00.999
 rock the police 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:04.170
 I am not officially replaced 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:04.170
 because he's going to have a partner 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:12.069
 My bond side is not even thinking. 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:13.540
 in loading as note there old was 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.859
 starting to rise the replacement spot 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.689
 it very fast 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:21.689
 the edp gas triangle monkey 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.670
 but there to do the other like I just 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:32.960
 doing is doing the other too the shit is 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.120
 his uncle and obvious butt even if not 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.410
 uses pt shape in what is difficult to 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.240
 realize this will not make a people have 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:47.600
 to finalize this 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:49.190
 already this one is already starting to 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.770
 call me a base thing of this game one 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:04:01.700
 little different from 13 has a little more 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:04:09.520
 of care a year better than that of 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:13.970
 itouch of the final x here you will have finally 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.720
 end here you liked it is the 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.370
 Favorite liked favorites and 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.290
 shared is at last accustomed to 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.669
 companies but mostly enjoyed 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:30.080
 people help moi beauty does not apply 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:33.320
 while the playmaker made a good game a fan 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.229
 the anime was worth a lot will have a warning 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.460
 but it is more for who is new channel and for 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.150
 who does not know the history of fights 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.760
 beauty 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:45.140
 now always been next people is the action 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.190
 the series of others it works 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.440
 next way 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.390
 for those who have not seen those who do not know the 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.430
 classic channel series we do not know how 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.650
 does the following work? 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.780
 you fight the requests but according to 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.280
 series that I am in the moment 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.440
 For example, I'm doing a series 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.500
 of August fights asks the likely 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.840
 easy there if I'm not serious 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.940
 No way to fight is in the type I 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.380
 I do not do many bites 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.390
 there I, for example, doing a series 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.060
 dragon ball one side of story the father 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.700
 I'm not going to type in the middle of the 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.890
 dragon ball series, I do it according to 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.290
 with a series of fights I make of 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.630
 channels is in summary I say channels 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.330
 but it's more for seconding the same 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.550
 which is a most voted channel games n even 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.880
 is in some older games 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.190
 in short the application only when he had 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.360
 series of open fights 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.430
 OK 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.509
 on the video date I also think this is 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.939
 important 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:44.090
 Sometimes you ask for something in a video but the 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:46.189
 position is very old and finally 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.560
 series is also very old and do not 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:49.879
 connected in this regard to these details 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.750
 details important details that make 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:55.520
 total difference or the whole issue of 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.770
 channel I am very regular in Question 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.990
 postings almost daily 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.729
 let's say but the even more regular question 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.860
 It's time that I put 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.080
 sometimes you have from Sunday to Sunday 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.849
 Times that are Monday to Friday 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.250
 There are times that sometimes in the week 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:13.189
 then varies greatly according to the 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.080
 time I have to apply it there 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:18.469
 more or less there're people 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.319
 so stay tuned on tv video questions 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:23.090
 have a series of fights open or not 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:26.229
 remembering to be guided by others 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.229
 comments may not be published 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:30.500
 The documentary is much older than 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:33.110
 then stay tuned to the date of 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.479
 things of the genre and requests only people 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.419
 when series of fights is open 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:40.819
 Okay but it does not cost to ask high 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.460
 the world, nor does it heat up 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:46.430
 I respond to the good of you series of fights 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.050
 I say if you are in still short but 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.270
 I have a base but less than I can 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.039
 another or more or less when 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.770
 perhaps even a timetable in which I 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:55.819
 know when ball the series beauty but 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.469
 this is around here 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.120
 this was the warning mainly for 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:02.120
 who does not know the series of fights or 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:05.000
 paying on the channel for those who in short 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.949
 Nothing, this series is here. 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.569
 thank you all left here in the video and 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:10.129
 it helps even quite serious and I 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:11.629
 I am very grateful for the program 

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:16.000
 also signed up 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:16.000
 this time a gramophone now yes I went 

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:19.629
 continues in the next episode
