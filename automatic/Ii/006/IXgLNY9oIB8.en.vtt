series where we actually had to make

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.570 
series where we actually had to make
sure<00:06:12.450> that<00:06:12.720> our<00:06:12.750> goal<00:06:12.960> difference<00:06:13.230> was<00:06:13.650> quite

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
sure that our goal difference was quite

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.310 
sure that our goal difference was quite
good<00:06:14.610> but<00:06:15.030> fortunately<00:06:15.510> he<00:06:15.780> was<00:06:15.930> kind<00:06:16.110> of<00:06:16.170> all

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
good but fortunately he was kind of all

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.710 
good but fortunately he was kind of all
over<00:06:16.350> me<00:06:16.650> for<00:06:16.830> the<00:06:16.920> second<00:06:17.250> half<00:06:17.370> kind<00:06:18.090> of<00:06:18.180> very

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
over me for the second half kind of very

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.630 
over me for the second half kind of very
very<00:06:18.930> different<00:06:19.140> to<00:06:19.440> at<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:19.800> opening<00:06:20.190> 45

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640

minutes in the game I don't know whether

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.440 
minutes in the game I don't know whether
that's<00:06:21.810> because<00:06:22.230> we<00:06:23.040> had<00:06:23.220> a<00:06:23.460> poor<00:06:24.000> side<00:06:24.270> with

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
that's because we had a poor side with

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.940 
that's because we had a poor side with
poor<00:06:24.660> chemistry<00:06:25.140> and<00:06:25.320> their<00:06:25.410> fitness<00:06:25.620> just

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
poor chemistry and their fitness just

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.650 
poor chemistry and their fitness just
drained<00:06:26.220> a<00:06:26.340> little<00:06:26.370> bit<00:06:26.640> quicker<00:06:26.880> than<00:06:27.450> their

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
perhaps it would have otherwise done we

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.110 
perhaps it would have otherwise done we
still<00:06:29.070> had<00:06:29.220> a<00:06:29.250> lot<00:06:29.400> of<00:06:29.460> the<00:06:29.550> ball<00:06:29.730> we<00:06:29.880> just

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
still had a lot of the ball we just

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.450 
still had a lot of the ball we just
could<00:06:30.330> not<00:06:30.510> create<00:06:30.840> anything<00:06:31.410> and<00:06:31.770> he<00:06:32.340> was

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
could not create anything and he was

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.040 
could not create anything and he was
having<00:06:32.580> chances<00:06:33.120> left<00:06:33.330> right<00:06:33.510> and<00:06:33.630> center<00:06:33.930> so

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
having chances left right and center so

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.290 
having chances left right and center so
fortunately<00:06:34.560> we<00:06:34.740> don't<00:06:35.010> get<00:06:35.430> the<00:06:35.640> the<00:06:35.940> ability
