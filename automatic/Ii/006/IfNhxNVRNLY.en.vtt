part<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> game<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.750> you're<00:00:46.079> opening<00:00:46.410> up

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
part of the game if you're opening up

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.100 
part of the game if you're opening up
with<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> ten<00:00:46.980> pool<00:00:47.219> there<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.239> lot<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.719> chance

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
that you will just straight-up kill your

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.430 
that you will just straight-up kill your
opponent<00:00:50.730> about<00:00:51.270> maybe<00:00:51.660> fifty<00:00:52.050> percent<00:00:52.320> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440

the time however that also instantly

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.760 
the time however that also instantly
means<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> other<00:00:54.989> fifty<00:00:55.379> percent<00:00:55.680> of

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
means that the other fifty percent of

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.740 
means that the other fifty percent of
the<00:00:55.890> time<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.280> might<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.910> near<00:00:57.120> impossible<00:00:57.239> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
ado let's just jump straight into the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.830 
ado let's just jump straight into the
game<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.310> actual<00:01:32.490> build<00:01:33.000> order<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.659> 10

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
game so the actual build order for 10

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.330 
game so the actual build order for 10
pool<00:01:34.079> banelings<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.680> not<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.310> very

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
pool banelings is not going to be very

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.830 
pool banelings is not going to be very
interesting<00:01:36.090> i'll<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.299> honest<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:36.570> you

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
interesting i'll be honest with you

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.300 
interesting i'll be honest with you
because<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.259> probably<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
because it's probably but for the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.340 
because it's probably but for the
easiest<00:01:38.640> build<00:01:38.939> order<00:01:39.329> like<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> actual

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
easiest build order like the actual

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.690 
easiest build order like the actual
build<00:01:40.560> order<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.950> probably<00:01:41.250> going<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
build order is probably going to be the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.060 
build order is probably going to be the
easiest<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.479> any<00:01:42.960> bill<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.320> i<00:01:43.500> ever<00:01:43.619> put<00:01:43.950> up

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
easiest of any bill that i ever put up

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.889 
easiest of any bill that i ever put up
on<00:01:44.189> YouTube<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.970> whole<00:01:45.119> tricky<00:01:45.479> part<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.810> our

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
on YouTube the whole tricky part of our

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.270 
on YouTube the whole tricky part of our
tampa<00:01:46.229> bay<00:01:46.380> links<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.950> need<00:01:47.159> to

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
tampa bay links is that you need to

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.490 
tampa bay links is that you need to
execute<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.909> properly<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.479> can't<00:01:48.780> miss<00:01:49.049> micro

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
execute it properly you can't miss micro

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.499 
execute it properly you can't miss micro
so<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.740> your<00:01:49.860> micro<00:01:50.159> isn't<00:01:50.430> very<00:01:50.640> strong<00:01:50.759> you

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
so if your micro isn't very strong you

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.789 
so if your micro isn't very strong you
will<00:01:51.600> need<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.840> work<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.380> because<00:01:52.619> it's

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
will need to work on it because it's

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.109 
will need to work on it because it's
going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.130> absolutely<00:01:53.220> crucial<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.030> you

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
going to be absolutely crucial that you

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.910 
going to be absolutely crucial that you
don't<00:01:54.420> run<00:01:55.020> your<00:01:55.200> brain<00:01:55.409> links<00:01:55.680> into<00:01:55.890> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
don't run your brain links into a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.620 
don't run your brain links into a
hatchery<00:01:56.159> or<00:01:56.460> something<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.479> to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
hatchery or something like that so to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.450 
hatchery or something like that so to
open<00:01:57.930> up<00:01:58.020> with<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> temple<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.950> actually<00:01:59.340> need

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
open up with a temple you actually need

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.459 
open up with a temple you actually need
to<00:01:59.549> make<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> spawning<00:02:00.060> pool<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.719> 10<00:02:01.079> supply

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
to make a spawning pool on 10 supply

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.170 
to make a spawning pool on 10 supply
there<00:02:02.430> we<00:02:02.490> go<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.790> spawning<00:02:03.149> pool<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.390> down

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
there we go I spawning pool going down

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.090 
there we go I spawning pool going down
and<00:02:06.180> then<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.450> make<00:02:06.600> another<00:02:06.840> drunk<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:08.039> you

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
and then we make another drunk now you

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.410 
and then we make another drunk now you
don't<00:02:08.250> want<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.490> make<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> gas<00:02:08.850> guys<00:02:09.090> are<00:02:09.270> too

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
don't want to make the gas guys are too

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.850 
don't want to make the gas guys are too
early<00:02:09.780> normally<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.259> want<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> wait<00:02:10.590> right

that into a bailing nest so so far it's

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.610 
that into a bailing nest so so far it's

droning<00:05:04.830> now<00:05:05.220> obviously<00:05:05.610> this<00:05:05.820> is<00:05:05.940> a<00:05:05.970> little

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
droning now obviously this is a little

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.490 
droning now obviously this is a little

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
bit of a choice that you have to make

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.110 
bit of a choice that you have to make
because<00:05:07.650> if<00:05:07.919> you<00:05:08.010> feel<00:05:08.220> like<00:05:08.250> going<00:05:08.550> even<00:05:08.910> more

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
because if you feel like going even more

because if you feel like going even more
olin<00:05:09.479> you<00:05:09.960> can<00:05:10.110> obviously<00:05:10.229> decide<00:05:10.950> to<00:05:11.100> make

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
olin you can obviously decide to make

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.190 
olin you can obviously decide to make
only<00:05:11.580> certain<00:05:11.910> from<00:05:12.090> now<00:05:12.240> on<00:05:12.390> but<00:05:12.840> I<00:05:13.020> would
