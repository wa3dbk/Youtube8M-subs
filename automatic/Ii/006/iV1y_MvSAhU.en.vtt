00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
have because no enemies around me so we

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.120 
have because no enemies around me so we
are<00:01:36.780> going<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.049> join<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> warbird<00:01:37.799> picking<00:01:38.069> up

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
are going to join the warbird picking up

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.880 
are going to join the warbird picking up
the<00:01:38.219> Iceman<00:01:38.729> metal<00:01:39.090> along<00:01:39.810> giving<00:01:40.229> us<00:01:40.350> 50

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the Iceman metal along giving us 50

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.289 
the Iceman metal along giving us 50
points<00:01:41.310> towards<00:01:41.640> our<00:01:41.759> next<00:01:41.969> course<00:01:42.179> tree

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
points towards our next course tree

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.789 
points towards our next course tree
picking<00:01:42.600> up<00:01:42.719> the<00:01:42.840> bombing<00:01:43.229> run<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
picking up the bombing run now the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.709 
picking up the bombing run now the
bombing<00:01:44.249> run<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.670> case<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.060> very<00:01:45.359> special

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
bombing run in this case is very special

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.410 
bombing run in this case is very special
because<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.590> does<00:01:46.770> not<00:01:46.920> drop<00:01:47.219> bombs<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:48.060> drops

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
because it does not drop bombs it drops

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.020 
because it does not drop bombs it drops
care<00:01:48.960> packages<00:01:49.499> it<00:01:49.679> will<00:01:50.100> drop<00:01:50.249> me<00:01:50.429> for<00:01:50.759> care

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
care packages it will drop me for care

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.489 
care packages it will drop me for care
package<00:01:51.359> that<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.539> will<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.869> able<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.139> pick<00:01:52.469> up

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:52.499 
package that I will be able to pick up

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:54.529 
package that I will be able to pick up
hopefully<00:01:53.069> so<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:53.520> enemy<00:01:53.700> team<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.389> see

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
hopefully so the enemy team do not see

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.139 
hopefully so the enemy team do not see
me<00:01:54.630> that's<00:01:54.810> where<00:01:54.960> placement<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.859> such<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.399> very

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
me that's where placement is such a very

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.760 
me that's where placement is such a very
hefty<00:01:57.450> thing<00:01:57.749> that<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.049> need<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.350> watch<00:01:58.530> out
