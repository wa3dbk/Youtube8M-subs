talking about the players who go out to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.680 
talking about the players who go out to
go<00:00:40.469> out<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.160> serve<00:00:41.399> step<00:00:41.910> up<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> baseline

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
go out to serve step up to the baseline

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.119 
go out to serve step up to the baseline
they<00:00:42.840> bounce<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.230> ball<00:00:43.379> they<00:00:43.620> put<00:00:43.890> up<00:00:43.980> their

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
they bounce the ball they put up their

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.610 
they bounce the ball they put up their
toss<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:45.270> take<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> huge<00:00:46.020> addressed

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
toss and they take a huge addressed

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.369 
toss and they take a huge addressed
swing<00:00:46.920> at<00:00:47.250> their<00:00:47.430> first<00:00:47.640> serve<00:00:47.989> miss<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.200> by

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
swing at their first serve miss it by

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.860 
swing at their first serve miss it by
like<00:00:49.620> ten<00:00:50.250> feet<00:00:50.489> or<00:00:50.910> an<00:00:51.300> inch<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.629> doesn't

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
like ten feet or an inch it doesn't

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.810 
like ten feet or an inch it doesn't
matter<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.260> then<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> second<00:00:53.460> serve<00:00:53.579> they

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
matter and then on the second serve they

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.000 
matter and then on the second serve they
toss<00:00:54.000> up<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> ball<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.320> tap<00:00:55.800> it

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
toss up the ball and just like tap it

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.860 
toss up the ball and just like tap it
over<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.969> because<00:00:57.210> they<00:00:57.360> don't<00:00:57.539> have

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
over and it's because they don't have

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.170 
over and it's because they don't have
the<00:00:58.109> ability<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:59.030> confidently<00:01:00.030> an

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the ability to confidently an

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.020 
the ability to confidently an
aggressively<00:01:00.750> accelerate<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.710> create<00:01:02.460> spin

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
aggressively accelerate and create spin

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.460 
aggressively accelerate and create spin
which<00:01:04.189> raises<00:01:05.189> your<00:01:05.960> margin<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.080> error<00:01:07.260> which

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
which raises your margin for error which

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.980 
which raises your margin for error which
actually<00:01:07.799> increases<00:01:08.460> your<00:01:08.510> consistency<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
actually increases your consistency the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.810 
actually increases your consistency the
more<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> spin<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> ball<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.430> more<00:01:11.640> margin

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
more you spin the ball the more margin

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.450 
more you spin the ball the more margin
for<00:01:12.030> error<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.710> so<00:01:13.710> spin<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.159> kind<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.369> a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
for error you have so spin is kind of a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.710 
for error you have so spin is kind of a
manageable<00:01:14.790> thing<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> serve

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
manageable thing with the serve

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.050 
manageable thing with the serve
especially<00:01:16.049> second<00:01:16.619> serve<00:01:16.770> because<00:01:17.060> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
especially second serve because the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940 
especially second serve because the
faster<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.630> accelerate<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.470> more

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
faster you accelerate the more

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.880 
faster you accelerate the more
consistent<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.670> becomes<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.930> really

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
consistent it becomes and that's really

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.640 
consistent it becomes and that's really
a<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.520> really<00:01:24.119> beautiful<00:01:24.509> thing<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.869> how<00:01:25.470> do<00:01:25.530> you

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
a a really beautiful thing so how do you

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.260 
a a really beautiful thing so how do you
do<00:01:25.799> how<00:01:25.979> do<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.100> improve<00:01:26.610> your<00:01:26.759> spin<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.150> need

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
do how do you improve your spin you need

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.260 
do how do you improve your spin you need
two<00:01:27.450> things<00:01:27.689> number<00:01:27.900> one<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:29.100> need<00:01:29.280> racket

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
two things number one you need racket

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.260 
two things number one you need racket
head<00:01:30.420> speed<00:01:30.979> if<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.369> racket<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.000> not

head speed if the racket is not
accelerating<00:01:34.170> confidently<00:01:34.890> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
accelerating confidently and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.749 
accelerating confidently and
aggressively<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:36.150> will<00:01:36.270> never<00:01:36.570> make<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.759> an

aggressively you will never make a an

amount of spin that actually makes any

the<00:01:47.759> straighter<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.960> path<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.470> your<00:01:49.770> serve<00:01:49.979> is

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
the straighter the path of your serve is

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.760 
the straighter the path of your serve is
the<00:01:50.640> lower<00:01:51.540> your<00:01:51.810> margin<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.290> error<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:52.649> it's

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
the lower your margin for error if it's

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.260 
the lower your margin for error if it's
a<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:53.159> bit<00:01:53.280> too<00:01:53.430> low<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.640> hits<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> net<00:01:54.119> if

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
a little bit too low it hits the net if

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.550 
a little bit too low it hits the net if
it's<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.479> little<00:01:54.689> bit<00:01:54.780> too<00:01:54.899> high<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.140> goes<00:01:55.380> too

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
it's a little bit too high it goes too

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.520 
it's a little bit too high it goes too
far<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.310> if<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.670> shape<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.110> path<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.380> our

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
far so if we can shape the path of our

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.230 
far so if we can shape the path of our
serve<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.759> actual<00:02:00.380> ball<00:02:01.380> flight<00:02:01.820> then<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:03.060> can

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
serve the actual ball flight then we can

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.550 
serve the actual ball flight then we can
start<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.630> really<00:02:03.869> gain<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> lot<00:02:04.409> of

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
start to really gain a lot of

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.740 
start to really gain a lot of
consistency<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.969> only<00:02:06.180> way<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.479> make<00:02:06.719> a

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
consistency and the only way to make a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.389 
consistency and the only way to make a
significant<00:02:07.380> amount<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.619> spin<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.369> a

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
significant amount of spin is to have a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.460 
significant amount of spin is to have a
significant<00:02:09.179> amount<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.539> racket<00:02:09.959> head<00:02:10.080> speed

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
significant amount of racket head speed

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.920 
significant amount of racket head speed
so<00:02:11.039> those<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.670> who<00:02:11.790> are<00:02:11.879> slowing<00:02:12.270> down<00:02:12.450> on

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
so those of you who are slowing down on

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.990 
so those of you who are slowing down on
your<00:02:13.080> second<00:02:13.440> serve

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
your second serve

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.369 
your second serve
you<00:02:15.000> are<00:02:15.180> not<00:02:15.510> only<00:02:15.690> giving<00:02:15.930> your<00:02:16.170> opponent

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
you are not only giving your opponent

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.530 
you are not only giving your opponent
and<00:02:16.680> easier<00:02:17.250> ball<00:02:17.520> but<00:02:18.239> you're<00:02:18.360> taking

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
and easier ball but you're taking

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.809 
and easier ball but you're taking
potential<00:02:19.440> spin<00:02:19.739> away<00:02:19.890> from<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.340> shot<00:02:20.580> which

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
potential spin away from the shot which

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.610 
potential spin away from the shot which
lowers<00:02:21.239> your<00:02:21.390> consistency<00:02:22.050> it's<00:02:22.230> actually

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
lowers your consistency it's actually

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.259 
lowers your consistency it's actually
you<00:02:23.280> know<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.610> terrible<00:02:23.760> thing<00:02:23.970> it's<00:02:24.239> a

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
you know it's a terrible thing it's a

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:24.949 
you know it's a terrible thing it's a
double<00:02:24.510> whammy

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
double whammy

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.830 
double whammy
so<00:02:25.410> beyond<00:02:26.190> accelerating<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.150> racket<00:02:27.540> you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
so beyond accelerating the racket you

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.600 
so beyond accelerating the racket you
need<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.080> accelerate<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> racket<00:02:29.010> along<00:02:29.370> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
need to accelerate the racket along the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.610 
need to accelerate the racket along the
right<00:02:29.790> path<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.540> now<00:02:30.780> when<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:30.989> say<00:02:31.200> path<00:02:31.410> I'm

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
right path and now when I say path I'm

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.710 
right path and now when I say path I'm
talking<00:02:31.980> about<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.640> path<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.269> racket

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
talking about the path that the racket

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.500 
talking about the path that the racket
itself<00:02:34.110> travels<00:02:34.590> across<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.849> I'm<00:02:36.269> not<00:02:36.390> going

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
itself travels across and I'm not going

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.530 
itself travels across and I'm not going
to<00:02:36.569> go<00:02:36.690> into<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> lot<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.110> detail<00:02:37.470> on<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.830> but

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
to go into a lot of detail on this but

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.809 
to go into a lot of detail on this but
the<00:02:39.540> general<00:02:40.080> concept<00:02:40.560> here<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.069> if<00:02:41.310> your

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
the general concept here is this if your

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.089 
the general concept here is this if your
racket<00:02:42.180> accelerates<00:02:42.830> straight<00:02:43.830> at<00:02:43.980> your

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
racket accelerates straight at your

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.240 
racket accelerates straight at your
target<00:02:44.549> aggressively<00:02:45.290> your<00:02:46.290> shot<00:02:46.530> will<00:02:47.040> not

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
target aggressively your shot will not

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.820 
target aggressively your shot will not
have<00:02:47.430> any<00:02:47.549> spin<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.299> will<00:02:48.480> be<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.810> flat<00:02:49.290> straight

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
have any spin it will be a flat straight

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.430 
have any spin it will be a flat straight
shot<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.549> you<00:02:51.299> won't<00:02:51.480> have<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.900> benefits<00:02:52.319> of

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
shot and you won't have the benefits of

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.039 
shot and you won't have the benefits of
that<00:02:52.560> curve<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.280> flight<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.150> ball<00:02:54.329> if

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
that curve in the flight of the ball if

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.979 
that curve in the flight of the ball if
and<00:02:55.730> again<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:57.030> may<00:02:57.180> sound<00:02:57.510> confusing<00:02:57.840> to

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
and again this may sound confusing to

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.210 
and again this may sound confusing to
you<00:02:58.079> at<00:02:58.200> first<00:02:58.380> I'm<00:02:58.560> not<00:02:58.590> gonna<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.950> don't<00:02:59.069> have

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
you at first I'm not gonna I don't have

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.350 
you at first I'm not gonna I don't have
time<00:02:59.370> here<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.730> go<00:02:59.790> through<00:03:00.060> all<00:03:00.180> the

different steps but if on the other hand
your<00:03:03.000> racket<00:03:03.390> accelerates<00:03:03.900> aggressively

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
your racket accelerates aggressively

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.729 
your racket accelerates aggressively
past<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.310> ball<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:06.260> your<00:03:07.260> strings<00:03:07.590> are

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
past the ball and your strings are

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.949 
past the ball and your strings are
facing<00:03:08.190> your<00:03:08.280> target<00:03:08.459> now<00:03:09.420> we<00:03:09.480> start<00:03:09.870> to

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
facing your target now we start to

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.270 
facing your target now we start to
create<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.260> whole<00:03:10.500> bunch<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.799> spin<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.069> it

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
create a whole bunch of spin and it

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.190 
create a whole bunch of spin and it
could<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.549> slice<00:03:11.819> could<00:03:12.209> be<00:03:12.299> side<00:03:12.480> spin<00:03:12.750> it

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
could be slice could be side spin it

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.720 
could be slice could be side spin it
could<00:03:13.440> be<00:03:13.590> more<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.130> kick<00:03:14.310> serve<00:03:14.489> more

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
could be more of a kick serve more

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.520 
could be more of a kick serve more
topspin<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.630> depends<00:03:16.110> on<00:03:16.200> what<00:03:16.349> direction

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
topspin that depends on what direction

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.789 
topspin that depends on what direction
your<00:03:17.160> racket<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.640> moving<00:03:18.030> past<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.660> ball<00:03:18.840> and

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
your racket is moving past the ball and

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.530 
your racket is moving past the ball and
that's<00:03:20.130> how<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.400> create<00:03:20.670> different<00:03:20.970> types<00:03:21.329> of

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
that's how you create different types of

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.229 
that's how you create different types of
spin<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.579> degree<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.060> you

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
spin and the to the degree that you

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.420 
spin and the to the degree that you
accelerate<00:03:24.750> your<00:03:24.959> racket<00:03:25.410> on<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.950> right<00:03:26.130> path

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
accelerate your racket on the right path

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.729
