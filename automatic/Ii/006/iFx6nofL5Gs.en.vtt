00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
for some people including myself who

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.340 
for some people including myself who

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
didn't think that it was better and just

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.990 
didn't think that it was better and just
thought<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.860> was<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> same<00:01:56.250> thing<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.700> for<00:01:56.759> an

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
thought it was the same thing but for an

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.770 
thought it was the same thing but for an
extra<00:01:57.240> five<00:01:57.450> dollars<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:59.610> actually<00:01:59.939> seems<00:02:00.689> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
extra five dollars it actually seems to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.959 
extra five dollars it actually seems to
benefit<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.259> more<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.799> here's<00:02:02.369> another<00:02:02.520> main

three<00:02:12.430> days<00:02:12.459> early<00:02:13.030> which<00:02:13.599> is<00:02:13.720> not<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:13.989> big

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
three days early which is not that big

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.110

of<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.260> deal<00:02:14.379> hopefully<00:02:15.190> they<00:02:15.340> had<00:02:15.519> an<00:02:15.700> ultimate

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
of a deal hopefully they had an ultimate

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.150 
of a deal hopefully they had an ultimate
team<00:02:16.269> I<00:02:16.540> mean<00:02:17.140> that's<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.620> similar<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.069> the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
team I mean that's a similar to the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.650 
team I mean that's a similar to the
season<00:02:18.459> ticket<00:02:18.760> thing<00:02:18.940> but<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.150> just<00:02:19.360> like<00:02:19.510> how

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
the games that they have to offer

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.390 
the games that they have to offer
discounted<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.819> whatnot<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:23.110> pay<00:02:23.400> monthly

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400
