00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 today together with you I will define 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 milk quality 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.880
 I used to be a good housewife 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.940
 caring mommy and taking milk 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.519
 homemade 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.719
 women but time changes now I take 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.810
 milk store 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.490
 I have milk every day 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.109
 this we will talk later now i want 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.990
 determine the quality of milk 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.710
 but first what will I do to him 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.830
 looked 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.019
 here it is milk it reminds home 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.219
 milk 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:38.670
 there are a lot of sour cream homemade milk 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:45.390
 sour cream for 20 fingers on the table 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:47.780
 but the smell of milk is gentle smells good on 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.780
 sample 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.540
 what a sweet some nice ray 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.610
 still milk is not sour 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.820
 now I can pour a glass 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.470
 pour into a jar pour into a jar when 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.570
 you pour 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:08.640
 good whole milk it bubbles 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.880
 you can see here the cans she pours bubbles 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.700
 if forcibly diluted the bubbles do not 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 there will be such a bank 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.210
 it is opaque 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:25.020
 you can see how it was like milk you see not 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.450
 as bald jar there like water it 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:34.229
 the first is the second that i will take to be i 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:39.600
 I'll take a moment like that a pilot 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.940
 I can see a drop of jacob on the nail 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.009
 it is not visible but it can be shown here 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.330
 if this is a drop of milk does not spread 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.100
 it means this milk is good 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:57.500
 Ours can later show well and 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:04.310
 this is the first such test the second sample 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:07.890
 if I pour a glass of milk 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:13.470
 more or less whole good it is that 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.900
 do you can see she sinks to the bottom she 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.490
 settles to the bottom if the milk will 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:25.530
 diluted well with water then it is like this 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:30.510
 Here it spreads right away this is such a second 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.569
 indicator of what else is typical 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.830
 smells said over the light yes now in 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.319
 milk can also be well as the starch 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.090
 detecting starch is easy and 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.010
 simply 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.590
 mean I'll take some 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:57.090
 milk is such a small cup 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:59.150
 that's what to drop a couple of drops of iodine and 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.920
 if starch is natural 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.430
 that 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.920
 milk that will get this one all 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.830
 the reaction is going to be blue 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.290
 happened milk was just more 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.300
 a little bit so he lived to vote even if 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:24.130
 add more iodine anyway she doesn't 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:27.730
 turned blue meaning no starch here 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:31.420
 but just became yellowish it means 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.930
 also an indicator of good 2 why milk 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.150
 may still be some alkali so mean 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.280
 that i will now also make such a trial i 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:47.530
 take a napkin napkin 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:51.580
 in one layer I pour here on a napkin 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:58.290
 Milk like that on a napkin 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:04:02.830
 process yes here and on top I 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.980
 I add this vinegar means so if 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:09.250
 there is some kind of alkali that must 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.410
 bubble and hiss this reaction in me 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.860
 No, well, I clearly and merge 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.260
 I'll add soda and I’ll see that I don’t 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.049
 solid good from the table yes good 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.590
 amenable to waving was not visible here I 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:28.660
 I add soda and immediately that sizzles and a bunch 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.710
 a bunch of bubbles on the napkins that is in 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.040
 this milk too 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.770
 here these impurities are not here then if 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.430
 diluted milk called it still 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.860
 check 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.660
 I have no alcohol, but I will say so 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.860
 otherwise pour too 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:48.760
 Milk, let's say a jar or a cup of reef 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.430
 a cup and there is such a proportion if you 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.650
 add two spoonfuls of milk you need to 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.260
 add one spoon of alcohol and even if 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.900
 immediately five seconds 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.050
 the flakes form and the milk 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.850
 whole good and if 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:09.000
 late for a minute is listed 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.000
 milk is considered there solid water 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.840
 so that 's it in my opinion so i'm all 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.300
 told what I make from milk from 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.110
 milk making cottage cheese and the next 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.610
 the transfer I will tell you how I do so 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.290
 I think I told everything from some 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:30.330
 questions or everything is clear yes what if 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.710
 have someone you ask to laugh if 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.710
 i will know i will answer for now
