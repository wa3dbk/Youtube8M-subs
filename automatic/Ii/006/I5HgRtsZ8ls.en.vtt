Marc: So what can a group of internet

00:00:01.582 --> 00:00:03.566
wood workers accomplish in 30 days?

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.950
A lot.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.648
The Wood Whisperer Guild and partnership

00:00:06.648 --> 00:00:08.062
with Woodworkers Fighting Cancer

00:00:08.062 --> 00:00:09.479
is proud to announce the results

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:11.199
of our March Guild Build.

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:13.720
We had over 150 individual donations

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.824
as well as corporate matching

00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:16.457
from numerous companies.

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:19.457
I personally pledged
$5 per completed table,

00:00:19.457 --> 00:00:22.016
as did a number of
individual contributors.

00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:25.105
The final tally was 67 shaker tables.

00:00:25.105 --> 00:00:26.576
That gives us a grand total of

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:28.872
just over $8,000 donated

00:00:28.872 --> 00:00:30.912
to the American Cancer Society.

00:00:30.912 --> 00:00:32.817
Our guild members worked
their butts off in March

00:00:32.817 --> 00:00:34.368
to get these tables done and I thought

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:36.296
they deserved a little recognition.

00:00:36.296 --> 00:00:37.377
I hope you enjoy.
