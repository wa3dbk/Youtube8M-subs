not like it matters um from there we
have<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.799> which<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.250> actually<00:01:08.490> it

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
have this one which is actually it

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.740 
have this one which is actually it
started<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.490> heart<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> bones

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
started as just the heart with the bones

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.749 
started as just the heart with the bones
and<00:01:13.760> then<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.820> later<00:01:15.270> added<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.759> spiderwebs

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
and then I later added on the spiderwebs

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.789 
and then I later added on the spiderwebs
because<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.420> felt<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.530> heartwood

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.870 
significant to me I guess it helps me
realize<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.920> know<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.340> I'm<00:02:20.580> dealing

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
realize that you know if I'm dealing

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.970 
realize that you know if I'm dealing
with<00:02:21.000> something<00:02:21.180> rough<00:02:21.900> at<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.200> moment<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.710> can

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
with something rough at the moment I can

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.650 
with something rough at the moment I can
I<00:02:23.250> can<00:02:23.790> always<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.120> wait<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.390> little<00:02:24.570> while

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
I can always just wait a little while

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.830 
I can always just wait a little while
because<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.410> will<00:02:25.590> pass<00:02:25.830> because<00:02:26.370> time<00:02:26.940> really

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
because it will pass because time really

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.440 
because it will pass because time really
does<00:02:28.050> fly<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.770> as<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.190> say<00:02:29.490> time<00:02:29.790> heals<00:02:29.820> all

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
does fly and as I say time heals all

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.800 
does fly and as I say time heals all
wounds<00:02:30.840> well<00:02:31.680> if<00:02:31.830> that's<00:02:32.010> true<00:02:32.100> but<00:02:32.550> i'm<00:02:32.820> i'm

wounds well if that's true but i'm i'm

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.280 
wounds well if that's true but i'm i'm
running<00:02:34.470> through<00:02:34.740> time<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.280> find<00:02:35.520> out<00:02:36.290> let's

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.270 
cupcake with stars on my forearm which
um<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:51.300> think<00:02:51.540> okay<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:52.200> girl<00:02:52.590> with<00:02:52.830> cupcakes

anything there's no meaning behind it

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.920 
anything there's no meaning behind it
but<00:02:56.370> you'd<00:02:57.120> be<00:02:57.270> wrong<00:02:57.300> about<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.870> one

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
but you'd be wrong about this one

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.300 
but you'd be wrong about this one
because<00:02:58.350> um<00:02:59.420> five<00:03:00.420> years<00:03:00.690> ago<00:03:00.960> I<00:03:01.320> had<00:03:01.950> my

gallbladder<00:03:02.550> removed<00:03:03.210> and<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:04.680> turns<00:03:04.980> out

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
gallbladder removed and it turns out

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.320 
gallbladder removed and it turns out
that<00:03:05.220> I'm<00:03:05.610> one<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.880> few<00:03:06.030> people<00:03:06.300> who

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
that I'm one of the few people who

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.540 
that I'm one of the few people who
cannot<00:03:06.960> really<00:03:07.440> function<00:03:07.980> very<00:03:08.010> well<00:03:08.250> without
