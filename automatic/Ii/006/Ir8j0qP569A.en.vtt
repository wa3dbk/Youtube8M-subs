00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.770 
going well here next to this is
beginning<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.880> get<00:02:26.000> did<00:02:26.210> what<00:02:26.390> everything

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
after that was really really difficult

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.580 
after that was really really difficult
now<00:02:28.820> if<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.270> hadn't<00:02:29.570> been<00:02:29.660> with<00:02:29.900> somebody<00:02:30.140> I

now if I hadn't been with somebody I

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.949 
now if I hadn't been with somebody I
wouldn't<00:02:31.190> have<00:02:31.460> gone<00:02:31.640> beyond<00:02:32.090> let's<00:02:32.420> say<00:02:32.630> 12

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
wouldn't have gone beyond let's say 12

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.140 
wouldn't have gone beyond let's say 12
or<00:02:33.140> 13<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:33.560> just<00:02:33.740> want<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:33.980> stop<00:02:34.190> so<00:02:34.730> everything

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
or 13 I just want to stop so everything

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
beyond that was kind of as a result of

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:48.800 
beyond that was kind of as a result of
being<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:38.150> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.730 

22<00:02:49.830> again<00:02:50.830> every<00:02:51.190> access<00:02:51.550> that<00:02:51.940> beautiful<00:02:52.330> I

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
22 again every access that beautiful I

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.230 
22 again every access that beautiful I
can't<00:02:53.740> do<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.100> thing<00:02:54.250> they<00:02:54.370> call<00:02:54.520> burpees<00:02:54.970> at

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240

can't do the thing they call burpees at
all<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.570> just<00:02:55.900> don't<00:02:56.110> have<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:57.130> flexibility

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
all I just don't have the flexibility

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.360 
all I just don't have the flexibility
around<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.690> knees<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.850> happened<00:03:01.660> I

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
around the knees and and happened I

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.680 
around the knees and and happened I
think<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.520> think<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.760> may<00:03:03.970> be<00:03:04.000> partially<00:03:04.660> a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
think I think it may be partially a

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.120 
think I think it may be partially a
function<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.170> age<00:03:05.350> where<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.650> can<00:03:05.830> discover

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
function of age where I can discover

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.280 
function of age where I can discover
