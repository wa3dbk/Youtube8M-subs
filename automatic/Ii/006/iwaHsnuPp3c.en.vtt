00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 charred unique discovery made in 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.360
 fifty-eighth year that 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.540
 man there is an alternative system 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.840
 power supply 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:20.699
 that is, we have with you two systems one 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:24.240
 known you well, if that is not enough 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.820
 there is to eat something like this 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.230
 the current theory of nutrition is 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.300
 if something is missing you then disease 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.850
 essential amino acids that only 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.260
 we have gone punished coal and Pauli 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.329
 proved that we have microflora 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.620
 pathogenic which pollute 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.110
 the whole microflora exhaust is useful which 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.050
 capable of producing 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.750
 all that the human body needs 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.870
 including even hormones 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.280
 irreplaceable amino acids any any 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.409
 vitamins and anything that is itself 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.119
 microflora 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.840
 but only an example needs to be saved and how 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.610
 he save 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.549
 and the problem is that she lives only on 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.060
 raw food on food that is not heated 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.930
 above 40 degrees of food which preserves 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.910
 the so-called enzymes 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.150
 making up and capable of herself 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.210
 digestion is called autolysis if you 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.480
 eat whole food fruits fruits vegetables 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.720
 nuts mushrooms and ufa i say here i can't 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.320
 I have an example of a steeper rule 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.190
 take 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:46.930
 just elementals mushroom which means 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:50.760
 now people shop champignon there 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:54.460
 cleared cut a little salt ki 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.229
 just harder so tasty and if in 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.770
 this door is added to the salad 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.869
 delete 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.060
 offense to add charged grain nuts 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.330
 accordingly consume here and 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.420
 much, much more then you are not 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.420
 Salt lurking you feed your microphone 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.450
 and Viktor will soon feed you and you 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.820
 there will always be balance and weight and 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.100
 and all the vitamins and nothing at all 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.459
 principle can not be good if you 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.890
 let your output multiple 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.800
 green food no their size is understandable 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.380
 and they are currency useful 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.210
 this which arises no 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.870
 pathogenic and 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.370
 arrest the microflora is hiding in answer 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.600
 hiding 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:49.370
 sometimes not endure perish 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:52.180
 so if you move smoothly even if 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.510
 salads to carry germinated grain 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.400
 use the fact that I do not have listed 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.010
 there have been no cases hundreds of such 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.990
 examples recovered from any 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.030
 a man with that 30 years 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:16.190
 all functions are normalized but 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:18.470
 need to understand what needs us if you 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.010
 or we will go she will start to get you 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.010
 where where where meat and here they say 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.440
 so what I quenched if the meat did not lead 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.250
 i'm taxing right so while we 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.290
 gradually suppress this microsurgery 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.150
 production times because we have three 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.370
 three and a half kilograms of microflora and 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.850
 she completely provides us with everything 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.890
 necessary russia 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:49.000
 what is meat ribbon 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:04:09.610
 what are you talking about always give an example 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:32.050
 horse work that cow predator 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:35.270
 throw grows need to find 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.750
 58 before opening and if it is introduced 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:44.090
 Now, but I went to Pskov bought on 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.780
 90 rubles 3 kilograms of wheat to snow 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.780
 enough for a month 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.270
 well at least ten times possible 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.490
 less 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.360
 but do you think anyone would allow such 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.540
 information to the common market 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.930
 then crashes live it all efficiently 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.930
 slaughterhouses and all
