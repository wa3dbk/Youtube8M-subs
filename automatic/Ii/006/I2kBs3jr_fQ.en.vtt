00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.529
 you guys some cool outfits you 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.419
 perfect for school or college 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.950
 can wear and I'm still tinkering 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.539
 a cool girl what you directly 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.400
 could take to school or uni 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.260
 necessarily with these great girls 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.129
 over there we are still cool 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.129
 videos shot 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.910
 Here you can see my outfit what I am 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.620
 so often to uni wear you can 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.610
 but of course also very easy in the 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.470
 put on a school 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.809
 I wear as a straight cut 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.970
 skirt with a beautiful pattern 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.860
 I just have a white basic shirt 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.199
 a pearl necklace and my current one 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.790
 Favorite leather jacket combines white 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.220
 Sneakers and then a very cool 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.890
 handbag and the look is done 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:06.080
 and really comfortable and casual for the 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.790
 school me the outfit is very similar 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.170
 to my she also just drinks son 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.659
 cut rock but in such a 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.939
 do turquoise and I think you last 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.890
 white top goes well with the blog 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.020
 otherwise she would rather be cool 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.270
 accessories law like her mirrored 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.440
 sunglasses and this bag too 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.260
 such a very reflective material 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.480
 hand and chucks that it just the 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.480
 Best choice because they are very comfortable 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.820
 yes not outfit is that quite a lot 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.650
 basic part but there you can too 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.360
 really never do anything wrong wearing them 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.670
 such a wide blouse 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.470
 three quarter length service shorts and has 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.390
 then just the whole with black 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.970
 accessories combined like you here 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.320

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.320
 very nice handbag 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.480
 lucia 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.850
 Finally, you can see some more parties here 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.830
 By the way, outfit finds all outfit too 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.260
 details again in the infobox there 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.820
 again where everything is and you 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.740
 I really like outfit too 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.690
 especially I find their michael kors 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.970
 Just perfect for the bag 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.070
 there everything is really necessary 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.080
 rows and their commuter drills or how 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.760
 I also like that in the house 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.900
 In general personally very happy for the 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.120
 are super comfortable 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.010
 otherwise she has a lot of basic parts 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.950
 how easy jeans and a black 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.200
 top dressed and so easy 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.200
 cool for school or college 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.340
 and it was our school now too 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.990
 and uni outfits and then I'll show you 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.180
 now again very easy 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.490
 I could make my own girl 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.010
 Once you have made this for what you are here for 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.990
 such super as a Beck bag needs 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.180
 because a bit logitech there is 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.040
 now everywhere and for the par decoration 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.610
 elements like any sticker or 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.810
 such sweet little hearts a pair of scissors 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.130
 Of course, cutting is not 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.690
 bad and he should with this bag 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.430
 Be careful that the again 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.200
 are lockable then you have to 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.140
 Actually only that happens ape in 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.940
 glue strips around this bag that is 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.100
 not quite so easy but at some point 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.330
 it's a bit of a twist and 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.180
 I just have a lot of different ones 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.280
 taken chips and then on it 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.840
 glued and if you do then made 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.460
 you just have to do it all 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.890
 decorate with stickers 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.790
 you can really be that 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.200
 you want 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.570
 I still have this heart 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.100
 glued to it and that's it 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.020
 Girl finished I hope you have that 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.240
 understood it is super easy 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.800
 and looks really cool you can 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.300
 but also such a small cloth bags 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.530
 make something for the uniform 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.200
 Practically , you only need one 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.230
 bit of fabric bastl glue and wool 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.250
 that was it, too, and such a thing 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.480
 stencil I can tell you in the 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.850
 link infobox 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.220
 you have to cut that out first 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.230
 and then you have to do the same 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.240
 actually then with the fabric 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.310
 that means you drive the whole thing 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.990
 then again on the fabric and long 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.630
 then just cut it again 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:07.090
 so that then the fabric form 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.770
 from the template you can yes 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.570
 You really take every material you like 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.640
 I think the song is really cool 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.560
 bastelladen is bought here in cologne 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.600
 By the way, everyone is fine too 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.790
 and then you just have to donate there 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.190
 put it right and then you fold 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.230
 the way I do it , so to speak 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.730
 and then take some cloth 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.740
 put it together and you have it 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.360
 such a small bag where you then 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.740
 always on the side of your donors 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.660
 get out there can go, of course 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.040
 not so many in here but for the 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.040
 uni is definitely enough 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.870
 I have now enjoyed the video and 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.280
 do not forget about the others 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.190
 to look because there you will find quite 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.840
 many cool videos and there at the 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.190
 you also find hashtag beauty course 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.390
 everything else we do in new york 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.790
 because we have that too 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.790
 video shot and then until
