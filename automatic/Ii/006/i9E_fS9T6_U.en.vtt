00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hi, I'm Daniela Ferrari and today I 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:26.880
 I would like to tell you about dresses 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:28.949
 of good graduation for this season 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.539
 as every year the recordings are 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.460
 in summer they are always colors 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.120
 fresh and they have to be cheerful colors 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.530
 because they are Chavistas are 18 or 19 years old 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.410
 so what I always recommend is 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.170
 make it a color that when you see the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.210
 photo within 30 years that is a color 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.450
 that you see well the rule of now is 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.719
 that in 30 years you cover that picture and say 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.449
 I liked it in terms of cuts and changes 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.070
 every year right now the cuts are 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.629
 very feminine that is very beautiful because 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.030
 Each time they are the dresses as more 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.730
 elegant and is also is 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.020
 the trend of dresses as more 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.539
 as eyes 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.890
 also used to to continue 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.869
 being an evening dress to me what 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.060
 I like to put on textiles like very 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.310
 luxurious and although the dress looks 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.319
 Facts or not to say it in some way 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.689
 or is more comfortable is still seeing with this 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.459
 night style another trend that is 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.030
 very father is all the dresses with the 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.819
 kiss 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.159
 happily they are with much embroidery with 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:33.079
 many things like rhinestones on top but 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.189
 without getting to the point that they seem 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.599
 as as of contest no but that is 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.520
 well put those that I like 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.170
 now for these for this season 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.840
 of graduations are those that go as in 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.630
 a single fabric can be a super dress 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.700
 minimalist but the pure fabric speaks of 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.860
 be amazing and I like it a lot for this 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.069
 temperate of the colors that I 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.159
 I would recommend more is to be colors 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.349
 alive or within the range almost almost 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.439
 I tell you the cheerful colors 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:05.209
 yellow green turquoise rice are 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.739
 colors that you see you say because they have 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.410
 they have an age where they can be 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:11.920
 compose the color that is colors that I 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.940
 I tell them never to do it 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.430
 Black and white is a color that is 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.410
 to invite a wedding but not for your 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.650
 graduation unsaturation not go of 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.290
 black do not also do it another way of 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.050
 choose how to design your dress 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.530
 you can get excited as with some time 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.970
 like the 20 30 30 and 50 60 is right now 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.180
 the most amazing thing is that everyone leaves 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.190
 then you can mix for example a 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.800
 skirt 50 is that they are the ones that are like 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.720
 wider than right now that I love 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.450
 that this fashion has returned because it 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.760
 It makes me super feminine super elegant and 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.459
 it is night are the dresses so big 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.950
 as network carpets what I already know that 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.269
 it is allowed to use it because it has been a long time 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.269
 people do not dare to use them
