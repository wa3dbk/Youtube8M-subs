00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.960
on this wonderful Outdoor Oven.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.300

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.870

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.320
12 Slices of Bacon..

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.360
6 quarters of Appenzeller Cheese... and 6 Eggs

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.680
First of all .. i used some non-sticking Spray on my Muffin-Pan

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.090
you could use butter or any other fat..

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.810
Now we start and grab

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.230
2 Slices of Bacon...and cut them

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.700
in the middle

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.000
and lay the Bacon into the Muffin holes

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.629
the Bacon mustn´t lay over the holes...

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.419
as i don´t want to flip it over the Eggs.

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.569
This is how it should look like.. and now

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.929
i will prepare the others.. and then we continue.

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:23.279
ok.. let´s go on..

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:24.809
here i got some Eggs

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:31.809
one Egg per Hole

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.269
"Didn´t the Grilljunky tell something about scrambled Egg?... CHECK! "

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.569
ok..the eggs are prepared...

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.569
now place a cube of Appenzeller in the middle of each hole...

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.579
and now.. lets move over to the outdoor-Oven

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.519
As you can see...the oven is at 210° Celsius...

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.900
Let´s open it..

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.959
place the Muffin pan in the middle of the oven..

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:13.199
and let them bake for 20 Minutes

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:17.079
at 210° Celsius.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.770
20 Minutes later... let´s open the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.249
Oven again.. OH MY GOD...

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:27.919
if there would be "Smell-O-Vision"....

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:34.900
this Appenzeller Cheese has so much flavour..

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.699
this looks fantastic!

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:42.209
Lets take them out...

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.259
take a look at them...

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:49.909
see how the Appenzeller came up...

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.299
and now...

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.069
i will let them cool down.. and have a taste..

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.319
Here are our Muffins... with an awesome flavour..

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.529
take a look

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:04.619
they don´t stick to the pan at all..

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:08.129
"Well Markus.. i guess we did well and our Mission "Scrambled Eggs" ...

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.789

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:11.929
