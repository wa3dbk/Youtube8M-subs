in<00:01:21.610> Minecraft<00:01:22.180> it's<00:01:22.330> a<00:01:22.420> bit<00:01:22.570> limited<00:01:22.780> but<00:01:23.530> I

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
in Minecraft it's a bit limited but I

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.380 
in Minecraft it's a bit limited but I
did<00:01:24.340> my<00:01:24.580> best<00:01:24.610> with<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:27.310> I<00:01:27.340> could<00:01:27.580> do<00:01:27.729> because

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
did my best with what I could do because

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.790 
did my best with what I could do because
you<00:01:28.540> can<00:01:28.660> only<00:01:28.780> really<00:01:29.110> make<00:01:29.229> a<00:01:29.290> two<00:01:29.560> by<00:01:29.770> one

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
you can only really make a two by one

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.400 
you can only really make a two by one
hole<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:32.190> back<00:01:33.190> here<00:01:33.869> basically<00:01:34.869> these<00:01:35.350> are

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
hole and back here basically these are

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:42.180 
hole and back here basically these are
all<00:01:37.259> moving<00:01:38.259> piston<00:01:38.890> worms<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:40.950> once<00:01:41.950> I<00:01:42.070> hit

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
all moving piston worms and once I hit

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.160 
all moving piston worms and once I hit
the<00:01:42.340> lever<00:01:42.550> it'll<00:01:42.940> update<00:01:43.180> all<00:01:43.690> of<00:01:43.840> them<00:01:43.990> and

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
the lever it'll update all of them and

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.320 
the lever it'll update all of them and
get<00:01:44.440> them<00:01:44.650> to<00:01:44.800> move<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:46.479> what<00:01:46.720> happens<00:01:47.200> is<00:01:48.330> all

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
get them to move so what happens is all

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.499 
get them to move so what happens is all
of<00:01:50.290> these<00:01:50.470> retract<00:01:51.009> one<00:01:51.369> so<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.030> redstone

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
of these retract one so the redstone

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.139 
of these retract one so the redstone
block<00:01:52.780> moves<00:01:53.050> one<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.710> side<00:01:53.979> actually<00:01:54.850> let

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
block moves one to the side actually let

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.540 
block moves one to the side actually let
me<00:01:55.300> get<00:01:55.450> some<00:01:55.660> city<00:01:56.530> in<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:56.979> put<00:01:57.190> it<00:01:57.280> in<00:01:57.399> front

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
me get some city in and put it in front

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.030 
me get some city in and put it in front
of<00:01:57.729> these<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.960> they<00:01:59.080> don't<00:01:59.259> run<00:01:59.470> away<00:01:59.619> real

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
of these so they don't run away real

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.730 
of these so they don't run away real
quick<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.319> can<00:02:02.500> show<00:02:02.800> you<00:02:04.170> one<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.200> them<00:02:05.440> in

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
quick and I can show you one of them in

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.130 
quick and I can show you one of them in
action<00:02:07.050> so<00:02:08.050> what<00:02:08.259> happens<00:02:08.770> is<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:10.720> piston

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
action so what happens is this piston

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.120 
action so what happens is this piston
will<00:02:11.170> retract<00:02:11.920> one<00:02:13.350> from<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.560> very<00:02:14.800> beginning

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
will retract one from the very beginning

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.020 
will retract one from the very beginning
when<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.030> hit<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.330> lever<00:02:17.640> D<00:02:18.640> powers<00:02:18.940> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
when you hit the lever D powers the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.350 
when you hit the lever D powers the
torch<00:02:19.300> or<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.830> mean<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.190> powers<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.580> torch<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.150> it

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
torch or I mean a powers a torch and it

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.110 
torch or I mean a powers a torch and it
moves<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:22.930> block<00:02:23.170> over<00:02:23.590> which<00:02:24.430> will<00:02:24.610> D<00:02:24.880> power

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
moves this block over which will D power

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.449 
moves this block over which will D power
this<00:02:25.480> basically<00:02:26.230> moving<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.709> line<00:02:26.920> over<00:02:27.160> one

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
this basically moving this line over one

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.790 
this basically moving this line over one
and<00:02:27.730> then<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:28.480> one<00:02:28.540> over<00:02:28.959> one<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.350> it's<00:02:29.560> all

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
and then that one over one and it's all

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.500 
and then that one over one and it's all
instant<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:30.520> they<00:02:30.610> all<00:02:30.819> activate<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:31.360> at<00:02:31.420> the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
instant so they all activate it at the

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.260 
instant so they all activate it at the
same<00:02:31.660> time<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:32.500> basically<00:02:33.459> when<00:02:33.880> this<00:02:34.000> moves

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
same time and basically when this moves

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.800 
same time and basically when this moves
over<00:02:34.540> one<00:02:37.230> off<00:02:38.230> goes<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.680> first<00:02:39.160> machine<00:02:39.810> goes

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
over one off goes the first machine goes

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.930 
over one off goes the first machine goes
through<00:02:41.020> the<00:02:41.110> lava<00:02:41.349> just<00:02:41.800> so<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.640> don't<00:02:42.819> see

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
through the lava just so you don't see

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.410 
through the lava just so you don't see
the<00:02:43.060> messiness<00:02:43.420> back<00:02:43.810> there<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.680> yeah<00:02:48.420> it's

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
the messiness back there and yeah it's

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.180 
the messiness back there and yeah it's
really<00:02:49.870> awesome<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.530> can<00:02:50.680> do<00:02:50.800> this<00:02:50.950> kind<00:02:51.160> of

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
really awesome you can do this kind of

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.660 
really awesome you can do this kind of
stuff<00:02:51.400> with<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.580> Pistons<00:02:52.000> now

slime blocks oh my gosh and it'll

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.420 
slime blocks oh my gosh and it'll
basically<00:02:56.250> just<00:02:56.790> keep<00:02:57.000> going<00:02:57.270> forever<00:02:58.430> unless

ones this is basically the machine here
and<00:03:21.590> then<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.620> attached<00:03:23.099> this<00:03:23.459> extra<00:03:24.030> part<00:03:24.269> on

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
and then I attached this extra part on

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.800 
and then I attached this extra part on
the<00:03:24.690> front<00:03:24.989> which<00:03:25.580> can<00:03:26.580> be<00:03:26.760> only<00:03:27.060> up<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.510> 12

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
the front which can be only up to 12

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.960 
the front which can be only up to 12
blocks<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.380> that's<00:03:28.590> why<00:03:28.769> they're<00:03:28.980> weird

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
blocks so that's why they're weird

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.180 
blocks so that's why they're weird
shapes<00:03:30.360> because<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.380> have<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.620> also<00:03:31.799> count

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
shapes because you have to also count

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.640 
shapes because you have to also count
this<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:33.209> 1<00:03:33.420> 2<00:03:33.690> 3<00:03:33.720> 4<00:03:34.049> 5<00:03:34.530> 6<00:03:34.769> 7<00:03:35.069> 8<00:03:35.370> 9<00:03:35.610> 10<00:03:35.910> 11<00:03:36.150> 12<00:03:36.650> so

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
this so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 so

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.990 
this so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 so
you<00:03:37.709> can<00:03:37.920> get<00:03:38.040> some<00:03:38.250> decent<00:03:38.489> amount<00:03:38.880> of

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
you can get some decent amount of

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.500 
you can get some decent amount of
variety<00:03:39.299> in<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.380> walls<00:03:40.620> with<00:03:40.950> this<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.510> I

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
variety in the walls with this and I

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.170 
variety in the walls with this and I
will<00:03:42.840> provide<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.799> download<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:44.849> can<00:03:45.060> get

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
will provide a download so you can get

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.759 
will provide a download so you can get
so<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.569> guys<00:03:45.780> can<00:03:45.989> try<00:03:46.140> this<00:03:46.200> out<00:03:46.380> yourself

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
so you guys can try this out yourself

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.430 
so you guys can try this out yourself
and<00:03:47.810> it<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:49.110> a<00:03:49.140> one-time<00:03:49.709> use<00:03:50.040> though<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:51.440> once

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
and it is a one-time use though so once

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.979 
and it is a one-time use though so once
you<00:03:52.620> play<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.480> these<00:03:54.480> things<00:03:54.690> are<00:03:54.810> going<00:03:54.900> to

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
you play it these things are going to

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.030 
you play it these things are going to
keep<00:03:55.170> going<00:03:55.470> off<00:03:55.620> into<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.099> distance<00:03:56.340> and

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
keep going off into the distance and

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.460 
keep going off into the distance and
yeah<00:03:59.690> not<00:04:00.690> really<00:04:00.810> much<00:04:01.079> you<00:04:01.109> can<00:04:01.320> do<00:04:01.440> about

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
yeah not really much you can do about

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.069 
yeah not really much you can do about
that<00:04:01.829> except<00:04:02.790> maybe<00:04:03.239> rebuild<00:04:03.780> them<00:04:03.930> or

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
that except maybe rebuild them or

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.920 
that except maybe rebuild them or
something<00:04:04.640> or<00:04:05.640> just<00:04:05.940> download<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.390> twice<00:04:06.660> and

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
something or just download it twice and

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.090 
something or just download it twice and
play<00:04:07.109> as<00:04:07.230> many<00:04:07.350> times<00:04:07.650> as<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:07.890> want<00:04:09.410> but<00:04:10.410> yeah

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
play as many times as you want but yeah

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.590 
play as many times as you want but yeah
I<00:04:11.430> think<00:04:11.790> I'm<00:04:12.030> going<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.209> show<00:04:12.329> you<00:04:12.390> how<00:04:12.569> to

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
I think I'm going to show you how to

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.539 
I think I'm going to show you how to
build<00:04:12.900> one<00:04:13.140> of<00:04:13.230> these<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:13.590> then<00:04:14.130> I'll<00:04:14.310> also

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
build one of these and then I'll also

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.779 
build one of these and then I'll also
show<00:04:14.880> you<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.150> instant<00:04:15.660> wire<00:04:16.070> all<00:04:17.070> right<00:04:17.489> so

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
show you the instant wire all right so

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.880 
show you the instant wire all right so
to<00:04:17.880> build<00:04:18.239> one<00:04:18.390> of<00:04:18.479> these<00:04:18.539> go<00:04:18.840> up<00:04:18.870> 3<00:04:19.470> from<00:04:19.769> the

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
to build one of these go up 3 from the

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.620 
to build one of these go up 3 from the
ground

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
ground

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.330 
ground
put<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.660> redstone<00:04:21.870> block<00:04:22.139> diagonally<00:04:22.950> from<00:04:23.130> it

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
put a redstone block diagonally from it

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.900 
put a redstone block diagonally from it
like<00:04:24.260> this<00:04:25.260> pattern<00:04:25.800> here<00:04:26.220> with<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:26.760> two

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
like this pattern here with the two

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.290 
like this pattern here with the two
slime<00:04:27.180> blocks<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:27.840> then<00:04:28.350> repeat<00:04:28.950> that<00:04:28.979> again

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.610 

and<00:04:32.390> this<00:04:33.050> one<00:04:33.350> you<00:04:33.880> go<00:04:34.880> up<00:04:35.030> three<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.870> then<00:04:36.440> on

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
and this one you go up three and then on

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.430 
and this one you go up three and then on
top<00:04:36.890> of<00:04:37.100> that<00:04:37.250> a<00:04:39.280> piston<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:40.400> believe<00:04:40.760> yeah<00:04:41.440> then

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
top of that a piston I believe yeah then

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.060 
top of that a piston I believe yeah then
behind<00:04:42.920> that<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:43.700> want<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:44.090> redstone<00:04:44.720> block

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
behind that you want a redstone block

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.580 
behind that you want a redstone block
any<00:04:46.070> more<00:04:46.220> slime<00:04:46.580> blocks<00:04:46.970> there<00:04:47.380> one<00:04:48.380> two

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
any more slime blocks there one two

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.150 
any more slime blocks there one two
three<00:04:48.920> four<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:49.520> down<00:04:49.580> one<00:04:50.210> and<00:04:50.980> then<00:04:51.980> you

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
three four and down one and then you

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.510 
three four and down one and then you
just<00:04:52.400> need<00:04:52.490> one<00:04:52.940> more<00:04:53.200> piston<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:58.190> when<00:04:58.430> you

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
just need one more piston and when you

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.440 
just need one more piston and when you
place<00:04:58.760> that<00:04:59.030> one<00:04:59.240> it'll<00:04:59.770> start<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.950> machine

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
place that one it'll start the machine

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.850 
place that one it'll start the machine
because<00:05:02.450> it'll<00:05:02.630> be<00:05:02.720> powered<00:05:03.290> by<00:05:03.320> the<00:05:03.470> redstone

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
because it'll be powered by the redstone

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.750 
because it'll be powered by the redstone
block<00:05:05.050> but<00:05:06.050> to<00:05:06.200> add<00:05:06.410> it<00:05:06.620> on<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:06.740> wall<00:05:07.070> like<00:05:07.100> I<00:05:07.460> did

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
block but to add it on a wall like I did

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.290 
block but to add it on a wall like I did
just<00:05:08.000> add<00:05:08.450> on<00:05:08.630> another<00:05:08.750> piston<00:05:09.350> in<00:05:09.440> front

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
just add on another piston in front

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.040 
just add on another piston in front
redstone<00:05:11.300> block<00:05:11.630> below<00:05:11.960> that<00:05:12.200> OOP<00:05:13.810> like<00:05:14.810> that

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
redstone block below that OOP like that

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.150 
redstone block below that OOP like that
and<00:05:15.290> then<00:05:15.650> basically<00:05:16.610> you<00:05:17.470> can<00:05:18.470> add<00:05:18.680> on<00:05:18.800> twelve

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
and then basically you can add on twelve

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.860 
and then basically you can add on twelve
blocks<00:05:19.400> including<00:05:19.640> this<00:05:20.030> redstone<00:05:20.420> one<00:05:20.720> so

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
blocks including this redstone one so

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.710 
blocks including this redstone one so
you<00:05:20.960> could<00:05:21.080> do<00:05:21.850> so<00:05:22.850> I<00:05:22.880> mean<00:05:25.690> something<00:05:26.690> like

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
you could do so I mean something like

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.460 
you could do so I mean something like
that<00:05:27.110> and<00:05:27.380> it<00:05:27.590> would<00:05:27.680> work<00:05:27.710> just<00:05:29.290> update<00:05:30.290> this

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
that and it would work just update this

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.990 
that and it would work just update this
piston<00:05:32.440> whoops

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
piston whoops

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.900 
piston whoops
there<00:05:35.000> right<00:05:35.440> that's<00:05:36.440> done

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
there right that's done

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:45.070 
there right that's done
I<00:05:38.860> forgot<00:05:39.860> to<00:05:40.100> put<00:05:40.280> a<00:05:40.340> slime<00:05:40.940> walk<00:05:41.500> there<00:05:44.080> we

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
I forgot to put a slime walk there we

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.670 
I forgot to put a slime walk there we
gotta<00:05:45.290> get<00:05:45.350> one<00:05:45.800> of<00:05:45.860> those<00:05:47.110> okay<00:05:48.110> now<00:05:48.530> it

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
gotta get one of those okay now it

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.260 
gotta get one of those okay now it
should<00:05:48.830> be<00:05:48.980> good

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:06:00.010 

nope<00:05:53.270> that's<00:05:53.570> more<00:05:54.080> than<00:05:55.840> okay<00:05:57.460> there<00:05:58.870> so<00:05:59.870> that

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
nope that's more than okay there so that

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.240 
nope that's more than okay there so that
must<00:06:00.260> be<00:06:00.350> 12<00:06:00.650> blocks

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
must be 12 blocks

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.990 
must be 12 blocks
I<00:06:01.280> have<00:06:02.030> too<00:06:02.270> many<00:06:02.360> and<00:06:03.250> yeah<00:06:04.250> just<00:06:04.490> get<00:06:04.640> 12

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
I have too many and yeah just get 12

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.700 
I have too many and yeah just get 12
locks<00:06:05.270> on<00:06:05.480> there<00:06:05.660> and<00:06:05.870> it<00:06:06.050> will<00:06:06.320> be<00:06:06.380> able<00:06:06.560> to

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
locks on there and it will be able to

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.310 
locks on there and it will be able to
push<00:06:06.920> it<00:06:07.300> and<00:06:08.300> with<00:06:08.510> this<00:06:08.720> you<00:06:08.870> can<00:06:08.990> make<00:06:09.140> all

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
push it and with this you can make all

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.720 
push it and with this you can make all
kinds<00:06:09.380> of<00:06:09.800> crazy<00:06:10.010> stuff<00:06:10.190> I'm<00:06:10.550> sure<00:06:12.550> it's<00:06:13.550> just

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
kinds of crazy stuff I'm sure it's just

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.840 
kinds of crazy stuff I'm sure it's just
unreal<00:06:14.240> how<00:06:15.050> many<00:06:15.290> crazy<00:06:16.100> things<00:06:16.280> people<00:06:16.760> are

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
unreal how many crazy things people are

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.800 
unreal how many crazy things people are
coming<00:06:17.120> out<00:06:17.240> with<00:06:17.270> already<00:06:19.420> next<00:06:20.420> I'm<00:06:20.690> going

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
coming out with already next I'm going

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.840 
coming out with already next I'm going
to<00:06:20.900> show<00:06:21.080> you<00:06:21.110> how<00:06:21.440> to<00:06:21.470> build<00:06:21.860> instant<00:06:22.520> wire

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
to show you how to build instant wire

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:31.360 
to show you how to build instant wire
really<00:06:23.810> really<00:06:24.140> easy<00:06:24.410> to<00:06:24.830> do<00:06:26.020> it's<00:06:27.490> piston<00:06:30.370> so

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
really really easy to do it's piston so

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.060 
really really easy to do it's piston so
I<00:06:31.760> just<00:06:32.270> went<00:06:32.450> out<00:06:32.600> 11<00:06:33.320> blocks<00:06:33.650> and<00:06:33.950> then

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
I just went out 11 blocks and then

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.120 
I just went out 11 blocks and then
placed<00:06:34.370> a<00:06:34.520> redstone<00:06:34.880> block<00:06:35.500> and<00:06:36.500> then<00:06:36.830> another

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
placed a redstone block and then another

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.150 
placed a redstone block and then another
one<00:06:37.640> and<00:06:38.270> basically<00:06:39.020> continue<00:06:39.590> that<00:06:39.770> pattern

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.970 

and<00:06:43.600> you<00:06:44.600> can<00:06:44.630> do<00:06:44.840> all<00:06:45.110> kinds<00:06:45.560> of<00:06:45.590> stuff<00:06:45.830> with

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
and you can do all kinds of stuff with

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.280 
and you can do all kinds of stuff with
this<00:06:46.160> like<00:06:46.880> even<00:06:47.240> make<00:06:47.390> it<00:06:47.540> curve<00:06:47.780> like<00:06:47.990> this

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.290 
this like even make it curve like this

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.810 
this like even make it curve like this
right<00:06:48.950> here<00:06:49.300> and<00:06:50.560> when<00:06:51.560> that<00:06:51.800> pulls<00:06:52.160> in<00:06:52.370> that's

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
right here and when that pulls in that's

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.510 
right here and when that pulls in that's
going<00:06:53.000> to<00:06:53.060> move<00:06:53.150> this<00:06:53.420> whole<00:06:53.720> structure<00:06:54.520> left

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
going to move this whole structure left

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.220 
going to move this whole structure left
one<00:06:55.790> and<00:06:56.060> it's<00:06:56.540> actually<00:06:56.810> going<00:06:56.930> to<00:06:56.990> end<00:06:57.050> up

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:57.230 
one and it's actually going to end up

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.840 
one and it's actually going to end up
sticking<00:06:57.560> on<00:06:57.860> to<00:06:58.510> the<00:06:59.510> beacon<00:06:59.930> I<00:07:00.050> think<00:07:00.850> so

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:01.850 
sticking on to the beacon I think so

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.610 
sticking on to the beacon I think so
this<00:07:02.000> is<00:07:02.150> going<00:07:02.330> to<00:07:02.390> be<00:07:02.540> pushed<00:07:03.290> if<00:07:04.040> we

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.230 

Oh<00:07:07.570> deactivate<00:07:08.570> this<00:07:08.690> is<00:07:08.900> what<00:07:09.050> I<00:07:09.080> need<00:07:09.320> to<00:07:09.350> do

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 
Oh deactivate this is what I need to do

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:18.310 
Oh deactivate this is what I need to do
so<00:07:12.640> like<00:07:13.640> that<00:07:15.850> yeah<00:07:16.850> that<00:07:17.120> piston<00:07:17.840> ended<00:07:18.200> up

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:18.320 
so like that yeah that piston ended up

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.260 
so like that yeah that piston ended up
pushing<00:07:18.620> and<00:07:19.010> did<00:07:19.550> they<00:07:19.640> pick<00:07:19.850> up<00:07:20.000> beacons

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.270 
pushing and did they pick up beacons

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.740 
pushing and did they pick up beacons
looks<00:07:23.270> like<00:07:23.510> they<00:07:23.690> don't<00:07:24.040> hmm<00:07:25.360> all<00:07:26.360> right<00:07:26.540> so

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:26.750 
looks like they don't hmm all right so

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.030 
looks like they don't hmm all right so
yeah<00:07:27.230> this<00:07:27.410> is<00:07:27.470> basically<00:07:28.070> instant<00:07:28.430> wire<00:07:30.040> when

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:31.040 
yeah this is basically instant wire when

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.740 
yeah this is basically instant wire when
it's<00:07:31.160> extending<00:07:31.730> it<00:07:31.910> takes<00:07:32.150> a<00:07:32.270> tiny<00:07:32.510> bit<00:07:32.720> of

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:32.750 
it's extending it takes a tiny bit of

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:42.070 
it's extending it takes a tiny bit of
time<00:07:33.790> but<00:07:34.790> D<00:07:35.570> extending<00:07:36.200> is<00:07:36.350> instant<00:07:41.050> so<00:07:42.050> I

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 
time but D extending is instant so I

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.100 
time but D extending is instant so I
hope<00:07:42.530> you<00:07:42.620> enjoyed<00:07:42.890> this<00:07:43.010> video<00:07:43.250> and<00:07:43.840> if<00:07:44.840> you
