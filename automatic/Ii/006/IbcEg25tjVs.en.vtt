00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.510
 thank you very much, fellow friends 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.980
 happy Thursday let's start even with the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.869
 weather conditions because 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.700
 we have a lot of activity on our radar 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.929
 and satellite nationwide 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.210
 primarily because we are talking 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.220
 from two different systems we have a 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.590
 low pressure on the great lakes 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.599
 is speaking a frontal system this already 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.310
 is causing rainstorms activity and 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.650
 scattered storms for the northeast of 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.250
 the united nation like the storm 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.380
 tropical 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.269
 Andrea from early hours was 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.400
 whipping the whole peninsula of florida 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:38.370
 with persistent rain storms 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.870
 causing tornadoes seven tornadoes 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.970
 they were reported today south of the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.920
 florida no fatalities or injuries 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.570
 but many structural damage and 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.670
 injuries well thank you very much soul already 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.760
 I got excited and all friends came the end 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.949
 of the week and how we have started with 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.269
 very rich conditions the truth for 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.920
 be outdoors high system 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.140
 pressure bringing only in fullness of 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.960
 those and quite dry conditions there 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.489
 outside with low humidity levels here 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.409
 in our locality light winds 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.810
 entering from the northeast east and the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.390
 maximum temperature just today reaching 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.950
 75 degrees under sky completely 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.659
 Sunny if I tell you what the area does 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.640
 coastal 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.380
 a red flag warning for those 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.149
 strong winds and those low levels of 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.329
 moisture this including corpus christi 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.560
 but it's already canceled hours and friends 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.909
 of hands with the conditions at level 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.600
 national we are talking about another 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.850
 storm 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.859
 imbert the number 26 is called ceos and is 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.289
 already depositing snow activity for 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.689
 colorado the dakotas minnesota here 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.909
 they could be fine in 6 to 12 inches 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.009
 in the forecast of the next 12 to 24 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.630
 hours south of the frontal system 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.490
 precipitation activity some 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.959
 storms that have the potential to 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.490
 take severe especially for 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:45.439
 oklahoma and kansas today 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.299
 obviously for us what is going to 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.489
 touch is this frontal system will come 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.689
 for tomorrow night this is the one 

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:52.640
 is going to be causing activity of 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.379
 rainfall of the nation returning 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.450
 home for tonight we will continue 

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:58.670
 watching cloudy sky possibilities 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.079
 rain still dormant very light 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.700
 according to 20 percent that yes the 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.239
 temperatures will continue quite 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.310
 fresh between 54 to 55 degrees the winds 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:10.220
 a little lighter entering the north 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.510
 northwest between 5 to 10 miles per hour 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.340
 but these possibilities are going to be 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.780
 greatly increasing what is the 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.040
 tomorrow Friday night toward 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.950
 early morning 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.500
 that's 50 to 70 percent 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.060
 torrential downpours possible some 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.640
 storms that could become 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.040
 severe also possible with hail and 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.689
 winds exceeding 58 miles per 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.549
 Not all storms are going to have an hour 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:34.030
 these factors some if they could 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.409
 develop the 70 percent friends 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.030
 It is usually for the early morning of 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.920
 tomorrow Friday to Saturday so have 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.290
 this very very pending to the 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.150
 temperatures I say they will be 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.340
 extremely cold for this time of 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.629
 year there is not going to be a big change like 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.689
 can see between the maximum and the minimum 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.430
 for tomorrow 53 that minimum still 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.319
 present at the inn of rainfall 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.879
 at 30 percent for Thursday though 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.209
 we are going to recover the 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.099
 temperatures gradually Friday 88 70 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.659
 yes I want to mention that we have a 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.879
 very small and sima possibility of 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.040
 precipitation starting on Saturday 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.480
 the night this is an instability that 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.180
 will come from the mountainous area of 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.129
 mexico so we 'll still see what 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.180
 will happen with this for the weekend 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.859
 but usually the truth 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.079
 relatively stable conditions for 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.400
 the weekend we'll see tomorrow is a 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.590
 hot coffee day 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.049
 I believe that the last of the year I hope 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.049
 because also the temperature of the sea
