we<00:00:09.710> must<00:00:09.920> know<00:00:10.099> the<00:00:10.250> basic<00:00:10.639> shapes<00:00:11.349> from<00:00:12.349> the<00:00:12.589> C

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
we must know the basic shapes from the C

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.380 
we must know the basic shapes from the C
major<00:00:13.070> triad<00:00:13.429> we<00:00:14.090> had<00:00:14.240> a<00:00:14.269> major<00:00:14.509> seven<00:00:16.210> we<00:00:17.210> got

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
major triad we had a major seven we got

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:32.189 
major triad we had a major seven we got
a<00:00:17.420> major<00:00:17.570> seven<00:00:18.020> chord<00:00:19.000> a<00:00:23.919> lot<00:00:24.919> of<00:00:25.070> flat<00:00:25.250> seven

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.280 

and<00:00:34.000> we'll<00:00:35.000> add<00:00:35.150> a<00:00:35.180> sixth<00:00:35.540> which<00:00:35.720> gives<00:00:35.989> us<00:00:36.110> a

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
and we'll add a sixth which gives us a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:44.710 
and we'll add a sixth which gives us a
major<00:00:36.470> sixth<00:00:37.070> chord

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.750 

those<00:00:45.720> were<00:00:45.900> all<00:00:46.080> from<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.290> root<00:00:46.640> we'll<00:00:47.640> go

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
those were all from the root we'll go

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.220 
those were all from the root we'll go
ahead<00:00:47.880> and<00:00:48.150> practice<00:00:48.300> all<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.720> these<00:00:48.990> things

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
ahead and practice all of these things

00:00:49.230 --> 00:01:01.670 
ahead and practice all of these things
with<00:00:49.890> minor<00:00:50.220> from<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> root<00:00:50.880> as<00:00:51.090> well<00:01:00.680> minor

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
with minor from the root as well minor

with minor from the root as well minor
with<00:01:02.040> a<00:01:02.070> major<00:01:02.309> 7<00:01:02.700> becomes<00:01:02.880> a<00:01:03.150> minor<00:01:03.360> major

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
with a major 7 becomes a minor major

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
becomes a minor 6th chord now we move

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:48.440 
becomes a minor 6th chord now we move
into<00:01:33.890> diminished<00:01:34.890> triad<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:46.670> lot<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.759> major<00:01:47.940> 7<00:01:48.330> -

at<00:02:52.950> flat<00:02:53.310> seven<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.879> you<00:02:53.970> get<00:02:54.120> dominant

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
at flat seven and you get dominant
