00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.430
 Hello ladies and gentlemen with you 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.410
 Valentine 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.689
 No, I still played a new need for 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.880
 speed I did not pass the game to the end but 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.610
 played a considerable time and so decided 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.040
 Share your opinion about the game it 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.130
 Will go about the version for the new Xbox in 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.470
 the game has no plot though 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.779
 projects he rarely gets there thoughts we 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.259
 remember in the previous parts of the series need for 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.540
 speed 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.180
 still had something to tell this time 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.820
 we see the usual career system and the very 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.270
 at the beginning we have a choice tip and 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.820
 easy 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.860
 no matter whom you choose as at any 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.440
 time can switch from one 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.870
 career mode on a different schedule quite 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.510
 not bad but by and large not special 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.070
 different from the version on ps3 consoles or 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.930
 xbox 360 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.730
 except on higher 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.060
 the settings we see and inflatable balls 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.940
 which form the air after all this is not 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.430
 climb well of course not true than 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.439
 NPS is famous as it seems to me like this 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.390
 dynamic cameras that are fun 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:13.390
 reacts to collision ups falls 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.729
 ashore and so on no less then 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.890
 operator I have a question 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.560
 certain moments the view switches 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.189
 so 100 I see what's going on 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.590
 behind 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.350
 it often happens during the chase i'm not 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.969
 I can understand for what and 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.710
 someone types of gate cards and see the road 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.710
 on the networks you do not see the gopher 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.710
 I do not see own, there is also us again 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.270
 rather than a lot of tools 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.500
 vehicle modifications 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.750
 well, why let's change the color and set 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.270
 magical technology inside on top of 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.640
 the we can still draw two sticks 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.350
 on the hood class especially me 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.689
 I liked that fact Sarajevo HP 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.549
 use the concept of a public game then 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.979
 have a gaming session has rights 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.049
 join another player of course 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.420
 You can exclude these functions but not 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.240
 less I left everything as it is and not once 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.950
 nobody joined and every time 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.170
 when the game tried to connect to the network 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.080
 throw me into the world with other players 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.970
 always happened disconnect but let's about 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.310
 that worked and enjoyed 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.680
 at the same time in the game open world 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.349
 Well, this will not surprise anyone as well what 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.060
 clues gamer new part koldy or in 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.880
 In this case, NPC 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.069
 rhymes project on which largely 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.500
 do not care about the publishers 1 studios 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.220
 pass the other one also not really 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.500
 interesting yes anyway back to 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.600
 cream itself despite the fact that 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.820
 compatibility of different climates on so 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.730
 small territory not quite say 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.620
 so real individually with location 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.030
 I was pleased here we are in the city center 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.730
 here in the forest 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.230
 and then the snow 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.239
 I was also pleased by the fact that 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.110
 you can start a new race while escaping 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.030
 from the police 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.909
 that is, you see the car you press 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.430
 agree and the race begins gps 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.590
 draws a route get off with it is connected and 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.810
 another cool thing even if you 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.200
 turned the wrong way if you try 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.540
 again you will be on your way here and kinap 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.390
 plays an important role let's say you quickly 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.280
 chase like fly but from the song at all 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.890
 does not help create appropriate 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.470
 so say the magic atmosphere 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.629
 phrase next cancer and play 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.370
 next track like voice 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.019
 teams are quite useful when a player 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.269
 centered over the road 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.579
 so kinect is truly comfortable 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.190
 thing and I did not expect his these chips 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.079
 Bach will be only implemented in this game 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.970
 me once 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.260
 npc rivals you can drive time from 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.209
 but no more time 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.430
 if you do not agree with my opinion then 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.670
 this is wonderful because we live in a world where 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.150
 to mark opinion but seriously do not think 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.310
 otherwise 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.290
 better subscribe to the channel but there 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.190
 look with you was valentine 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.190
 see you friends
