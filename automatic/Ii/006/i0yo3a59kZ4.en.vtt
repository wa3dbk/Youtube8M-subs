sensors in the back bumper and in the
bed<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.520> get<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.760> deck<00:02:50.940> rail<00:02:51.150> system<00:02:51.180> so

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
bed and you get the deck rail system so

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:09.699 
bed and you get the deck rail system so
they're<00:02:52.050> adjustable<00:02:52.770> cargo<00:02:53.670> tie-downs

so<00:03:10.709> have<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.010> 2009<00:03:11.489> tundra<00:03:12.030> limited<00:03:12.860> Crewmax

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
so have it 2009 tundra limited Crewmax

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.610 
so have it 2009 tundra limited Crewmax
pyrite<00:03:14.430> mica
