here at Braden Hanson for today's
protest<00:00:02.820> it<00:00:03.000> was<00:00:03.090> good<00:00:03.240> HTT<00:00:03.600> idea<00:00:03.870> quarterback

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
protest it was good HTT idea quarterback

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.220 
protest it was good HTT idea quarterback
so<00:00:05.400> what's<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.879> first<00:00:06.150> thing<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.720> need<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.140> know

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
so what's the first thing I need to know

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.629 
so what's the first thing I need to know
about<00:00:07.350> being<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.649> quarterback<00:00:07.980> first<00:00:08.429> thing

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
about being a quarterback first thing

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.919 
about being a quarterback first thing
about<00:00:08.700> being<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.059> quarterback<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.719> have<00:00:09.809> to

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
about being a quarterback is you have to

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.629 
about being a quarterback is you have to
understand<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.620> defensive<00:00:11.130> coverage<00:00:11.340> that

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
understand the defensive coverage that

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.610 
understand the defensive coverage that
they're<00:00:11.759> going<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.940> bring<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:12.450> there's<00:00:13.230> two

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
they're going to bring in so there's two

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.230 
they're going to bring in so there's two
different<00:00:14.009> families<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.429> coverages<00:00:15.030> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
different families of coverages the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.939 
different families of coverages the
middle<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> field<00:00:15.900> open<00:00:16.410> which<00:00:16.920> means

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
middle of the field open which means

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.470 
middle of the field open which means
there's<00:00:17.340> two<00:00:17.490> high<00:00:17.640> safeties<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.359> there's

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
there's two high safeties and there's

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.939 
there's two high safeties and there's
middle<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.900> field<00:00:19.080> close<00:00:19.410> which<00:00:19.740> means

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
middle of the field close which means

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.830 
middle of the field close which means
there's<00:00:20.189> one<00:00:20.400> high<00:00:20.580> safety<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.720> will

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
there's one high safety and that will

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.320 
there's one high safety and that will
obviously<00:00:22.109> dictate<00:00:23.000> what<00:00:24.000> sorts<00:00:24.269> of

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
obviously dictate what sorts of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.730 
obviously dictate what sorts of
coverages<00:00:24.750> they<00:00:24.869> can<00:00:25.050> do<00:00:25.199> but<00:00:25.439> those<00:00:25.560> are<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
coverages they can do but those are the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.990 
coverages they can do but those are the
two<00:00:25.890> basic<00:00:26.039> families<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.880> to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
two basic families that you have to

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.450 
two basic families that you have to
understand<00:00:27.390> okay<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.640> when<00:00:29.640> you're<00:00:29.789> lining<00:00:29.970> up

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.360 

yes<00:00:36.290> so<00:00:37.290> middle<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.710> field<00:00:37.920> close<00:00:38.160> you're

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
yes so middle of the field close you're

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.950 
yes so middle of the field close you're
gonna<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:38.850> high<00:00:39.000> safety<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:39.840> to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
gonna have one high safety so you do to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.610 
gonna have one high safety so you do to
be<00:00:40.079> cover<00:00:40.350> 1<00:00:40.590> cover<00:00:40.860> 3<00:00:42.020> or<00:00:43.020> some<00:00:43.290> sort<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.530> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
be cover 1 cover 3 or some sort of a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.680 
be cover 1 cover 3 or some sort of a
cover<00:00:43.829> 9<00:00:44.100> look<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.030> basically<00:00:45.360> means

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
cover 9 look but that basically means

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.389 
cover 9 look but that basically means
that<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.200> middle<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.649> field<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.100> closed

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that the middle of the field is closed

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.190 
that the middle of the field is closed
so<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.640> more<00:00:48.570> than<00:00:48.719> likely<00:00:48.840> you're<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
so you more than likely you're going to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.529 
so you more than likely you're going to
go<00:00:49.289> outside<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> flat<00:00:50.579> route<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
go outside or to the flat route to the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.939 
go outside or to the flat route to the
sidelines<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> middle<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.739> field

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
sidelines but if the middle of the field

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.479 
sidelines but if the middle of the field
is<00:00:53.100> open<00:00:53.250> there's<00:00:53.670> two<00:00:53.820> high<00:00:53.940> safeties<00:00:55.489> you

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
is open there's two high safeties you

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.770 
is open there's two high safeties you
can<00:00:56.610> either<00:00:56.760> work<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.149> middle<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.510> field

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
can either work the middle of the field

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.689 
can either work the middle of the field
or<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.109> cover<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.890> corners<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.489> play

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
or in cover to the corners have to play

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.729 
or in cover to the corners have to play
tight<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> touch<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> line<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
tight to the touch of the line of

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.779 
tight to the touch of the line of
scrimmage<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.219> try<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> work<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
scrimmage you can try to work up the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.759 
scrimmage you can try to work up the
sidelines<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> most<00:01:03.930> basic<00:01:04.379> coverage

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
sidelines so the most basic coverage

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.109 
sidelines so the most basic coverage
that<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> lot<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.220> teams<00:01:05.460> will<00:01:05.519> try<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.760> play<00:01:05.939> is

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
that a lot of teams will try to play is

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.490 
that a lot of teams will try to play is
called<00:01:06.299> cover<00:01:06.570> two<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.350> is

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
called cover two and that what that is

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.920 
called cover two and that what that is
is<00:01:07.799> too<00:01:08.189> deep<00:01:08.400> safeties<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.180> they<00:01:09.479> play<00:01:09.689> half

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
is too deep safeties and they play half

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.450 
is too deep safeties and they play half
of<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.260> field<00:01:10.500> that's<00:01:10.680> their<00:01:11.010> deep

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
of the field that's their deep

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.850 
of the field that's their deep
responsibilities<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.510> he<00:01:12.659> has<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:13.650> there's

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
responsibilities that he has but there's

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.670 
responsibilities that he has but there's
there's<00:01:14.670> two<00:01:15.060> deep<00:01:15.240> safeties<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:15.990> Beach

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
there's two deep safeties on it's Beach

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.950 
there's two deep safeties on it's Beach
half<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:17.970> there's<00:01:18.150> five<00:01:18.450> underneath

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
half but then there's five underneath

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.420 
half but then there's five underneath
the<00:01:19.080> cover<00:01:19.290> man<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> strength<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.310> that

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the cover man so the strength of that

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.609 
the cover man so the strength of that
defense<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.540> underneath<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.200> corners

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
defense is be underneath the corners

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.440 
defense is be underneath the corners
traditionally<00:01:23.610> will<00:01:23.759> try<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.939> jam<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
traditionally will try to jam the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.120 
traditionally will try to jam the
receivers<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.020> funnel<00:01:25.409> them<00:01:25.560> inside<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
receivers and funnel them inside of the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.219 
receivers and funnel them inside of the
safeties<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> weakness<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.990> there's

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
safeties but the weakness is there's

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.140 
safeties but the weakness is there's
only<00:01:28.380> two<00:01:28.680> deep<00:01:28.890> defenders<00:01:29.400> versus<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.939> cover

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
only two deep defenders versus on cover

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
only two deep defenders versus on cover
three<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.600> cover<00:01:30.780> four<00:01:31.079> there's<00:01:31.740> three<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
three and cover four there's three and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.800 
three and cover four there's three and
there's<00:01:32.340> four<00:01:32.579> deep<00:01:32.790> defenders<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.450> uncovered

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
there's four deep defenders so uncovered

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.810 
there's four deep defenders so uncovered
-<00:01:33.930> there's<00:01:34.170> only<00:01:34.259> two<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.310> try<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.490> attack

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
- there's only two so we try to attack

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.270 
- there's only two so we try to attack
down<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> field<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.930> deep<00:01:37.530> play<00:01:37.799> actions

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
down the field with deep play actions

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.760 
down the field with deep play actions
and<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:38.490> try<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.810> send<00:01:39.810> three<00:01:40.049> receivers<00:01:40.560> out

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and we try to send three receivers out

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.590 
and we try to send three receivers out
to<00:01:41.310> make<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.759> those<00:01:41.850> safeties<00:01:42.360> wrong

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
to make one of those safeties wrong

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.969 
to make one of those safeties wrong
because<00:01:42.810> there's<00:01:43.020> only<00:01:43.170> two<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.409> them<00:01:43.619> okay<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
because there's only two of them okay I

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.889 
because there's only two of them okay I
would<00:01:44.130> say<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.250> difficult<00:01:44.790> read<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.240> sometimes

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
would say a difficult read and sometimes

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.120 
would say a difficult read and sometimes
we'll<00:01:46.020> run<00:01:46.170> what's<00:01:46.350> called<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.619> flood<00:01:46.890> route

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
we'll run what's called a flood route

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.190 
we'll run what's called a flood route
where<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.759> outside<00:01:48.119> receiver<00:01:48.270> will<00:01:48.780> go<00:01:48.930> deep

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
where the outside receiver will go deep

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.469 
where the outside receiver will go deep
and<00:01:49.470> then<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> second<00:01:50.729> receivers<00:01:51.119> gonna<00:01:51.299> run

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and then the second receivers gonna run

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.420 
and then the second receivers gonna run
kind<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.869> 10<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.170> 15<00:01:52.560> yard<00:01:52.829> corner<00:01:53.250> route
