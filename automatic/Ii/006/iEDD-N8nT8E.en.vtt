00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
pretty much whatever stance you can get

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.930 
pretty much whatever stance you can get
him<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.130> getting<00:01:11.310> them<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.700> stance

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
him in but getting them in that stance

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.330 
him in but getting them in that stance
is<00:01:12.119> pretty<00:01:12.330> hard<00:01:12.479> because<00:01:12.720> his<00:01:12.960> legs<00:01:13.140> are

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
is pretty hard because his legs are

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.550 
is pretty hard because his legs are
pretty<00:01:14.340> wobbly<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.510> can<00:01:15.660> see<00:01:15.869> his<00:01:16.170> legs

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
pretty wobbly if you can see his legs

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.760 
pretty wobbly if you can see his legs
are<00:01:16.710> made<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.040> three<00:01:17.340> different<00:01:17.640> parts<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
are made of three different parts and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.590 
are made of three different parts and
those<00:01:19.770> parts<00:01:20.340> are<00:01:20.460> all<00:01:21.030> held<00:01:21.300> together<00:01:21.390> by

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
those parts are all held together by

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.670 
those parts are all held together by
plastic<00:01:22.550> so<00:01:23.550> it's<00:01:24.170> pretty<00:01:25.170> hard<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.440> give<00:01:25.590> them

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
plastic so it's pretty hard to give them

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.150 
plastic so it's pretty hard to give them
to<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.830> stay<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.580> some<00:01:26.850> stances<00:01:27.979> what<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.040> mean

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
to like stay in some stances what I mean

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.620 
to like stay in some stances what I mean
as<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.610> here<00:01:29.820> he's<00:01:30.030> been<00:01:30.330> a<00:01:30.420> pretty

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
as you can see here he's been a pretty

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.930 
as you can see here he's been a pretty
stable<00:01:31.050> that<00:01:31.740> happens<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.100> lot<00:01:32.160> too<00:01:32.400> uh-huh

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
stable that happens a lot too uh-huh

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.060 
stable that happens a lot too uh-huh
he's<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.080> pretty<00:01:34.229> stretched<00:01:34.560> out<00:01:34.740> stance

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
he's in a pretty stretched out stance

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.960 
he's in a pretty stretched out stance
and<00:01:36.259> yeah<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> second<00:01:38.220> problem<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.550> why

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and yeah now the second problem is why

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.030 
and yeah now the second problem is why
it<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.450> fell<00:01:39.630> out<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:40.050> you<00:01:40.230> can<00:01:40.320> see<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.770> hooks

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it just fell out as you can see it hooks

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.440 
it just fell out as you can see it hooks
up<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.360> plastic<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.330> as<00:01:45.330> you

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
up like that it's just plastic so as you

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.950 
up like that it's just plastic so as you
can<00:01:45.540> see<00:01:45.690> they're<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.200> plastic

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
can see they're just plastic

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.760 
can see they're just plastic
so<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.799> legs<00:01:49.010> fall<00:01:49.340> out<00:01:49.549> eat<00:01:50.360> lots<00:01:50.750> it's<00:01:51.470> not

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
so the legs fall out eat lots it's not

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.170 
so the legs fall out eat lots it's not
anything<00:01:52.070> big<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.340> can<00:01:52.610> just<00:01:52.760> push<00:01:52.940> them<00:01:53.030> back

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
anything big and can just push them back

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.690 
anything big and can just push them back
in<00:01:53.390> their<00:01:54.020> fine<00:01:54.260> and<00:01:54.530> if<00:01:55.340> you're<00:01:55.490> just

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
in their fine and if you're just

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.190

supposed<00:02:24.709> to<00:02:24.769> stretch<00:02:25.160> out<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:26.380> it's<00:02:27.380> pretty

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
supposed to stretch out and it's pretty

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.350 
supposed to stretch out and it's pretty
much<00:02:27.860> impossible<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.519> make<00:02:28.730> them<00:02:28.880> stretch<00:02:29.150> out

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
much impossible to make them stretch out

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.860 
much impossible to make them stretch out
and<00:02:29.540> when<00:02:30.470> they<00:02:30.560> do<00:02:31.180> they<00:02:32.180> don't<00:02:32.450> stretch<00:02:32.720> out

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
and when they do they don't stretch out

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.970 
and when they do they don't stretch out

goal and all the rest of the details as
you<00:03:48.440> can<00:03:48.560> see<00:03:48.710> on<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.950> top<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.610> numbers<00:03:49.970> are

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
you can see on the top the numbers are

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.940 
you can see on the top the numbers are
all<00:03:51.800> the<00:03:52.220> scratch-off<00:03:52.850> decals<00:03:53.630> so<00:03:54.470> they<00:03:54.800> don't

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
all the scratch-off decals so they don't

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.160 
all the scratch-off decals so they don't
leave<00:03:55.100> any<00:03:55.340> sort<00:03:55.610> of<00:03:55.670> gloss<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.600> it's<00:03:56.960> pretty

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
leave any sort of gloss and it's pretty

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.199 
leave any sort of gloss and it's pretty
hard<00:03:57.380> to<00:03:57.440> tell<00:03:57.680> that<00:03:57.800> through<00:03:57.980> details

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
hard to tell that through details

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.429 
hard to tell that through details
yeah<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.450> design<00:04:01.750> in<00:04:01.870> this<00:04:02.019> is<00:04:02.170> actually

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
yeah the design in this is actually

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.050 
yeah the design in this is actually
pretty<00:04:02.590> cool<00:04:02.769> too<00:04:02.980> if<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:03.760> look<00:04:03.849> at<00:04:03.969> the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
pretty cool too if you look at the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.990 
pretty cool too if you look at the
bottom<00:04:04.480> of<00:04:04.599> the<00:04:04.719> feet<00:04:04.870> has<00:04:05.739> all<00:04:05.980> sorts<00:04:06.790> of
