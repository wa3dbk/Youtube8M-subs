00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
accuracy and the damage is so high on a

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.520 
accuracy and the damage is so high on a
lot<00:04:05.609> of<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.790> guns<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.959> just<00:04:07.200> doesn't

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
do thi sensitivity and do well because

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.360 
do thi sensitivity and do well because
you<00:04:15.299> like<00:04:15.450> turning<00:04:15.810> on<00:04:15.870> bad<00:04:16.350> kids<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:16.799> guess<00:04:16.859> I'm

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
you like turning on bad kids I guess I'm

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.000

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
sure but you know what i like to prepare

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.659 
sure but you know what i like to prepare
against<00:04:20.780> good<00:04:21.780> players<00:04:21.959> so<00:04:22.500> in<00:04:23.130> that<00:04:23.430> case<00:04:23.610> you

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
against good players so in that case you

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.250 
against good players so in that case you
just<00:04:23.849> you<00:04:24.150> want<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.390> be<00:04:24.630> as<00:04:24.750> accurate<00:04:24.960> as

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
just you want to be as accurate as

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.580 
just you want to be as accurate as
possible<00:04:25.320> so

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
possible so

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.439 
possible so
on<00:04:26.800> like<00:04:26.980> a<00:04:27.010> two<00:04:27.460> or<00:04:27.490> three<00:04:27.760> sensitivity

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
on like a two or three sensitivity

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.320 
on like a two or three sensitivity
usually<00:04:29.320> because<00:04:29.740> it<00:04:30.370> also<00:04:30.850> helps<00:04:31.060> you<00:04:31.150> shoot

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
usually because it also helps you shoot

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.150 
usually because it also helps you shoot
people<00:04:31.630> from<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:31.870> longer<00:04:32.680> distance<00:04:32.949> away<00:04:33.310> and

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
people from a longer distance away and

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.680 
people from a longer distance away and
you<00:04:36.160> know<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:36.280> wish<00:04:36.760> there<00:04:36.970> was<00:04:37.090> I<00:04:37.270> wish<00:04:37.510> there

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
you know I wish there was I wish there

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.540 
you know I wish there was I wish there
was<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:37.840> competitive<00:04:38.199> playlist<00:04:38.860> like<00:04:39.400> there

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
was a competitive playlist like there

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.219 
was a competitive playlist like there
was<00:04:39.699> in<00:04:39.850> black<00:04:40.090> ops<00:04:40.300> I<00:04:40.630> hope<00:04:40.750> they<00:04:40.870> bring<00:04:41.050> that

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
was in black ops I hope they bring that

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.800 
was in black ops I hope they bring that
back<00:04:41.440> as<00:04:41.740> well<00:04:42.010> because<00:04:42.940> it<00:04:43.270> just<00:04:43.419> gives<00:04:43.690> you

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
back as well because it just gives you

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.300 
back as well because it just gives you
an<00:04:43.900> opportunity<00:04:44.139> to<00:04:44.470> play<00:04:44.680> against<00:04:44.919> a<00:04:45.070> lot<00:04:45.220> of
