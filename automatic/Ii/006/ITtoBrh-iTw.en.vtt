00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
one of those is a secondary weapon so

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.839 
one of those is a secondary weapon so
that's<00:00:23.910> that's<00:00:24.480> good<00:00:24.660> news<00:00:24.960> at<00:00:25.109> least<00:00:25.849> anyway

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
that's that's good news at least anyway

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
that's that's good news at least anyway
I<00:00:26.880> don't<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.300> too<00:00:27.420> much<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.720> way<00:00:27.840> of

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
I don't have too much in the way of

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.169 
I don't have too much in the way of
clips<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> hs10<00:00:28.859> as<00:00:29.400> well<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:29.970> only

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
clips for the hs10 as well I only

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.359 
clips for the hs10 as well I only
recorded<00:00:30.510> two<00:00:31.109> attachments<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:31.890> rather<00:00:32.130> one

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
recorded two attachments or rather one

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.650 
recorded two attachments or rather one
attachment<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> absence<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.510> that

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
attachment and the absence of that

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.080 
attachment and the absence of that
attachment<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.680> we've<00:00:34.800> got<00:00:34.920> about<00:00:35.010> 8<00:00:35.730> minutes

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
attachment so we've got about 8 minutes

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.729 
attachment so we've got about 8 minutes
by<00:00:36.300> my<00:00:36.480> reckoning<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> should<00:00:37.649> probably

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
by my reckoning so I should probably

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.470 
by my reckoning so I should probably
crack<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.670> with<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.850> questions<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.390> not

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
crack on with the questions and not

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.020 
crack on with the questions and not
waste<00:00:39.660> too<00:00:39.780> much<00:00:39.809> time

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
waste too much time

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.549 
waste too much time

fill<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> gap<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.350> nicely<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.549> do<00:01:38.939> select

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
fill a gap really nicely so I do select

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.649 
fill a gap really nicely so I do select
everything<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:41.119> then<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.329> sort<00:01:42.600> of

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
everything like that and then I sort of

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.929 
everything like that and then I sort of
I<00:01:42.780> use<00:01:42.930> markers<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.560> delineate<00:01:44.159> everything<00:01:44.759> by

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
I use markers to delineate everything by

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.880 
I use markers to delineate everything by
different<00:01:45.450> attachments<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.500> everything<00:01:46.799> is

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
different attachments so everything is

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.760 
different attachments so everything is
organized<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.820> project<00:01:48.240> file<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.770> then

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
organized in the project file and then

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.710 
organized in the project file and then
what<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.369> order<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.729> select<00:01:50.880> clips<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.509> I

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
what I do in order to select clips is I

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.990 
what I do in order to select clips is I
will<00:01:52.200> review<00:01:52.500> all<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.920> clips<00:01:53.220> once

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
will review all of the clips once

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.910 
will review all of the clips once
they're<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:54.270> split<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.530> pick<00:01:55.799> out

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
they're all split and I pick out

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.380 
they're all split and I pick out
anything<00:01:56.189> that's<00:01:56.340> particularly<00:01:56.880> impressive

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
anything that's particularly impressive

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.740 
anything that's particularly impressive
or<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.899> another<00:01:58.500> one<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.890> include<00:01:59.299> so<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.329> pick

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
or and another one to include so I pick

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.539 
or and another one to include so I pick
out<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.049> top<00:02:01.530> 25%<00:02:02.159> or<00:02:02.579> top<00:02:02.729> 10%<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.390> clips<00:02:03.600> and

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
out the top 25% or top 10% of clips and

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.370 
out the top 25% or top 10% of clips and
I'll<00:02:05.549> pick<00:02:05.790> up<00:02:05.939> from<00:02:06.119> those<00:02:06.329> first<00:02:06.750> top<00:02:07.110> clips

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
I'll pick up from those first top clips

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.219 
I'll pick up from those first top clips
and<00:02:07.619> then<00:02:07.829> if<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:09.060> need<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.539> I'll<00:02:09.720> pick<00:02:09.929> sort<00:02:10.170> of

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
and then if I need to I'll pick sort of

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.530 
and then if I need to I'll pick sort of
secondary<00:02:10.679> clips<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.849> rather<00:02:12.030> depends<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.450> how

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
secondary clips it rather depends on how

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.280 
secondary clips it rather depends on how
much<00:02:12.660> space<00:02:12.900> are

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
much space are

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.230 
much space are
sometimes<00:02:15.290> myspace<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:16.100> quite<00:02:16.310> specific<00:02:16.520> so<00:02:17.000> I

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
sometimes myspace is quite specific so I

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.000 
sometimes myspace is quite specific so I
have<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.810> pick<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.960> clip<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.500> certain<00:02:18.830> length

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
have to pick a clip of a certain length

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.970 
have to pick a clip of a certain length
and<00:02:20.200> sometimes<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.320> more<00:02:21.440> impressive<00:02:21.710> clicks

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
and sometimes the more impressive clicks

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.530 
and sometimes the more impressive clicks
tend<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.250> be<00:02:22.310> quite<00:02:22.460> long<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:22.940> it's<00:02:23.240> it's

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
tend to be quite long and it's it's

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.990 
tend to be quite long and it's it's
quite<00:02:23.720> hard<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:24.020> fit<00:02:24.170> long<00:02:24.350> clips<00:02:24.620> in<00:02:25.000> so

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
quite hard to fit long clips in so

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.520 
quite hard to fit long clips in so
generally<00:02:26.420> one<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.720> when<00:02:26.870> I'm<00:02:26.990> compositing

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
generally one that when I'm compositing

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.260 
generally one that when I'm compositing
off<00:02:27.680> I'll<00:02:27.890> choose<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.370> longest<00:02:28.580> ones<00:02:28.970> first

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
off I'll choose the longest ones first

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.010 
off I'll choose the longest ones first
so<00:02:30.050> if<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.230> have<00:02:30.350> like<00:02:30.530> an<00:02:30.680> epic<00:02:30.950> spree<00:02:31.400> oh<00:02:32.020> I'll

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
so if I have like an epic spree oh I'll

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.630 
so if I have like an epic spree oh I'll
definitely<00:02:33.200> sort<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.620> go<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:34.010> first<00:02:34.280> and

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
definitely sort of go to that first and

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.340 
definitely sort of go to that first and
then<00:02:34.760> try<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.030> gather<00:02:35.120> in<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.960> largest

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
then try and gather in the the largest

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.310 
then try and gather in the the largest
gap<00:02:36.560> in<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.520> sequencing<00:02:37.970> but<00:02:38.840> anyway<00:02:39.140> that's

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
gap in the sequencing but anyway that's

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.230 
gap in the sequencing but anyway that's
that's<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.830> basic<00:02:40.130> process<00:02:40.310> that's<00:02:40.700> how<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.000> go

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
that's the basic process that's how I go

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.760 
that's the basic process that's how I go
about<00:02:41.480> getting<00:02:41.720> clips<00:02:42.170> together<00:02:42.320> and

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
about getting clips together and

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.010 
about getting clips together and
obviously<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.370> leftover<00:02:43.760> clips<00:02:43.940> oh<00:02:44.180> they're

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
obviously the leftover clips oh they're

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.370 
obviously the leftover clips oh they're
the<00:02:45.110> ones<00:02:45.230> you're<00:02:45.320> watching<00:02:45.650> right<00:02:45.770> now<00:02:47.380> NZ
