definitely not an easy album to follow
up<00:01:04.080> at<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.379> prime<00:01:04.680> example<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.689> sometimes

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
up at a prime example that sometimes

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.050 
up at a prime example that sometimes
artists<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:07.830> more<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.310> competition<00:01:08.909> with

that this album comes with some very
noticeable<00:01:16.680> changes<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> most<00:01:17.939> part

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
noticeable changes but for the most part

of my few few issues of black futures

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.560 
of my few few issues of black futures
that<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.159> could<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.430> used<00:01:38.700> more<00:01:38.939> variety<00:01:39.540> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
that it could have used more variety and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.719 
that it could have used more variety and
that<00:01:39.780> definitely<00:01:40.290> gets<00:01:40.619> addressed<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.220> this

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
that definitely gets addressed on this

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.789 
that definitely gets addressed on this

that's one of vectors calling cards to

what<00:02:02.729> makes<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.450> LP<00:02:03.899> sort<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.619> different<00:02:04.979> to

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
what makes this LP sort of different to

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.960 
what makes this LP sort of different to
me<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.630> increase<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.740> slower<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
me that it is the increase of slower and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.589 
me that it is the increase of slower and
more<00:02:09.209> melodic<00:02:09.629> passage

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
more melodic passage

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.890 
more melodic passage
on<00:02:10.899> here<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.950> softer<00:02:12.549> and<00:02:12.730> slower<00:02:13.120> spots<00:02:13.659> on

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
on here the softer and slower spots on

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.170 
on here the softer and slower spots on
here<00:02:14.109> definitely<00:02:14.319> have<00:02:14.859> more<00:02:15.340> focus<00:02:15.730> they

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
here definitely have more focus they

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.410 
here definitely have more focus they
have<00:02:16.329> more<00:02:16.540> purpose<00:02:17.109> they're<00:02:17.680> just<00:02:17.950> not

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
have more purpose they're just not

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.759 
have more purpose they're just not

vocals here and there I was extremely

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.400 
vocals here and there I was extremely
impressed<00:05:05.980> and<00:05:06.610> satisfied<00:05:07.240> with<00:05:07.960> this<00:05:08.080> record

I<00:05:08.970> wouldn't<00:05:09.970> call<00:05:10.210> this<00:05:10.390> a<00:05:10.450> disappointment

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
I wouldn't call this a disappointment

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.420 
I wouldn't call this a disappointment
not<00:05:11.620> by<00:05:11.770> a<00:05:11.800> long<00:05:12.040> shot

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
not by a long shot

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.220 
not by a long shot
I<00:05:12.580> would<00:05:12.760> say<00:05:12.910> one<00:05:13.150> of<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.330> major<00:05:13.570> negatives

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
I would say one of the major negatives

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.250 
I would say one of the major negatives
to<00:05:14.410> this<00:05:14.560> LP<00:05:15.040> though<00:05:15.280> is<00:05:15.550> that<00:05:15.930> there<00:05:16.930> are<00:05:17.020> some

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
to this LP though is that there are some

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.630 
to this LP though is that there are some
moments<00:05:17.380> on<00:05:17.680> here<00:05:17.890> that<00:05:18.010> kind<00:05:18.190> of<00:05:18.250> sound<00:05:18.490> a

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
moments on here that kind of sound a

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.910 
moments on here that kind of sound a
little<00:05:18.760> too<00:05:19.120> much<00:05:19.330> like<00:05:19.540> black<00:05:19.840> future<00:05:20.260> for

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
little too much like black future for

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.440 
little too much like black future for
their<00:05:21.520> own<00:05:21.760> good

their own good

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.510 
their own good
that's<00:05:22.690> difficult<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:23.410> do<00:05:23.620> when<00:05:24.130> you're<00:05:24.280> still

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
that's difficult to do when you're still

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.850 
that's difficult to do when you're still

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
those songs do finally get the

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.030 
those songs do finally get the
production<00:05:45.220> quality<00:05:45.670> they<00:05:46.540> need<00:05:46.930> to<00:05:47.500> really

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
production quality they need to really

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.370 
production quality they need to really
pack<00:05:48.610> the<00:05:48.850> punch<00:05:49.030> they<00:05:49.300> were<00:05:49.360> intended<00:05:49.900> to<00:05:49.930> but

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
pack the punch they were intended to but

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.680 
pack the punch they were intended to but
I<00:05:50.410> was<00:05:50.620> hoping<00:05:50.950> this<00:05:51.130> band's<00:05:51.690> inherent

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
I was hoping this band's inherent

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.680 
I was hoping this band's inherent
ambition<00:05:53.470> would<00:05:54.100> cause<00:05:54.490> them<00:05:54.850> to<00:05:54.880> kind<00:05:55.600> of

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
ambition would cause them to kind of

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.620 
ambition would cause them to kind of
make<00:05:55.930> a<00:05:55.980> greater<00:05:56.980> leap<00:05:57.280> forward<00:05:57.970> with<00:05:58.510> this

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
make a greater leap forward with this

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.890 
make a greater leap forward with this
record<00:05:59.190> stylistically<00:06:00.190> I<00:06:00.460> guess<00:06:00.760> still<00:06:01.360> this

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
record stylistically I guess still this

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.310 
record stylistically I guess still this
record<00:06:02.320> and<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.740> previous<00:06:03.160> one<00:06:03.190> are<00:06:04.320> enough

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
record and the previous one are enough

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.300 
record and the previous one are enough
for<00:06:05.920> me<00:06:05.980> to<00:06:06.730> to<00:06:07.180> say<00:06:07.480> to<00:06:07.840> you<00:06:08.140> that<00:06:08.740> this<00:06:08.980> band

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
for me to to say to you that this band

for me to to say to you that this band
in<00:06:09.640> my<00:06:09.880> opinion<00:06:10.330> is<00:06:10.510> the<00:06:11.290> most<00:06:12.010> standout<00:06:13.000> group

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390
