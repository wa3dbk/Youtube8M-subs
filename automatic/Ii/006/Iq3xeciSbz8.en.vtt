00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.530
 here at this point we have thunder 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.420
 under the boat here they are standing 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.100
 that year a bit from all sides yes 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.530
 they are forming two big eats a 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.420
 100 150 meters from us another eat 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.250
 obviously amber from children 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.379
 today he has fished it and so with the sea 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.210
 formal and then formal format 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.470
 put a fish that ate below 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.470
 then the fight 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.390
 this is really a 36 train but 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.439
 I was finding the right car because 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.869
 with the 30,000 star the teacher on tour a 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.850
 a braid a power among 800 books is 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.920
 actually found a giusy wagon 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.490
 have a good fight enjoy yourself 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.490
 thank you 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.950
 important thing to remember that the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.660
 star 30 thousand even if it looks like a 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.270
 rib reel directed that it 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.860
 styling really isn't because it is 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.230
 combined with a rod like these 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.140
 we can really catch fish of 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.780
 large size in a very short time e 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.430
 then release it without too much stress 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.320
 nothing with a little more reels 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.870
 small fights would last 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.820
 absolutely defined when absolutely 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.010
 in addition to this obviously when 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.100
 we know that the target is the high target 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.959
 when we know the tones we are 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.050
 trying to fish are exemplary 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.380
 then well then in italy 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.380
 the 30 thousand euros certainly not too much 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.380
 absolutely 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.730
 the fish if I'm not mistaken attacked a 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.470
 good feeling and pink 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.140
 red is a particular color a 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.210
 color that definitely like tuna and 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.870
 especially once again on days 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.970
 like these 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.310
 creates a great contrast contras 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.570
 chromatic and evidently has been is 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.570
 was the right choice
