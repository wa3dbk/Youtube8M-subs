 tomato who was at the conference 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.540

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.190

 etcetera etcetera or wonder and it gives me 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.980
 It's a shame to say it when you have a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.980
 lawyer next door is to feel 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:42.840
 obviously supported but yesterday it was very 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.600
 funny to listen to the defense I had 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.789
 the lawyer regarding the subject of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.949

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.680

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.440

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.970

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.040
 his own words he said in this 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.880
 program because in this program 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.160
 the lady said that when she left or 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.890
 when I was going to leave your magazine I was going to 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.870
 present those compromising photos of 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.860
 blessed of that and of the relationship that I 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.170

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.510

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.390
 forceful beyond the video of what 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.460
 own what what own 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.550

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.020

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.420

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.140

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.850
 will be this exclusive says 17 scandal in 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.909
 the revelation in the middle of romance 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.200
 clandestine 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.899
 Between Tomato Barraza and Milena Zárate 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.530
 he saw them kissing before it exploded 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.810
 his family drama is to say make it clear 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.310
 that you go from a relationship 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.939
 while she was with edwin 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.009
 saw is like that and on the other hand the 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.830
 product to the director of great time 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.870
 says yesterday obviously feels between 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.810
 the sword and the wall and it just says no 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.470
 It was a little piquito and he 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.620
 and the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.080
 mocks and says no but I 've already said 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.910
 tomato mud in his tomato program is 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.350
 used to being neighbors with 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.120
 any girl, a thing is a little kiss and 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.370
 another thing is to say that before a 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.760
 clandestine relationship especially of the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.560
 qualifiers where where I have been 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.410
 they have not pointed me out as the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.780
 mistress et cetera etcetera 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.020
 there are things that really do me 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.570
 they lament a lot because just day what 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.600
 I was talking to a family member about the subject in a 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.450
 Aunt kiss that there is this that tells me and 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.220
 The judiciary is right 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.700
 I imagine that being busy in 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.570
 many things not feminicidios 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.850
 parricide murders drug trafficking 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.480
 terrorism et cetera etcetera as for 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.630
 that I or rather this topic is 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.120
 judicial I did and all this spill gives me 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.910
 a lot of grief because I think it is not possible 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.830
 we are in such a violent country with a 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.140
 violence so extreme that the 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.610
 true that this must go with him 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.850
 respect that you deserve, it seems like a 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.740
 clown and especially on the cover says 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.030
 well clear you read it because I do not 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.790
 I'm going to repeat it 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:37.069
 milena zárate and a very strong and very 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:40.230
 delicate and in supposedly 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:44.250
 breaking down the news only make 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.750
 emphasize and write the text what it says 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.730
 textually in the videos of the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.350
 magazines grace and then for the 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.540
 research they have had with 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.570
 Regarding the theme of milena there are proofs 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.040
 here they only repeat what all the 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.380
 world already knows what draws attention 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.800
 It is also that there is not a person 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.870
 to sign and see if it is clear that 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.850
 the lynx is very important 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.380
 finish 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.730
 the lynx you have is the lynx is a 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.820
 pseudonym 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.950
 he did is an animal is a big animal 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.070
 he is fast 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.580
 thanks Alberto finally with 7 people 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:26.590

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:31.070
 have the pants to give it to 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.590
 journalist you are serious and you say ok 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.590

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.140
 this and signature because in my job but not 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.760
 you're going to put lynx to sign something 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.800
 we all know that it is 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.320
 totally false now definitely 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.320
 I am is something is something personal with 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.450
 truth with the program and said is it happened 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.280
 when I went yesterday and we're going to see that in 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.610
 brief in the images I told the lord 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.380
 why they had not let him in no 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.120
 only the love love team but the 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.040
 show team and the team of the 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.330
 night is mine if they invite a 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.400
 press conference 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.200
 the mail is not the invitation 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.800
 because blocking access we're going to 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.800
 See later
