side there's a c-clip and as you're

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.410 
side there's a c-clip and as you're
driving<00:01:04.019> your<00:01:04.290> Baja<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.550> there's<00:01:05.850> excessive

play<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.870> there<00:01:07.050> it<00:01:07.230> just<00:01:07.440> hammers<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:08.010> that

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
play in there it just hammers on that

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.790 
play in there it just hammers on that
c-clip<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.730> they<00:01:08.940> they<00:01:09.180> tend<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.510> fall<00:01:09.780> off<00:01:10.050> so

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
c-clip and they they tend to fall off so

proper<00:02:18.470> proper<00:02:19.470> shims<00:02:19.790> for<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.879> job<00:02:21.090> you're

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
proper proper shims for the job you're

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.649 
proper proper shims for the job you're
doing<00:02:21.300> whether<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:23.640> axles<00:02:24.120> or<00:02:24.450> the

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
check the play and we can see that it is

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.320 
check the play and we can see that it is
much<00:03:24.020> better<00:03:24.260> but<00:03:25.070> there<00:03:25.220> still<00:03:25.340> is<00:03:25.520> an<00:03:26.030> amount

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
much better but there still is an amount

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.960 
much better but there still is an amount
of<00:03:26.570> play<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.440> what<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:28.160> did<00:03:28.400> on<00:03:28.550> that<00:03:28.730> was<00:03:28.940> I

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
of play and what I did on that was I

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.759 
of play and what I did on that was I
used<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.950> thickest<00:03:31.150> 0.5<00:03:32.150> shim<00:03:32.570> so<00:03:33.380> now<00:03:33.590> what

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
used the thickest 0.5 shim so now what

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.970 
used the thickest 0.5 shim so now what
we're<00:03:33.920> gonna<00:03:34.010> go<00:03:34.250> ahead<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.640> do<00:03:34.790> is<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.420> add

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
we're gonna go ahead and do is to add

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.710 
we're gonna go ahead and do is to add
since<00:03:36.980> we<00:03:37.130> still<00:03:37.310> have<00:03:37.489> a<00:03:37.519> little<00:03:37.760> play<00:03:38.120> one

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
since we still have a little play one

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.229 
since we still have a little play one
more<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.290> finist<00:03:39.769> I'm<00:03:40.340> just<00:03:40.700> by<00:03:40.790> looking

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
more of the finist I'm just by looking

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:41.770 
more of the finist I'm just by looking
at<00:03:41.420> it

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
at it

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.880 
at it
that<00:03:42.230> seems<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.830> be<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:45.110> one<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.440> use<00:03:45.560> so<00:03:45.769> we're

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
that seems to be the one to use so we're

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.699 
that seems to be the one to use so we're
gonna<00:03:45.980> go<00:03:46.160> ahead<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.370> remove<00:03:46.580> the<00:03:46.910> c-clip<00:03:47.709> go

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
gonna go ahead and remove the c-clip go

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.509 
gonna go ahead and remove the c-clip go
ahead<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.480> place<00:03:50.480> another<00:03:50.810> one<00:03:51.050> of<00:03:51.200> the

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
ahead and place another one of the

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.470 
ahead and place another one of the
thinnest<00:03:52.519> shims<00:03:52.880> so<00:03:53.180> now<00:03:53.330> we<00:03:53.390> have<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:54.190> 5<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:55.580> we

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
thinnest shims so now we have a 5 and we

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.830 
thinnest shims so now we have a 5 and we
have<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.630> 2<00:03:56.959> for<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.290> total<00:03:57.320> of<00:03:58.269> 0.7<00:03:59.269> millimeters

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
have a 2 for a total of 0.7 millimeters

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.080 
have a 2 for a total of 0.7 millimeters
of<00:04:00.019> Shemp<00:04:00.320> just<00:04:01.010> going<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.310> go<00:04:01.400> ahead<00:04:01.519> and

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
of Shemp just going to go ahead and

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.949 
of Shemp just going to go ahead and
slide<00:04:03.019> it<00:04:03.049> back<00:04:03.380> in<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:05.090> we're<00:04:05.630> gonna<00:04:05.750> go

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
slide it back in and we're gonna go

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.870 
slide it back in and we're gonna go
ahead<00:04:06.080> and<00:04:06.500> put<00:04:06.769> our<00:04:06.890> seat<00:04:07.130> clip<00:04:07.400> back<00:04:07.610> on

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
ahead and put our seat clip back on

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.900 
ahead and put our seat clip back on
again<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:09.010> see<00:04:10.010> how<00:04:10.160> that<00:04:10.220> works

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.640 

again<00:04:13.910> see<00:04:14.209> clips<00:04:14.510> are<00:04:14.690> difficult<00:04:15.230> or<00:04:15.410> easy

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
again see clips are difficult or easy

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.860 
again see clips are difficult or easy
and<00:04:16.010> they're<00:04:16.760> not<00:04:16.880> giving<00:04:17.180> us<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.390> hard<00:04:17.600> time

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
and they're not giving us a hard time

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.699 
and they're not giving us a hard time
today<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:18.979> let's<00:04:19.220> take<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.430> look<00:04:19.729> at<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:20.000> now<00:04:20.030> and

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
today so let's take a look at it now and

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.110 
today so let's take a look at it now and
I<00:04:21.709> can<00:04:21.919> see<00:04:22.160> that<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:23.630> is<00:04:24.580> absolutely<00:04:25.580> no<00:04:25.820> play

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
I can see that the is absolutely no play

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.240 
I can see that the is absolutely no play
in<00:04:26.360> there<00:04:26.600> and<00:04:27.729> that<00:04:28.729> the<00:04:28.910> hub<00:04:29.120> itself<00:04:30.250> the

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
in there and that the hub itself the

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.400 
in there and that the hub itself the
axle<00:04:31.640> within<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.060> hub<00:04:32.240> is<00:04:32.479> not<00:04:32.990> turning

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
axle within the hub is not turning

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.890 
axle within the hub is not turning
freely<00:04:33.919> it's<00:04:34.550> not<00:04:34.760> binding<00:04:35.120> but<00:04:35.450> it's<00:04:35.720> not

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
freely it's not binding but it's not

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.380 
freely it's not binding but it's not
turning<00:04:36.169> freely<00:04:36.560> so<00:04:37.430> basically<00:04:37.970> what<00:04:38.210> that's

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
turning freely so basically what that's

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.950 
turning freely so basically what that's
telling<00:04:38.630> me<00:04:38.840> is<00:04:38.990> that<00:04:39.080> we've<00:04:39.349> over

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
telling me is that we've over

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.050 
telling me is that we've over
shimmed<00:04:40.289> it<00:04:40.470> so<00:04:41.340> we're<00:04:41.490> gonna<00:04:41.580> go<00:04:41.789> ahead<00:04:41.910> and

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
shimmed it so we're gonna go ahead and

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.210 
shimmed it so we're gonna go ahead and
take<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.479> c-clip<00:04:42.690> back<00:04:43.139> off<00:04:46.340> and<00:04:48.139> remove<00:04:49.139> the

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
take the c-clip back off and remove the

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.939 
take the c-clip back off and remove the
smallest<00:04:50.220> shim<00:04:50.840> that<00:04:51.840> we<00:04:51.990> just<00:04:52.199> put<00:04:52.410> on<00:04:52.560> there

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
smallest shim that we just put on there

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.249 
smallest shim that we just put on there
let's<00:04:53.130> stick<00:04:53.460> into<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.759> axle<00:04:54.300> here<00:04:54.479> so<00:04:55.169> we're

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
let's stick into the axle here so we're

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.360 
let's stick into the axle here so we're
gonna<00:04:55.349> go<00:04:55.560> ahead<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:55.860> take<00:04:56.009> that<00:04:56.039> off<00:04:56.250> and

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
gonna go ahead and take that off and

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.070 
gonna go ahead and take that off and
that<00:04:59.370> shows<00:04:59.669> us<00:04:59.910> that's<00:05:00.150> all<00:05:00.389> we<00:05:00.599> needed<00:05:00.840> on

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
that shows us that's all we needed on

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.249 
that shows us that's all we needed on
there<00:05:01.460> was<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.490> point<00:05:02.849> five<00:05:03.150> I'm<00:05:03.960> gonna<00:05:04.110> go

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
there was a point five I'm gonna go

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.189 
there was a point five I'm gonna go
ahead<00:05:04.319> and<00:05:04.440> put<00:05:04.650> it<00:05:04.740> back<00:05:04.889> on

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
ahead and put it back on

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:12.770 
ahead and put it back on
reinsert<00:05:07.199> the<00:05:08.599> c-clip<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:11.360> we<00:05:12.360> now<00:05:12.539> have<00:05:12.570> a

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
reinsert the c-clip and we now have a

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.560 
reinsert the c-clip and we now have a
properly<00:05:13.349> shimmed<00:05:15.199> front<00:05:16.199> axle<00:05:17.419> always<00:05:18.419> make

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
properly shimmed front axle always make

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.029 
properly shimmed front axle always make
sure<00:05:18.750> that<00:05:18.900> your<00:05:19.050> seat<00:05:19.229> clips<00:05:19.530> are<00:05:19.680> on<00:05:19.800> nice

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
sure that your seat clips are on nice

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.270 
sure that your seat clips are on nice
and<00:05:20.070> tight<00:05:20.690> and<00:05:21.690> again<00:05:22.530> I'll<00:05:22.710> show<00:05:22.919> you<00:05:22.979> here

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
and tight and again I'll show you here

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.120 
and tight and again I'll show you here
that<00:05:23.970> the<00:05:25.669> hub<00:05:26.669> spins<00:05:27.120> freely<00:05:27.949> there's<00:05:28.949> no

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
that the hub spins freely there's no

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.670 
that the hub spins freely there's no
binding<00:05:29.580> and<00:05:29.849> there's<00:05:30.570> a<00:05:30.780> very<00:05:31.110> minimal

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
binding and there's a very minimal

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.719 
binding and there's a very minimal
amount<00:05:32.009> of<00:05:32.960> play<00:05:33.960> so<00:05:34.830> that's<00:05:34.919> all<00:05:35.159> there<00:05:35.340> is<00:05:35.400> to

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
amount of play so that's all there is to

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.210 
amount of play so that's all there is to
it<00:05:35.909> go<00:05:36.419> ahead<00:05:36.449> and<00:05:36.720> repeat<00:05:37.349> the<00:05:37.500> process<00:05:37.680> on

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
it go ahead and repeat the process on

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.909 
it go ahead and repeat the process on
your<00:05:38.250> second<00:05:38.789> side<00:05:39.000> sometimes<00:05:39.990> they<00:05:40.169> take<00:05:40.349> the

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
your second side sometimes they take the

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.589 
your second side sometimes they take the
same<00:05:41.099> amount<00:05:41.159> of<00:05:41.639> shimming<00:05:42.000> sometimes<00:05:42.449> they

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
same amount of shimming sometimes they

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.899 
same amount of shimming sometimes they
take<00:05:42.780> different<00:05:43.050> amounts<00:05:43.289> of<00:05:43.590> shipping<00:05:44.009> it<00:05:44.639> is

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
take different amounts of shipping it is

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.879 
take different amounts of shipping it is
a<00:05:44.940> relatively<00:05:45.690> easy<00:05:46.020> project<00:05:46.710> it's

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
a relatively easy project it's

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.249 
a relatively easy project it's
