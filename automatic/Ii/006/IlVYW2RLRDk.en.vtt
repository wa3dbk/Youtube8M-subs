00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.490 
may be the same material as the
spider-man<00:02:40.160> one<00:02:40.489> but<00:02:40.760> it's<00:02:41.690> painted<00:02:42.110> blue

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
spider-man one but it's painted blue

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.699 
spider-man one but it's painted blue
instead<00:02:42.890> of<00:02:43.010> being<00:02:43.310> clear<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.989> also<00:02:45.290> looks

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
instead of being clear and it also looks

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.370 
instead of being clear and it also looks
like<00:02:45.890> it's<00:02:46.070> attached<00:02:46.430> in<00:02:46.760> his<00:02:46.850> hands<00:02:47.390> in<00:02:47.959> fact

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
like it's attached in his hands in fact

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.610 
like it's attached in his hands in fact
it<00:02:48.709> almost<00:02:48.950> looks<00:02:49.340> like<00:02:50.080> it's<00:02:51.080> part<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.470> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
it almost looks like it's part of the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.070 
it almost looks like it's part of the
mold<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:52.190> is<00:02:52.400> it's<00:02:52.640> part<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.090> actual<00:02:53.750> mold

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
mold it is it's part of the actual mold

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.640 
mold it is it's part of the actual mold
of<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.320> hands<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:56.150> comes<00:02:56.420> out<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.290> must

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
of the hands and it comes out so it must

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.580 
of the hands and it comes out so it must
be<00:02:57.769> a<00:02:57.799> one<00:02:58.100> piece<00:02:58.340> mold<00:02:58.810> together<00:02:59.810> that<00:03:00.320> way<00:03:00.470> it

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
be a one piece mold together that way it

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.699 
be a one piece mold together that way it
won't<00:03:00.709> come<00:03:00.980> out<00:03:01.160> run<00:03:01.970> like<00:03:02.090> spider-man

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
won't come out run like spider-man

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.699 
won't come out run like spider-man
because<00:03:03.709> it<00:03:03.829> had<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:03.950> be<00:03:04.070> clear<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:06.380> had<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.650> be

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
because it had to be clear it had to be

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.400 
because it had to be clear it had to be
separated<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.640> put<00:03:08.060> in<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:08.900> attached

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
separated and put in and in attached

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.770 
separated and put in and in attached
that<00:03:09.680> way<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.640> this<00:03:10.850> is<00:03:10.880> actually<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.540> same

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
that way so this is actually the same

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.740 
that way so this is actually the same
material<00:03:12.290> just<00:03:12.560> stretched<00:03:13.100> out<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:13.519> soft<00:03:15.340> huh
