00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.259 
determines which one is it sounds so I
say<00:03:32.739> that's<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:33.010> pretty<00:03:33.370> brilliant<00:03:34.150> way<00:03:34.239> of

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
say that's a pretty brilliant way of

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.840 
say that's a pretty brilliant way of
doing<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:35.850> also<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:37.060> activate<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:38.850> whole

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
doing it also to activate the whole

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.710 
doing it also to activate the whole
hinge<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.329> stuff<00:03:42.180> those<00:03:43.180> buttons<00:03:43.540> at<00:03:43.660> the

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
hinge and stuff those buttons at the

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.620 
hinge and stuff those buttons at the
same<00:03:43.900> time<00:03:44.109> activated<00:03:44.739> like<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.630> activates

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
same time activated like that activates

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.319 
same time activated like that activates
the<00:03:46.720> henshin<00:03:47.109> so<00:03:47.730> time<00:03:48.730> for<00:03:48.850> me<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.030> prove<00:03:49.269> that
