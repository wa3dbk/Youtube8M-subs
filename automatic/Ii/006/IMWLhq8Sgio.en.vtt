repairing for planes you don't really
need<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.880> any<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.060> your<00:01:57.240> hangers

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
hangers are really kind of dispatcher

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.200 
hangers are really kind of dispatcher
missions<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:01.310> these<00:02:02.310> missions<00:02:02.759> take<00:02:02.969> time

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
missions and these missions take time

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.880 
missions and these missions take time
and<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.780> longer<00:02:03.899> they<00:02:04.140> are<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.380> more<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.680> get

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
and the longer they are the more you get

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.609 
and the longer they are the more you get
the<00:02:06.049> requirements<00:02:07.049> for<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.200> missions<00:02:07.500> are

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
the requirements for the missions are

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.320 
the requirements for the missions are
here<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> left<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.459> rewards<00:02:09.270> are

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
here on the left and the rewards are

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.850 
here on the left and the rewards are
here<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> right<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.050> then<00:02:10.289> which<00:02:10.560> plane

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
here on the right and then which plane

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.880 
here on the right and then which plane
you<00:02:10.979> need<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:12.110> right<00:02:13.110> here

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
you need is right here

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.309 
you need is right here
as<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.250> could<00:02:14.370> hire<00:02:14.490> on<00:02:14.700> you'll<00:02:14.970> need<00:02:15.319> bigger

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
as you could hire on you'll need bigger

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.610 
as you could hire on you'll need bigger
planes<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.240> missions<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.380> have<00:02:19.500> to

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
planes to the missions and you have to

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.130 
planes to the missions and you have to
buy<00:02:19.770> those<00:02:19.980> planes<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.700> stuff<00:02:21.000> like<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.300> so

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
buy those planes and stuff like that so

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.030 
buy those planes and stuff like that so
I'm<00:02:22.230> just<00:02:22.319> going<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.530> send<00:02:22.650> them<00:02:22.740> out<00:02:22.860> on<00:02:22.980> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
I'm just going to send them out on the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.110 
I'm just going to send them out on the
training<00:02:23.310> flight<00:02:23.610> since<00:02:23.850> that's<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
training flight since that's the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.240 
training flight since that's the
quickest<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.110> hopefully<00:02:25.770> it'll<00:02:25.920> get<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.130> back

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
quickest and hopefully it'll get it back

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.730 
quickest and hopefully it'll get it back
before<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.730> videos<00:02:27.030> done<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.560> have<00:02:28.650> to

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
before the videos done so you have to

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.350 
before the videos done so you have to
fill<00:02:28.950> them<00:02:29.100> up<00:02:29.160> which<00:02:29.400> takes<00:02:29.670> fuel<00:02:30.030> as<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.240> can

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
fill them up which takes fuel as you can

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.540 
fill them up which takes fuel as you can
see<00:02:30.540> here<00:02:30.810> which<00:02:31.620> regenerates<00:02:31.980> slowly<00:02:32.370> over

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
see here which regenerates slowly over

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.270 
see here which regenerates slowly over
time<00:02:32.700> where<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.270> can<00:02:33.390> buy<00:02:33.540> some<00:02:33.570> then<00:02:34.280> you

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
time where you can buy some then you

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.160 
time where you can buy some then you
load<00:02:35.430> up<00:02:35.550> with<00:02:35.670> your<00:02:35.790> passengers<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:37.020> one
