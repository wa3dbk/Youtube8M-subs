playing with Connecticut as you can see

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.319 
playing with Connecticut as you can see

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
he has the ball now this is what I want

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.910 
he has the ball now this is what I want
to<00:01:00.420> say<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.230> know<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.379> don't<00:01:01.559> know<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:01.770> it's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
to say you know I don't know if it's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.969 
to say you know I don't know if it's
just<00:01:02.070> me<00:01:02.160> imagining<00:01:03.059> things<00:01:03.270> or<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:04.019> don't<00:01:04.799> know

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
just me imagining things or I don't know

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.670 
just me imagining things or I don't know
but<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.850> seems<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.360> me<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.200> online

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
but it seems like to me that the online

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.929 
but it seems like to me that the online
gameplay<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.970> playing<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.570> lot<00:01:09.869> smoother<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.939> lot

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
gameplay is playing a lot smoother a lot

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.109 
gameplay is playing a lot smoother a lot
smoother<00:01:12.450> than<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> offline<00:01:13.110> now<00:01:13.939> that's<00:01:14.939> not

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
smoother than the offline now that's not

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.140 
smoother than the offline now that's not
to<00:01:15.180> say<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.750> offline<00:01:16.140> gameplay<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.860> bad

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
to say that the offline gameplay is bad

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.359 
to say that the offline gameplay is bad
I'm<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.420> saying<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.080> seems<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.710> me<00:01:19.890> for

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
I'm just saying it just seems to me for

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.609 
I'm just saying it just seems to me for
some<00:01:20.580> reason<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:21.030> online<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.810> playing<00:01:22.140> very

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
some reason that online is playing very

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.219 
some reason that online is playing very
smoothly<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:24.210> know<00:01:24.360> even<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:25.140> an

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
smoothly you know even like for an

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.660 
smoothly you know even like for an
example<00:01:25.290> when<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.920> get<00:01:26.040> an<00:01:26.130> interception

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
example when you get an interception

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.870 
example when you get an interception
there's<00:01:27.630> no<00:01:27.869> delay<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.650> mean<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.460> soon<00:01:29.640> as<00:01:29.790> you

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
there's no delay I mean as soon as you

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.539 
there's no delay I mean as soon as you
pick<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.540> screen<00:01:30.840> flips<00:01:31.140> around<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.369> got

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
pick the screen flips around and you got

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.999 
pick the screen flips around and you got
control<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.119> ball<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.600> quick<00:01:33.869> no<00:01:34.590> delay

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
control of the ball that quick no delay

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.789 
control of the ball that quick no delay
is<00:01:35.250> no<00:01:35.490> slowing<00:01:35.880> down<00:01:36.470> nothing<00:01:37.470> everything

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
is no slowing down nothing everything

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.130 
is no slowing down nothing everything
just<00:01:38.189> seems<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.759> real<00:01:39.329> smooth<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.049> real

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
just seems to be real smooth and real

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.130 
just seems to be real smooth and real
fluid<00:01:40.710> as<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.479> doesn't<00:01:42.869> seem<00:01:43.079> like

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
fluid as well it doesn't seem like

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.139 
fluid as well it doesn't seem like
players<00:01:44.130> are<00:01:44.280> getting<00:01:44.369> knocked<00:01:44.670> off<00:01:44.909> with<00:01:45.090> a

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
but other than that if it's just a play

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.440 
but other than that if it's just a play
now<00:04:26.230> I'm<00:04:27.040> only<00:04:27.280> gonna<00:04:27.490> do<00:04:27.700> on<00:04:27.910> ranked<00:04:28.180> games

now I'm only gonna do on ranked games
and<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.720> reason<00:04:29.110> being<00:04:29.260> in<00:04:29.950> my<00:04:30.220> experience<00:04:30.790> is

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
and the reason being in my experience is

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.700 
and the reason being in my experience is
now<00:04:31.150> I'm<00:04:31.300> noticing<00:04:31.630> that<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:31.990> unread<00:04:32.380> games

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
now I'm noticing that the unread games

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.970 
now I'm noticing that the unread games
are<00:04:32.950> a<00:04:33.010> lot<00:04:33.220> more<00:04:33.250> fun<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:34.660> you<00:04:35.470> know<00:04:35.500> you<00:04:35.680> can

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
are a lot more fun and you know you can

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.860 
are a lot more fun and you know you can
make<00:04:36.130> minor<00:04:36.640> adjustments<00:04:36.850> if<00:04:37.420> you<00:04:37.540> want<00:04:37.750> as

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
make minor adjustments if you want as

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.450 
make minor adjustments if you want as
far<00:04:38.050> as<00:04:38.200> how<00:04:38.320> long<00:04:38.350> you<00:04:38.680> want<00:04:38.890> to<00:04:38.920> play<00:04:39.160> and

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
far as how long you want to play and

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.980 
far as how long you want to play and
things<00:04:39.820> like<00:04:40.030> that<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.300> believe<00:04:40.570> you<00:04:40.720> can<00:04:40.810> even

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
things like that I believe you can even

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.830 
things like that I believe you can even
tweak<00:04:41.380> sliders<00:04:41.920> but<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:43.030> main<00:04:43.270> reason<00:04:43.300> is

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
tweak sliders but the main reason is

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.870 
tweak sliders but the main reason is
because<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.260> get<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.470> better<00:04:44.770> experience<00:04:45.280> as<00:04:45.640> far

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
because I get a better experience as far

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.900 
because I get a better experience as far

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
normally see a ranked game and I think

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.200 
normally see a ranked game and I think
the<00:05:17.650> reason<00:05:17.800> being<00:05:18.100> is<00:05:18.340> really<00:05:18.880> nothing<00:05:19.030> to

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
the reason being is really nothing to

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.140 
the reason being is really nothing to
play<00:05:19.450> for<00:05:19.480> you<00:05:19.960> know<00:05:20.290> you<00:05:20.350> just<00:05:20.530> having<00:05:20.890> fun

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
play for you know you just having fun

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.580 
play for you know you just having fun
when<00:05:22.150> you<00:05:22.240> start<00:05:22.480> playing<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.870> rent<00:05:23.110> games<00:05:23.290> I

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
when you start playing the rent games I

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.020 
when you start playing the rent games I
think<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:23.860> get<00:05:24.010> a<00:05:24.040> lot<00:05:24.250> of<00:05:24.280> guys<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:24.790> trying
