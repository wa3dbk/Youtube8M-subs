00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.779
 Makeup artist of 15 and 17 here collaborating with the magazine padrísimo doing 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.780
 makeup the equity one ran away be back to school we have ours 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.529
 linda pradel you have to make achille ready to start 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.329
 good that the first step we are going to do is very important is to apply the 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.329
 naval base in principle we are going to apply the base 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.960
 a few days ago they emerged 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.910
 when officiating weddings 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.380
 with the brush 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.950
 going down if you notice the reason why we do that I hope that all the 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.639
 we have a facial hair 

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:47.370
 face 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.400
 then what happens is that if we do that way up we raise the 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.930
 Facial hair and assets that we see more of rape or not is not okay 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.749
 makeup effects of mimes advised that when applying we are going to apply 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.909
 take advantage of the growth of facial hair or with these 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.330
 well downwards although this one we're going to apply the base everywhere the 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:12.920
 tracking 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.260
 ok then once we have finished applying it to state funds 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.080
 the right concert below the eyes and that's very important especially 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.780
 when we go back to what does it say in as much malaise recre 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.870
 and does not sleep on the street the outskirts of Milan announced member 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.640
 then the makeup figures the helps 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.820
 and what I advise is that we are going to grab a corrector that is more 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.469
 clear of the color of the skin in tano oranges because we avoid that neutralize 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.720
 in the blue tones although the team would be on the sidewalks 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.250
 and we will apply it 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.640
 and this not only 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.719
 alestra hoist under dark circles what also make these entities do not see each other 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.400
 tired the next day in 13 months 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.180
 very good important for what we look at this for good here is difficult and 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.010
 that the difference between one side and the robbery then what to once has 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.060
 highlighted besides having applied the canciler road down the contributions 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.240
 of the next step is to apply the payments 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.880
 the palms until rsf graciela vázquez then this part came to the famous 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.389
 all day these comrades apply a gap 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:22.860
 of natural hair 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.069
 let's put the sword who will finally judge him on the face 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.129
 although it started taking between 7 we were now using the random snap 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.649
 and how she wants to make appear on board for one we have 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:39.039
 the brooch to ensure that this color that is a darker color than the 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.119
 skin tone of whoever 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.839
 art this Tuesday they keep of tickets is very important because I'm going to 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:48.569
 accept to try to make a 'break' certain areas to be depth 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.369
 then we need is going to use 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:54.109
 let's apply it business in the area and have the forehead to the temporary 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.520
 down the cheekbones 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.229
 and in the neck area blurring how well we do the same thing on this side 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:02.789
 and after the tan 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.819
 by then now we are ready for the course 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.229
 and the place 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.009
 this is how we are going to apply it 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:11.629
 let's apply the theft ar 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.220
 doing that the model knew then will go when she smiles those that 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.219
 the cheeks stand out that's where we're going to apply the highest concentration 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:21.299
 from colon 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.379
 in the cheeks and we are blurring the cheekbone like this in this way 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:31.039
 will be again contain estelada in the cheeks beginning to live dominating 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:35.369
 thus the popular one before the recent one we happened to make learn in the eyes 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:38.659
 that is always important now that he has returned to school 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.979
 intermedia and miguel díaz antolín school and he wants the makeup is 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:43.229
 free all day 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:46.609
 that's important to apply on the entire eyelid in this way 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.049
 what he's going to do is low late in the excess fat on the skin anxiety 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.909
 that the shadow 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.870
 do not move are committed in that section 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.649
 and femininity all day in the classes 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:04.179
 now let's start applying this epitaph of shadows that this happens easy 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:08.960
 do the let's do it especially learned his trade is very expensive 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.580
 it is not a national strike to be perfect for the time of return 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.549
 school 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.500
 that everyone can do it I have two colors of the same town in color 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.890
 clear no part of the upper eyelid 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.039
 and lower eyelid 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.699
 I think I'm going to make that great natural-size capecchi friendship 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.699
 I will apply it in the part of the foot in the eye following the natural form of 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.350
 eye foot if they look bencomo has a rainbow shape 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.750
 and above is not clear at all what is important in this application of this 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.920
 operation since the report for the sake of promoting respect when it comes to shadows 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.889
 always following mexico - the rival agency 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.909
 topolánek in that line that does not look very marked 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.969
 this is one of the most besides natural 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:58.709
 it will be only not in part to the one that uses natural colors to be 

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:01.669
 look so softer but there are no lines 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.010
 that is to say these techniques in which we are going to put and of course here to one more color 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.009
 darkness 500 in overcoming it mixed from the other side 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:14.860
 because then how it felt good to finish both sides and remember the 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.620
 importance of blurring 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.350
 which means having 2 dollars but that there is no demarcation line of one 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.620
 with the other 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.600
 so now we are going to delineate the garlic and I have an eye outlined agencies 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.470
 escape let's do it and the reason why not 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.939
 veneman shoot caps 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:32.190
 give them a lot 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.600
 The definition of the eye is not intended in this way it is investigated with the eyelid 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.020
 that makes it much easier to delineate the ones we started in the middle 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.020
 i will outline not everything in the life of the eye 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:50.719
 and pulling it a little more towards the side to lengthen it, we are going to 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:52.580
 stop everything in happy 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.580
 in here in the inside 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.889
 and with a little shadow 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:06.430
 the outside part also then dozens of knives mark overtaking what 

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:07.089
 rather 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:12.059
 we need to ensure sovereignty in the eyelid with the shadows nothing 

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:15.900
 more the score but we can not define the garlic boss 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.449
 with the eyeliner 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.860
 people know how to sell we can all forget the royal king to open the eye there is 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.740
 have in bigger malindi 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.120
 is expected that we are going to do in venice of the sponge tower protejo 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.729
 it would affect to say the eyelid of the skin below so that it does not get dirty 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.380
 and from there to apply and end the tabs and after 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.400
 apply the VAT in both eyes let's go with the lips 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:45.060
 fernandez is very important to use a liner is natural as she has 

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:46.169
 I wanted 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:50.039
 the timeline the global network and the lip gloss is already very fashionable 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:55.210
 a but this morning that the line that is very marked in the definition of 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.110
 eyeliner 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.550
 of the Nativity scene contest and linked a natural color that was sick protect that 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:01.770
 lip gloss 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.780
 if this life was out of line 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.559
 but without you notice the color 

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:07.449

 late when they go anywhere 

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:29.589
 because this data can be born 

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:32.490
