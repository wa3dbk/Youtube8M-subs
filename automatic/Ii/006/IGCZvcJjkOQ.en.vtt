Hi folks!

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.120
Today I'll show you a Christmas hot drink's recipe!

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.380
Probably most of you already know it if you go to skii in the Alps: it's bombardino.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.640
It's super simple and quick, maybe you know how to make it.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.540
You don't need anything, but the "Vov" egg liquor.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.880
Then you can choose if do it with milk or coffee.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.010
I didn't use any particular alcohol, but you can add a bit.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:49.320
So, since it's a easy recipe, this is all. Happy Christmas and see you the next time! BYE!

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.350
First, prepare the coffee and warm up the milk and the Vov liquor.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.080
Then, pour the Vov into a small glass.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.200
Now choose between hot milk or coffee.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.470
Complete with fresh whipped cream and decorate with cocoa powder or cinnamon.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:38.980
You can also add more alcohol: the most traditional one is Whisky, or Brandy or Rum.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.940
Easy, quick and delicious, perfect for these cold days.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.970
I hope you enjoyed the recipe!
