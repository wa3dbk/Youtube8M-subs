the<00:02:25.120> front<00:02:25.390> page<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.660> groups<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.670> think<00:02:27.670> that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
the front page of groups I think that

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.259 
the front page of groups I think that
action<00:02:28.480> was<00:02:28.660> pretty<00:02:29.230> sad<00:02:29.709> to<00:02:30.100> admin<00:02:30.940> attack<00:02:31.239> a

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
action was pretty sad to admin attack a

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.120 
action was pretty sad to admin attack a
group<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.019> your<00:02:32.290> group<00:02:32.500> could<00:02:32.680> stay<00:02:32.920> on<00:02:32.950> the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
group so your group could stay on the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.640 
group so your group could stay on the
front<00:02:33.340> page<00:02:33.549> yeah<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.030> agree<00:02:34.510> totally<00:02:35.110> on<00:02:35.470> that

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
front page yeah I agree totally on that

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.520 
front page yeah I agree totally on that
and<00:02:36.519> also<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:37.030> guess<00:02:37.329> they<00:02:37.540> were<00:02:37.600> just<00:02:37.690> having

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
and also I guess they were just having

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.440 
and also I guess they were just having
fun<00:02:38.560> but<00:02:39.130> many<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.519> people<00:02:39.820> i<00:02:39.910> also<00:02:40.150> said

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
fun but many of the people i also said

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.750 
fun but many of the people i also said
that<00:02:40.480> they<00:02:40.690> regret<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.230> all<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.459> way<00:02:42.640> i<00:02:42.700> think

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
that they regret it all the way i think

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.800 
that they regret it all the way i think
they<00:02:43.680> they<00:02:44.680> still<00:02:45.489> have<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.790> kind<00:02:46.269> of<00:02:46.329> take<00:02:46.630> the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
they they still have to kind of take the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.930 
they they still have to kind of take the
responsibility<00:02:47.019> for<00:02:47.739> them<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.430> mean<00:02:48.790> they

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
responsibility for them I mean they

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.370 
responsibility for them I mean they
can't<00:02:49.150> just<00:02:49.299> say<00:02:49.390> I'm<00:02:49.510> sorry<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.900> then
