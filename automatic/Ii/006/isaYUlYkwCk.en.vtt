it<00:00:37.710> didn't<00:00:38.190> come<00:00:38.399> super<00:00:38.940> sharp<00:00:39.270> out<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> the

it didn't come super sharp out of the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.209 
it didn't come super sharp out of the
box<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.140> once<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> good<00:00:40.800> edge<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.190> it

it<00:00:41.460> holds<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.879> edge<00:00:42.059> very<00:00:42.270> well

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.920 

flipping<00:00:45.930> there's<00:00:46.590> some<00:00:47.270> tricks<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.750> this

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
flipping there's some tricks I like this

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.930 
flipping there's some tricks I like this
for<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.500> other<00:00:49.800> tricks<00:00:50.070> not<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.460> much<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:50.910> I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
for and other tricks not so much but I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.630 
for and other tricks not so much but I
really<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:52.079> aerials<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.160> find

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
really like this for is aerials I find

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.250 
really like this for is aerials I find
aerials<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.329> be<00:00:54.420> more<00:00:54.660> predictable<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
aerials to be more predictable and

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.299 
aerials to be more predictable and
easier<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.829> learn

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.060 

in<00:01:02.309> fact<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.539> would<00:01:03.930> compare<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.290> very<00:01:04.589> much<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
in fact I would compare it very much to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.940 
in fact I would compare it very much to
a<00:01:05.100> cold<00:01:05.460> steel<00:01:05.700> or<00:01:05.909> angel<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.630> got<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.530> handle<00:01:07.860> an

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
a cold steel or angel I got to handle an

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.890 
a cold steel or angel I got to handle an
archangel<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.850> passed<00:01:09.060> around<00:01:09.330> recently

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
archangel and a passed around recently

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.770 
archangel and a passed around recently
and<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.350> noticed<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.220> because<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.390> long

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
and I noticed that because of the long

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.020 
and I noticed that because of the long
handles<00:01:13.290> combined<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> long<00:01:14.250> blade<00:01:14.610> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
handles combined with the long blade it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.859 
handles combined with the long blade it
made<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.900> knife<00:01:16.110> more<00:01:16.740> top-heavy<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.869> it

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
made the knife more top-heavy and it

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.570 
made the knife more top-heavy and it
made<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.200> rotation<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.740> little<00:01:19.770> bit<00:01:20.130> faster

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
made the rotation a little bit faster

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.450 
made the rotation a little bit faster
and<00:01:20.790> thus<00:01:21.299> easier<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.470> predict<00:01:22.770> at<00:01:22.979> least<00:01:23.250> for

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
and thus easier to predict at least for

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.300 
and thus easier to predict at least for
me<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> Archangel<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:26.009> will

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
me so if you like the Archangel you will

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.020 
me so if you like the Archangel you will
like<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.970> bear<00:01:27.150> ups<00:01:28.250> for<00:01:29.250> aerials<00:01:29.670> at<00:01:29.820> least

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
like the bear ups for aerials at least

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.950 
like the bear ups for aerials at least
but<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.840> don't<00:01:31.079> like<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:31.979> much<00:01:32.189> is

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
but I don't like this for so much is

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.020 
but I don't like this for so much is
chaplains<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.229> tank<00:01:34.710> ups<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.250> these<00:01:35.490> are<00:01:35.729> very

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
chaplains the tank ups on these are very

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.980 
chaplains the tank ups on these are very
rough<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.890> can<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:38.610> chaplains<00:01:39.150> with<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.570> find

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
rough I can do chaplains with this find

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.499 
rough I can do chaplains with this find
but<00:01:40.560> once<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.040> get<00:01:41.159> good<00:01:41.400> momentum<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.180> for

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
but once you get good momentum going for

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.270 
but once you get good momentum going for
the<00:01:42.600> zero<00:01:42.840> gravity<00:01:43.049> zit<00:01:43.649> starts<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.130> get

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the zero gravity zit starts to get

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.620 
the zero gravity zit starts to get
uncomfortable<00:01:44.430> pretty<00:01:45.090> quick<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.450> raw

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
uncomfortable pretty quick and raw

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.460 
uncomfortable pretty quick and raw
selfies<00:01:45.990> finger<00:01:49.700> matisse<00:01:51.200> along<00:01:52.200> with

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
selfies finger matisse along with

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.920 
selfies finger matisse along with
smoothing<00:01:53.040> out<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.460> tank<00:01:54.030> ups<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.540> would<00:01:54.780> also

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
smoothing out the tank ups I would also

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.429 
smoothing out the tank ups I would also
suggest<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.920> they<00:01:56.430> make<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.360> pivot<00:01:58.020> pins

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
suggest that they make the pivot pins

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.550 
suggest that they make the pivot pins
shorter<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.880> pins<00:02:00.119> are<00:02:00.240> too<00:02:00.390> long<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.960> tighten

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
shorter the pins are too long I tighten

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.219 
shorter the pins are too long I tighten
these<00:02:01.649> all<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.100> way<00:02:02.189> down<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.899> as

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
these all the way down and this is as

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.410 
these all the way down and this is as
little<00:02:04.439> play<00:02:04.770> as<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.399> are<00:02:05.520> going<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.939> get<00:02:08.420> the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
little play as you are going to get the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.070 
little play as you are going to get the
tool<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:10.800> have<00:02:11.009> they<00:02:11.819> need<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.300> shorter<00:02:12.750> so

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
tool you have they need to be shorter so

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.550 
tool you have they need to be shorter so
you<00:02:13.200> can

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
you can

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.350 
you can
tighten<00:02:14.190> down<00:02:14.220> all<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.670> way<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.060> lots<00:02:15.240> of

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
tighten down all the way and lots of

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.040 
tighten down all the way and lots of
layout<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.050> then<00:02:16.200> loosen<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.160> up<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.610> get

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
layout and then loosen it up to get

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.930 
layout and then loosen it up to get
minimized<00:02:19.050> amount<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.709> play<00:02:19.920> which<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.760> lot<00:02:20.910> of

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
minimized amount of play which a lot of

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.540 
minimized amount of play which a lot of
