00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.690
 Talk to me, people, ana mateus, I am. 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.940
 assisted second period in hd medicine 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.849
 I was asked to give one a comment 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.020
 regarding the substitution test of bh is 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.699
 since the time I tried the college entrance examination 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.000
 was recurrent, I have heard that it was 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.510
 an area today to fall in the case of 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.400
 or if taxonomy has been dropped and in addition 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.949
 have fallen in biology are miguel 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.640
 twins systems is also very 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.739
 applicant in biology is in the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.570
 chemistry I remember that the pressure dropped 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.250
 of steam I am only mistaken for the superliga 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.920
 active 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.180
 the experience is also who organizes is 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.340
 How do I make time? I do not remember much. 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.890
 well on issues fell but I advise 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.350
 that you have systems is about the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.680
 institution is me I tried I'm finding 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.550
 institution note 10 in 87 years reached 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.540
 mg test and the enem is kind of me 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.619
 barred that this that my purpose here 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.560
 I tried is is a place like colleagues 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.360
 my study that left with fÃ¡bio 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.210
 they tried there in the middle of the year and I 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.350
 I saw that it was possible to pass after 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.450
 so many years right? 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.729
 It's kind of like watching ships in this 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.540
 forgetting that it is possible to reach it 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.159
 clam 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.040
 so from the moment I tried 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.159
 there anyway half a second 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.040
 and I got through and it was worth a lot 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.729
 sorry today I can talk to you with all 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.250
 the words that is the place that I should 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.680
 primarily because of the structure is 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.170
 a structure so out of the ordinary 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.710
 It is the laboratory that has the most 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.890
 pieces on the corpses from great to great at 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.680
 state is is the question of teachers are 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.500
 generally relying on contact is the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.200
 fact of having a good will to 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.149
 solve doubts and help in any way 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.549
 need 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.060
 in preparation for one's life 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:12.590
 profession since the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.200
 aaaah average given to the given college 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.230
 course is 70% the number of 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.620
 other courses already have people in the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.930
 residence a little further ahead and 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.400
 for me the maximum point that is what is the 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.550
 part of the humanization that 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.370
 curriculum to 6 all the immense people 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.300
 has a matter of the dark says it's 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.269
 humanized nor falling from the grid of humans 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.540
 it's aimed at medicine 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.600
 this helps 20 ha ha ha do not stay 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.630
 in the tourism where he tries medicine 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.390
 technique that is beautiful for sure 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.660
 anatomy of the histology but but that 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.470
 human matter 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.580
 Nowadays it's sound I know few 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.650
 doctors so take medicine in 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.519
 to the letter that in the case would be served 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:12.640
 The patient should take care of him and 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:16.489
 both to the appeasement of pain and to 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.769
 acura in that at last forget the human being 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.070
 and treat it as a human being and not 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:25.220
 as a disease that is why I recommend it 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.650
 that you have on your college entrance exam and leave a 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.160
 last message because it's 17 years of 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.250
 coursework and I have a luggage is 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.959
 life and it's something I 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.440
 I understood that after you pass, you 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.989
 you realize that it depends on how long you 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.380
 happened in the little school 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.630
 suffering does not put so 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.389
 Then you're worth it. 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.910
 so so if you crave medicine 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.310
 even if you see who it at once 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.440
 A doctor friend talked to me talking to me. 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.989
 you quake that medicine 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.480
 the last had until the last last drop 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.269
 sweat because we learned that with 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.460
 the one who never gives up and never is 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:11.250
 defeated then go to the end useful 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.500
 as much as you can because if you went 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.970
 if you will pass and when you little 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.600
 she went to university 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.790
 you have other other challenges and 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.650
 years have passed will pass as 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.630
 started with nothing because your 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.520
 learning and do in having arrived there 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.020
 will overwhelm any suffering 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.960
 previous 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.500
 so I hope and wish good luck to 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.000
 all remain quiet tire seize 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.790
 a time to rest 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.910
 study but rest because what you 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:46.020
 he studies all year in there 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:51.440
 so force me there and I hope you'll be there 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.440
 one of the freshmen and future heart
