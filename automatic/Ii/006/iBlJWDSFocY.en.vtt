00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
through here previously on last I'm

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.939 
through here previously on last I'm
sharp<00:00:56.910> pictures<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.960> let's<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> little<00:00:58.770> bit

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
sharp pictures on let's see a little bit

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.950 
sharp pictures on let's see a little bit
of<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.789> hardware<00:01:00.120> side<00:01:00.300> where<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.719> four

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
of the hardware side where we have four

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.299 
of the hardware side where we have four
gigs<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.350> RAM<00:01:01.559> inside<00:01:01.890> Intel<00:01:02.550> Core<00:01:02.789> i5<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:04.309> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
gigs of RAM inside Intel Core i5 and the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.149 
gigs of RAM inside Intel Core i5 and the
you<00:01:05.670> at<00:01:05.909> 4,200<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.930> processor<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.950> have<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you at 4,200 you processor we have a

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.120 
you at 4,200 you processor we have a
power<00:01:08.520> port<00:01:08.790> USB<00:01:09.060> 2.0<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:10.530> external<00:01:10.799> hot

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
power port USB 2.0 with external hot

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.980 
power port USB 2.0 with external hot
water<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.760> extra<00:01:12.060> power<00:01:12.270> well<00:01:12.900> actually

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
water with extra power well actually

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.310 
water with extra power well actually
maybe<00:01:13.290> even<00:01:13.590> 3.0<00:01:14.130> since<00:01:14.400> blue<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.020> hdmi<00:01:16.020> port

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
maybe even 3.0 since blue and hdmi port

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.100 
maybe even 3.0 since blue and hdmi port
so<00:01:16.439> we<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.710> give<00:01:16.860> out<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.970> picture<00:01:18.780> quite

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
so we can give out the picture quite

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.000 
so we can give out the picture quite
easily<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.860> our<00:01:20.040> TV<00:01:20.400> or<00:01:20.640> somewhere<00:01:20.970> else

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
easily on to our TV or somewhere else

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.670 
easily on to our TV or somewhere else
on<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> other<00:01:23.760> side<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.480> micro<00:01:25.350> USB

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
on the other side we have the micro USB

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.070 
on the other side we have the micro USB
ports<00:01:26.070> which<00:01:26.430> I'm<00:01:26.670> not<00:01:27.000> sure<00:01:27.270> yet<00:01:27.510> what<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.960> is

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
ports which I'm not sure yet what it is

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.050 
ports which I'm not sure yet what it is
more<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.560> guess<00:01:28.770> were<00:01:28.950> an<00:01:29.070> adapter<00:01:29.520> like

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
more but I guess were an adapter like

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.200 
more but I guess were an adapter like
network<00:01:30.510> or<00:01:30.660> VGA<00:01:31.050> also<00:01:31.740> again<00:01:32.040> USB<00:01:32.460> 3.0<00:01:32.850> and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
network or VGA also again USB 3.0 and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.740 
network or VGA also again USB 3.0 and
headphone<00:01:34.170> port<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:35.130> no<00:01:35.370> microphone<00:01:35.970> as<00:01:36.210> it

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
headphone port with no microphone as it

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.690 
headphone port with no microphone as it
seems<00:01:37.020> since<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:37.980> there<00:01:38.220> should<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.550> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
seems since I think there should be a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.060 
seems since I think there should be a
microphone<00:01:39.150> somewhere<00:01:39.510> inside<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.620> case<00:01:40.800> so

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
microphone somewhere inside the case so

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.680 
microphone somewhere inside the case so
we<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> screen<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.090> toothed

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
we can see that the screen is toothed

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.730 
we can see that the screen is toothed
belt<00:01:42.930> back<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.770> far<00:01:44.040> which<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.670> quite<00:01:44.910> enough

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
belt back this far which is quite enough

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.990 
belt back this far which is quite enough
if<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.890> close<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.430> can<00:01:47.520> see<00:01:47.730> from<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
if you close it up you can see from the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.100 
if you close it up you can see from the
outside<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.420> looks<00:01:48.450> really<00:01:48.720> quite<00:01:48.990> beautiful

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
outside it looks really quite beautiful

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.900 
outside it looks really quite beautiful
but<00:01:49.410> it's<00:01:49.650> all<00:01:49.860> plastic<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.460> make<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.760> really

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
but it's all plastic to make it really

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.940 
but it's all plastic to make it really
this<00:01:51.180> line<00:01:51.690> but<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:51.990> hope<00:01:52.170> still<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.650> it's<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
this line but I hope still that it's a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.660 
this line but I hope still that it's a
