the<00:00:04.750> most<00:00:04.930> common<00:00:05.350> upgrade<00:00:05.740> done<00:00:05.920> to<00:00:06.160> all

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.310 
the most common upgrade done to all

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.670 
the most common upgrade done to all

scooters ATVs and go-karts is the

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.760 
scooters ATVs and go-karts is the
exhaust<00:00:08.980> why<00:00:09.580> you<00:00:10.030> ask<00:00:10.240> well<00:00:10.930> basically

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
exhaust why you ask well basically

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.949 
exhaust why you ask well basically
because<00:00:12.100> OEMs<00:00:12.639> restrict<00:00:13.059> the<00:00:13.150> flow<00:00:13.270> of<00:00:13.360> air<00:00:13.719> in

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959 
because OEMs restrict the flow of air in

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.049 
because OEMs restrict the flow of air in
most<00:00:14.500> exhausts<00:00:15.039> of<00:00:15.129> the<00:00:15.190> brand<00:00:15.699> new<00:00:15.850> scooter

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
most exhausts of the brand new scooter

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.720 
most exhausts of the brand new scooter
in<00:00:16.840> order<00:00:17.050> to<00:00:17.170> meet<00:00:17.320> and<00:00:17.890> comply<00:00:18.220> with<00:00:18.520> certain

speed<00:00:21.070> of<00:00:21.190> the<00:00:21.220> vehicle<00:00:21.430> for<00:00:21.790> example<00:00:22.390> by

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
speed of the vehicle for example by

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.660 
speed of the vehicle for example by
replacing<00:00:22.810> an<00:00:23.140> exhaust<00:00:23.620> with<00:00:23.890> an<00:00:23.980> MRP<00:00:24.250> exhaust

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
replacing an exhaust with an MRP exhaust

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.340 
replacing an exhaust with an MRP exhaust
you're<00:00:25.180> going<00:00:25.390> to<00:00:25.450> get<00:00:25.600> more<00:00:25.780> top-end<00:00:26.080> speed

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
you're going to get more top-end speed

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.010 
you're going to get more top-end speed
because<00:00:27.039> we<00:00:27.220> design<00:00:27.550> them<00:00:27.700> for<00:00:27.940> racing<00:00:28.330> so<00:00:28.960> in

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
because we design them for racing so in

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.810 
because we design them for racing so in
your<00:00:29.110> average<00:00:29.440> 2<00:00:29.680> stroke<00:00:29.920> scooter<00:00:30.160> this<00:00:30.670> is

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
your average 2 stroke scooter this is

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.459 
your average 2 stroke scooter this is
the<00:00:30.940> easiest<00:00:31.270> application<00:00:31.960> that<00:00:32.110> you<00:00:32.169> can<00:00:32.320> do

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
the easiest application that you can do

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.229 
the easiest application that you can do
usually<00:00:33.219> by<00:00:33.340> changing<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:33.760> washer<00:00:34.060> on<00:00:34.150> the

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
usually by changing the washer on the

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.319 
usually by changing the washer on the
rollers<00:00:34.540> and<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:34.900> exhaust<00:00:35.230> now<00:00:35.950> in<00:00:36.329> go-karts

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
rollers and the exhaust now in go-karts

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.180 
rollers and the exhaust now in go-karts
you're<00:00:37.630> going<00:00:37.780> to<00:00:37.840> want<00:00:37.989> more<00:00:38.170> power<00:00:38.350> this<00:00:39.040> is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
you're going to want more power this is

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.950 
you're going to want more power this is
also<00:00:39.489> achievable<00:00:39.970> by<00:00:40.120> changing<00:00:40.510> your<00:00:40.540> exhaust

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
also achievable by changing your exhaust

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.139 
also achievable by changing your exhaust
because<00:00:41.380> most<00:00:41.680> OEM<00:00:42.100> go-kart<00:00:42.700> exhausts

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
because most OEM go-kart exhausts

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.540 
because most OEM go-kart exhausts
restrict<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.840> amount<00:00:43.899> of<00:00:44.200> airflow<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:44.800> your

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
restrict the amount of airflow and your

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.670 
restrict the amount of airflow and your
bottom<00:00:45.880> end<00:00:46.059> for<00:00:46.300> power<00:00:46.450> so<00:00:47.020> by<00:00:47.170> changing<00:00:47.320> both

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
bottom end for power so by changing both

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.180 
bottom end for power so by changing both
you're<00:00:47.920> going<00:00:48.040> to<00:00:48.100> gain<00:00:48.340> speed<00:00:48.970> and<00:00:49.390> power<00:00:50.190> on

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
you're going to gain speed and power on

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.940 
you're going to gain speed and power on
top<00:00:51.610> of<00:00:51.760> d<00:00:51.910> restricted<00:00:52.450> or<00:00:52.660> upgraded<00:00:53.649> exhaust

exhaust that can only be used if you've
upgraded<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:24.009> cylinder<00:01:24.340> so<00:01:24.429> you<00:01:24.520> go<00:01:24.759> from

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
upgraded the cylinder so you go from

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.629 
upgraded the cylinder so you go from
fifty<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.299> a<00:01:25.420> 70<00:01:25.869> and<00:01:26.049> in<00:01:26.560> some<00:01:26.740> cases<00:01:26.950> from<00:01:27.249> 50

to 80 in order to use them because if
not<00:01:29.709> your<00:01:29.979> engine's<00:01:30.340> going<00:01:30.399> to<00:01:30.549> be<00:01:30.609> extremely

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
not your engine's going to be extremely

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.249 
not your engine's going to be extremely
underpowered<00:01:31.389> he's<00:01:31.749> going<00:01:31.929> to<00:01:31.990> have<00:01:32.079> more

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
underpowered he's going to have more

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.499 
underpowered he's going to have more
flow<00:01:32.499> of<00:01:32.619> air<00:01:32.770> so<00:01:33.399> just<00:01:33.999> make<00:01:34.119> sure<00:01:34.270> when

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
flow of air so just make sure when

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.179 
flow of air so just make sure when
upgrading<00:01:34.719> to<00:01:34.929> an<00:01:35.049> MRP<00:01:35.349> exhaust<00:01:35.709> don't<00:01:35.979> drive

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
upgrading to an MRP exhaust don't drive

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.339 
upgrading to an MRP exhaust don't drive
yourself<00:01:36.340> crazy<00:01:36.639> they're<00:01:37.539> great<00:01:37.719> exhaustion

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:38.349 
yourself crazy they're great exhaustion

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:40.169 
yourself crazy they're great exhaustion
or<00:01:38.439> you<00:01:38.529> get<00:01:38.649> more<00:01:38.829> power<00:01:39.009> and<00:01:39.219> more<00:01:39.279> speed<00:01:39.639> at

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
or you get more power and more speed at

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:41.370 
or you get more power and more speed at
the<00:01:40.299> same<00:01:40.450> time<00:01:40.509> you<00:01:40.810> gotta<00:01:40.959> make<00:01:41.079> sure<00:01:41.139> you<00:01:41.289> do

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380
