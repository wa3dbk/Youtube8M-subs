00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
and slow enough you had to slow it down

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.540 
and slow enough you had to slow it down
even<00:05:51.830> more

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
even more

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.820

any thoughts on the quality of fish you
were<00:05:54.920> there<00:05:55.070> I<00:05:55.100> didn't<00:05:55.370> see<00:05:55.400> you<00:05:55.580> catch<00:05:55.760> any

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
were there I didn't see you catch any

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.550 
were there I didn't see you catch any
little<00:05:56.330> ones<00:05:56.480> today<00:05:56.600> they<00:05:56.840> were<00:05:56.900> all<00:05:57.110> big<00:05:57.350> ones

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.560 
little ones today they were all big ones
yeah<00:05:58.280> I<00:05:58.310> caught<00:05:58.610> a<00:05:58.640> few<00:05:58.910> small<00:05:59.180> ones<00:05:59.390> just

mixed<00:05:59.930> in<00:06:00.050> I<00:06:00.260> think<00:06:00.320> they're<00:06:00.740> just<00:06:00.920> running<00:06:01.100> up

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
mixed in I think they're just running up

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.890 
mixed in I think they're just running up
down<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.610> bank<00:06:01.820> feeding<00:06:02.240> on<00:06:02.300> the<00:06:02.390> shad<00:06:02.570> but

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
down the bank feeding on the shad but

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.050

the<00:06:03.110> big<00:06:03.260> fish<00:06:03.530> I<00:06:03.950> could<00:06:04.550> see<00:06:04.790> him<00:06:04.910> on<00:06:05.000> the

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
the big fish I could see him on the

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.730 
the big fish I could see him on the
graph<00:06:05.270> they<00:06:05.540> were<00:06:05.600> just<00:06:05.840> they're<00:06:06.380> just<00:06:06.590> down

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740
