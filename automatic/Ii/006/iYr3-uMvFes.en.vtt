00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
on it and you just have to be a little

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.430 
on it and you just have to be a little

starts<00:05:10.140> slow<00:05:10.380> just<00:05:10.650> use<00:05:10.830> it<00:05:10.980> once<00:05:11.190> a<00:05:11.340> day<00:05:11.370> you

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
starts slow just use it once a day you

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.930 
starts slow just use it once a day you
know<00:05:12.360> quite<00:05:12.600> lightly<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.170> build<00:05:13.740> up<00:05:13.980> and<00:05:14.370> I

know quite lightly and build up and I

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.250 
know quite lightly and build up and I
would<00:05:15.060> probably<00:05:15.360> suggest<00:05:15.540> when<00:05:15.840> you<00:05:15.930> come<00:05:16.110> off
