 that are digital art vice transcribing 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.680
 with them so that everything is medium 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.780
 homogenous clear you studied in 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.640

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.960
 and as I care as I stick to 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.519
 to be a master and something very big and strong 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.950
 design to attract in Chile and there it is 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.100
 where I took the greatest experience 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.180
 how much character do you have to wear 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.210
 around 50 52 are caritas 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.240
 and they have history change the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.540
 most not the cast of dancers has 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.420
 some changes happen like coral and 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.060
 motives some fairy birds and that 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.890
 change has to be splash or if you have to 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.080
 try to do as conditioning the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.080
 vector me that is easy to exchange 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.210
 and they are stories with a lot of 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.450

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.180
 a luxury to work with james and the estu 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.409
