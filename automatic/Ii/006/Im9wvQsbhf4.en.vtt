00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
cup of that we're going to cook it until

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.399 
cup of that we're going to cook it until
it<00:01:42.710> gets<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:42.979> little<00:01:43.070> thickened<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:44.409> some

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
it gets a little thickened and some

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.160 
it gets a little thickened and some
recipes<00:01:45.950> call<00:01:46.220> for<00:01:46.250> a<00:01:46.910> tablespoon<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.840> flour

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
recipes call for a tablespoon of flour

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.249 
recipes call for a tablespoon of flour
in<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:49.100> but<00:01:49.759> what<00:01:50.119> I<00:01:50.149> do<00:01:50.270> is<00:01:50.660> I<00:01:50.780> add<00:01:50.960> about<00:01:51.200> a

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
in this but what I do is I add about a

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.719 
in this but what I do is I add about a
tablespoon<00:01:51.440> or<00:01:52.009> two<00:01:52.369> of<00:01:52.960> grated<00:01:53.960> cheese<00:01:54.229> or

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
tablespoon or two of grated cheese or

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.480 
tablespoon or two of grated cheese or
locatelli<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:56.869> then<00:01:57.350> we'll<00:01:57.979> make<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.340> a

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
locatelli and then we'll make it a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.240 
locatelli and then we'll make it a
little<00:01:58.580> cheesier<00:01:59.530> and<00:02:00.530> one<00:02:00.619> more<00:02:00.770> flavorful

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
little cheesier and one more flavorful

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.040 
little cheesier and one more flavorful
also<00:02:01.819> we<00:02:02.119> don't<00:02:02.210> have<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.450> add<00:02:02.569> salt<00:02:02.840> now

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
also we don't have to add salt now

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.169 
also we don't have to add salt now
because<00:02:03.890> this<00:02:04.039> is<00:02:04.100> basically<00:02:04.550> functioning<00:02:05.090> as

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
because this is basically functioning as

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.650 
because this is basically functioning as
our<00:02:05.300> salt<00:02:06.819> taking<00:02:07.819> the<00:02:07.909> hot<00:02:08.060> stuffing<00:02:08.509> or

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
our salt taking the hot stuffing or

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.640 
our salt taking the hot stuffing or
putting<00:02:08.840> on<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.140> cold<00:02:09.350> waster<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:11.620> what<00:02:12.620> I

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
putting on the cold waster and what I

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.920 
putting on the cold waster and what I
did<00:02:12.860> was<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.100> put<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.489> creamed<00:02:14.300> spinach<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.840> a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
did was I put the creamed spinach in a

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.930 
did was I put the creamed spinach in a
strainer<00:02:15.290> over<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.830> bowl<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:16.370> we<00:02:16.730> still<00:02:16.880> have

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
strainer over a bowl so we still have

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.520 
strainer over a bowl so we still have
that<00:02:17.180> nice<00:02:17.360> cream<00:02:17.660> in<00:02:17.810> there<00:02:17.930> but<00:02:18.200> we<00:02:18.350> want<00:02:18.500> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
that nice cream in there but we want to

that nice cream in there but we want to
keep<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.799> as<00:02:18.950> dry<00:02:19.940> as<00:02:19.970> possible<00:02:20.150> when<00:02:20.690> we're

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
keep it as dry as possible when we're

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.420 
keep it as dry as possible when we're
stuffing<00:02:21.019> it<00:02:21.260> otherwise<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:22.100> liquid<00:02:22.370> will

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
stuffing it otherwise the liquid will

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.140 
stuffing it otherwise the liquid will
just<00:02:22.670> use<00:02:22.880> right<00:02:23.360> out<00:02:24.519> so<00:02:25.519> I'm<00:02:25.579> taking<00:02:25.700> about<00:02:25.970> a

teaspoon here just basically covering up
the<00:02:30.470> oyster<00:02:30.860> and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.759 

some<00:02:34.209> people<00:02:34.510> take<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.019> leaves<00:02:35.230> off<00:02:35.439> of<00:02:35.500> the

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769

some people take the leaves off of the
spinach<00:02:36.069> when<00:02:36.219> you<00:02:36.280> have<00:02:36.400> matured<00:02:36.819> spinach

leaves that's what you're going to do if

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.259

you have baby spinach leaves you can

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.170 
you have baby spinach leaves you can
leave<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.650> stems<00:02:41.650> on<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.219> if<00:02:42.609> you're<00:02:42.849> using

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
leave the stems on and if you're using

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.289 
leave the stems on and if you're using
frozen<00:02:44.019> spinach<00:02:44.319> perfectly<00:02:45.189> fine<00:02:45.370> some

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
frozen spinach perfectly fine some

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.089 
frozen spinach perfectly fine some
people<00:02:46.540> put<00:02:46.659> it<00:02:46.810> into<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.260> food<00:02:47.590> processor<00:02:47.620> to

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
people put it into a food processor to

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.860 
people put it into a food processor to
make<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.370> nice<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:48.519> creamy<00:02:48.879> looking<00:02:49.299> either

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
make it nice and creamy looking either

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.789 
make it nice and creamy looking either
way<00:02:50.109> this<00:02:50.260> is<00:02:50.379> a<00:02:50.409> little<00:02:50.560> bit<00:02:50.709> more

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
way this is a little bit more

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.789 
way this is a little bit more
traditional<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.489> little<00:02:51.849> more<00:02:52.060> rustic<00:02:52.799> we

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
traditional a little more rustic we

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.190 
traditional a little more rustic we
balanced<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.489> oysters<00:02:55.030> over<00:02:55.420> kosher<00:02:55.900> salt

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
balanced the oysters over kosher salt

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.140 
balanced the oysters over kosher salt
the<00:02:56.620> reason<00:02:56.920> why<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.099> kosher<00:02:57.579> salt<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:57.909> there

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
the reason why the kosher salt is there

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.539 
the reason why the kosher salt is there
is<00:02:58.389> so<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.650> oysters<00:03:00.129> don't<00:03:00.280> tip<00:03:00.459> over

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
is so that the oysters don't tip over

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.020 
is so that the oysters don't tip over
and<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:00.939> juice<00:03:01.120> doesn't<00:03:01.359> fall<00:03:01.659> out<00:03:03.030> another

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
and the juice doesn't fall out another

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.550 
and the juice doesn't fall out another
reason<00:03:04.209> is<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.689> also<00:03:04.840> holds<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.409> heat

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
reason is that it also holds the heat

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.899 
reason is that it also holds the heat
and<00:03:05.709> when<00:03:05.889> it<00:03:05.980> comes<00:03:06.159> to<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.430> table<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.790> can

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
and when it comes to the table you can

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.839 
and when it comes to the table you can
read<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.180> oysters<00:03:07.510> out<00:03:07.599> for<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:08.079> while<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:09.730> a

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
read the oysters out for a while just a

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.059 
read the oysters out for a while just a
nice<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.180> hot<00:03:10.329> I'm<00:03:11.230> going<00:03:11.349> to<00:03:11.470> add<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.739> little

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
nice and hot I'm going to add a little

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.479 
nice and hot I'm going to add a little
bit<00:03:12.189> of<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.370> cream<00:03:12.639> I<00:03:13.560> do<00:03:14.560> prefer<00:03:14.919> Greer

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
bit of the cream I do prefer Greer

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.399 
bit of the cream I do prefer Greer
cheese<00:03:15.909> I<00:03:18.209> think<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.299> is<00:03:19.329> a<00:03:19.480> much<00:03:20.379> better

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
cheese I think it is a much better

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:21.899 
cheese I think it is a much better
quality<00:03:21.010> cheese<00:03:21.219> and<00:03:21.400> it's<00:03:21.519> much<00:03:21.700> more

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
quality cheese and it's much more

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.050 
quality cheese and it's much more
flavorful<00:03:22.329> or<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:23.590> can<00:03:23.739> add<00:03:23.889> Swiss<00:03:24.819> cheese

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
flavorful or you can add Swiss cheese

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.659 
flavorful or you can add Swiss cheese
and<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:26.590> would<00:03:26.739> recommend<00:03:26.980> shredding<00:03:27.579> the

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
and I would recommend shredding the

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.490 
and I would recommend shredding the
Swiss<00:03:27.909> cheese

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
Swiss cheese

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.040 
Swiss cheese

onto this particular plate which is a

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.000 
onto this particular plate which is a
smoked<00:03:46.240> salt<00:03:46.510> which<00:03:46.990> is<00:03:47.140> not<00:03:47.290> necessary<00:03:47.830> but

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
smoked salt which is not necessary but

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.740 
smoked salt which is not necessary but
it<00:03:48.160> just<00:03:48.370> makes<00:03:48.730> a<00:03:48.880> little<00:03:49.000> bit<00:03:49.300> of<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:49.450> nicer
