perhaps the best way of taking advantage
of<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.230> perk<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.859> double<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.460> with

Juggernog that way when you make a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.979 
Juggernog that way when you make a
mistake<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.670> don't<00:01:02.910> actually<00:01:03.210> dive<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.960> prone

you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:05.040> handle<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.460> couple<00:01:05.489> hits<00:01:06.000> from

you can handle a couple hits from
zombies<00:01:06.659> before<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.140> go<00:01:07.290> down<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.490> the

flapper perk is that if I mess up my
dive<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.659> prone<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:13.170> leaves<00:01:13.439> me<00:01:13.680> completely

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460

it those things combined with the nuke I
find<00:01:47.759> are<00:01:47.939> worthwhile<00:01:48.420> having<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:49.079> perk

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.249

alright now that I've saved up over four

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.200 
alright now that I've saved up over four
thousand<00:02:04.830> seven<00:02:04.979> hundred<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.430> fifty<00:02:05.580> points

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
thousand seven hundred and fifty points

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.690 
thousand seven hundred and fifty points
I'm<00:02:06.360> gonna<00:02:06.630> go<00:02:06.810> turn<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.290> power<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.680> which<00:02:08.520> is

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
I'm gonna go turn the power on which is

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.020 
I'm gonna go turn the power on which is
all<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.300> way<00:02:09.330> at<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> top<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> ship<00:02:11.030> so

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
all the way at the top of the ship so

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.059 
all the way at the top of the ship so
that<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.209> don't<00:02:12.420> get<00:02:12.510> any<00:02:12.569> conspiracy<00:02:13.500> theories

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069

on<00:02:14.220> my<00:02:14.400> hands<00:02:14.790> here<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.239> made<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.630> dumb<00:02:15.900> move<00:02:16.230> and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
on my hands here I made a dumb move and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.890 
on my hands here I made a dumb move and
forgot<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.800> turn<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.370> power<00:02:17.580> on<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.209> had<00:02:18.720> to

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
forgot to turn the power on it had to

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.470 
forgot to turn the power on it had to
come<00:02:19.110> back<00:02:19.380> up<00:02:19.650> not<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.670> waste<00:02:20.819> your<00:02:21.030> time<00:02:21.330> I

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.060 
come back up not to waste your time I
cut<00:02:21.780> myself<00:02:21.959> back<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.830> powder<00:02:23.400> room

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
cut myself back to the powder room

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.710 
cut myself back to the powder room
so<00:02:26.070> once<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.580> powers<00:02:26.910> on<00:02:27.090> you're<00:02:27.300> gonna<00:02:27.420> drop

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
so once the powers on you're gonna drop

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.449 
so once the powers on you're gonna drop
down<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> lower<00:02:28.440> level<00:02:28.830> stand<00:02:29.190> in<00:02:29.340> front

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
how to set off the mini nuke in order to

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.060 
how to set off the mini nuke in order to
do<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:54.959> you're<00:02:55.110> gonna<00:02:55.260> have<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.530> dive<00:02:55.799> to

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
do this you're gonna have to dive to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.580 
do this you're gonna have to dive to
prone<00:02:56.100> from<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.670> height<00:02:56.910> that's<00:02:57.750> probably

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
prone from a height that's probably

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.979 
prone from a height that's probably
above<00:02:58.860> six<00:02:59.190> feet<00:02:59.430> in<00:03:00.090> case<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.720> don't<00:03:00.840> know

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
above six feet in case you don't know

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.390 
above six feet in case you don't know
how<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.170> dive<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.590> prone<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.070> know<00:03:02.130> they're

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
how to dive to prone and I know they're

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.490 
how to dive to prone and I know they're
there<00:03:02.700> everybody<00:03:03.510> probably<00:03:03.750> knows<00:03:04.019> this<00:03:04.350> but

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
there everybody probably knows this but

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.770 
there everybody probably knows this but
just<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:04.829> case<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.730> have<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.090> be<00:03:06.209> sprinting

just in case you have to be sprinting
and<00:03:07.019> then<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.440> hold<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.739> Crouch<00:03:08.040> button<00:03:08.340> by

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
and then you hold the Crouch button by

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.430 
and then you hold the Crouch button by
holding<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.540> you're<00:03:09.660> gonna<00:03:09.840> jump<00:03:10.170> in<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.410> air

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
holding it you're gonna jump in the air

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.920 
holding it you're gonna jump in the air
and<00:03:11.130> you're<00:03:11.280> gonna<00:03:11.400> lay<00:03:11.700> down<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.299> lie<00:03:12.570> flat

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
and you're gonna lay down and lie flat

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.050 
and you're gonna lay down and lie flat
you<00:03:13.709> need<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.980> be<00:03:14.070> jumping<00:03:14.430> from<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:14.700> distance

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
you need to be jumping from a distance

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.270 
you need to be jumping from a distance
about<00:03:15.209> six<00:03:15.780> feet<00:03:15.959> like<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.320> said<00:03:16.560> earlier<00:03:17.010> and

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
about six feet like I said earlier and

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:41.070 
about six feet like I said earlier and
that<00:03:17.400> will<00:03:17.610> cause<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.820> explosion

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.240 

now<00:03:42.080> I'm<00:03:42.230> gonna<00:03:42.350> start<00:03:42.620> giving<00:03:42.920> some<00:03:42.950> examples

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
now I'm gonna start giving some examples

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.400 
now I'm gonna start giving some examples
of<00:03:43.820> how<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.060> kill<00:03:44.330> zombies<00:03:44.780> with<00:03:44.990> it<00:03:45.170> it's

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
of how to kill zombies with it it's

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.650 
of how to kill zombies with it it's
pretty<00:03:45.830> simple<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.490> just<00:03:46.640> have<00:03:47.210> to<00:03:47.360> jump

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
pretty simple you just have to jump

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.810 
pretty simple you just have to jump
within<00:03:47.900> like<00:03:48.260> I'd<00:03:48.470> say<00:03:48.710> a<00:03:48.740> thirty<00:03:49.520> foot

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
within like I'd say a thirty foot

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.150 
within like I'd say a thirty foot
perimeter<00:03:50.120> of<00:03:50.660> where<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.380> zombies<00:03:51.770> are<00:03:51.950> and

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
perimeter of where the zombies are and

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.130 
perimeter of where the zombies are and
they'll<00:03:52.280> be<00:03:52.430> killed<00:03:52.670> by<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:52.910> mini<00:03:53.180> nuke<00:03:53.390> you

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
they'll be killed by the mini nuke you

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.140 
they'll be killed by the mini nuke you
can<00:03:54.320> even<00:03:54.590> jump<00:03:54.830> from<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:55.190> lower<00:03:55.430> hills<00:03:55.820> that

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
can even jump from the lower hills that

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.300 
can even jump from the lower hills that
are<00:03:56.210> down<00:03:56.450> by<00:03:56.600> the<00:03:56.660> caves<00:03:56.990> which<00:03:57.710> is<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:57.920> very

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
are down by the caves which is a very

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:06.790 
are down by the caves which is a very
useful<00:03:58.520> area<00:03:58.970> for<00:03:59.330> me<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:06.290> last<00:04:06.470> thing<00:04:06.710> I'm

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.350 
useful area for me the last thing I'm
going<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:07.010> show<00:04:07.070> you<00:04:07.250> is<00:04:07.520> an<00:04:07.640> example<00:04:07.700> of<00:04:08.150> me

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
going to show you is an example of me

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.690
