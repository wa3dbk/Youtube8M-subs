artwork so if you're like me your your
scanner<00:00:28.130> bed<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.460> actually<00:00:30.060> smaller<00:00:30.720> than

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
scanner bed is actually smaller than

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.920 
scanner bed is actually smaller than
most<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.890> artwork<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> create<00:00:33.149> so

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
most of the artwork that you create so

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.200 
most of the artwork that you create so
you<00:00:34.020> end<00:00:34.260> up<00:00:34.380> having<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.770> scan<00:00:35.130> your<00:00:35.370> art<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:35.850> in

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
you end up having to scan your art in in

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.770 
you end up having to scan your art in in
separate<00:00:36.840> pieces<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.350> somehow<00:00:38.510> stitch<00:00:39.510> them

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
separate pieces and somehow stitch them

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.280 
separate pieces and somehow stitch them
together<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.440> Photoshop<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
together in Photoshop and that can be a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.130 
together in Photoshop and that can be a
painstaking<00:00:44.840> time<00:00:45.840> taking<00:00:46.620> process<00:00:47.870> well<00:00:48.870> if

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
painstaking time taking process well if

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.459 
painstaking time taking process well if
you<00:00:49.289> use<00:00:49.320> photo<00:00:49.890> merge<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.579> Photoshop<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:52.230> does

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
had to scan it in four pieces and

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.310 
had to scan it in four pieces and
there's<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> lot<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.090> overlap<00:01:03.750> from<00:01:04.049> piece<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.550 
watch as Photoshop does it's magic and
their<00:01:53.759> Photoshop<00:01:54.329> has<00:01:54.450> stitched<00:01:54.840> my<00:01:55.200> four

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
their Photoshop has stitched my four

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.700 
their Photoshop has stitched my four
separate<00:01:56.189> images<00:01:56.640> together<00:01:57.170> perfectly<00:01:58.170> as

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
separate images together perfectly as

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.670 
separate images together perfectly as
you<00:01:58.920> can<00:01:59.219> see<00:01:59.490> it's<00:02:00.149> seamless<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:01.110> can't<00:02:01.530> even

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
you can see it's seamless I can't even

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.859 
you can see it's seamless I can't even
tell<00:02:01.979> where<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> stitching<00:02:03.390> has<00:02:03.450> happened

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
tell where the stitching has happened

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.780 
tell where the stitching has happened
the<00:02:04.020> only<00:02:04.049> way<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.770> tell<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.159> over<00:02:05.460> here

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
the only way you can tell is over here

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.089 
the only way you can tell is over here
it<00:02:06.270> keeps<00:02:06.600> them<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.960> separate<00:02:07.350> layers<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.039> you

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
it keeps them in separate layers and you

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.570 
it keeps them in separate layers and you
can<00:02:08.280> see<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:08.670> masked<00:02:09.239> out<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.979> duplicate

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
can see it's masked out the duplicate

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.770 
can see it's masked out the duplicate
areas<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.239> each

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
areas on each

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.059 
areas on each
um<00:02:13.130> separate<00:02:14.130> scan<00:02:14.959> so<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:16.350> usually<00:02:16.590> merge

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
um separate scan so I usually merge

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.070 
um separate scan so I usually merge
those<00:02:17.280> together<00:02:17.550> because<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.209> looks<00:02:18.420> good<00:02:18.750> and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
those together because it looks good and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.940 
those together because it looks good and
then<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.650> crop<00:02:19.980> out<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:21.200> crop<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.380> tight<00:02:22.650> so

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
then I crop out the crop it tight so

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.100 
then I crop out the crop it tight so
that<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.370> background<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:24.090> all<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.569> same<00:02:24.810> and

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
that the background is all the same and

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.770 
that the background is all the same and
there's<00:02:25.230> no<00:02:25.470> none<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.640> clear<00:02:26.940> area<00:02:27.569> is

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
there's no none of the clear area is

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.290 
there's no none of the clear area is
showing<00:02:29.660> I'm<00:02:30.660> gonna<00:02:30.900> rotate<00:02:31.170> because<00:02:31.590> it

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
showing I'm gonna rotate because it

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.740 
showing I'm gonna rotate because it
Skanda<00:02:33.300> them<00:02:34.100> upside<00:02:35.100> down<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.750> then

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
Skanda them upside down and then

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.949 
Skanda them upside down and then
scanning<00:02:37.230> often<00:02:38.000> doesn't<00:02:39.000> scan<00:02:39.480> at<00:02:39.720> bright

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
scanning often doesn't scan at bright

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.830 
scanning often doesn't scan at bright
white<00:02:40.230> or<00:02:41.010> sometimes<00:02:41.580> some<00:02:42.030> areas<00:02:42.420> will<00:02:42.690> be

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
white and others will be shaded and so a

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.720 
white and others will be shaded and so a
quick<00:02:45.930> fix<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.590> do<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:47.100> works<00:02:47.310> great<00:02:47.610> for

quickly undo I'm gonna command Z and
undo<00:03:28.560> what<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.739> just<00:03:28.829> did<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:30.209> add<00:03:30.360> an

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
undo what I just did is to add an

adjustment layer clicking here and doing
levels<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.390> then<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.810> way<00:03:37.049> it's<00:03:37.799> the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
levels and then that way it's the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.330 
levels and then that way it's the
adjustment<00:03:38.820> is<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.739> there<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.100> can

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
adjustment is is there and you can

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.640 
adjustment is is there and you can
change<00:03:41.609> it<00:03:41.820> as<00:03:41.940> much<00:03:42.150> as<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.480> want<00:03:42.959> later<00:03:43.320> and

change it as much as you want later and

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.650 
change it as much as you want later and
so<00:03:44.130> it's<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.370> same<00:03:44.400> idea<00:03:44.609> you<00:03:45.120> add<00:03:45.299> the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
so it's the same idea you add the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.319 
so it's the same idea you add the
adjustment<00:03:46.260> layer<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.709> levels<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.489> click<00:03:48.150> on
