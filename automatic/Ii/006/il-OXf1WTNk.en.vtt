00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.990
 to achieve this point so he will you 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.410
 will need a number of miles divisible by 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:17.170
 card 4 so in fact we're going 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:20.640
 start with an edge mesh of 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.640
 mesh upside down 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:31.250
 we're going to make a jetty is knitted 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.170
 4 my whole upside down so you have to 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.079
 knit loose enough because for 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:42.739
 take 4 my after that may be very 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:47.780
 complicated is so on all of us 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:50.199
 their ranks a jetty 4 my whole to 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.199
 upside 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.360
 a jetty 4 my together upside down and 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:09.180
 we will end up daumail together at 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.180
 the back followed by a mesh guiziÃ¨res 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:22.180
 for the second row we are going to do 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:27.009
 our my visor followed by two mesh to 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:30.360
 the place and we will knit so 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:37.600
 our rejected during previous like this 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:42.850
 so a fair to the place once to 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.090
 upside down and a third time to 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.090
 the place 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.140
 then we make a stitch to 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.730
 the place 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.860
 we come again on our game you are 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:01.920
 so we knit again 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:06.660
 the place once upside down and a 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:10.350
 third time to the place we know 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:14.240
 this during all so makes each 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.240
 game you are highly rated three times 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:30.400
 the third row we have ch'ti 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:34.030
 side all a place and then so 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:39.690
 we and we repeat for one year three 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:43.750
 on toulouse work to have this weight 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.780
 very openwork very nice to achieve 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.500
 Boleros have to start thinking about 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.500
 summer works
