00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it unless you already have a Sega

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
Genesis and Sega CD combo in which case

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.240 
Genesis and Sega CD combo in which case
you<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.850> because<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:22.049> does<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.650> same<00:01:22.979> thing

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you can because this does the same thing

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.370 
you can because this does the same thing
that<00:01:23.400> those<00:01:23.610> two<00:01:23.850> things<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.390> together<00:01:24.720> but

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that those two things do together but

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.710 
that those two things do together but
this<00:01:25.619> one<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.490> guess<00:01:26.640> technically<00:01:27.150> portable

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
this one is I guess technically portable

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.469 
this one is I guess technically portable
and<00:01:27.930> does<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.680> using<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.040> whole<00:01:29.189> lot<00:01:29.400> less<00:01:29.670> space

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and does it using a whole lot less space

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.950 
and does it using a whole lot less space
also<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:32.100> generally<00:01:32.670> more<00:01:32.700> expensive<00:01:32.960> but

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
also it's generally more expensive but

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.690 
also it's generally more expensive but
it's<00:01:34.110> compacted<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.860> feels<00:01:35.189> pretty<00:01:35.369> good<00:01:35.579> it

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
it's compacted it feels pretty good it

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.429 
it's compacted it feels pretty good it
feels<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.000> lot<00:01:36.119> less<00:01:36.329> kludgy<00:01:36.960> than<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> old

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
feels a lot less kludgy than the old

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.310 
feels a lot less kludgy than the old
Sega<00:01:38.280> CD<00:01:38.970> adapter<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.229> what

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
Sega CD adapter but you know for what

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.840 
Sega CD adapter but you know for what
it's<00:01:40.350> worth<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.400> thinks<00:01:41.640> still

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it's worth I have one that thinks still

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.999 
it's worth I have one that thinks still
works<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.689> wait<00:01:42.990> there's<00:01:43.350> more<00:01:43.740> while<00:01:43.979> I

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
works but wait there's more while I

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.770 
works but wait there's more while I
don't<00:01:44.250> think<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.549> says<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.030> anywhere<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.659> is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
don't think it says this anywhere it is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.700 
don't think it says this anywhere it is
compatible<00:01:46.259> with<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.829> Sega<00:01:47.310> 32x<00:01:47.420> adapter<00:01:48.420> and
