00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:09.840
 well here we are today with a boxing 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.760
 How are we going to do 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.370
 ah 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.970
 here we have it is what I just asked 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.230
 is this the mirror is from here we see it 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.230
 fuck what good looks 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.800
 You see, it 's perfect 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.860
 and well, it's an iron that I've 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.610
 order of two for two that were place 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.350
 everyone paid us the price that is worth 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:41.370
 that the postman bring it to me this house 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.180
 and good very good 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.180
 and well, well 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.720
 Well, you can see it is perfect 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.980
 it's a wonder we have this 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.040
 for the collection is not that difficult 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.170
 of funds by edges 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.870
 that moves 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.220
 as you see 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.290
 all this the screw in the minor 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.230
 then I asked is it also in silver 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.020
 I asked in gold because because 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.430
 would lose cheaper in these insurances 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.320
 maybe it's better the silver have the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.440
 asked the two or not both 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.480
 fucking consumerism because it is not 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.420
 very good, well, since we have it 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.190
 here we will see if we can solve it 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.350
 that there were people out there who said that 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.880
 How difficult is today complicated 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.560
 is this well, I think it is not 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.770
 complicated 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.420
 both like a 2 x 2 has no greater 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.360
 mystery 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.100
 strange things are used or subjects 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.020
 strangers let's see if we can 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.320
 solve in a moment but does not have 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.020
 none 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.150
 no any history we take the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.240
 biggest piece the biggest one is this 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.620
 that his adored we have not tried 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.230
 put pieces next to us we do not have 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:00.140
 references but fuck 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.770
 here it does not come solved to see here 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.450
 is neither is it the we rotate by 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.910
 third time they can then here it does not go then 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.100
 it's here on the other side look already enters 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.480
 or is 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.850
 you see this goes with heights does not have 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.080
 much mystery these two pieces are already 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.240
 good is already 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.400
 that did not go here we want for another and 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.939
 then you will have to go to the other side 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.819
 we already have one this is not going 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:33.390
 we rotated the second round did not we 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.849
 we turn here the third time entered 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.189
 we have three that are the biggest are 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.810
 the highest or this is consists of two 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:44.550
 layers a higher debt more tight 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:47.280
 Well, but let's do this 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:52.190
 we have here here this is not going this 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.290
 another is this piece that is the highest 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.000
 ok we have the first layer once 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.610
 that we have made the first layer 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.350
 let's do the second 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.960
 you have to put what I told you all in 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.260
 the same height 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.760
 so we have a building here with 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.290
 different heights which is high 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.840
 good may not be any of them 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.270
 but I think it 's because this one 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.350
 is well placed then they all have 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.830
 to be at the same height as what 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.940
 we do first orientate 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.650
 how we orientate 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.650
 the Quran algorithm always 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.310
 many the question is what is the 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.170
 algorithm always an algorithm 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.439
 always this is already oriented here 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.439
 we can now with the d 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.170
 you see 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.390
 we have oriented studies 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.730
 the orienting algorithm of the inter 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.590
 vertices is something that works for all 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.270
 for all the cubes since we are here 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.550
 let's see it yes we have this here 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.550
 it's right down 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.830
 and others we repeat 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:11.630
 we guide this we do three times 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.500
 this makes a low 1 2 and 3 and the 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.500
 imagine, place well 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.590
 You have come here 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.590
 then for the third time 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.940
 this I do not even wonder what part more 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.700
 comment on the algorithm of always good 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.740
 Well, these are very basic. 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.870
 to entertain us in this for that they are 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.260
 the first videos that are the basics 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.030
 of all and well we do not stay for 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.180
 guide these two let's finish it 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.470
 because for the same height it is not 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.350
 very complicated 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.950
 and we will have algorithm orient 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:54.150
 Antonio part of orienting vertices 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.150
 we proceed to the rubber slowly 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.780
 Orient once 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.780
 it has worked I will give it again 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.919
 first a fade 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.000
 I've already done it twice and now 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.730
 what I do 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.240
 and up to the same height then for this 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.240
 third time 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.890
 I have become confused in one and for doing 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.870
 ready and if I'm more waste I'm here but 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.430
 good for you to see it we are going to guide 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:36.130
 now the top part to the part 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.130
 fat is worth what is the good 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.350
 because the height good form there is no 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.260
 good is because I do not get 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.820
 pass none be at home here the other 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.000
 time what does any height this 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.680
 good structure you see that this piece 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.540
 at this good height everyone has to 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.600
 be at this height let's do the 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.540
 algorithm 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.720
 to guide everything is at this height 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.720
 we'll see 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.490
 once is not right 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:19.069
 when I came back from the last step down here 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:20.779
 twice now I have it right and this 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:23.260
 I do not have it right without moving the part of 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:26.430
 down I turn this here 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.430
 and the third time 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.610
 the bottom part has turned to me 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.500
 build and here I have it right in the 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.020
 accent the times 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.520
 I already have these two well I only have left 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:44.470
 these two brave these two do not 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.470
 let's give it, let's do it 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.810
 once 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.810
 this is already oriented 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.610
 we change position 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.419
 twice and once again 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.380
 and it has already left me I have no more I could 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.450
 have come here at the end two things a 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.400
 once running to orient that they are two 

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.840
 pieces moved or two pieces moved but 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.540
 good to use that similar algorithm since 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:24.400
 it has no greater mystery 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:27.970
 well, this has been the sun bean 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:31.210
 the unboxing all at once from my mistake 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:34.240
 this and good if you do not know how it is done 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.560
 a 2 for 2 then you go to the tutorial how 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.670
 a 2 for 2 is done 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:42.100
 exactly like this one 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.100
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.120
 thanks for watching it until another
