out<00:02:24.329> our<00:02:24.480> screens<00:02:24.890> this<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.069> where<00:02:26.220> we<00:02:26.459> use<00:02:27.269> a

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
out our screens this is where we use a

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.090 
out our screens this is where we use a
pressure<00:02:27.540> washer<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.140> put<00:02:28.290> our<00:02:28.380> design<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:29.069> the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
pressure washer to put our design in the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.039 
pressure washer to put our design in the
screens<00:02:29.519> as<00:02:29.730> well<00:02:30.000> as<00:02:30.120> when<00:02:30.510> we're<00:02:30.810> done

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
screens as well as when we're done

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.530 
screens as well as when we're done
printing<00:02:31.530> we<00:02:32.430> take<00:02:32.609> all<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.880> chemicals<00:02:33.329> off

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
printing we take all the chemicals off

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.660 
printing we take all the chemicals off
of<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.870> screen<00:02:34.019> that<00:02:34.739> way<00:02:34.889> we<00:02:35.040> can<00:02:35.069> reuse<00:02:35.459> them

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
of the screen that way we can reuse them

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.690 
of the screen that way we can reuse them
as<00:02:36.540> many<00:02:36.780> times<00:02:36.840> as<00:02:37.170> we<00:02:37.230> want<00:02:37.459> all<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.519> our

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
as many times as we want all of our

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.160 
as many times as we want all of our
chemicals<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.299> we<00:02:39.389> use<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.750> shop<00:02:39.959> are

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
chemicals that we use in the shop are

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.650 
chemicals that we use in the shop are
soy<00:02:40.829> based<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.519> all<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.120> our<00:02:42.239> inks<00:02:42.540> are

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
soy based and all of our inks are

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.390 
soy based and all of our inks are
water-based<00:02:43.019> so<00:02:43.500> it's<00:02:43.680> really<00:02:43.859> nice<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.370> that

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
water-based so it's really nice is that

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.970 
water-based so it's really nice is that
all<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.970> chemicals<00:02:45.359> we<00:02:45.420> use<00:02:45.620> totally<00:02:46.620> safe<00:02:46.829> to

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
all the chemicals we use totally safe to

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.319 
all the chemicals we use totally safe to
go<00:02:47.069> down<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.370> drain<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:47.970> don't<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.209> to

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
go down the drain and we don't have to

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.520 
go down the drain and we don't have to
worry<00:02:48.480> about<00:02:48.569> wearing<00:02:48.930> respirators<00:02:49.109> or

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
worry about wearing respirators or

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.930 
worry about wearing respirators or
rubber<00:02:49.859> gloves<00:02:50.190> or<00:02:50.459> anything<00:02:50.760> like<00:02:50.790> that

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
rubber gloves or anything like that

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.590 
rubber gloves or anything like that
while<00:02:52.519> while<00:02:53.519> we're<00:02:53.670> making<00:02:53.700> our<00:02:54.090> screens<00:02:54.389> and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
while while we're making our screens and

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.500 
while while we're making our screens and
while<00:02:54.690> we're<00:02:54.840> doing<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.079> process<00:02:56.329> this<00:02:57.329> is

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
while we're doing the process this is

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.930 
while we're doing the process this is
what's<00:02:57.690> called<00:02:57.870> an<00:02:58.019> exposure<00:02:58.410> unit<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.100> this

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
what's called an exposure unit and this

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.539 
what's called an exposure unit and this
is<00:03:00.209> where<00:03:01.049> we<00:03:01.290> burn<00:03:01.530> our<00:03:01.680> designs<00:03:02.100> into<00:03:02.400> the

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
is where we burn our designs into the

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.879 
is where we burn our designs into the
screens<00:03:02.819> our<00:03:03.060> designs<00:03:03.389> start<00:03:03.840> out<00:03:04.019> as<00:03:04.829> a

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
screens our designs start out as a

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.860 
screens our designs start out as a
transparency<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:06.120> print<00:03:06.359> off<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.690> our

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
transparency that we print off of our

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.890 
transparency that we print off of our
computer<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.590> then<00:03:08.340> we<00:03:09.239> stick<00:03:09.450> those<00:03:09.630> on<00:03:09.780> to

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
computer and then we stick those on to

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.289 
computer and then we stick those on to
our<00:03:09.989> screen<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.470> expose<00:03:11.340> them<00:03:11.519> on<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.910> unit

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
our screen and expose them on this unit

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.559 
our screen and expose them on this unit
and<00:03:12.510> that's<00:03:13.019> what<00:03:13.760> puts<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.819> design<00:03:15.180> into<00:03:15.450> the

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
and that's what puts the design into the

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.129 
and that's what puts the design into the
screen<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.280> over<00:03:17.280> here<00:03:17.639> we<00:03:17.880> have<00:03:17.910> our<00:03:18.420> rack<00:03:18.840> of

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
screen and over here we have our rack of

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.210 
screen and over here we have our rack of
screens<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:20.519> are<00:03:20.579> coded<00:03:21.389> and<00:03:21.920> ready<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:23.099> have

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
screens that are coded and ready to have

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.729 
screens that are coded and ready to have
a<00:03:23.280> design<00:03:23.639> put<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.239> them<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:25.319> we<00:03:25.440> take<00:03:25.560> our

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
a design put on them so we take our

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.720 
a design put on them so we take our
transparency

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
transparency

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.949

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
stick it on to the screen and then when

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.600 
stick it on to the screen and then when
we're<00:03:32.110> done<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.860> image<00:03:33.129> will<00:03:33.310> be<00:03:33.430> in<00:03:33.519> the

Jessica and Jake are loading the shirts

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.650 
Jessica and Jake are loading the shirts
on<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.780> boards<00:03:47.670> when<00:03:48.670> we're<00:03:48.879> printing<00:03:49.299> we

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
on to the boards when we're printing we

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.750 
on to the boards when we're printing we
usually<00:03:49.989> have<00:03:50.170> one<00:03:50.470> person<00:03:50.739> who<00:03:51.129> loads<00:03:51.459> the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
usually have one person who loads the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.640 
usually have one person who loads the
shirts<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:52.330> then<00:03:52.900> another<00:03:53.080> person<00:03:53.560> who

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
shirts and then another person who

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.289 
shirts and then another person who
prints<00:03:54.099> and<00:03:54.310> takes<00:03:54.519> them<00:03:54.700> off<00:03:54.849> and<00:03:55.060> puts<00:03:55.209> them

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
prints and takes them off and puts them

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.690 
prints and takes them off and puts them
on<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.569> dryer<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:57.010> bottom<00:03:57.340> part<00:03:57.549> of<00:03:57.640> the

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
on the dryer the bottom part of the

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.119 
on the dryer the bottom part of the
press<00:03:58.299> will<00:03:58.599> spin<00:03:59.019> and<00:03:59.200> so<00:03:59.680> we'll<00:03:59.829> be<00:03:59.950> able<00:03:59.980> to

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
press will spin and so we'll be able to

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.610 
press will spin and so we'll be able to
demonstrate<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.819> in<00:04:01.030> just<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.360> sec<00:04:01.599> Jess<00:04:02.470> you

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
demonstrate that in just a sec Jess you

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.420 
demonstrate that in just a sec Jess you
could<00:04:02.769> go<00:04:02.860> ahead<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.129> spin<00:04:03.549> it<00:04:03.579> and<00:04:03.879> then

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
could go ahead and spin it and then

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.069 
could go ahead and spin it and then
we'll<00:04:06.430> spin<00:04:06.640> it<00:04:06.790> so<00:04:07.269> you<00:04:07.359> can<00:04:07.510> see<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:07.810> press

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
we'll spin it so you can see the press

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.289 
we'll spin it so you can see the press
can<00:04:08.410> spin<00:04:08.650> around<00:04:08.739> so<00:04:09.310> after<00:04:09.519> someone<00:04:09.819> loads<00:04:10.060> a

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
can spin around so after someone loads a

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.720 
can spin around so after someone loads a
shirt<00:04:10.540> they<00:04:11.290> can<00:04:11.680> spin<00:04:12.129> it<00:04:12.160> around<00:04:12.340> to<00:04:12.640> the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
shirt they can spin it around to the

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.680 
shirt they can spin it around to the
person<00:04:13.090> printing<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:16.030> screen<00:04:16.359> lowers<00:04:16.660> down
