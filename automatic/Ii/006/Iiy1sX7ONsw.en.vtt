00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

stamping<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:00.840> a<00:00:00.870> great<00:00:01.199> thing<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.650> do<00:00:01.800> for

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
stamping is a great thing to do for

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.340 
stamping is a great thing to do for
favors<00:00:02.700> because<00:00:03.060> you<00:00:03.300> can<00:00:03.449> make<00:00:03.570> multiples<00:00:04.170> of

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
favors because you can make multiples of

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.039 
favors because you can make multiples of
them<00:00:04.650> so<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.339> nice<00:00:05.580> touch<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.270> have<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.450> custom

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
them so a nice touch is to have a custom

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.110 
them so a nice touch is to have a custom
stamp<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.890> we're<00:00:07.980> gonna<00:00:08.069> create<00:00:08.370> our<00:00:08.639> own<00:00:08.670> and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
stamp and we're gonna create our own and

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.299 
stamp and we're gonna create our own and
the<00:00:09.510> way<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.660> do<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.500> first<00:00:10.800> print<00:00:11.160> your

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
the way you do that is first print your

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.890 
the way you do that is first print your
graphic<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.090> chose<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:13.049> cute<00:00:13.380> little<00:00:13.469> anchor<00:00:14.009> and

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
graphic I chose a cute little anchor and

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.220 
graphic I chose a cute little anchor and
we're<00:00:15.900> gonna<00:00:15.990> be<00:00:16.590> transferring<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
we're gonna be transferring that to a

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.750 
we're gonna be transferring that to a
block<00:00:19.230> which<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.680> what<00:00:20.039> we're<00:00:20.160> gonna<00:00:20.220> carve

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
block which is what we're gonna carve

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.120 
block which is what we're gonna carve
the<00:00:21.029> stamp<00:00:21.300> out<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> first<00:00:22.800> thing<00:00:23.039> to

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the stamp out of so the first thing to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.500 
the stamp out of so the first thing to
do<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.460> transfer<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:25.740> color<00:00:26.510> your

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
do to transfer it is to color your

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.770 
do to transfer it is to color your
design<00:00:28.609> completely<00:00:29.779> with<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> regular<00:00:31.230> pencil

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
design completely with a regular pencil

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.080 
design completely with a regular pencil
making<00:00:33.780> sure<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.320> get<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:35.280> entire<00:00:35.760> design

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
making sure you get the entire design

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.940 
making sure you get the entire design
and<00:00:39.980> then<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.160> transfer<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.620> we're<00:00:43.620> gonna<00:00:43.739> lay

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and then to transfer it we're gonna lay

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.110 
and then to transfer it we're gonna lay
it<00:00:44.070> face<00:00:44.370> down<00:00:44.430> onto<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> block<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.950> color

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
it face down onto the block and color

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.150 
it face down onto the block and color
over<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.149> pressing<00:00:49.110> hard<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.860> lead<00:00:50.129> is

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
over it pressing hard and the lead is

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.430 
over it pressing hard and the lead is
actually<00:00:50.550> going<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> transfer<00:00:51.079> to<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> other

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
actually going to transfer to the other

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.209 
actually going to transfer to the other
side

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
side

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.610 
side
once<00:00:54.000> you've<00:00:54.180> colored<00:00:54.570> over<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> entire<00:00:55.289> back

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
once you've colored over the entire back

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.420 
once you've colored over the entire back
of<00:00:55.649> your<00:00:56.190> image<00:00:57.379> its<00:00:58.379> transferred<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.309> to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
of your image its transferred but to

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.709 
of your image its transferred but to
make<00:00:59.579> sure<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.030> really<00:01:00.270> see<00:01:00.570> it

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
make sure that you can really see it

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.340 
make sure that you can really see it
we're<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:01.379> gonna<00:01:01.590> go<00:01:01.829> over<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.370> with<00:01:02.520> sharpie

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
we're just gonna go over it with sharpie

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.590 
we're just gonna go over it with sharpie
so<00:01:04.350> I'm<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.589> gonna<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.909> go

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
so I'm just gonna go in here and go

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.510 
so I'm just gonna go in here and go
right<00:01:06.900> over<00:01:06.930> my<00:01:07.380> design<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.400> it's

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
right over my design just so that it's

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.609 
right over my design just so that it's
very<00:01:08.729> clear<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.420> all<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> edges<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.290> crisp

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
very clear and all the edges are crisp

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.969 
very clear and all the edges are crisp
because<00:01:11.430> once<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.880> start<00:01:11.909> carving<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:13.710> can't

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
because once I start carving you can't

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.469 
because once I start carving you can't
go<00:01:14.159> back<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:15.979> now<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.250> nice<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.090> crisp<00:01:18.509> and

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
go back so now it's nice and crisp and

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.450 
go back so now it's nice and crisp and
now<00:01:21.479> once<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.110> design<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.439> transferred<00:01:23.070> we're

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
now once the design is transferred we're

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.429 
now once the design is transferred we're
going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> start<00:01:23.909> carving<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:25.170> we're<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.350> to

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
going to start carving so we're going to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.859 
going to start carving so we're going to
be<00:01:25.530> using<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.979> speedball<00:01:26.670> linoleum<00:01:27.299> cutter<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
be using a speedball linoleum cutter and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.539 
be using a speedball linoleum cutter and
it<00:01:28.229> comes<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.590> bunch<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.950> different<00:01:29.340> tips

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
it comes with a bunch of different tips

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.090 
it comes with a bunch of different tips
this<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.450> finest<00:01:30.960> tip<00:01:31.229> we're<00:01:31.740> gonna<00:01:31.829> do

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
this is the finest tip we're gonna do

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.460 
this is the finest tip we're gonna do
with<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.670> create<00:01:33.090> an<00:01:33.270> outline<00:01:33.869> around

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
with this is create an outline around

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.010 
with this is create an outline around
our<00:01:34.619> design<00:01:36.020> that<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.259> will<00:01:37.500> then<00:01:38.119> cut<00:01:39.119> all<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
our design that we will then cut all the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.230 
our design that we will then cut all the
rest<00:01:40.259> out<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.950> want<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.220> keep<00:01:41.490> your<00:01:41.820> black

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
rest out so you want to keep your black

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.940 
rest out so you want to keep your black
of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.659> design<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.200> we'll<00:01:46.320> go<00:01:46.439> all<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.920> way

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
of the design so we'll go all the way

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.810 
of the design so we'll go all the way
around<00:01:49.759> nice<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.060> finally

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.850 

this<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.540> just<00:01:55.750> basically<00:01:56.170> giving<00:01:56.440> you<00:01:56.680> a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
this is just basically giving you a

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.520 
this is just basically giving you a
protective<00:01:57.760> border<00:01:58.300> around<00:01:58.780> your<00:01:58.930> design<00:01:59.080> so

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
protective border around your design so

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.010 
protective border around your design so
that<00:01:59.680> when<00:01:59.830> you're<00:01:59.979> gouging<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:00.970> out<00:02:01.090> you're

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
that when you're gouging it out you're

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.469 
that when you're gouging it out you're
you're<00:02:02.590> not<00:02:02.620> going<00:02:03.220> accidentally<00:02:04.000> into<00:02:04.360> your

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
you're not going accidentally into your

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.100 
you're not going accidentally into your
design<00:02:04.810> it's<00:02:05.260> a<00:02:06.060> barrier<00:02:07.060> between<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.600> design

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
design it's a barrier between the design

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.410 
design it's a barrier between the design
and<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.860> rest<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.840> cut<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.230> out<00:02:12.090> hang<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.270> off

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
and the rest so cut that out hang it off

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.949 
and the rest so cut that out hang it off
so<00:02:14.410> then<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:14.770> switch<00:02:14.980> your<00:02:15.250> tip<00:02:15.810> once<00:02:16.810> you

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
so then you can switch your tip once you

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.720 
so then you can switch your tip once you
have<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.770> valley<00:02:18.070> cut<00:02:18.490> out<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.330> bigger<00:02:20.050> tip

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
have that valley cut out to a bigger tip

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.060 
have that valley cut out to a bigger tip
and<00:02:21.730> these<00:02:21.880> are<00:02:22.000> really<00:02:22.240> easy<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.780> change<00:02:23.650> out

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
and these are really easy to change out

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.160 
and these are really easy to change out
and<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:25.000> can<00:02:25.150> also<00:02:25.180> actually<00:02:25.780> store<00:02:26.140> your

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
and you can also actually store your

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.050 
and you can also actually store your
tips<00:02:26.590> in<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.860> back<00:02:27.040> which<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.430> convenient<00:02:27.940> so

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
tips in the back which is convenient so

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.760 
tips in the back which is convenient so
you<00:02:28.150> don't<00:02:28.300> lose<00:02:28.480> them<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:28.959> then<00:02:29.140> with<00:02:29.320> this

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
you don't lose them and then with this

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.890 
you don't lose them and then with this
bigger<00:02:30.040> tip<00:02:30.400> we're<00:02:31.090> going<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.270> then<00:02:31.390> just<00:02:31.630> take

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
bigger tip we're going to then just take

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.979 
bigger tip we're going to then just take
chunks<00:02:32.470> out<00:02:35.220> on<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.430> side<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:37.540> we're<00:02:37.750> creating

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
chunks out on the side so we're creating

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.540 
chunks out on the side so we're creating
an<00:02:38.380> embossed<00:02:38.890> graphic<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:41.680> will<00:02:41.860> turn<00:02:42.340> into

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
an embossed graphic that will turn into

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:51.110 
an embossed graphic that will turn into
the<00:02:42.940> stamp

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.559

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
so once you get all of that extra out

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.979 
so once you get all of that extra out
and<00:02:55.080> once<00:02:55.920> you've<00:02:56.250> cleaned<00:02:57.180> up<00:02:57.360> all<00:02:57.660> around

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
and once you've cleaned up all around

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.910 
and once you've cleaned up all around
