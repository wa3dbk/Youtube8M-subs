00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
all right here we have a 12 volt 30 watt

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.639 
all right here we have a 12 volt 30 watt

30<00:00:32.070> 30<00:00:32.579> volt<00:00:33.950> watt<00:00:34.950> bulb<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.480> are

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
30 30 volt watt bulb and here we are

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:52.730 
30 30 volt watt bulb and here we are
free<00:00:36.840> go

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:01:05.010 

a<00:00:54.020> bulb<00:00:56.510> of<00:00:57.510> my<00:00:57.750> phone

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.050 

alright<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:06.230> it<00:01:06.470> arcs<00:01:06.800> right<00:01:07.130> above<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.820> bulb

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
alright so it arcs right above the bulb

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.210 
alright so it arcs right above the bulb
into<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.600> bulb<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.170> goes<00:01:09.500> out<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.830> metal<00:01:10.130> on

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
into the bulb and goes out the metal on

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.040 
into the bulb and goes out the metal on
the<00:01:10.490> other<00:01:11.450> contact<00:01:13.270> I'm<00:01:14.270> curious<00:01:14.630> as<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:14.930> why

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
the other contact I'm curious as to why

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.450 
the other contact I'm curious as to why
he<00:01:15.110> doesn't<00:01:15.380> just<00:01:15.440> go<00:01:15.650> right<00:01:15.800> into<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.190> vault

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
he doesn't just go right into the vault

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.030 
he doesn't just go right into the vault
where<00:01:17.210> it's<00:01:17.330> touching<00:01:17.650> maybe<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:18.860> rubber

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
where it's touching maybe the rubber

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.130 
where it's touching maybe the rubber
Smith<00:01:19.310> are<00:01:19.430> holding<00:01:19.730> it<00:01:19.820> in<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:23.780> had<00:01:23.870> to<00:01:23.960> hold

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
Smith are holding it in you had to hold

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.770 
Smith are holding it in you had to hold
it<00:01:24.290> until<00:01:24.440> you<00:01:25.210> lose<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.270> little<00:01:26.480> spark

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
it until you lose a little spark

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.230 
it until you lose a little spark
starting<00:01:27.290> at<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:27.440> seam<00:01:27.860> between<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.640> bulb<00:01:29.060> in

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
starting at the seam between the bulb in

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:37.060 
starting at the seam between the bulb in
the<00:01:29.330> metal<00:01:29.600> on<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:31.730> top<00:01:32.740> okay<00:01:33.740> oh<00:01:35.620> that<00:01:36.620> that

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
the metal on the top okay oh that that

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.430 
the metal on the top okay oh that that
suggests<00:01:37.550> that<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:38.600> electricity<00:01:39.230> is<00:01:39.320> not

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
suggests that the electricity is not

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.230 
suggests that the electricity is not
going<00:01:39.680> inside<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.100> bulb<00:01:40.310> we<00:01:40.460> said<00:01:40.640> it's<00:01:40.790> going

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
going inside the bulb we said it's going

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.710 
going inside the bulb we said it's going
outside<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.900> bowl<00:01:43.300> and<00:01:44.300> that<00:01:44.600> little

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
outside of the bowl and that little

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.050 
outside of the bowl and that little
spark<00:01:45.080> is<00:01:45.290> work<00:01:45.500> transfer<00:01:46.430> from<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.640> bulb<00:01:46.880> to

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
spark is work transfer from the bulb to

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.100 
spark is work transfer from the bulb to
the<00:01:47.150> metal<00:01:48.130> because<00:01:49.130> otherwise<00:01:50.110> the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
the metal because otherwise the

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.900 
the metal because otherwise the
illumination<00:01:51.800> of<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.070> light<00:01:52.700> will<00:01:52.820> be

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
illumination of the light will be

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.840 
illumination of the light will be
eliminating<00:01:53.770> with<00:01:54.770> Smosh<00:01:55.070> electricity<00:01:55.730> going

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
eliminating with Smosh electricity going

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.460 
eliminating with Smosh electricity going
through<00:01:55.970> it

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.740 

oh<00:01:59.640> that's<00:02:00.640> neat<00:02:00.820> I'm<00:02:01.030> looking<00:02:01.330> anything<00:02:01.630> else

you<00:02:14.650> know<00:02:16.349> this<00:02:17.349> bulb<00:02:17.650> seems<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.099> be<00:02:18.220> very

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
you know this bulb seems to be very

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.190 
you know this bulb seems to be very
brittle<00:02:19.450> rental<00:02:21.660> breaks<00:02:22.660> apart<00:02:22.870> with<00:02:23.050> there's

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200
