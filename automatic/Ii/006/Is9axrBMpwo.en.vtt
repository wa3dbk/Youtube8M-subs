00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.940 
to control your hair throughout the day
and<00:02:48.750> like<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.019> said<00:02:49.080> it's<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.470> very<00:02:49.500> light

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
and like I said it's a very light

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.680 
and like I said it's a very light
product<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.610> it's<00:02:50.760> going<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:50.970> fall<00:02:51.180> properly

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
product so it's going to fall properly

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.660 
product so it's going to fall properly
as<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.049> saw<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.440> started<00:02:52.860> with<00:02:53.010> damp<00:02:53.220> hair

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
as you saw I started with damp hair

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.670 
as you saw I started with damp hair
I<00:02:53.700> usually<00:02:54.060> style<00:02:54.930> my<00:02:55.110> hair<00:02:55.260> with<00:02:55.410> damp<00:02:55.590> hair

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
I usually style my hair with damp hair

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.440 
I usually style my hair with damp hair
because<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:55.980> have<00:02:56.100> very<00:02:56.340> thick<00:02:56.640> hair<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.030> it's

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
because I have very thick hair and it's

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.360 
because I have very thick hair and it's
easier<00:02:57.989> for<00:02:58.019> me<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.290> work<00:02:58.530> product<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.069> when<00:02:59.280> my

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
easier for me to work product in when my

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.620 
easier for me to work product in when my
hair<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.150> damp

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
hair is damp

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.570 
hair is damp
I<00:03:00.750> also<00:03:01.110> untangled<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:01.950> with<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.100> call<00:03:02.400> before

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
I also untangled it with a call before

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.420 
I also untangled it with a call before
starting<00:03:03.269> now<00:03:03.780> now<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.560> I'm<00:03:04.650> styling<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.280> I

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
starting now now that I'm styling it I

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.699 
starting now now that I'm styling it I
will<00:03:05.790> not<00:03:05.970> be<00:03:06.150> using<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.540> comb<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.989> my<00:03:07.530> only

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
comb will be my fingers and that's the

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.180 
comb will be my fingers and that's the
point<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.750> casual<00:03:10.170> hair<00:03:10.380> style<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:11.040> want
