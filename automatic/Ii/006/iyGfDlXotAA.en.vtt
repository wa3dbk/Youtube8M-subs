 bringing the omission of facts and 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.910
 preventing something that would serve to 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.580
 solidify the good relationship

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.790

 fundamental for living together with 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.310
 people like that since everything has to be 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.170
 The way they always communicate her 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.630
 opinion of the position and the attitudes 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.810

 his personality helped him to face 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:54.189
 challenging curves and to be a pilot in 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.749
 party but they can suffer in 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.420
 some areas of life mainly 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:59.379
 when the subject is relationship 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.469
 loving 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:08.079
 Ever girlfriend your jade speeds up 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:10.510
 and already but how to recognize someone of genius 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.189
 strong a generous he may appear from 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.439
 for example in decision 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.310
 programs that are made on the day 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.709
 couple's day 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.430
 a clear example he wants to watch 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.820
 avatar 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.669
 She wants to watch is a young Maria and 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.800
 really they never never match 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.380
 reached an agreement because the 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.800
 comments from one or the other if 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.539
 stand out and do everything the other 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.030
 either in which the will of the other is 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.669
 this happens with a constancy 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.000
 with a frequency that actually the other 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.400
 ends up becoming unfeasible in the end couple 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.560
 disappearing because the will 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.900
 prevailing prevalence of the other 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.520
 according to the psychologist does not exist 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.009
 advantage to be so 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.470
 very rarely does a person have great 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.300
 genious person she can take aim 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.120
 bombs or stubbornness because she's going to 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.039
 becoming increasingly isolated and only each 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.349
 one realizes when she receives maybe 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.080
 is too late to recover the 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:11.080
 relationships lost or harmed by 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.330
 mutilation of these possibilities of 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.220
 class interaction that will be 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.979
 possible to reverse this situation and 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.750
 make the genius more flexible 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.909
 stubborn person could often 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.800
 improve if it conservation that I call 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:26.560
 of benefit of the doubt then that 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.440
 The benefit of the doubt always has what I 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.599
 I see it is the correct correct fit of the same 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.610
 not always the way I speak 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.159
 what I do or what attitude he takes 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.380
 will be the most correct at the time then 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:41.500
 if the person asks about the 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.770
 their references to others 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.080
 perhaps she could improve 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.930
 their interactions with the human being 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.770
 that she lives or the people with the 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.770
 which it relates
