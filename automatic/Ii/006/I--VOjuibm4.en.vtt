with<00:00:39.280> it<00:00:39.550> when<00:00:39.700> it<00:00:39.730> arrived<00:00:40.710> took<00:00:41.710> some<00:00:41.829> hard

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
with it when it arrived took some hard

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.610 
with it when it arrived took some hard
knocks<00:00:42.160> I<00:00:42.400> think<00:00:42.610> in<00:00:42.760> shipping<00:00:43.570> so<00:00:43.780> but<00:00:44.470> now<00:00:44.590> I

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
knocks I think in shipping so but now I

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.340 
knocks I think in shipping so but now I
have<00:00:44.770> it<00:00:44.800> working<00:00:45.040> well<00:00:45.310> and<00:00:46.140> I've<00:00:47.140> got<00:00:47.320> a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
have it working well and I've got a

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.040 
have it working well and I've got a
fresh<00:00:47.650> layer<00:00:48.280> of<00:00:48.340> tape<00:00:48.850> on<00:00:49.060> the<00:00:49.180> bed<00:00:49.360> will<00:00:49.870> come

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
fresh layer of tape on the bed will come

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.120 
fresh layer of tape on the bed will come
through<00:00:50.170> that<00:00:50.290> again<00:00:50.380> later<00:00:50.710> on<00:00:50.800> but<00:00:51.489> now

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
through that again later on but now

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.229 
through that again later on but now
before<00:00:54.130> each<00:00:54.250> print<00:00:54.550> you<00:00:54.670> have<00:00:54.790> to<00:00:54.940> do<00:00:55.060> in

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
before each print you have to do in

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.620 
before each print you have to do in
acetone<00:00:55.720> wipe<00:00:55.960> over<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.770> tape<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:58.210> acetone

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
acetone wipe over the tape the acetone

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.840 
acetone wipe over the tape the acetone
helps<00:00:58.960> it<00:00:59.110> claims<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.620> surface<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.220> also

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
helps it claims the surface and also

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.799 
helps it claims the surface and also
makes<00:01:01.059> it<00:01:01.210> stickier<00:01:01.870> so<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:03.570> 3d<00:01:04.570> print

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
makes it stickier so that the 3d print

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.990 
makes it stickier so that the 3d print
will<00:01:04.930> stay<00:01:05.140> on<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.409> bed<00:01:05.619> and<00:01:05.649> not<00:01:05.920> lift<00:01:06.250> up<00:01:06.430> or

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
will stay on the bed and not lift up or

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.960 
will stay on the bed and not lift up or
curl<00:01:07.840> during<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.710> print<00:01:09.509> so<00:01:11.760> pretty<00:01:12.760> basic

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
curl during the print so pretty basic

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.890 
curl during the print so pretty basic
lil<00:01:13.930> bit<00:01:14.049> of<00:01:14.140> acetone

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.340 

doesn't<00:01:20.900> take<00:01:20.990> too<00:01:21.170> much

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.160 

I<00:01:26.439> just<00:01:27.159> wipe<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:27.460> across

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.859 

that's<00:01:34.770> all<00:01:34.979> that's<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.580> need<00:01:37.430> at<00:01:38.430> least

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
that's all that's all you need at least

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.749 
that's all that's all you need at least
that's<00:01:39.869> all<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> think<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.409> need<00:01:40.580> only<00:01:41.580> been<00:01:41.729> a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
that's all I think you need only been a

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.940 
that's all I think you need only been a
few<00:01:41.820> days<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.330> thing<00:01:42.540> looks<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.590> far<00:01:43.770> so

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
few days with this thing looks so far so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.700 
few days with this thing looks so far so
good<00:01:44.570> basically<00:01:45.570> I'm<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.049> about<00:01:46.500> everything

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
on printing i'm giving away so far i've

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.480 
on printing i'm giving away so far i've
only<00:01:49.290> got<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> couple<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.799> pieces<00:01:49.890> around<00:01:50.159> here

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
only got a couple of pieces around here

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
just slowed it in some red filament and

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.679 
just slowed it in some red filament and
so<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.700> my<00:01:59.880> first<00:02:00.090> time<00:02:00.210> printing<00:02:00.570> with

so this is my first time printing with

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.870 
so this is my first time printing with
red<00:02:00.960> I've<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.289> so<00:02:01.439> far<00:02:01.590> used<00:02:01.890> black<00:02:02.580> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
red I've just so far used black and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.149 
red I've just so far used black and
white<00:02:03.780> which<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.439> two<00:02:04.560> colors<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.890> came

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
white which is the two colors that came

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.749 
white which is the two colors that came
with<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> MakerBot<00:02:05.789> replicator<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:07.759> this

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
with the MakerBot replicator and this

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.540 
with the MakerBot replicator and this
red<00:02:09.060> filament<00:02:09.479> spool<00:02:09.569> was<00:02:09.959> actually<00:02:10.430> given<00:02:11.430> to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
red filament spool was actually given to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.530 
red filament spool was actually given to
me<00:02:12.080> for<00:02:13.080> free<00:02:13.290> by<00:02:13.950> MakerBot<00:02:14.430> do<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.269> delays

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
me for free by MakerBot do the delays

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.660 
me for free by MakerBot do the delays
and<00:02:15.720> shipping<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.410> was<00:02:16.530> their<00:02:16.739> kind<00:02:17.610> of

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
and shipping so that was their kind of

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.520 
and shipping so that was their kind of
concession<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.330> delay<00:02:18.600> which<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.380> thought

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
concession for the delay which I thought

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.259 
concession for the delay which I thought
was<00:02:19.620> very<00:02:19.680> nice<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.220> thank<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:20.580> maker<00:02:20.790> bot

there<00:04:26.790> this<00:04:27.750> is<00:04:27.930> set<00:04:28.110> at<00:04:28.230> ten<00:04:28.470> percent<00:04:28.890> fill<00:04:29.790> so

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
there this is set at ten percent fill so

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.420 
there this is set at ten percent fill so
even<00:04:31.290> though<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.410> may<00:04:31.500> look<00:04:31.680> solid<00:04:32.130> when<00:04:32.280> it's

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
even though it may look solid when it's

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.200 
even though it may look solid when it's
done<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:33.000> lot<00:04:33.660> of<00:04:33.690> air<00:04:33.900> space<00:04:34.140> in<00:04:34.350> between

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
done a lot of air space in between

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.000 
done a lot of air space in between
inside<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.360> same<00:04:36.570> on<00:04:36.720> plastic<00:04:37.200> to<00:04:37.740> make<00:04:37.890> it

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
inside the same on plastic to make it

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.980 
inside the same on plastic to make it
lighter<00:04:38.190> also<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.150> wanted<00:04:39.420> to<00:04:39.510> point<00:04:39.660> out<00:04:39.870> if

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
lighter also I wanted to point out if

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.380 
lighter also I wanted to point out if
you<00:04:40.080> look<00:04:40.230> at<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.760> tip<00:04:41.760> of<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:41.970> heart<00:04:42.210> and

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
you look at the tip of the heart and

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.120 
you look at the tip of the heart and
closest<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.960> camera<00:04:43.110> you'll<00:04:43.890> see<00:04:44.010> it's

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
closest to the camera you'll see it's

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.340 
closest to the camera you'll see it's
lifting<00:04:44.610> up<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:46.010> that<00:04:47.010> happens<00:04:48.140> to<00:04:49.140> try<00:04:49.290> to

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
lifting up and that happens to try to

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.550 
lifting up and that happens to try to
fix<00:04:49.620> that<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:50.580> may<00:04:51.180> try<00:04:51.420> wiping<00:04:51.660> it<00:04:51.960> again

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
fix that I may try wiping it again

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.190 
fix that I may try wiping it again
without<00:04:52.710> with<00:04:53.130> acetone<00:04:53.760> may<00:04:54.630> be<00:04:54.690> replacing

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
without with acetone may be replacing

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.390 
without with acetone may be replacing
the<00:04:55.290> tape<00:04:56.270> or<00:04:57.270> printing<00:04:58.020> with<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.140> raft<00:04:58.410> which

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
the tape or printing with a raft which

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.770 
the tape or printing with a raft which
is<00:04:59.550> like<00:04:59.700> a<00:04:59.730> base<00:05:00.030> layer<00:05:00.300> of<00:05:00.480> plastic<00:05:01.130> in<00:05:02.780> this

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
is like a base layer of plastic in this

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.659 
is like a base layer of plastic in this
case<00:05:03.990> it's<00:05:04.260> not<00:05:04.440> a<00:05:04.470> structural<00:05:05.130> part<00:05:05.400> I<00:05:05.520> don't

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
case it's not a structural part I don't

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:06.920 
case it's not a structural part I don't
think<00:05:05.850> it'll<00:05:05.970> matter<00:05:06.090> too<00:05:06.330> much<00:05:06.360> as<00:05:06.690> long<00:05:06.810> as

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
think it'll matter too much as long as

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.080 
think it'll matter too much as long as
it<00:05:07.020> holds<00:05:07.140> together<00:05:07.380> and<00:05:08.100> it<00:05:08.460> doesn't<00:05:08.730> pop<00:05:08.850> off

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
it holds together and it doesn't pop off

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.270 
it holds together and it doesn't pop off
the<00:05:09.120> bed<00:05:10.110> all<00:05:10.260> together<00:05:10.410> before<00:05:10.950> it<00:05:11.010> finishes

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
the bed all together before it finishes

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:49.550 
the bed all together before it finishes
so<00:05:11.640> we'll<00:05:12.570> see

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.709 

wow<00:05:50.560> that<00:05:50.830> print<00:05:51.069> took<00:05:51.219> a<00:05:51.340> long<00:05:51.580> time<00:05:51.610> I<00:05:52.150> should

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:52.719 
wow that print took a long time I should

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.809 
wow that print took a long time I should
have<00:05:52.810> time<00:05:53.050> that<00:05:53.289> I<00:05:53.740> think<00:05:54.430> it<00:05:54.520> was<00:05:54.580> at<00:05:54.699> least

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:54.819 
have time that I think it was at least

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:59.399 
have time that I think it was at least
45<00:05:55.360> minutes<00:05:56.610> anyway<00:05:57.610> it<00:05:57.909> finished<00:05:58.449> and<00:05:58.689> it

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
45 minutes anyway it finished and it

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.619 
45 minutes anyway it finished and it
never<00:05:59.560> did<00:05:59.770> pop<00:05:59.979> off<00:06:00.189> the<00:06:00.460> platform<00:06:00.969> so<00:06:01.449> that's

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:01.629 
never did pop off the platform so that's

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.019 
never did pop off the platform so that's
good<00:06:01.900> and<00:06:02.080> it<00:06:02.919> just<00:06:02.949> finished<00:06:03.340> now<00:06:03.610> it's<00:06:03.849> still

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:04.029 
good and it just finished now it's still

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.519 
good and it just finished now it's still
warm<00:06:04.300> let<00:06:04.629> me<00:06:04.689> see<00:06:04.840> if<00:06:04.930> I<00:06:04.960> can<00:06:05.110> get<00:06:05.229> it<00:06:05.289> just

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:05.529 
warm let me see if I can get it just

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:13.810 
warm let me see if I can get it just
with<00:06:05.680> my<00:06:05.830> hands<00:06:06.210> there<00:06:07.210> we<00:06:07.330> go

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.030 

to<00:06:14.030> lead<00:06:14.210> that<00:06:14.620> that

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.910 

look<00:06:19.790> you<00:06:20.150> know<00:06:20.270> I<00:06:20.300> had<00:06:20.570> black<00:06:21.170> filament<00:06:21.830> in

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:21.920 
look you know I had black filament in

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.100 
look you know I had black filament in
before<00:06:22.250> the<00:06:22.340> red<00:06:22.520> I<00:06:22.550> think<00:06:22.910> even<00:06:23.900> though<00:06:24.080> I

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
before the red I think even though I

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.390 
before the red I think even though I
flushed<00:06:24.410> it<00:06:24.560> out<00:06:24.710> it<00:06:24.950> looks<00:06:25.070> like<00:06:25.250> they're

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
flushed it out it looks like they're

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
flushed it out it looks like they're
still<00:06:25.670> with<00:06:25.850> some<00:06:26.000> black<00:06:26.380> coming<00:06:27.380> out<00:06:28.210> he<00:06:29.210> sits

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:29.420 
still with some black coming out he sits

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.870 
still with some black coming out he sits
on<00:06:29.510> the<00:06:29.630> bottom<00:06:29.900> and<00:06:30.260> I<00:06:30.920> did<00:06:31.220> warp<00:06:31.550> a<00:06:31.640> little

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
on the bottom and I did warp a little

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.530 
on the bottom and I did warp a little
bit<00:06:32.000> you<00:06:32.150> can<00:06:32.240> see<00:06:32.480> the<00:06:32.890> upturn<00:06:33.890> of<00:06:34.160> the<00:06:34.540> bottom

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
bit you can see the upturn of the bottom

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.930 
bit you can see the upturn of the bottom
of<00:06:35.630> the<00:06:35.720> heart<00:06:36.400> but<00:06:37.400> it<00:06:37.460> doesn't<00:06:37.640> seem<00:06:37.880> to

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
of the heart but it doesn't seem to

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:45.719 
of the heart but it doesn't seem to
matter

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:45.729 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:47.789 

you
