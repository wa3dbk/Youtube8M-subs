00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
came out on may 5th 2015 and then four

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.039 
came out on may 5th 2015 and then four
weeks<00:01:49.500> later<00:01:49.829> Tania<00:01:50.579> came<00:01:50.790> out<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.149> June<00:01:51.450> 2nd

weeks later Tania came out on June 2nd

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.620 
weeks later Tania came out on June 2nd
2015<00:01:52.829> now<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.759> guys<00:01:54.090> are<00:01:54.149> probably<00:01:54.329> saying

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
2015 now you guys are probably saying

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.120 
2015 now you guys are probably saying
why<00:01:54.780> are<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.899> saying<00:01:55.079> she<00:01:55.200> does<00:01:55.350> 15<00:01:55.740> well<00:01:55.950> you

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
why are you saying she does 15 well you

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.410 
why are you saying she does 15 well you
know<00:01:56.250> what<00:01:56.340> because<00:01:56.579> that's<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> year<00:01:57.030> okay

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
know what because that's the year okay

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.380 
know what because that's the year okay
so<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.710> probably<00:01:58.890> tell<00:01:59.130> four<00:02:00.090> weeks

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
so as you can probably tell four weeks

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.450 
so as you can probably tell four weeks
from<00:02:00.689> each<00:02:00.960> character's<00:02:01.590> release<00:02:02.040> there's

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
from each character's release there's

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.100 
from each character's release there's
going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.790> another<00:02:03.210> character<00:02:03.750> released

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
going to be another character released

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.289 
going to be another character released
for<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.500> game<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.159> if<00:02:05.460> there<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> be

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
for the game so if there is going to be

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.690 
for the game so if there is going to be
a<00:02:06.329> four<00:02:06.810> week<00:02:07.049> span<00:02:07.350> between<00:02:07.920> characters<00:02:08.459> and

a four week span between characters and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.190 
a four week span between characters and
stuff<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.780> would<00:02:09.959> mean<00:02:10.140> that

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
stuff like that that would mean that

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.170 
stuff like that that would mean that
predator<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.950> going<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.160> be<00:02:11.250> coming<00:02:11.489> out

is still trying to develop the patches
for<00:03:10.409> those<00:03:10.650> characters<00:03:11.099> so<00:03:11.129> they<00:03:11.400> can<00:03:11.639> be

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
for those characters so they can be

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.209 
for those characters so they can be
balanced<00:03:12.659> in<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.930> game<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.769> there's<00:03:14.010> always

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:14.219 
balanced in the game so there's always

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.670 
balanced in the game so there's always
that<00:03:14.549> fears<00:03:14.909> that<00:03:15.510> might<00:03:15.959> push<00:03:16.319> it<00:03:16.500> back

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
that fears that might push it back

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.559 
that fears that might push it back
another<00:03:17.099> month<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:17.549> it<00:03:17.819> could<00:03:18.060> come<00:03:18.299> out<00:03:18.329> in

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
another month so it could come out in

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.719 
another month so it could come out in
September<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.379> stuff<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:20.159> to<00:03:20.310> make<00:03:20.489> sure<00:03:20.699> a

so<00:03:27.629> maybe<00:03:27.959> September<00:03:28.349> is<00:03:28.889> going<00:03:29.069> to<00:03:29.220> be<00:03:29.400> a

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
so maybe September is going to be a

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.360 
so maybe September is going to be a
possible<00:03:30.569> month<00:03:31.199> release<00:03:31.620> date<00:03:31.859> or<00:03:31.889> somewhere

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
possible month release date or somewhere

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.520 
possible month release date or somewhere
around<00:03:32.430> September<00:03:32.879> is<00:03:33.389> a<00:03:33.419> possible<00:03:34.290> release

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
around September is a possible release

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.050 
around September is a possible release
date<00:03:34.739> for<00:03:34.889> the<00:03:34.949> last<00:03:35.159> gen<00:03:35.370> consoles<00:03:35.819> but

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
date for the last gen consoles but

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.670 
date for the last gen consoles but
that's<00:03:36.269> just<00:03:36.449> my<00:03:36.689> opinion<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.260> that's<00:03:37.379> just

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
that's just my opinion and that's just

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.580 
that's just my opinion and that's just
my<00:03:37.859> theory<00:03:38.189> since<00:03:38.819> I<00:03:38.970> did<00:03:39.209> say<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:40.019> my<00:03:40.560> I

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
my theory since I did say that my I

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.349 
my theory since I did say that my I
think<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.220> benefit<00:03:41.639> of<00:03:41.790> waiting<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.299> long

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
think the benefit of waiting that long

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.869 
think the benefit of waiting that long
is<00:03:42.959> going<00:03:43.199> to<00:03:43.259> be<00:03:43.409> getting<00:03:44.159> the<00:03:44.280> combat<00:03:44.669> pack

from what we get here in America or ever
you're<00:05:01.980> from<00:05:02.280> I<00:05:02.520> would<00:05:02.970> say<00:05:03.180> expect<00:05:04.050> the

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
you're from I would say expect the
