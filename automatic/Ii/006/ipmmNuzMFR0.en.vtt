00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.060 
from the southern hemisphere Australia
the<00:00:45.210> down<00:00:46.210> here<00:00:46.480> we<00:00:46.600> get<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.020> black<00:00:47.680> seat

the down here we get the the black seat

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.060 
the down here we get the the black seat
and<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.739> black<00:00:51.070> grip<00:00:51.699> tape<00:00:52.000> on<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
and the black grip tape on the

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.799 
and the black grip tape on the
Cannondale<00:00:54.489> website<00:00:55.030> that<00:00:55.149> I<00:00:55.239> was<00:00:55.329> looking<00:00:55.629> at

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
Cannondale website that I was looking at

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.160 
Cannondale website that I was looking at
they<00:00:56.410> had<00:00:56.649> a<00:00:56.859> white<00:00:57.100> seat<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.730> and<00:00:58.480> white<00:00:58.809> prep

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
they had a white seat and and white prep

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.060 
they had a white seat and and white prep
tape<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.609> I<00:01:00.670> think<00:01:00.910> that<00:01:01.059> might<00:01:01.300> be<00:01:01.329> that<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
tape so I think that might be that the

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.850 
tape so I think that might be that the
northern<00:01:03.399> hemisphere<00:01:03.550> a<00:01:03.910> northern<00:01:04.269> American

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
they feel a bit digital in terms of

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.160 
they feel a bit digital in terms of

feel<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.799> braking<00:03:36.220> so<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.329> might<00:03:37.480> see<00:03:37.720> how

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
feel to the braking so it might see how

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.920 
feel to the braking so it might see how
it<00:03:38.019> go<00:03:39.000> just<00:03:40.000> interested<00:03:40.389> to<00:03:40.420> give<00:03:40.630> them<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.780> bit

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
it go just interested to give them a bit

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.490

is really good and and the reach to the

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.910 
is really good and and the reach to the
believers<00:05:05.210> seems<00:05:05.450> pretty<00:05:05.720> good<00:05:08.920> reminders

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920

which is really really minor is is the
the<00:05:24.680> bend<00:05:25.010> here<00:05:26.590> so<00:05:27.590> I'm<00:05:27.760> what<00:05:28.760> I'm<00:05:28.850> right<00:05:29.150> you

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
the bend here so I'm what I'm right you

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.280 
the bend here so I'm what I'm right you
know<00:05:29.510> that<00:05:29.540> to<00:05:29.900> get<00:05:30.050> the<00:05:30.200> this<00:05:30.590> other<00:05:32.290> it's

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
know that to get the this other it's

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.620 
know that to get the this other it's
it's<00:05:33.680> just<00:05:34.010> an<00:05:34.160> awkward<00:05:34.430> kind<00:05:34.940> of<00:05:35.090> position<00:05:35.600> to

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
it's just an awkward kind of position to

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.610 
it's just an awkward kind of position to
try<00:05:35.990> and<00:05:36.200> get<00:05:36.380> around<00:05:36.890> there<00:05:37.340> to<00:05:38.150> get<00:05:38.620> where

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
try and get around there to get where

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.680 
try and get around there to get where
the<00:05:39.860> hand<00:05:40.460> feels<00:05:40.790> comfortable<00:05:42.700> so<00:05:43.700> think<00:05:44.150> you

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
the hand feels comfortable so think you

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.360 
the hand feels comfortable so think you
know<00:05:44.810> from<00:05:44.960> looking<00:05:45.230> at<00:05:45.530> it<00:05:45.590> that<00:05:45.920> would<00:05:46.070> look

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
know from looking at it that would look

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.810 
know from looking at it that would look
that<00:05:46.610> sort<00:05:47.090> of<00:05:47.120> here<00:05:47.570> there's<00:05:48.080> probably<00:05:48.820> we

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
that sort of here there's probably we

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.360 
that sort of here there's probably we
hold<00:05:50.240> with<00:05:50.450> the<00:05:50.540> bar<00:05:50.750> and<00:05:51.260> obviously<00:05:51.680> to<00:05:52.130> reach

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370
