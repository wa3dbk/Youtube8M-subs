00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.820
 introduction and 360 degree view 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.689
 with the k 3 pentax sends a new one 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.849
 SLR camera in the race around the 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.480
 aps c crown in comparison to 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.770
 predecessor model k 52 or 52 it has 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.820
 pentax doing some changes 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.430
 performed 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.430
 the image sensor in aps c size now triggers 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.469
 24 1 megapixel on as with the pentax k 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.090
 5 2 it comes with the k 3 no 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.250
 low pass filter more for use 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.780
 this should be needed once 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.579
 The SLR camera offers one 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.039
 low pass filter simulation over the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.800
 movably mounted sensor to the iso 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.540
 was between iso 100 and iso 51.200 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.400
 in thirds 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.260
 thanks to plan three image processor 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.820
 concretizing speed up 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.630
 also increased two pictures per second 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.040
 become 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.489
 the closure allows at least 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.559
 200,000 releases the autofocus module 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.899
 the k 3 works with 27 focus 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.390
 measuring fields 25 of these are cross-sensors 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.060
 The exposure measurement takes over one 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.979
 86,000 pixel rgb light measuring sensor as 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.689
 shortest exposure time can be one 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.750
 set eight thousandths of a second 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.159
 the 3.2 inch lcd pentax k 3 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.079
 represents 104 million 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.209
 pixel represents the optical penta prism 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.340
 Sucher gives 100 of the picture field 

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:25.649
 a 0 95 times magnification again 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.420
 Video recordings are done in full HD 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.020
 resolution with 30 frames per second 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.729
 and h 264 encoding the sound is using the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.229
 integrated mono microphone or one 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.149
 external microphone stored and leaves 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.799
 to level like most 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.380
 mirror reflex models of pentax is 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.729
 of course the k3 weatherproof 92 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.369
 Seals protect the camera body 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.959
 against dust and splashing water as a photo 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.329
 program has the SLR camera 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.920
 including a fully automatic psm 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.529
 modes and three pattern programs 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.090
 the battery with memory card and the 

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:59.279
 pentax smc dhl 18 55mm lens 1015 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.009
 gram heavy pentax k 3 can take pictures and 

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:04.039
 videos on two sdhc or sdxc sd 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.659
 store memory cards 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.950
 place next to this introductory video 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.270
 we give you the camera another 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.700
 videos in detail before 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.980
 wherein they learn to for further details 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.340
 to equip the image stabilizer and 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.340
 the picture quality
