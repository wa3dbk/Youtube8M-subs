00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:13.289
 glaucoma is a disease that damages the optic nerve the part of the eye that 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.749
 transmits images to the brain 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.899
 there are several kinds of glaucoma and many ways to treat it 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:23.459
 Early detection and treatment can help preserve vision 

00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:26.569
 so they can see what life offers 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:27.820
 in a healthy eye 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.560
 one has to be informed mora exposed 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.140
 circulates a frontal position of lopo 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.430
 to maintain an eye pressure stanley 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.490
 and constant the eye continuously produces a small amount of aqueous humor and 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.110
 that amount of fluid leaves the eye through a microscopic channel in the angle 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.110
 drainage called 3 trabecular 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.310
 If you suffer from graus coma the aqueous humor does not exclude by the drainage angle of 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.680
 proper way 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.380
 the pressure of the fluid in the eye increases and this additional pressure forces 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.460
 in the optic nerve in the back of the eye leaving the fibers 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.860
 nervous 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.990
 remember usually glaucoma has no symptoms at the beginning 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.460
 usually the right treatment can stop or delay a loss 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.439
 additional of the hobby an evaluation to detect in the ointment is very 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.920
 important for people over 60 years of age the relatives of people who 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.200
 glaucoma sufferers are people of African descent and people with 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 high eye pressure 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.360
 although there is no cure for glaucoma and optic nerve damage is not 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.250
 reversible 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.260
 We can prevent hearing loss by being an ethyl coma explained 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.660
 the treaty especially in its initial stage 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.230
 some people with high eye pressure still without clear coma can 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.410
 benefit from a treatment of boots for eyes 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.480
 This is why it is important to visit your ophthalmologist regularly if you run 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.850
 risk of developing glaucoma 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.510
 the loss of one's vision or how it can usually be prevented if 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.610
 Detects and treats early 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.130
 There are several ways to treat glaucoma 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.819
 Although some people notice the side effects of medicines or 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.460
 surgery these risks should be compared with a higher risk the 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.590
 loss of vision due to lack of treatment
