00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
you know to open the case and you'll

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.080

notice<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.409> have<00:01:31.680> something<00:01:32.430> which<00:01:32.790> you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
notice here you have something which you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.030 
notice here you have something which you
know<00:01:33.240> get<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> couple<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.200> screws<00:01:34.470> there<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
know get a couple of screws there and

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.069 
know get a couple of screws there and
something<00:01:35.850> which<00:01:36.210> looks<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.840> could<00:01:37.049> be

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
something which looks like it could be

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.950 
something which looks like it could be
hinged<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.070> that's<00:01:38.490> exactly<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
hinged and that's exactly what it is so

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.990 
hinged and that's exactly what it is so
if<00:01:40.170> you're<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> open<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.729> you<00:01:41.729> just

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
if you're going to open this you just

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.810 
if you're going to open this you just
simply<00:01:42.630> flip<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.549> actually

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
simply flip this and this is actually

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.730 
simply flip this and this is actually
quite<00:01:45.360> an<00:01:45.540> interesting<00:01:45.750> mechanism<00:01:46.229> you

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
quite an interesting mechanism you

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.429 
quite an interesting mechanism you
actually<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:48.290> two-part<00:01:49.610> hinge<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:51.750> it

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
actually have a two-part hinge so it

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.679 
actually have a two-part hinge so it
doesn't<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:52.890> fold<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.420> it

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
doesn't just fold up like this it

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.520 
doesn't just fold up like this it
actually<00:01:54.899> folds<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:56.240> that<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.960> little

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
actually folds up like that so a little

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.139 
actually folds up like that so a little
bit<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.070> show<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.280> how<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.610> works<00:01:59.670> but

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
bit for to show you how this works but

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.569 
bit for to show you how this works but
you<00:02:00.270> basically<00:02:00.600> yeah<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
you basically yeah you have like a

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.190 
you basically yeah you have like a
double<00:02:02.579> joint<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.030> get<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:03.689> attached

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
double joint you get to in just attached

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.410 
double joint you get to in just attached
to<00:02:04.469> each<00:02:04.590> other<00:02:04.799> which<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.130> how<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:05.939> can<00:02:06.270> get

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
to each other which is how you can get

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.010 
to each other which is how you can get
this<00:02:06.950> very<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.280> know<00:02:08.420> foldable<00:02:09.420> effects<00:02:09.869> you

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
this very you know foldable effects you

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.230 
this very you know foldable effects you
see<00:02:10.050> folds<00:02:10.649> once<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.819> second<00:02:12.209> piece<00:02:12.480> for

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
see folds once then the second piece for

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.870 
see folds once then the second piece for
as<00:02:13.330> well<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:13.870> yeah<00:02:14.590> really<00:02:15.430> interesting

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
as well so yeah really interesting

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.150 
as well so yeah really interesting
choice<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.510> works<00:02:16.870> very<00:02:17.020> well<00:02:17.350> for<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:17.950> one

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
choice and works very well for this one

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.550 
choice and works very well for this one
overall<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.150> think<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:20.170> know<00:02:20.260> it's<00:02:20.440> a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
overall I think that you know it's a

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.160 
overall I think that you know it's a
very<00:02:20.830> great<00:02:21.130> sign<00:02:21.520> it's<00:02:21.880> just<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.690> was

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
very great sign it's just it was

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.290 
very great sign it's just it was
incredibly<00:02:23.650> cool<00:02:23.920> when<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.310> came<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:24.820> I<00:02:24.910> think

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
incredibly cool when it came and I think

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.850 
incredibly cool when it came and I think
it<00:02:25.390> still<00:02:25.660> holds<00:02:25.870> up<00:02:26.170> as<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.410> lot<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.710> more

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
it still holds up as a lot of the more

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.250 
it still holds up as a lot of the more
interesting<00:02:27.250> packaging<00:02:27.910> besides<00:02:28.270> done<00:02:28.690> for

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
interesting packaging besides done for

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.290 
interesting packaging besides done for
this<00:02:29.380> movie<00:02:29.830> definitely<00:02:30.280> it's<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.820> most

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
this movie definitely it's the most

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.900 
this movie definitely it's the most
interesting<00:02:31.750> packaging<00:02:32.230> that's<00:02:32.910> impacting

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
interesting packaging that's impacting

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.200 
interesting packaging that's impacting
overall<00:02:34.270> you<00:02:34.570> know<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:35.160> rarely<00:02:36.160> see<00:02:36.670> something

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210

know here you got this whole interior so

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.860 
know here you got this whole interior so

you know it's been dubbed as the cold

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.020 
you know it's been dubbed as the cold
edition<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.710> that's<00:02:54.190> very<00:02:54.370> much<00:02:54.490> what<00:02:54.670> it

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
edition and that's very much what it

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.640 
edition and that's very much what it
looks<00:02:55.240> like<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.600> looks<00:02:55.630> like<00:02:56.050> you<00:02:56.500> know

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
something that was launched from

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.020 
something that was launched from
spaceship<00:02:59.350> you<00:03:00.250> know<00:03:00.370> that's<00:03:00.550> basically<00:03:00.910> the

spaceship you know that's basically the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.640 
spaceship you know that's basically the
idea<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.630> think<00:03:01.660> they<00:03:01.990> really<00:03:02.230> pulled<00:03:02.500> that

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
idea and I think they really pulled that

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.620 
idea and I think they really pulled that
off<00:03:02.710> you<00:03:03.160> know<00:03:03.280> sort<00:03:03.580> of<00:03:03.670> conveying<00:03:04.540> that

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
feeling and you guys like these you know

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.690 
feeling and you guys like these you know
partial<00:03:07.900> skeletons<00:03:08.590> sort<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:09.010> melted<00:03:09.520> into

it's just an amazing case design and

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.920 
it's just an amazing case design and
yeah<00:03:24.190> really<00:03:24.580> holds<00:03:24.940> up<00:03:25.060> well<00:03:25.300> but<00:03:25.660> anyway

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
yeah really holds up well but anyway

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.400 
yeah really holds up well but anyway
then<00:03:26.710> we<00:03:26.800> get<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.160> interior<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:28.260> here<00:03:29.260> we

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
then we get the interior and here we

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.130 
then we get the interior and here we
have<00:03:30.040> something<00:03:30.940> that<00:03:31.090> just<00:03:31.300> slides<00:03:31.510> out<00:03:31.810> very

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
have something that just slides out very

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.030 
have something that just slides out very
easily<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.760> what<00:03:33.760> we<00:03:33.880> get<00:03:34.030> inside<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:35.040> first

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
easily and what we get inside is first

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.660 
easily and what we get inside is first
of<00:03:36.190> all<00:03:36.310> we<00:03:36.490> got<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.640> plastic<00:03:37.270> slipcase<00:03:38.670> just

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
of all we got a plastic slipcase just

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.000 
of all we got a plastic slipcase just
comes<00:03:39.910> up<00:03:40.060> like<00:03:40.270> that<00:03:40.470> can<00:03:41.470> tell<00:03:41.680> it's<00:03:41.890> not

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
comes up like that can tell it's not

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.280 
comes up like that can tell it's not
completely<00:03:42.760> see-through<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.900> has<00:03:44.050> a<00:03:44.080> bit<00:03:44.260> of

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
completely see-through it has a bit of

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.620 
completely see-through it has a bit of
structure<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.100> so<00:03:45.760> not<00:03:45.910> entirely<00:03:46.300> clear

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
structure to it so not entirely clear

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.770 
structure to it so not entirely clear
but<00:03:47.050> yeah<00:03:47.920> works<00:03:48.280> really<00:03:48.550> well<00:03:48.670> and<00:03:49.480> then<00:03:49.660> we

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
but yeah works really well and then we

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.650 
but yeah works really well and then we
have<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.200> which<00:03:50.890> is<00:03:51.040> just<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:52.240> design<00:03:52.630> of
