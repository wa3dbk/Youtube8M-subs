00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.580
 sonia and I like a lot I'm going to 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.070
 teach how to make this beautiful portal 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.500
 candles that is very easy to do very 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.230
 economic and is ideal for decorating the 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.210
 house or to give as a gift if you want to know 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.940
 how do you stay that right now you 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.940
 I explain step by step how to do it 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.770
 The materials that we are going to use are 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.050
 candles of various sizes a figure 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.690
 small a base where we are going to put the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.380
 ribbon candles to decorate the base a 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.050
 brush plaster or plaster water to mix 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.720
 with the plaster some small pebbles 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.660
 acrylic or latex paints for 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.600
 paint the white tail base a little bit 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.750
 liquid silicone petrolatum and tape 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.750
 adhesive 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.250
 very well let's start the idea of ​​this 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.040
 craftsmanship that I am going to show you today is 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.439
 that they see that with different types of 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.610
 materials that we can get not 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.590
 necessarily in stores of 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.140
 crafts we can do very jobs 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.090
 interesting and very original and about 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.869
 everything very cheap that is what we 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.360
 interesting in this case I will use 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.340
 this dish as a base for the candles that 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.500
 is what you put under the pots 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.170
 so that the water falls and they sell it for 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.729
 course where they sell plants are very 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.460
 economic this is clay or mud and 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.080
 I thought it was ideal for 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.270
 This paper will give as a touch 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.369
 rustic of course we can leave it 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.110
 of this color or paint it the color that 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.140
 we want in this case what I 'm going to do 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.709
 is to give a layer inside and outside 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.569
 with white acrylic paint or 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.369
 latex paint one of the candles that 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.459
 I'm going to use is this big size 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.860
 and white and so you do not see 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.439
 so simple I have chosen to decorate it 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.420
 This decorated paper napkin and 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.470
 a very simple way we can give it 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.229
 color to the candles 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.480
 and make them very original prints if 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.730
 you want to know how to decorate candles in this 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.650
 you just have to look down on the 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.960
 part of the description of this video the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.940
 link to the tutorial to paint the base 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.820
 I will use acrylic paints or 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.830
 latex color red yellow and white here 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.020
 I have put them, I have not mixed them 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.750
 complete and with this mixture I will go 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.090
 painting my base and before it dries 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.640
 the painting we are going to look for a bag of 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.340
 we are going to wrinkle it and we are going to 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.380
 Give this effect and once it has dried 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.950
 very well all the paint we can give 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.480
 some glitter with acrylic varnish 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.220
 bright so that the candles do not 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.680
 they mess with the plaster what we're going to 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.770
 do is stick around tape 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.170
 adhesive and a longer piece that crosses 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.380
 that we just put the stick by 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.180
 the sides and we leave these projections for 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.250
 make it easier for us to get it out of the 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.740
 plaster and finally we apply a bit of 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.480
 Vaseline on the entire base of the candle already 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.820
 the big candle will also protect you 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.860
 the bottom part with adhesive tape and 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.460
 we also apply Vaseline and once 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.440
 that has dried very well 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.260
 and we can continue decorating it in this 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.580
 case I'm going to hit you on the edge this 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.250
 so beautiful tape that has some 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.230
 I will make little flowers with silicone 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.360
 cold we can also do it with the 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.820
 silicone gun once we have 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.620
 fully decorated the base we have 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.780
 put the adhesive tape with Vaseline 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.670
 to the candles and have the rest 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.220
 implements that we are going to put we can already 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.640
 make the mixture of plaster or plaster 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.520
 I could not tell you in what proportions 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.530
 will go water and white tail because 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.750
 I'm going to keep an eye on it so what 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.850
 we have to do is go watering go 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.310
 mixing if it stays like that a bit 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.500
 lumps or we keep pouring water we put 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.060
 just a little white tail and we continue 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.770
 mixing when we have a 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.320
 consistency like this we're going to 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.660
 add here to the base we scatter and 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.270
 we are going to gradually put the 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.100
 small candles we also put the candle 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.660
 big and here I have some pebbles 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.550
 small ones that are the ones that are used 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.650
 to put in the aquariums and I'm going to 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.300
 take advantage here to decorate the go 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.220
 joining a little with your finger so that 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.830
 stay fixed if we are going to put 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.000
 a figurine we are going to take advantage of that the 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.850
 plaster is not yet 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.520
 hard and we're going to sink like that to make the 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.620
 instead we take it out and clean it like the 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.980
 dry plaster so fast we will notice that to the 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.920
 half an hour this is already hard enough not 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.560
 It is totally hard but it allows us 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.420
 start to take out the candles so for 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.870
 example in the case of the small ones we go 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.060
 pulling so carefully and we're going to go 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.700
 taking out and in the case of the big candle 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.560
 it's easier, we're going to turn it around 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.930
 little and also leaves very easily 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.669
 as the idea of ​​this candle holder is to go 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.610
 changing the candles every time 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.260
 We are going to look for something sharp in 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.060
 this case I will use a knife as 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.570
 have your hand and we will go scraping 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.340
 already widening these circles from here 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.990
 we can also use a spoon 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.030
 small to remove all 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.860
 imperfections and once we check 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.110
 that the candles come in and out with 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.240
 ease we let it dry for a day 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.610
 for another once it has dried very 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.400
 well the plaster we are going to look for a brush 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.740
 of hard bristle we will pass it like this for 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.720
 Remove as much plaster dust as you can 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.850
 have stayed and again with paintings 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.569
 acrylic paint the inside of the 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.550
 circles 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.789
 give more color and once you have 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.580
 We can paint the paint 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:35.709
 applying glossy acrylic varnish and 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.809
 already to finish we paste the figure with 

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:39.809
 any very strong glue 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.090
 and here you can see that with very few 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.560
 materials and very easily and 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.810
 We have been able to make a 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.540
 beautiful arrangement that I bought in the 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.760
 street would go very expensive here can 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.480
 see that every time the candles wear out 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.270
 we can change them 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.830
 in a very simple way and always going to 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.900
 look great where we want to put 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.450
 you can also learn to do these 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.520
