the Nexus 5 workers are the 5 inch full

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.950 
the Nexus 5 workers are the 5 inch full
HD<00:00:48.570> display<00:00:49.289> whereas<00:00:50.280> Nexus<00:00:50.640> 4<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.969> 4.7<00:00:51.750> inch

of<00:00:52.860> full<00:00:53.219> HD<00:00:53.420> display<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:55.230> one<00:00:55.410> has<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> 1080p

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
of full HD display this one has a 1080p

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.740 
of full HD display this one has a 1080p
pixels<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.480> that's<00:00:57.629> 1080<00:00:58.410> x<00:00:58.980> 1920<00:00:59.750> whereas

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
pixels so that's 1080 x 1920 whereas

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.810 
pixels so that's 1080 x 1920 whereas
this<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:00.989> works<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:01.920> 1280<00:01:02.699> x<00:01:03.710> 768<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.519> there

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
this one works with 1280 x 768 so there

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.640 
this one works with 1280 x 768 so there
you<00:01:06.150> know<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.510> practice<00:01:07.049> they're<00:01:07.260> extremely

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
you know in practice they're extremely

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.500 
you know in practice they're extremely
similar<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.430> really<00:01:08.790> really<00:01:08.820> way<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.270> close

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
similar but really really way up close

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.850 
similar but really really way up close
you<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.869> tell<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.170> there's<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.680> slight

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
you can tell that there's just a slight

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
you can tell that there's just a slight
bit<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.189> difference<00:01:11.400> there<00:01:13.100> when<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.430> are

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
bit of difference there when you are

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.670 
bit of difference there when you are
using<00:01:15.060> these<00:01:15.210> devices<00:01:15.360> they'll<00:01:16.350> essentially

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
using these devices they'll essentially

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.370 
using these devices they'll essentially
bring<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> same<00:01:17.220> sort<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:18.140> services<00:01:19.140> as

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
bring you the same sort of services as

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.050 
bring you the same sort of services as
you<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.130> see<00:01:20.310> we're<00:01:20.490> actually<00:01:20.580> connecting

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
you can see we're actually connecting

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
you can see we're actually connecting
with<00:01:21.119> NFC<00:01:21.509> right<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:21.920> unintentionally

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
with NFC right there unintentionally

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.310 
with NFC right there unintentionally
they<00:01:23.430> both<00:01:23.580> ways<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.850> work<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.119> NFC<00:01:24.720> they're

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
they both ways to work with NFC they're

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.830 
they both ways to work with NFC they're
both<00:01:25.439> extremely<00:01:25.619> similar<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.580> size<00:01:26.820> as<00:01:27.509> far<00:01:27.720> as

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
both extremely similar in size as far as

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
just light it just pretty much is made

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.450 
just light it just pretty much is made
of<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> same<00:02:03.030> materials<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:03.930> white

deep<00:02:08.039> into<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:09.239> what<00:02:09.840> you're<00:02:10.080> seeing

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
deep into this but what you're seeing

here

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.220 
here
is<00:02:14.100> sort<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.220> situation<00:02:15.400> in<00:02:15.940> which<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
is sort of a situation in which the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.870 
is sort of a situation in which the
software<00:02:17.560> isn't<00:02:17.710> going<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:17.980> matter<00:02:18.070> because

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
software isn't going to matter because

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.120 
software isn't going to matter because
the<00:02:19.060> Nexus<00:02:20.050> 4<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.410> eventually<00:02:20.620> going<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:20.980> be

the Nexus 4 is eventually going to be

the Nexus 4 is eventually going to be
updated<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.550> KitKat<00:02:22.120> whereas<00:02:22.780> this<00:02:22.930> one<00:02:22.990> is

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
updated to KitKat whereas this one is

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.200 
updated to KitKat whereas this one is
working<00:02:23.440> like<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.680> cat<00:02:23.920> out<00:02:24.070> of<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.220> box<00:02:24.400> the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
working like a cat out of the box the

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.730 
working like a cat out of the box the
processors<00:02:25.810> do<00:02:26.050> make<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.230> little<00:02:26.470> bit<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.620> the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
processors do make a little bit of the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.960 
processors do make a little bit of the
difference<00:02:27.040> because<00:02:27.220> your<00:02:27.370> while<00:02:27.820> you're

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
difference because your while you're

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.940 
difference because your while you're
working<00:02:28.240> with<00:02:28.330> qualcomm<00:02:29.140> processes<00:02:29.680> in<00:02:29.770> both

working with qualcomm processes in both

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.940 
working with qualcomm processes in both
cases<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:31.630> Nexus<00:02:32.020> 4<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.470> sort<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:32.860> a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
cases the Nexus 4 is sort of a

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.270 
cases the Nexus 4 is sort of a
generation<00:02:33.570> behind<00:02:34.570> not<00:02:35.380> that<00:02:35.500> it's<00:02:35.650> slowed

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
by any means it's obviously extremely

Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor so

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.900
