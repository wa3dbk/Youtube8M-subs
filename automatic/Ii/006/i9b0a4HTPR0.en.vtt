00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
myself in two years I've been living on

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.990 
myself in two years I've been living on
hand-me-downs<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.590> question<00:00:32.040> did<00:00:32.369> bring<00:00:32.850> me

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
hand-me-downs this question did bring me

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.430 
hand-me-downs this question did bring me
back<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.390> feeling<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.870> feeling<00:00:34.110> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
back to that feeling and feeling so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.139 
back to that feeling and feeling so
overwhelmed<00:00:34.469> when<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.250> had<00:00:35.460> my<00:00:35.579> first<00:00:35.610> baby<00:00:35.940> and

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
overwhelmed when I had my first baby and

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.209 
overwhelmed when I had my first baby and
he<00:00:36.210> started<00:00:36.450> walking<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.960> had<00:00:37.380> literally<00:00:37.620> no

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
he started walking I had literally no

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.580 
he started walking I had literally no
idea<00:00:38.250> what<00:00:38.610> kind<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.790> shoes<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.120> get<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.420> him

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
idea what kind of shoes to get for him

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.770 
idea what kind of shoes to get for him
so<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.860> think<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:41.790> are<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> really<00:00:42.120> two

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
so I think here are the really two

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.959 
so I think here are the really two
things<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.260> concentrate<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.219> number<00:00:44.789> one

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
things really concentrate on number one

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.090 
things really concentrate on number one
you<00:00:45.270> want<00:00:45.480> something<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.289> comes<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.800> very

you can get on easily no thin straps no
tiny<00:00:56.160> little<00:00:56.430> holes<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.969> after<00:00:57.300> that

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
key thing here is that the baby is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.910 
key thing here is that the baby is
developing<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.690> sensation<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.500> walking

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
developing the sensation of walking

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.560

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
she should have that feeling of having

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.039 
she should have that feeling of having
her<00:01:08.280> feet<00:01:08.520> touch<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> ground<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.780> don't

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
her feet touch the ground so you don't

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.590
