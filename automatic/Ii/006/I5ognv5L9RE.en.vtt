 and then start again produced by cable then 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.030
 doing normally managed to find 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.030
 it comes out like this 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:54.600
 to relate to the chorus carillo 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.720
 we have the minor 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.390
 which is done by placing the first finger on the 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.860
 fifth cost here d'acord second key the 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.750
 second finger on the fourth string in the 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.319
 according to key these measures 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.360
 then we have the dott 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:16.470
 which becomes the first finger second string first 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.560
 second finger fourth string second key 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:24.860
 third finger button fifth third string 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:28.190
 key these from now then we have the sol 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.380
 which is made of the first finger fifth string 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.479
 second key second finger sixth key 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.590
 third string and fourth finger first fret 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.590
 spin this and soul 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.380
 and then the king the first second finger 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.360
 third string button according to tito primo 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.900
 second finger first string second key 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.690
 third finger second string third rate 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:58.100
 these rules and therefore we have the 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:05:01.100
 succession of minor dream the picking is 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.100
 closed 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:14.190
 for each agreement then the refrain to 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:16.669
 new me minor when he started different 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.669
 with dr 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.630
 me minor only 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:38.790
 no and so for the whole chorus then 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:44.820
 the agreement we repeat with the refrain is 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:47.480
 the jesus pennata jesus is this and for 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.090
 as for the one with the arpeggio 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.600
 in the version only with the breath that 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.600
 always the same 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.770
 that is, the agreements change only 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.810
 themselves but the succession changes because 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.780
 in the reverso we have the dream 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:10.060
 king 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.060
 me minor and so I have 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.040
 money 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.040
 3 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:36.690
 is the verse is equal to that of the minor 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:43.800
 then at the end when he concludes all that 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.800

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.020

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.520
 after the final part we do 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:06.790

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.040
