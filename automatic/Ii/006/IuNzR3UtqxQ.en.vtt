00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.469
 and I the one that started in solar fox 

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.910
 extinguish action I bring you a new 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:08.180
 video so good this time it's going to 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.650
 be a a news video in the pp and 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.750
 well, let's start first 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.630
 what has changed is right now 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.570
 they modified the thymus war 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.150
 of the omega squad 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.980
 now as you see here it looks like one of 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.099
 these little boats or like a bomb 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.270
 explosive full of radioactive material 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:30.640
 or something like that now makes more sense 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.600
 as you can see there are fungi and the explosion 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.320
 I guess it will remain the same 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.240
 let the crab pass by to step on the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.960
 the explosion is still the same and 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.680
 well another thing that have changed in the 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.300
 pp 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.510
 let me get my notes here in what 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.480
 they enjoy a little rip-off 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.030
 is that they are going to get into possibly or is 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.820
 it's only possible it's the most likely 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:59.079
 are going to put a new game mode that 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.059
 it's called nurse nrf as bours but with 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.909
 in the beginning 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.479
 This game mode will be the mode 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.630
 of game 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.700
 this is going to be the way that 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.250
 always presents riot for the day of 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.080
 the innocents the first of April in 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.840
 USA 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.570
 this model is going to be as they say here 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.210
 the gossips will be all 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.159
 the opposite of the way that the 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.380
 last year 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.909
 because you are going to have instead of a 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.880
 super powerful character is going to have a 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.819
 weak mega character then you're going to 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.319
 have 100% mana consumption that is 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:36.850
 refer this to anything 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.179
 whatever skill you throw is going to 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:44.530
 remove all your mana automatically you go 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:47.290
 to have 200% of the cult and inflection 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.110
 in skills items and 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.430
 like the bone to everything will cost the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.820
 double or this is instead of this being in 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.340
 instead of being 16 seconds base 32 the 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.040
 flash is going to be 10 minutes or each 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.310
 10 footage has a flash they also say 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.250
 that you are going to have 50% anti-tenacity or 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.950
 is that you are going to have the edible the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.930
 Athena is that the effects of 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.760
 Mass control will last you less anti 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.290
 tenacity I guess it's going to be that the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.959
 Effects are going to last twice as long 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.950
 do not wait 50% is double then the 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:28.219
 flash is going to be about 20 minutes 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.439
 yes yes because one hundred percent 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.390
 more series wins however 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:35.470
 then you will last longer longer 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.780
 still in the effects of slowdown 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.340
 stunt seg actions and all that not be 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.730
 non-oxidation action is a word 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.159
 but good this one that more is going to have 200 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.769
 percent of delay in basic attacks or 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.510
 be it for example if they scam do if I and 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.359
 then it takes a second and you can go back 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.159
 to attack for they are going to be like four 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.980
 seconds more or less between attack and 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:00.319
 attack I do not know if it counts when you do it 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.520
 so you move until you shoot 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.360
 move and the attack restarts 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.540
 to have 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.490
 critical strikes are going to do 50% of the 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.710
 total damage or the critical stars 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.050
 they're going to be even more striking so 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.600
 a gang blank grid plank is going to be going to 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.430
 be the good host not really not 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.920
 because you will cost all take to 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:27.700
 put one 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.700
 so you're not going to have that much 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.519
 what 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.790
 a says that this unit is vulnerable to 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.980
 the consequences that you are going to do is going to 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.320
 is going to be very weak this is going to be the 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.050
 new game mode or apparently it's 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.780
 what is raising our mind that the 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.240
 new game mode of this season 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.950
 it will be null the opposite of 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.640
 urbasa have a character with whom you 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.900
 you feel very vulnerable so 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.850
 Well, our opinions and 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.650
 comments here in the section does not wait 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.370
 say our opinions and comments 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.610
 here in the comments section 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.360
 Here I leave you with a scam and I suppose 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.360
 I suppose magical 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.870
 one of those and scam that you're doing 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.520
 leave yourself there piggy so it's good for 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.520
 everything until the next goodbye
