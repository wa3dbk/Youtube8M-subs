main thing we're looking for is to be

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.760 
main thing we're looking for is to be
able<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.180> give<00:00:27.300> riders<00:00:27.570> really<00:00:28.230> accurate

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
times on their splits how they have that

relate to the leader in terms of their
their<00:00:33.960> speed<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.530> also<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.220> provide<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.610> you

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
their speed and also to provide a you

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.700 
their speed and also to provide a you
know<00:00:36.269> database<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:36.960> people<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.350> track<00:00:37.559> their

know database so people can track their

know database so people can track their
progress<00:00:37.910> we<00:00:38.910> think<00:00:39.150> it'll<00:00:39.269> be<00:00:39.420> something<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
progress we think it'll be something to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.250 
progress we think it'll be something to
be<00:00:40.500> pretty<00:00:41.040> desirable<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:42.000> most<00:00:42.330> riders<00:00:42.660> okay

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
be pretty desirable for most riders okay

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.930 
be pretty desirable for most riders okay
you<00:00:43.739> know<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> guys<00:00:44.070> who<00:00:44.370> are<00:00:44.400> winning<00:00:44.820> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
you know the guys who are winning a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.310 
you know the guys who are winning a
great<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.360> B<00:00:45.480> grades<00:00:45.750> probably<00:00:46.050> won't<00:00:46.170> make<00:00:46.290> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
great and B grades probably won't make a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.049 
great and B grades probably won't make a
lot<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.590> difference<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> vast

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
lot of difference to but for the vast

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.610 
lot of difference to but for the vast
majority<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.690> riders<00:00:49.050> behind<00:00:49.290> a<00:00:49.350> track<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
majority of riders behind a track the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.780 
majority of riders behind a track the
performance<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.219> sort<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.399> see<00:00:50.550> how<00:00:50.579> they're

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
performance and sort of see how they're

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.549 
performance and sort of see how they're
going<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.480> relation<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> other<00:00:52.200> rider<00:00:52.440> I

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
going in relation to the other rider I

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.869 
going in relation to the other rider I
think<00:00:52.739> would<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.980> pretty<00:00:53.160> desirable<00:00:53.489> thing

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
think would be a pretty desirable thing

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.610 
think would be a pretty desirable thing
you<00:00:54.510> know<00:00:54.570> times<00:00:54.870> people<00:00:55.230> come<00:00:55.320> off<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.559> go

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
a guesstimate we do a great job with our

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.520 
a guesstimate we do a great job with our
website<00:01:26.970> putting<00:01:27.299> results<00:01:27.659> up<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.470> know

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
website putting results up but you know

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.810 
website putting results up but you know
if<00:01:28.619> they're<00:01:28.740> not<00:01:28.830> accurate<00:01:29.189> results<00:01:29.580> you<00:01:29.700> know

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
if they're not accurate results you know

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.760 
if they're not accurate results you know
it<00:01:29.970> loses<00:01:30.360> some<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.600> its<00:01:30.780> credibility<00:01:31.740> I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
it loses some of its credibility I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.620 
it loses some of its credibility I
suppose<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> way<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.420> move

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
suppose so this is just the way to move

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.380 
suppose so this is just the way to move
forward<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.110> know<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:35.009> think<00:01:35.400> online

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
forward you know and I think online

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.030 
forward you know and I think online
entry<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.170> stuff<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.770> that's<00:01:37.890> just

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
entry and stuff like that that's just

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.830 
entry and stuff like that that's just
the<00:01:38.250> way<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.850> know<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.270> takes<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
the way to go you know it just takes the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.140 
the way to go you know it just takes the
takes<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> hassle<00:01:40.830> a<00:01:41.070> bit<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.340> race<00:01:41.549> day<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
takes the hassle a bit on race day and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.850 
takes the hassle a bit on race day and
it's<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:43.049> got<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> great<00:01:43.619> improvement

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
it's just got to be a great improvement

timing expert up here tonight have a
look<00:01:53.549> at<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.700> trial<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.299> they're

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
look at the trial and they're

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.510 
look at the trial and they're
considering<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.829> know<00:01:55.979> what<00:01:56.189> they're<00:01:56.369> going

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
considering you know what they're going

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.620 
considering you know what they're going
to<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.970> we<00:01:57.119> think<00:01:57.329> will<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.479> a

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
to do and we think will be a

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.179 
to do and we think will be a
recommendation<00:01:57.930> from<00:01:58.439> CSP<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:58.950> they're<00:01:59.100> not

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
recommendation from CSP and they're not

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.069 
recommendation from CSP and they're not
too<00:01:59.340> distant<00:01:59.520> future<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.450> last<00:02:00.659> year<00:02:00.930> we

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
too distant future the last year we

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.219 
too distant future the last year we
rolled<00:02:01.320> out<00:02:01.560> our<00:02:01.939> x<00:02:02.939> 7<00:02:03.390> system<00:02:03.780> which<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.079> had

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
rolled out our x 7 system which we had

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.710 
rolled out our x 7 system which we had
previously<00:02:07.220> run<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.820> we<00:02:09.119> did<00:02:09.509> some

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
previously run it so we did some

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.420 
previously run it so we did some
upgrades<00:02:10.079> and<00:02:10.229> some<00:02:10.440> testing<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.070> be<00:02:11.100> able<00:02:11.280> to

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
upgrades and some testing to be able to

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.990 
upgrades and some testing to be able to
run<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.910> system<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:13.230> ran<00:02:13.470> throughout<00:02:13.739> the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
run that system we ran throughout the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.550 
run that system we ran throughout the
National<00:02:15.000> Road<00:02:15.150> Series<00:02:15.600> events<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.140> Caribou

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
National Road Series events that Caribou

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.300 
National Road Series events that Caribou
runs<00:02:16.829> in<00:02:17.100> Victoria<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:17.940> then<00:02:18.180> we<00:02:19.070> rolled<00:02:20.070> out

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
runs in Victoria and then we rolled out

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.059 
runs in Victoria and then we rolled out
the<00:02:20.340> data<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.360> baked<00:02:21.840> rats<00:02:22.110> as<00:02:22.290> well<00:02:22.470> so

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
the data in the baked rats as well so

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.070 
the data in the baked rats as well so
the<00:02:23.700> plan<00:02:23.879> this<00:02:24.090> year<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.629> continue

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
the plan this year is to continue

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.940 
the plan this year is to continue
running<00:02:25.260> with<00:02:25.560> that

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
running with that

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.820 
running with that
it<00:02:26.069> is<00:02:26.220> working<00:02:26.459> for<00:02:27.050> more<00:02:28.050> open<00:02:28.200> event<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:28.770> to

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
it is working for more open event so to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.850 
it is working for more open event so to
expand<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.430> however<00:02:29.700> we<00:02:30.150> see<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.480> long-term

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
expand that however we see the long-term

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.979 
expand that however we see the long-term
vision<00:02:31.860> as<00:02:32.330> moving<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.480> an<00:02:33.599> active

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
vision as moving to an active

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.229 
vision as moving to an active
transponder<00:02:34.950> system<00:02:35.310> that's<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.700> passive

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
transponder system that's a passive

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.880 
transponder system that's a passive
transponder<00:02:36.930> system<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.500> we'll<00:02:37.620> be<00:02:37.769> moving

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
transponder system so we'll be moving

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.420 
transponder system so we'll be moving
away<00:02:38.580> from<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.390> into<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> new<00:02:40.019> system<00:02:41.010> in

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
away from that and into a new system in

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.949 
away from that and into a new system in
the<00:02:41.700> medium<00:02:42.480> term

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
the medium term

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.920 
the medium term
I<00:02:42.989> guess<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.860> hope<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.459> both<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.630> clubs

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
I guess the hope is that both the clubs

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.370 
I guess the hope is that both the clubs
and<00:02:46.280> Victorian<00:02:47.280> cycling<00:02:47.700> will<00:02:47.910> see<00:02:48.480> well<00:02:49.200> I'll

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
and Victorian cycling will see well I'll

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.559 
and Victorian cycling will see well I'll
have<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.620> vision<00:02:50.370> plotted<00:02:50.849> out<00:02:51.120> together<00:02:51.330> on

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
have a vision plotted out together on

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.809 
have a vision plotted out together on
the<00:02:51.690> same<00:02:51.930> system<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.069> we<00:02:53.160> can<00:02:53.310> all<00:02:53.430> have

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
the same system so that we can all have

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.729 
the same system so that we can all have
the<00:02:53.970> same<00:02:54.120> type<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.420> results<00:02:55.080> where<00:02:55.349> there's

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
the same type of results where there's

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.680 
the same type of results where there's
consistent<00:02:56.340> timing<00:02:56.910> results<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.510> when<00:02:57.599> you

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
consistent timing results and when you

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.990 
consistent timing results and when you
go<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.870> an<00:02:58.230> event<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.790> have<00:02:59.970> a

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
go to an event you you have a

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.009 
go to an event you you have a
consistency<00:03:00.780> across<00:03:01.709> them<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.580> a<00:03:03.030> standard

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
consistency across them and a standard

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.930 
consistency across them and a standard
of<00:03:04.170> service<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.799> you<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.310> expect<00:03:05.730> as<00:03:05.910> a

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
of service that you you expect as a

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.470 
of service that you you expect as a

importantly<00:03:09.959> it's<00:03:10.170> it's<00:03:10.620> not<00:03:10.709> as<00:03:10.890> onerous<00:03:11.280> on

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
importantly it's it's not as onerous on
