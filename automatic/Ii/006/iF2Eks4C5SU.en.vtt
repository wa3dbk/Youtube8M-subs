 keyed basements 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.099

 located 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.750

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.990
 This opinion Victoria journalist from 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.840
 Lugansk girl on my own experience

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.300
 informed on the Internet appeared 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.210
 list 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.639
 the list of places to hide 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.060
