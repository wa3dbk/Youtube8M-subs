00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.480
 good in this video I want to talk to you about 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.990
 something very, very important that many 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.389
 people sometimes do not take into account and 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.110
 suddenly they have a lot of problems with their 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.879
 computer one of them is the speed 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.160
 some other times when they turn on the 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.230
 computer this takes a very long time 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.120
 to start and do not know exactly what 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.780
 it's about I want to mention to you that when 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.740
 you install many programs 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.960
 regularly when you turn on your 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.940
 computer almost always next to 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.800
 little clock here I do not have the clock but 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.890
 regularly you are going to see a lot here 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.020
 of tiny icons for each good 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.350
 of those icons means that it is a 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.360
 program that is working from the 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.700
 moment that you turn on your computer 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.550
 which means that many of those 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.630
 programs are using resources from 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.570
 your pc 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.980
 obviously making it much slower and 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.170
 I want to mention to you that most of 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.750
 those programs sometimes we do not use them 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.960
 and for some reason since the 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.320
 we install are working 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.290
 now as we can disable 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.060
 disabling does not mean deleting 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.909
 it means that we are only going to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.729
 prevent them from starting automatically 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.619
 and that are placed on this side and then 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.170
 good the right way to carry 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.330
 This purpose is to use a 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.399
 I program several times already 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.320
 I have presented if you want to come to this 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.240
 page you see on the piriform screen 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.600
 dotcom within the section of 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.640
 downloads look for seacleaner and this 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.920
 side have two versions one turned off 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.229
 we look for being free of 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.149
 left side we give piriform and to the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.770
 get to this page we will appear 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.289
 the option to save it in our 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.490
 computer or running it once for 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.190
 proceed with the installation you 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.410
 I recommend that you install it once 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.759
 you already install it you will see more or 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.920
 less like this that I have here in 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.110
 screen what you have to do is 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.140
 go to the section where it says 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.659
 tools on this side and here you go to 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.240
 find a button that says start up or 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.579
 start programs if we give you 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.360
 one click to this option here we are going to 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.280
 give an account 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.270
 all those programs that are 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.800
 starting every time we turn on 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.900
 our computer if you want to give you 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.450
 more or less account of what program 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.730
 try then good here you will see it from 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.310
 right side like your 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.080
 location and there will be many of them that 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.990
 Actually I repeat, we are not 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.940
 using for example the quick time that 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.640
 he regularly puts you down here 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.590
 about updates and so on that 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.750
 many times we do not occupy it by the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.310
 simple fact that the selections you 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.160
 are you going to give this side design or 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.780
 disable what if otherwise you 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.640
 already disabled this and later 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.459
 you want to enable it, well you come 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.290
 to this same section you select that 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.959
 program and you give and netbook or 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.239
 I in this case enable all 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.160
 that you see marked in black a little more 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.950
 strong means that they are not 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.590
 disabled but the others that you see 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.780
 they look like a little gray these 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.430
 yes I have them disabled once 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.980
 you have already disabled those 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.380
 programs that you do not want to start 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.030
 when windows starts then the next 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.040
 nothing else is to be 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.110
 technically the program and 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.480
 automatically the next time you 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.819
 clothes your computer you will not see 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.770
 these annoying programs running from 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.350
 automatic way I repeat you does not mean 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.060
 that you are deleting them if you want 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.000
 open some of them that you no longer have 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.760
 here you can find it in what is your 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.739
 start menu and from this side locate 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.709
 to the program that you go to 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.420
 need to open only in that 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.220
 moment obviously when I no longer 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.130
 use this I recommend that the closures 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.870
 completely so that in that way not 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.060
 is using resources of your machine 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.400
 you will see that your pc is going to feel very 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.709
 but very very good leave me a comment 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.280
 in the bottom part and see you in the 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.280
 next
