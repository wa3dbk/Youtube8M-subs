00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:10.999
 and here we are live before the un 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:16.070
 professional and amateur class in ohio 2013 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:21.250
 with Panamanian athletes presenting their 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.250
 Homeland to idle and excel 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:29.060
 true spinoza yes and when they arrived 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.060
 Monday true let's say 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.960
 a little earlier to make sure that everything 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.739
 comes physical is well liquid 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.430
 and be able to give us the climate in which category 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.430
 they are going to compete 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.980
 figuro that the perfect fitness couple 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.960
 help us between the two because it is not 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.750
 easy the one of the diet of the feeding 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.460
 well rigorous then it's better so in 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.879
 team better that way 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.909
 Tell me a little of their struggle to reach 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.540
 from Panama I am told that they come via 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.180
 the npc truth if I say because I started 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.520
 this because the federation did not want me 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.400
 give permission then I had nothing 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.909
 more than talking to them so I left 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.149
 by my other federation the nation- of 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.390
 Yemen's comedy on how this goes up 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.159
 it's super look at us truth do not know for me and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.429
 if they are the first, I have not competed 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.350
 much in level 5 competition in the usa 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:39.570
 as the list of stage 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.880
 the west palm beach sunshine 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.759
 the jersey show 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.490
 several on bikes I was competing and 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.860
 later I retired to panama and part of 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.070
 turn yes although there is someone who gave them the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.250
 inspiration after having made a 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.170
 family because they have children, not children 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.069
 we have two children good inspiration 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.159
 was born from that after I retired because 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.799
 there the family is that we followed the 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.410
 sport but 9 and I love the sport grow and 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.849
 then I see a lot of potential in 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.190
 panama many athletes who come and go 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.540
 very knowledgeable and not maintained 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.790
 then I am giving him as a 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.459
 encouragement to keep going that the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.069
 federation of the only way to be able 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.260
 achieve one's goal perhaps that the 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.590
 same athletes have an inspiration 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.019
 also know one of your own are 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.280
 the united states representing their 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:37.590
 country and you after two children have 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.799
 sure in your advice for other women 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.019
 that maybe they are contemplating the idea in 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.239
 compete or compete again 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.560
 Of course, in 2006, it was my last 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.390
 competition 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.300
 has obtained the title of miss fitness 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.040
 panama and miss fitness republic in 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.410
 my country 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.160
 contest in cup me three in cup friendship 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.950
 in different cups they fit in my country 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.170
 and then after he just had one he has 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.000
 a one-year-old baby then because of 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.500
 that this one prepared for my three gym 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.720
 that after six years he won it in me 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.000
 country then I went with him doing 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.620
 the diet to help him to accompany him 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.960
 and suddenly I saw that the physicist and they go 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.270
 improving more and more and that if I gave 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.670
 mind that if they pressed achieve and so I 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.200
 I was motivating little by little and then when 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.820
 he was told that I did not say you know that 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.400
 They have we will not go do instead of 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.680
 one then let's let's do it the 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.090
 two and I think they are finding out and 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.770
 now that we're here that I'm 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.660
 here because you can not compete for six years 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.820
 and two children I think that as no 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.380
 they squared on him in what he's going to 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.880
 compete she is not there goes the one of 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.940
 clear clear helper though and now in 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.370
 the future and then the year that will be their 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.470
 good plans I say continue with 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.720
 my career is to try 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.870
 go to another home I do not know I do not know about Brazil 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.120
 of the europe look for competitions 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.030
 of good levels to be able to improve myself and 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.110
 continue to be inspired by what I am not 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.060
 Of course the most important thing is that we have 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.069
 the doors open to opportunities 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.230
 positive that it is best not to choose 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.970
