00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
boom an RV and he came across this thing

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.130 
boom an RV and he came across this thing
that<00:02:19.379> is<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:20.069> vehicle<00:02:20.909> which<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.239> sprinter

that is this vehicle which is a sprinter
it's<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.769> little<00:02:22.950> engine<00:02:24.590> it's<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.769> total

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
it's a little engine it's a total

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.309 
it's a little engine it's a total
passenger<00:02:26.970> sprinter<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.450> he<00:02:27.690> has<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.900> really

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
can live it running the consumption is

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.240 
can live it running the consumption is
really<00:02:44.909> good<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.530> we<00:02:46.530> actually<00:02:46.709> sleeping

the other option was with a van and like

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.039 
the other option was with a van and like
towing<00:03:04.859> a<00:03:05.069> trailer<00:03:05.120> but<00:03:06.120> with<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.510> wind<00:03:06.750> drag

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
know just impossible because then it

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.690 
know just impossible because then it
