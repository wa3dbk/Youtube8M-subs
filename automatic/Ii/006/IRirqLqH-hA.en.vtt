00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.460
 sure place that are just a meleca 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.160
 green there, not funny, but during your 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.930
 sleep in those capsule bullet capsules 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.170
 that will explain there are those that 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.479
 cheat science grapes and wake up and everything stays 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.340
 wrong and that those gossip escaped 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.250
 your ship's personnel are dead 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.740
 even over the top turned zombies stir and the 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.689
 chatron or that now that you remember 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.970
 from metroid run away because it's just you 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.979
 walking alone golden brown full of 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.630
 animal that killed the world map that 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.670
 game is very big ms always like 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.560
 explore each corner of the room because the 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.240
 game is full of secret passages with 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.460
 churches of life or ammunition within 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.020
 remembering many tanks of energy and 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.060
 frequent use of gaming missiles 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.100
 metroid same and it's always nice to have 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.320
 as frequent as possible because the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.320
 boss of this game is nothing phase 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.700
 if you run away without caring 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.799
 with nothing in the game you can be sure 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.500
 who will be stuck with the first boss 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.360
 here there is no rpg system where you 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.489
 Level opia killing enemies with 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.560
 your clothes exploring the same scenarios 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.239
 not to mention that it's cool to even explore 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.040
 new ones are informed and 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.200
 finding some survivors you 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.580
 finds this little fish called bubbles 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.650
 conquest my god bluetooth webcam 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.340
 you stay well avoid talking much otherwise 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.340
 ram 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.980
 the pope 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.120
 You were the best goldfish made by 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.740
 four pixels is 4 pixels is enough 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.810
 and make me feel moved 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.150
 just a loose graphics as 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.860
 can see are very charming I have not enjoyed 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.960
 much character design seems to 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.550
 very much with the character of rpg maker I think 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.130
 that it would be much cooler if they 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.440
 were higher zinho out but okay all 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.870
 well I 'm a bit annoying even though 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.550
 game have this visual 8 to 16 bits 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.410
 He is very excited and has some 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.780
 very interesting lighting effects 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.850
 not to mention that this game would give much 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.560
 right on nintendo 3ds because some 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.170
 scenarios have a nice perspective that 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.510
 looks amazing with 3d effect of laptop 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.430
 partner is very bad the color whale of 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.740
 practically all areas 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.600
 this game are blue it does not bring much 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.580
 variety and still gives the feeling of you 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.830
 is walking in circles change the color of 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.680
 some scenarios for yellow red already 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:40.970
 I would improve a lot but again I'm fine 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.970
 boring even now the songs are fucking 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.890
 she can make the mood brighter 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.890
 when you are in an area full of friends 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.530
 but it also manages to leave the climate well 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.450
 dark composer in this dark place 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.450
 and tetouan what's cool 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.790
 I can not say the same thing about the 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.370
 sounds that what this idea of 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:14.739
 Developer leave everything well but 8 bits 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.269
 I think it was not necessary the sun half 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:23.289
 that does not fit as you see 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:26.139
 on the screen you have bigger than ever 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:29.919
 took repower and all you hear is one 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:33.699
 piu piu piu pulp who fears for the worst 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:36.520
 Now the gameplay is flawless water is 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.800
 need sun devil UOL which leaves 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.970
 fights with the ChÃ¡vez very epic because 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.979
 Can you say that practically 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.870
 everything he throws at you you can 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.759
 give a kind of double jump had to 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.320
 which may be very strange in the 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.090
 start but then you get used to it 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.699
 this system that can do every 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.860
 Maneuver yourself believing time 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.810
 that you can click on the walls and do 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.270
 the audio is wide and this is always welcome 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.520
 I think it's mine when you die 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.289
 usually it's because of you, it 's really 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.970
 difficult to have motorcycle unfair I think the 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.870
 The only unjust death I had in this 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.550
 game was in this part that I fell rip 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.039
 thorns how the hell would I know that 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.930
 thorns there you gain more 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.909
 each boss you kill again one 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.590
 metroid gimp saw the parts you 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:19.870
 wins for invincibility games 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.139
 yesterday even mature overpowered it 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.169
 You can go out and kill everybody and it's 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.240
 this final act is the zoom graphics 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.599
 nice for those who enjoy pixel area 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.460
 sounds fantastic music is what else 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.460
 story ok the gameplay 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.940
 I love metroid style games or 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.250
 metroidvania seal this game did everything 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.930
 still mixed new elements 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.360
 as platforms well the style of games 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.400
 indies even as super meat boy by 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.320
 example so if you liked this game 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.090
 prepare to tear off your hair 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.220
 because the game is harder than it looks 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:59.150
 and learn your wallet too because the 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.320
 game is for $ 20 from steam someone 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.750
 noticed that the prices of the games 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.640
 regional governments are raising the blame 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.890
 kind of sad just getting everything every time 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.690
 more expensive or but it's worth buying a 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.640
 car show up some cool promotion and 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.500

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.220
