00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
lower-lying building here and you'd

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.300 
lower-lying building here and you'd
still<00:01:46.200> get<00:01:46.470> people<00:01:46.770> looking<00:01:46.890> out<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.189> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
couple of times actually and even on

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.590 
couple of times actually and even on
this<00:02:10.470> one<00:02:10.679> now<00:02:10.709> there's<00:02:11.099> been<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> few

as<00:03:28.850> well<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:29.540> hopefully<00:03:30.020> he<00:03:30.410> can<00:03:30.530> introduce

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
as well so hopefully he can introduce

as well so hopefully he can introduce
you<00:03:31.070> to<00:03:31.160> some<00:03:31.340> of<00:03:31.370> those<00:03:31.580> if<00:03:31.790> you're

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
you to some of those if you're

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.820 
you to some of those if you're

seven comics they're all hilarious some

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.590 
seven comics they're all hilarious some
of<00:03:36.710> them<00:03:36.890> sort<00:03:37.430> of<00:03:37.490> biographical<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.420> some<00:03:38.510> of

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
of them sort of biographical and some of

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.100 
of them sort of biographical and some of
them<00:03:38.720> just<00:03:38.750> fiction<00:03:40.540> but<00:03:41.540> this<00:03:41.720> building<00:03:42.020> is

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
them just fiction but this building is

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.780 
them just fiction but this building is
amazing<00:03:42.440> i<00:03:42.530> love<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.830> no<00:03:43.160> idea<00:03:43.400> how<00:03:43.490> much<00:03:43.580> going

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
amazing i love it no idea how much going

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.920 
amazing i love it no idea how much going
to<00:03:43.820> cost<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.120> that<00:03:44.150> moment<00:03:44.480> this<00:03:44.540> is<00:03:44.720> just<00:03:44.870> a

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
to cost to that moment this is just a

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.570 
to cost to that moment this is just a
prototype<00:03:45.170> that's<00:03:45.560> been<00:03:45.710> cut<00:03:46.040> on<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.340> cheap

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
prototype that's been cut on the cheap

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.950 
prototype that's been cut on the cheap
chinese<00:03:47.000> laser<00:03:47.240> that<00:03:47.390> we<00:03:47.510> bought<00:03:47.690> just<00:03:47.870> for

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
chinese laser that we bought just for

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.480 
chinese laser that we bought just for
prototyping<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.650> stuffing<00:03:48.980> around<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:51.490> the

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
prototyping and stuffing around and the

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.520 
prototyping and stuffing around and the
costs<00:03:53.300> for<00:03:53.330> these<00:03:53.570> are<00:03:53.840> some<00:03:54.050> somewhat

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
costs for these are some somewhat

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.310 
costs for these are some somewhat
dependent<00:03:54.920> on<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.130> amount<00:03:55.160> of<00:03:55.430> material<00:03:55.880> but

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
dependent on the amount of material but

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.230 
dependent on the amount of material but
predominantly<00:03:57.320> on<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:58.100> laser<00:03:58.310> time<00:03:58.580> how

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
predominantly on the the laser time how

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.790 
predominantly on the the laser time how
long<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.540> lights<00:03:59.750> on<00:03:59.930> for<00:03:59.960> the<00:04:00.200> lasers<00:04:00.500> on<00:04:00.590> for

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
long the lights on for the lasers on for

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.170 
long the lights on for the lasers on for
to<00:04:00.890> cut<00:04:01.130> all<00:04:01.310> of<00:04:01.340> this<00:04:01.580> there's<00:04:01.790> obviously<00:04:02.120> a

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
to cut all of this there's obviously a

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.820 
to cut all of this there's obviously a
lot<00:04:02.240> of<00:04:02.420> detail<00:04:02.780> in<00:04:02.810> this<00:04:02.990> is<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.170> lot<00:04:03.530> of<00:04:03.620> layers

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
lot of detail in this is a lot of layers

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.130 
lot of detail in this is a lot of layers
which<00:04:04.130> is<00:04:04.280> what<00:04:04.460> gives<00:04:04.580> us<00:04:04.730> that<00:04:04.910> depth<00:04:05.210> and

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
which is what gives us that depth and

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.510 
which is what gives us that depth and
when<00:04:06.320> our<00:04:06.440> production<00:04:06.890> machines<00:04:07.250> arrive

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
when our production machines arrive

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.640 
when our production machines arrive
we'll<00:04:07.700> get<00:04:07.820> a<00:04:07.850> better<00:04:08.060> idea<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.510> how<00:04:09.350> long<00:04:09.530> it's

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
we'll get a better idea of how long it's

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.200 
we'll get a better idea of how long it's
going<00:04:09.740> to<00:04:09.800> take<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:10.160> cut<00:04:10.340> this<00:04:10.520> how<00:04:10.700> quickly<00:04:11.000> we

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
going to take to cut this how quickly we

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.460 
going to take to cut this how quickly we
can<00:04:11.240> produce<00:04:11.510> them<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:11.960> therefore<00:04:12.080> how<00:04:12.320> much

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
can produce them and therefore how much

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.580 
can produce them and therefore how much
it's<00:04:12.650> going<00:04:12.740> to<00:04:12.800> cost<00:04:13.420> but<00:04:14.420> I<00:04:14.840> love<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.350> it's<00:04:15.500> a

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
it's going to cost but I love it it's a

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.950 
it's going to cost but I love it it's a
great<00:04:15.800> looking<00:04:16.070> building<00:04:16.460> and<00:04:16.609> I<00:04:17.299> hope<00:04:17.540> if

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:17.960 
great looking building and I hope if

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.719 
great looking building and I hope if
you're<00:04:18.170> interested<00:04:18.590> you<00:04:18.739> can<00:04:19.220> tune<00:04:19.520> in<00:04:19.640> two

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
you're interested you can tune in two
