00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
and how you could actually really

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.390 
and how you could actually really
interact<00:02:02.080> with<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.259> environment<00:02:02.400> actually

environment drag your finger across the

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.690 
environment drag your finger across the
environment<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.570> have<00:02:07.720> Drake<00:02:07.960> follow<00:02:08.319> along

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
environment and have Drake follow along

when<00:02:09.700> we<00:02:09.880> are<00:02:10.030> doing<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.840> back<00:02:11.050> an<00:02:11.350> alpha

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
when we are doing the back an alpha

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.920 
when we are doing the back an alpha
sample<00:02:12.250> we<00:02:12.850> came<00:02:13.060> up<00:02:13.090> with<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.480> idea<00:02:13.540> of

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
sample we came up with the idea of

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.710 
sample we came up with the idea of
climbing<00:02:14.440> hopes<00:02:14.819> so<00:02:15.819> we<00:02:16.030> are<00:02:16.209> trying<00:02:16.480> always

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
climbing hopes so we are trying always

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.340 
climbing hopes so we are trying always
to<00:02:16.900> use<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.590> feature<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.160> Vita<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:20.140> a

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
to use the feature of the Vita in a

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.080 
to use the feature of the Vita in a
sense<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.250> only<00:02:21.340> brings<00:02:21.700> something<00:02:21.940> to

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
sense that the only brings something to

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.720 
sense that the only brings something to
the<00:02:22.209> game<00:02:22.480> can<00:02:23.200> do<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.470> traditional<00:02:23.980> controls

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
the game can do the traditional controls

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.059 
the game can do the traditional controls
you<00:02:25.060> know<00:02:25.180> aiming<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.660> firing<00:02:25.830> but<00:02:26.830> what<00:02:26.950> we

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
you know aiming and firing but what we

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.350 
you know aiming and firing but what we
wanted<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.340> do<00:02:27.459> for<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.700> Vita<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:28.060> add

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
wanted to do for the Vita is add

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.710 
wanted to do for the Vita is add
something<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.959> little<00:02:29.200> bit<00:02:29.410> more<00:02:30.390> dynamic<00:02:31.390> to

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
something a little bit more dynamic to

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.990 
something a little bit more dynamic to
the<00:02:31.750> system<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:33.220> main<00:02:33.400> thing<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.790> we<00:02:33.880> did

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
the system so the main thing that we did

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.670 
the system so the main thing that we did
is<00:02:34.209> when<00:02:34.390> you're<00:02:34.510> aiming<00:02:34.870> around<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.380> can<00:02:35.530> aim

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
is when you're aiming around you can aim

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.380 
is when you're aiming around you can aim
with<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.950> right<00:02:36.130> stick<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.730> then<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.269> can

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
with the right stick and then you can

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.600 
with the right stick and then you can
just<00:02:37.569> tilt<00:02:37.840> through<00:02:38.080> adjust<00:02:38.410> your<00:02:38.530> aim<00:02:38.610> we've

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
just tilt through adjust your aim we've

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.640 
just tilt through adjust your aim we've
got<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.760> touch<00:02:40.030> screen<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.360> front<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.690> rear<00:02:40.870> so

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
got a touch screen in front and rear so

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.290 
got a touch screen in front and rear so
for<00:02:41.860> example<00:02:41.890> what<00:02:42.430> we<00:02:42.459> decided<00:02:42.819> to<00:02:42.910> do<00:02:43.060> for

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
for example what we decided to do for

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.360 
for example what we decided to do for
grades<00:02:43.600> is<00:02:43.930> when<00:02:44.560> you're<00:02:44.709> holding<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.040> system

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
grades is when you're holding the system

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.620 
grades is when you're holding the system
you<00:02:45.519> could<00:02:45.670> touch<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.090> grenade<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.480> just

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
you could touch the grenade and just

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.479 
you could touch the grenade and just
drag<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:46.989> into<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.440> scene<00:02:47.650> wherever<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:48.220> want

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
drag it into the scene wherever you want

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.270 
drag it into the scene wherever you want
it's<00:02:49.300> really<00:02:49.630> easier<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.140> aim<00:02:50.319> on<00:02:50.590> our<00:02:50.980> on<00:02:51.250> the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
it's really easier to aim on our on the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.940 
it's really easier to aim on our on the
Vita<00:02:51.610> funny<00:02:52.000> enough<00:02:52.140> than<00:02:53.140> any<00:02:53.170> other<00:02:53.530> system

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
Vita funny enough than any other system

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.250 
Vita funny enough than any other system
any<00:02:54.430> other<00:02:54.730> game<00:02:54.970> we've<00:02:55.239> ever<00:02:55.360> played<00:02:55.510> and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
any other game we've ever played and

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.090 
any other game we've ever played and
we're<00:02:56.470> pretty<00:02:56.620> proud<00:02:56.890> of<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.569> Vita<00:02:58.569> has<00:02:58.870> a

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
we're pretty proud of that Vita has a

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.030 
we're pretty proud of that Vita has a
OLED<00:03:00.100> screen<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:01.019> I've<00:03:02.019> never<00:03:02.260> worked<00:03:02.890> with

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
OLED screen and I've never worked with

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.610 
OLED screen and I've never worked with
that<00:03:03.310> technology<00:03:03.760> before<00:03:04.150> but<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:05.380> first

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
that technology before but the first

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.110 
that technology before but the first
impression<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:06.070> get<00:03:06.250> at<00:03:06.400> this<00:03:06.489> device<00:03:06.850> is

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
impression you get at this device is

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.660 
impression you get at this device is
that<00:03:07.390> screen<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:08.350> blacks<00:03:08.620> are<00:03:08.799> so<00:03:09.040> deep<00:03:09.280> the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
that screen the blacks are so deep the
