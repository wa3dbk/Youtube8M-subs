it<00:01:33.420> might<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.750> little<00:01:34.020> bit<00:01:34.110> wrong<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
it might be a little bit wrong but you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.429 
it might be a little bit wrong but you
do<00:01:35.460> now<00:01:35.640> you're<00:01:36.150> looking<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.720> really<00:01:37.170> stiff

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
do now you're looking for a really stiff

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.230 
do now you're looking for a really stiff
thing<00:01:37.710> eventually<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.460> basically<00:01:38.759> take<00:01:39.000> and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
thing eventually you basically take and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.300 
thing eventually you basically take and
it's<00:01:39.360> cold<00:01:39.570> enough<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.470> mold<00:01:40.740> into<00:01:41.189> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
it's cold enough you can mold into a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.010 
it's cold enough you can mold into a
pastry<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.509> then<00:01:42.630> put<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> filling

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
enough now this is a bit where to turn

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.259 
enough now this is a bit where to turn
it<00:03:04.200> into<00:03:04.290> it's<00:03:04.620> very<00:03:04.830> traditional<00:03:04.980> style<00:03:05.940> and

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
it into it's very traditional style and

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.430 
it into it's very traditional style and
shape<00:03:06.510> yes

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
shape yes

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.410 
shape yes
so<00:03:07.620> they<00:03:07.769> resemble<00:03:08.400> where<00:03:08.910> they<00:03:09.000> are<00:03:09.120> teardrop

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
so they resemble where they are teardrop

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.880 
so they resemble where they are teardrop
shapes<00:03:09.660> but<00:03:09.840> they<00:03:09.930> resent<00:03:10.230> what<00:03:10.319> you<00:03:10.410> can<00:03:10.530> find

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
shapes but they resent what you can find

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.009 
shapes but they resent what you can find
okay<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.849> wafer<00:03:12.120> I've<00:03:12.569> had<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.750> different

they're<00:03:18.000> in<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.329> shape<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.750> teardrop

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
they're in the shape of a teardrop

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.599 
they're in the shape of a teardrop

I<00:03:25.680> hope<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.579> once<00:03:26.760> you've<00:03:26.910> rolled<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.209> out<00:03:27.299> as

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
I hope so once you've rolled it out as

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.500 
I hope so once you've rolled it out as
thin<00:03:27.630> as<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.840> possibly<00:03:28.140> can<00:03:28.579> place<00:03:29.579> sort<00:03:30.359> of<00:03:30.420> a

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
thin as you possibly can place sort of a

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.569 
thin as you possibly can place sort of a
teaspoon<00:03:31.170> into<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.799> middle<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.220> then<00:03:32.519> you

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
teaspoon into the middle and then you

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.069 
teaspoon into the middle and then you
want<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.730> fold<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.180> up<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:33.450> around<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:33.959> an

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
want to fold it up and around that an

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.530 
want to fold it up and around that an
important<00:03:34.500> thing<00:03:34.769> is<00:03:34.980> don't<00:03:35.549> let<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.239> filling

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
important thing is don't let the filling

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.569 
important thing is don't let the filling
touch<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.109> outside<00:03:37.290> because<00:03:38.100> that's<00:03:38.310> when

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
touch the outside because that's when

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.309 
touch the outside because that's when
later<00:03:38.790> on<00:03:38.910> when<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.150> fry<00:03:39.359> ill<00:03:39.569> explode<00:03:39.959> if<00:03:40.170> any

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
later on when you fry ill explode if any

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.099 
later on when you fry ill explode if any
is<00:03:40.470> leaking<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:41.280> then<00:03:41.519> this<00:03:41.819> is<00:03:42.030> fiddly<00:03:42.569> but

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
is leaking and then this is fiddly but

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.289 
is leaking and then this is fiddly but
basically<00:03:43.590> bring<00:03:43.859> your<00:03:43.980> edges<00:03:44.340> pop<00:03:44.579> and<00:03:44.850> a<00:03:45.150> bit

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
basically bring your edges pop and a bit

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.720 
basically bring your edges pop and a bit
like<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:46.319> it<00:03:46.440> was<00:03:46.530> Chinese<00:03:46.950> cuisine<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.519> look

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
like if it was Chinese cuisine you look

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.849 
like if it was Chinese cuisine you look
a<00:03:47.790> bit<00:03:47.819> length<00:03:48.450> on<00:03:48.750> or<00:03:49.260> something<00:03:49.560> like<00:03:49.680> that

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
a bit length on or something like that

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.819 
a bit length on or something like that
or<00:03:49.980> dumpling<00:03:50.459> then<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.600> is<00:03:51.810> similar<00:03:52.260> there's

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
or dumpling then this is similar there's

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.259 
or dumpling then this is similar there's
an<00:03:52.920> inversion<00:03:53.190> as<00:03:53.850> soon<00:03:54.060> as<00:03:54.120> you're<00:03:54.239> finished

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
an inversion as soon as you're finished

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.300 
an inversion as soon as you're finished
shaping<00:03:54.660> them<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:55.170> can<00:03:55.290> then<00:03:55.410> take<00:03:55.650> them<00:03:55.920> dunk

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
shaping them you can then take them dunk

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.190 
shaping them you can then take them dunk
them<00:03:56.609> into<00:03:57.120> beaten<00:03:57.600> egg<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:57.959> then

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
them into beaten egg and then

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.780 
them into beaten egg and then
breadcrumbs<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:58.889> the<00:03:58.980> breadcrumb<00:03:59.310> stick<00:03:59.579> and

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
breadcrumbs and the breadcrumb stick and

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.330 
breadcrumbs and the breadcrumb stick and
then<00:03:59.910> they'll<00:04:00.000> be<00:04:00.090> ready<00:04:00.120> for<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.510> frock

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.800 

so<00:04:05.340> they've<00:04:05.489> gone<00:04:05.640> into<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.090> fryer<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.540> need

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
so they've gone into the fryer and need

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.410 
so they've gone into the fryer and need
three<00:04:07.080> or<00:04:07.110> four<00:04:07.319> minutes<00:04:07.560> at<00:04:07.739> 163<00:04:08.730> Celsius

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
three or four minutes at 163 Celsius

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.690 
three or four minutes at 163 Celsius
