00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.729
 so few however kind people told me 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.119
 that such but seen on Indian 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.439
 fair that it is possible to clean 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.820
 accidents get just on such 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:55.680
 events like indian fair 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:01.040
 so if you see and feel free to 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.040
 buy as it is worth the money 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.690
 One of the advantages of packing data is I 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.630
 I can mark this cooking recipe 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.560
 henna with added coffee for dark 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.489

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.739

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.600

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.140
 consistency and now I have left 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:28.910
 add only kai buck iodine i added 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.640
 15 drops of iodine before applying this 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.500
 I think I would advise you to add a couple 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.959
 tablespoons of your favorite oil 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.440
 so that j does not hurt your beautiful 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.810
 beautiful hair I have everything carefully 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.989
 shuffled now I have to remove 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.549
 my gruel is a dark warm place like 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:55.250
 usually 8 hours after eight hours 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.410
 my seems absolutely ready now 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.680
 there will be little things left to add here 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.390
 tablespoon of your favorite butter for 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.660
 In order not to overdry the length of hair 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:12.730
 I've already added butter a tablespoon 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:17.390
 I mix it all thoroughly now and 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:23.859
 it remains to put this mixture on the head 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.859
 under a warm warming cap all night 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.640
 and here is the long-awaited result 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.629
