00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Vladimir Putin completed the first part 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.850
 his visit to latin america this 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.470
 the longest visit of the Russian 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.559
 president for all the time how much he 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.059
 is in power in the harbor 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.639
 at a press conference Vladimir Putin 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.199
 confirmed that many were signed 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.859
 various important agreements including 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.680
 in oil production and development 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.150
 it is known that some potential shelf cubes 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.410
 can bring 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.400
 up to 20 billion barrels of oil 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.900
 Russian company abroad a lion now 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.059
 will be engaged in mining development 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.500
 oil is one of the main agreements well 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.630
 certainly the most important news 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 the fact that Moscow officially confirmed 90 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.010
 percent long cubes soviet union 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.770
 it's 32 billion dollars 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.390
 officially written off 10 percent 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.450
 the remaining three will be invested in 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.129
 economy cubes and now as the main 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.570
 The intrigue is that Havana 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.100
 will be able to offer some in return 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.170
 They say that maybe even be 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.760
 re- launched radar 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.640
 station lourdes who is Putin himself and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.890
 closed almost fifteen years ago and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.359
 of course in the current hya 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.890
 practical situation it will be pretty 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.930
 significant event if you stop 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.760
 will happen but so far none of the leaders 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.400
 world camp fire her about this 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.350
 speak officially another of the main 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.780
 moments of this visit a short visit to 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.030
 Havana became Vladimir Putin's visit to 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.890
 fidel castro of course fiedel 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.600
 probably not govern the country because 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.590
 do before he is almost ten years old already 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.689
 is in hospital 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.229
 but Vladimir Putin said that they had 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.009
 quite intense talk about 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.140
 international politics regional 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.470
 politicians but probably it was not for me 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.270
 long conversation in fidel career 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.360
 it is known that he loves to talk 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.909
 his longest speech in havan and 80th 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.950
 year lasted as much as 7 hours fidel castro 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.270
 wants as I said not very much 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.070
 now governs the country but nonetheless 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.740
 he is one of the longest playing 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.710
 political leaders in the world he is on duty 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.340
 same in fact 49 years ten american 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.170
 presidents he political survived 634 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.670
 an attempt on his life like himself 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.580
 claims it was committed most of 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.040
 them as he says was 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.050
 from the break to the cia and some of them 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.720
 were quite creative poisoned 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.670
 cigars and even tried to pour powder 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.280
 because of which the beard would n't fall 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.410
 most so that he lost his reputation and 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.410
 political weight on the cube
