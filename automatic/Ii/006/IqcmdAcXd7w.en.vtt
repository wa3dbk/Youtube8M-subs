00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
me to switch the two strikers around

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.310 
me to switch the two strikers around
between<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:56.009> each<00:01:56.250> episode<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:57.299> each<00:01:57.630> game<00:01:58.290> I

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
between in each episode like each game I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.679 
between in each episode like each game I
play<00:01:58.649> because<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> generally<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.270> do<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> lot

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
play because I generally do do a lot

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.289 
play because I generally do do a lot
better<00:02:00.869> with<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.500> left<00:02:02.040> striker<00:02:02.460> position<00:02:03.060> so

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
better with the left striker position so

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.109 
better with the left striker position so
I<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:04.200> been<00:02:04.380> doing<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.740> for<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:05.340> episode

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
I have been doing that for this episode

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.429 
I have been doing that for this episode
I've<00:02:06.390> been<00:02:06.539> switching<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.020> turn<00:02:07.170> around

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
I've been switching the turn around

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.940 
I've been switching the turn around
however<00:02:08.100> unfortunately<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.850> we<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.720> play<00:02:10.050> with

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
however unfortunately if we do play with

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.950 
however unfortunately if we do play with
a<00:02:11.160> hybrid<00:02:11.760> team<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.240> they're<00:02:12.480> getting<00:02:12.630> dead

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
a hybrid team and they're getting dead

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.990 
a hybrid team and they're getting dead
links<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.440> won't<00:02:13.710> probably<00:02:14.010> be<00:02:14.370> possible<00:02:14.880> to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
links it won't probably be possible to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.210 
links it won't probably be possible to
switch<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.450> two<00:02:15.630> around<00:02:16.230> what<00:02:16.740> i<00:02:16.770> will<00:02:17.040> do

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
switch the two around what i will do

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.860 
switch the two around what i will do
though<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.430> i<00:02:17.700> will<00:02:17.850> switch<00:02:18.120> them<00:02:18.330> around<00:02:18.360> at

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
though is i will switch them around at

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.140 
though is i will switch them around at
the<00:02:18.990> start<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.500> each<00:02:19.770> game

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
the start of each game

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.030 
the start of each game
them<00:02:21.269> so<00:02:21.599> i<00:02:21.629> keep<00:02:21.989> getting<00:02:22.140> chemistry<00:02:22.739> and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
them so i keep getting chemistry and

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.020 
them so i keep getting chemistry and
they're<00:02:23.250> playing<00:02:23.549> in<00:02:23.700> different<00:02:23.970> positions

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
they're playing in different positions

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.360 
they're playing in different positions
so<00:02:24.720> let's<00:02:24.900> build<00:02:25.079> that<00:02:25.200> team<00:02:25.409> in<00:02:25.709> center

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
so let's build that team in center

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.190
