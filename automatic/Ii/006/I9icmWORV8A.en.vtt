00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.219
 Hi, friends, how are you doing? 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.860
 gari clive I bring a new video in this 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.750
 on occasion we will see how well I am going to 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.970
 show where is where you can find 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.190
 this vehicle as this may be called 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.160
 forklift a 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.529
 I flip I do not know how you can call 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.840
 but many people had asked me what 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.670
 that there were and then here is the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.109
 exact location 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.480
 it would be more or less the mine is a mine 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:44.370
 where they exploit some kind of mineral not 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.070
 I know if I silver 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.160
 charcoal 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.700
 putting something something to explode but 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.730
 is here 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.200
 we go backwards towards 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.980
 back forward remember here is 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.120
 the desert and to one side 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.909
 I'm lost 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.510
 and then nothing since we have it then we are going 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.510
 to prove it 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.420
 It's very slow, it's very slow, I know that 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.720
 it's not a racing car 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.140
 It is a car for 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.320
 load 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.659
 but 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.929
 but it can be used for other purposes 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.530
 like for example making the asshole of 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.530
 make them mother 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:40.409
 shock clash of titans fuck not fuck 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.549
 This car is not designed for this 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.510
 this vehicle is designed for that 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.290
 sorry 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.290
 I was wrong 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.010
 it's a big boys fight towards 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.010
 down I better 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.260
 but I want to get to the road and 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.260
 do whatever it is to actually do 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.430
 to cause chaos 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.480
 imagine is a fight between this and the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.920
 train obviously 30 and jealousy chinga 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.920
 but it 's so interesting 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.960
 and that's how it came, it's almost here, it's going to be 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.020
 the end of many of many people in 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.410
 serious or at least I hope if it is that 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:32.730
 this thing moves faster 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.730
 what imbecile tombstones 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.000
 created the order very carefully 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.480
 beating the coup 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.770
 to the contrary guys I think they go 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.380
 bad that can not be like that go more boys 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.210
 guys care care 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.580
 sorry no mystery forgiveness I found 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.790
 you know how much I'm sorry shit I have not 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.790
 turned around 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.050
 air was in charge care was fighting against 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.430
 hit view warns 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.430
 have to turn idiot 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.690
 for believing that these things actors do not 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.690
 can give 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.600
 at the stroke of a visa there is 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.600
 very well 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.819
 the insurance company will be 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.590
 crying seriously will be crying 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.970
 with me 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.970
 what is happening that is by your side 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.350
 in this car you can do internships 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.350
 inside who want to play 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.879
 I do not think a boat has stopped me 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.879
 obviously a game error 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.600
 If this is the case, I did not expect it if 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.420
 I did not expect it 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.530

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.410
