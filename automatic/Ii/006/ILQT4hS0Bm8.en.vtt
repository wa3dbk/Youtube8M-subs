favorite some people might hate it and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.869 
favorite some people might hate it and
it's<00:00:48.360> basically<00:00:48.809> scare<00:00:49.620> eight<00:00:49.829> heavy<00:00:50.399> barrel

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
it's basically scare eight heavy barrel

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.130 
it's basically scare eight heavy barrel
bipod<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.129> 3.4<00:00:53.129> times<00:00:53.160> scope<00:00:54.140> especially

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
bipod and the 3.4 times scope especially

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.130 
bipod and the 3.4 times scope especially
the<00:00:55.829> US<00:00:56.309> side<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:57.960> love

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the US side one because I really love

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.139 
the US side one because I really love
that<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.500> has<00:00:58.530> some<00:00:58.920> really<00:00:59.219> nice<00:00:59.609> clear

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
that it has some really nice clear

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.720 
that it has some really nice clear
crossers<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.770> easily<00:01:01.980> calculate

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
crossers and you can easily calculate

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.630 
crossers and you can easily calculate
the<00:01:03.300> drop<00:01:03.629> off<00:01:03.920> over<00:01:04.920> long<00:01:05.129> race<00:01:05.339> now<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the drop off over long race now the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.270 
the drop off over long race now the
reason<00:01:05.939> I'm<00:01:06.180> using<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.960> bipod<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.560> not<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> fruit

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
reason I'm using a bipod and not a fruit

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.539 
reason I'm using a bipod and not a fruit
loop<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:09.060> loader<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:10.010> really<00:01:11.010> good<00:01:11.310> and

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
loop is this loader is really good and

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.050 
loop is this loader is really good and
I'm<00:01:11.939> trying<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:13.200> engaged<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:14.040> long<00:01:14.610> ranges

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
I'm trying to be engaged in long ranges

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.870 
I'm trying to be engaged in long ranges
like<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.900> maps<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.590> strike<00:01:16.979> at<00:01:17.130> karkand<00:01:17.610> or

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
like in maps like strike at karkand or

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.050 
like in maps like strike at karkand or
aftermath<00:01:18.750> maps<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.320> merkins<00:01:19.920> mono<00:01:20.250> leaf<00:01:20.549> if

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
aftermath maps like merkins mono leaf if

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.490 
aftermath maps like merkins mono leaf if
you're<00:01:21.270> going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> go<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.140> little<00:01:22.350> bit

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you're going to go for like a little bit

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.800 
you're going to go for like a little bit
more<00:01:22.830> medium<00:01:23.250> range<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.790> will<00:01:24.210> probably<00:01:24.420> use<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
more medium range I will probably use a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.920 
more medium range I will probably use a
353<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.189> want<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.150> want<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.540> play<00:01:27.720> in

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
353 and if I want if I want to play in

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.800 
353 and if I want if I want to play in
really<00:01:28.229> long<00:01:28.439> range<00:01:28.710> maps<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.810> endgame

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
really long range maps like the endgame

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.560 
really long range maps like the endgame
ups<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.290> will<00:01:31.680> probably<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.460> an<00:01:32.610> HD<00:01:32.909> WR<00:01:33.390> with

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
ups I will probably go for an HD WR with

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.090 
ups I will probably go for an HD WR with
the<00:01:33.630> heavy<00:01:33.810> barrel<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.619> reason<00:01:34.920> I'm<00:01:35.070> not

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
the heavy barrel the reason I'm not

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.920 
the heavy barrel the reason I'm not
putting<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> Foley<00:01:35.909> above<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.240> sky<00:01:36.479> rates<00:01:36.750> is

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
putting the Foley above the sky rates is

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.770 
putting the Foley above the sky rates is
as<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.439> all<00:01:37.560> know<00:01:37.590> guys<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.400> does<00:01:38.790> fuck<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
as you all know guys it does fuck up the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.660 
as you all know guys it does fuck up the
accuracy<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.470> gun<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.220> special

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
accuracy of the gun and a special

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.389 
accuracy of the gun and a special
discourage<00:01:42.270> which<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> high-power<00:01:43.740> garment

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
discourage which is a high-power garment

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.039 
discourage which is a high-power garment
it's<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> highest<00:01:44.970> power<00:01:45.360> gun<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
it's the highest power gun on the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.160 
it's the highest power gun on the
engineer<00:01:46.439> class<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> same<00:01:47.250> as<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.520> g3<00:01:48.390> it

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
engineer class is the same as a g3 it

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.380 
engineer class is the same as a g3 it
makes<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.680> really<00:01:49.920> nitrate<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.790> prefer<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
makes it really nitrate so I prefer to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.999 
makes it really nitrate so I prefer to
go<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.810> heavy<00:01:52.020> barrel<00:01:52.290> because<00:01:52.560> for

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
go with the heavy barrel because for

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.889 
go with the heavy barrel because for
those<00:01:53.189> long<00:01:53.490> read<00:01:53.700> skills<00:01:54.000> especially<00:01:54.210> if

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
those long read skills especially if

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.600 
those long read skills especially if
you're<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.320> full<00:01:55.649> out<00:01:55.680> at<00:01:55.979> some<00:01:56.250> point<00:01:56.280> if

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you're going full out at some point if

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.190 
you're going full out at some point if
you<00:01:56.670> want<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.909> suppress<00:01:57.210> someone<00:01:57.689> because

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
you want to suppress someone because

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.929 
you want to suppress someone because
suppression<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> really<00:01:59.219> big<00:01:59.340> factor<00:01:59.790> and

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
suppression is a really big factor and

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.219 
suppression is a really big factor and
you<00:02:00.060> need<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.360> think<00:02:00.479> about<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.899> when<00:02:01.079> you're

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you need to think about it when you're

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.230 
you need to think about it when you're
trying<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.680> kill<00:02:01.920> someone<00:02:02.369> if<00:02:02.490> he<00:02:02.670> sees<00:02:02.969> you

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
trying to kill someone if he sees you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.450 
trying to kill someone if he sees you
suppressing<00:02:04.170> him<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.500> also<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> really<00:02:05.280> good

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
suppressing him is also a really good

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.130 
suppressing him is also a really good
idea<00:02:05.610> that's<00:02:06.030> why<00:02:06.240> I'm<00:02:06.390> using<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.960> heavy

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
idea that's why I'm using the heavy

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.290 
idea that's why I'm using the heavy
barrel<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.560> surfaces<00:02:08.129> someone<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.759> I'm<00:02:09.060> kind

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
barrel of surfaces someone and I'm kind

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.940 
barrel of surfaces someone and I'm kind
of<00:02:09.390> surprised<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> will<00:02:10.229> try<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> suppress

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
of surprised to I will try to suppress

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.860 
of surprised to I will try to suppress
him<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.310> then<00:02:11.489> kill<00:02:11.760> him<00:02:11.819> some<00:02:12.420> people<00:02:12.690> try<00:02:12.810> to

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
him and then kill him some people try to

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.700 
him and then kill him some people try to
be<00:02:13.140> really

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
be really

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.440 
be really
but<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.130> truth<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.520> guides<00:02:15.000> after<00:02:15.330> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
but the truth is that guides after the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.390 
but the truth is that guides after the
suppression<00:02:15.780> system<00:02:16.290> kicked<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:17.160> truth

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
suppression system kicked in the truth

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.130 
suppression system kicked in the truth
is<00:02:17.550> up<00:02:17.730> guys<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.240> pressing<00:02:18.570> someone<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.020> as

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
is up guys the pressing someone is as

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.480 
is up guys the pressing someone is as
effective<00:02:19.410> as<00:02:19.710> being<00:02:19.920> accurate<00:02:20.100> and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
effective as being accurate and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.220 
effective as being accurate and
sometimes<00:02:20.910> suppression<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.750> way<00:02:22.020> more

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
sometimes suppression is way more

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.360 
sometimes suppression is way more
important<00:02:22.650> than<00:02:22.770> not<00:02:22.950> being<00:02:23.100> accurate

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
important than not being accurate

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.190 
important than not being accurate
because<00:02:24.000> if<00:02:24.180> you're<00:02:24.330> suppressed<00:02:24.750> like<00:02:24.930> hell

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
because if you're suppressed like hell

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.960 
because if you're suppressed like hell
what's<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.590> point<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:25.980> actually<00:02:26.460> trying<00:02:26.880> to

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
that I really enjoy the Magnum lately

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.000 
that I really enjoy the Magnum lately
and<00:02:36.750> right<00:02:36.930> now<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.350> i'm<00:02:37.440> using<00:02:37.470> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
and right now that i'm using the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.500 
and right now that i'm using the
controllers<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.670> very<00:02:38.970> designed<00:02:39.390> the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
controllers the very designed the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.180 
controllers the very designed the
trigger<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.380> Thunder<00:02:40.830> children

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
trigger of the Thunder children

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.430 
trigger of the Thunder children
controllers<00:02:41.700> I'm<00:02:42.210> enjoying<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.870> Magnum<00:02:43.320> and

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
controllers I'm enjoying the Magnum and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.590 
controllers I'm enjoying the Magnum and
somber<00:02:43.920> scan<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.610> 94<00:02:45.210> pretty<00:02:45.390> much

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
somber scan in the 94 pretty much

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.210 
somber scan in the 94 pretty much
because<00:02:45.930> with<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.200> trigger<00:02:46.410> stops<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:47.070> can

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
because with the trigger stops you can

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.490 
because with the trigger stops you can
really<00:02:47.490> spam<00:02:48.210> that<00:02:48.480> sugar<00:02:48.780> with<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.050> Magnum

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
really spam that sugar with the Magnum

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.350 
really spam that sugar with the Magnum
and<00:02:49.740> it's<00:02:50.070> way<00:02:50.250> more<00:02:50.280> easy<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.910> put<00:02:51.150> the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
and it's way more easy to put the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.780 
and it's way more easy to put the
trigger<00:02:51.630> halfway<00:02:52.200> entire<00:02:52.740> instead<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.580> like

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
trigger halfway entire instead of like

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.760 
trigger halfway entire instead of like
all<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.150> way<00:02:54.300> in<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.870> as<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.200> can<00:02:55.380> see<00:02:55.410> in

it's over 9000 it's 0.5 which is

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.250 
it's over 9000 it's 0.5 which is
ridiculously<00:03:32.460> hella<00:03:32.790> high<00:03:33.030> like<00:03:33.270> a<00:03:33.300> g3<00:03:33.870> but

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
ridiculously hella high like a g3 but

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.530 
ridiculously hella high like a g3 but
the<00:03:34.410> RPM<00:03:34.860> is<00:03:35.010> really<00:03:35.280> low<00:03:35.490> it<00:03:35.820> actually<00:03:36.060> kills

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
the RPM is really low it actually kills

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.780 
the RPM is really low it actually kills
really<00:03:36.900> fast<00:03:37.170> in<00:03:37.350> close<00:03:37.560> range<00:03:37.680> that's<00:03:38.520> why<00:03:38.760> I

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
really fast in close range that's why I

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.360 
really fast in close range that's why I
think<00:03:38.970> it's<00:03:39.300> really<00:03:39.810> versatile<00:03:40.260> if<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.590> see

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
think it's really versatile if you see

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.760 
think it's really versatile if you see
someone<00:03:41.700> been<00:03:42.270> really<00:03:42.690> close<00:03:42.810> range<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.530> you

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
someone been really close range and you

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.530 
someone been really close range and you
stood<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.100> couple<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:44.520> bullets<00:03:44.850> at<00:03:45.030> him<00:03:45.300> you

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
stood a couple of bullets at him you

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.810 
stood a couple of bullets at him you
pretty<00:03:45.750> much<00:03:45.840> have<00:03:46.260> got<00:03:46.800> his<00:03:47.010> half<00:03:47.220> health<00:03:47.550> and

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
pretty much have got his half health and

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.760 
pretty much have got his half health and
then<00:03:48.330> add<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.510> couple<00:03:48.720> more<00:03:48.900> bullets<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.620> he's

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
then add a couple more bullets and he's

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.340 
then add a couple more bullets and he's
dead<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.250> know<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:51.030> he's<00:03:51.420> hip<00:03:51.450> it's<00:03:51.840> hip<00:03:52.110> fire
