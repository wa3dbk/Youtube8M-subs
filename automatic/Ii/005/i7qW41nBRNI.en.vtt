00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
is this is my old camera I had it for 18

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.760 
is this is my old camera I had it for 18
months<00:00:49.230> now

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
months now

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.650 
months now
they<00:00:50.579> both<00:00:50.850> mirrorless<00:00:51.510> camera<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.610> so

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
they both mirrorless camera and so

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.619 
they both mirrorless camera and so
they're<00:00:54.660> very<00:00:54.899> thin<00:00:55.289> very<00:00:56.129> small<00:00:57.770> and<00:00:59.629> size

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
they're very thin very small and size

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.140 
they're very thin very small and size
wise<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.649> are<00:01:01.980> almost<00:01:02.730> identical<00:01:03.799> and<00:01:05.150> you

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
wise they are almost identical and you

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.320 
wise they are almost identical and you
can<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.600> from<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.110> side<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.000> back<00:01:11.330> this

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
can see from the side and the back this

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.330 
can see from the side and the back this
way<00:01:12.570> okay<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:16.040> OMD<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.970> Olympus<00:01:18.509> is

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
way okay and the OMD this the Olympus is

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.310 
way okay and the OMD this the Olympus is
actually<00:01:20.340> had<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.619> extra<00:01:22.619> grip<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:25.140> when

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
actually had this extra grip on so when

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.260 
actually had this extra grip on so when
I<00:01:25.350> bought<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:27.950> this<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.610> was<00:01:29.850> extra<00:01:32.270> so

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
I bought it this this was extra so

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.499 
I bought it this this was extra so
without<00:01:33.689> without<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.320> grip<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:35.299> that's<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
without without the grip a that's the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.399 
without without the grip a that's the
real<00:01:36.689> size<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.280> slightly<00:01:38.880> smaller<00:01:39.409> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
real size so it's slightly smaller and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.590 
real size so it's slightly smaller and
not<00:01:40.680> much<00:01:41.270> different<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:45.409> why<00:01:46.409> why<00:01:47.070> do<00:01:47.130> I

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
not much different and so why why do I

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.609 
not much different and so why why do I
add<00:01:48.600> larger<00:01:49.409> by<00:01:49.649> another<00:01:50.640> mirrorless<00:01:51.119> camera

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
add larger by another mirrorless camera

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.620 
add larger by another mirrorless camera
it<00:01:52.619> there's<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.399> much<00:01:53.640> different<00:01:54.180> between

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
it there's not much different between

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.700 
it there's not much different between
them<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:56.280> main<00:01:56.670> difference<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.509> behind<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
them the main difference is behind the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.260 
them the main difference is behind the
cap<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.479> okay<00:02:00.500> this<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.100> micro<00:02:02.729> 4/3

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
cap here okay this one is a micro 4/3

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.190 
cap here okay this one is a micro 4/3
sensor<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:05.399> there<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.860> okay

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
sensor and there is okay

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.460 
sensor and there is okay
not<00:02:09.530> very<00:02:09.710> big<00:02:09.979> at<00:02:10.160> all<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.940> know<00:02:11.290> but<00:02:12.290> this

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
not very big at all you know but this

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.120 
not very big at all you know but this
one<00:02:13.180> have<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.209> guess

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
one have a guess

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.410 
one have a guess
yes<00:02:16.569> it's<00:02:17.569> a<00:02:17.690> full-frame<00:02:18.230> sensor<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:20.090> get<00:02:20.300> it

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
yes it's a full-frame sensor you get it

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.590 
yes it's a full-frame sensor you get it
on<00:02:20.690> most<00:02:21.350> of<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.620> DSLR<00:02:22.160> now<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.850> we<00:02:26.000> compare

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
on most of the DSLR now and we compare

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.210 
on most of the DSLR now and we compare
the<00:02:26.750> size<00:02:27.640> this<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.910> four<00:02:29.510> times<00:02:30.020> almost<00:02:30.560> four

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
the size this is four times almost four

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.480 
the size this is four times almost four
times<00:02:31.520> bigger<00:02:32.000> than<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.270> one<00:02:33.250> that's<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
times bigger than that one that's the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:41.020 
times bigger than that one that's the
reason<00:02:34.940> why<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:37.870> bought<00:02:38.870> this<00:02:39.080> new<00:02:39.290> one<00:02:40.030> it's

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
reason why I bought this new one it's

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.300 
reason why I bought this new one it's
because<00:02:41.150> of<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:42.970> monster<00:02:43.970> sensor<00:02:44.600> in<00:02:44.750> here

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
because of this monster sensor in here

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.360 
because of this monster sensor in here
and<00:02:46.780> let<00:02:47.780> me<00:02:47.810> tell<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.320> about<00:02:49.269> my<00:02:50.269> my<00:02:51.370> camera

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
and let me tell you about my my camera

d700 we just also have a full scene full
full<00:03:01.760> size<00:03:02.000> sensor<00:03:02.300> inside<00:03:03.670> but<00:03:04.670> it's<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:05.830> DSLR

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
full size sensor inside but it's a DSLR

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:14.770 
full size sensor inside but it's a DSLR
camera<00:03:08.709> DSLR<00:03:09.709> camera<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:13.220> Nikon<00:03:13.780> without

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
camera DSLR camera the the Nikon without

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.289 
camera DSLR camera the the Nikon without
the<00:03:14.989> lens<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:16.130> pole<00:03:16.370> device<00:03:16.730> about<00:03:17.090> this

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
the lens the pole device about this

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.060 
the lens the pole device about this
thick<00:03:17.890> so<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:18.920> can<00:03:19.760> argue<00:03:19.970> ok<00:03:20.720> it's<00:03:21.470> almost

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
thick so you can argue ok it's almost

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.490 
thick so you can argue ok it's almost
twice<00:03:22.549> as<00:03:22.820> thick<00:03:22.850> as<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.570> mirrorless<00:03:24.019> camera

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
twice as thick as a mirrorless camera

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.160
