like i say this process is going to be
virtually<00:01:27.960> exactly<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.409> same<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.890> any<00:01:29.159> kind

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
virtually exactly the same on any kind

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.410 
virtually exactly the same on any kind
of<00:01:30.079> program<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.110> use<00:01:31.229> out<00:01:31.619> there<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.790> once

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
of program you use out there so and once

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.630 
of program you use out there so and once
you<00:01:33.570> into<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.320> find<00:01:34.560> out<00:01:34.829> where<00:01:35.340> your

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
you into that just find out where your

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.609 
you into that just find out where your
Temple<00:01:36.060> Run<00:01:36.150> 2<00:01:36.270> file<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.020> obviously<00:01:37.350> I've<00:01:37.439> got

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
Temple Run 2 file is obviously I've got

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.990 
Temple Run 2 file is obviously I've got
quite<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.860> few<00:01:37.950> apps<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.430> here<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.820> might

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
quite a few apps on here so it might

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.910 
quite a few apps on here so it might
take<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.390> bit<00:01:39.509> longer<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.049> but<00:01:40.619> go<00:01:40.740> into

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
take a little bit longer and but go into

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.100 
take a little bit longer and but go into
Temple<00:01:41.310> Run<00:01:41.430> 2<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.030> you're<00:01:42.479> looking<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.020> the
