 simple until chocolate tacos 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.740

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.070

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.870
 to make a child chocolate tree 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.610
 you can go see the ingredients if 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.770
 they want but because only chocolate 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.930
 because it has chocolate we love the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.700
 chocolate and because although it is something very 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.280
 simple to do many times do not 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.440
 throw side I do not even know how to 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.480
 do what 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.840
 but you have to enjoy doing it 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.309
 does with love now well if we 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.590
 we come closer we will see the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.020
 ingredients the recipe of today is 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.880
 to make a glass of chocolate liqueur 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.140
 If we want to do more than just 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.200
 we double the ingredients and you 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.290
 excuse my throat as first step 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.390
 Well let's go today with blender 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.490
 can do with an agitator with a 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.760
 spoon but we require a glass of 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.360
 milk in this case I put spoonful and 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.729
 half of chocolate powder a brand 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.190
 that you want me here I put a 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.450
 teaspoon of sugar can be without 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.170
 sugar can be 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.350
 sweetener what do I know and we can put it 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.270
 a little cinnamon 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.750
 can be cinnamon powder or can 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.520
 complement with banana as with 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.000
 I do not recommend almonds with eggs 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.009
 It's a matter of taste or you can put it 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.370
 a trickle of vanilla then 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.940
 we start quickly we have milk 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.940
 we get 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.690
 here it is already in the tablespoon and a half of 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.690
 chocolate 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.720
 we have sugar 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.770
 Y 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.850
 a small 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.850
 cinnamon hairline 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.100
 does not know what gives a special touch 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.130
 I put him very little really is 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:43.590
 so that it gives it a flavor smell is a cell 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:48.800
 of god imagine since we have that 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.800
 we cover up with care 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.870
 and we get it connected 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.870
 and smoothies 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.109
 really the time for which you can 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:28.659
 vary as of about 30 seconds 40 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.540
 seconds to realize I no longer took me 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:35.730
 much the same more we use to put 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.280
 one night there to not hear more 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.750
 we put this 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.750
 It smells good smells good 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.970
 we stayed more I do not know why it is a fact 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.970
 curious but not 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.860
 it stays very good it stays fresh 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.080
 I recommend the ingredients are 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.670
 relatively cheap they get them 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.370
 in the supermarket that takes in the 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.010
 shop and enjoy chocolate 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.790
 now we can make more recipes 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.520
 for you are absurd crazy recipes 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.930
 international traditional the point 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.739
 is that they enjoy the same as us 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.560

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.830
