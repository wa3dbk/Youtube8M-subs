00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.350
 well this wonder is a project that 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.650
 we were delayed about seven years ago 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.810
 and obviously to the lack of work 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.980
 we try to do something that serves us 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:35.180
 for the good resource this is the idea 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.780
 reflected that in 22 thousand 608 we for 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.020
 can create event 15 in the marriage 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.390
 collective 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.580
 this is a limousine a project 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.300
 quite broad let's say where they cut 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.790
 the two cars modify the doors 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.400
 is modified the entire floor extend 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.589
 the cables and reinforce all this well 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.230
 has the sliding roof of a coupe 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.420
 torino then let's say the structure in 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.850
 yes it actually has a few forms that do not 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.290
 has a common car and is missing 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.380
 example everything the interior upholstery 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.420
 for events yes to rent let's say 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.390
 to enter the resources let's say towards the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.370
 cooperative because good we give 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.190
 free trainings call the 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.070
 guys in a state let's say at once a 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.780
 drink with respect to the drug to the 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.270
 street crime in the neighborhood 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.130
 maldonado then we managed to make a 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.840
 agreement and train those guys in 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.070
 those guys learned what mechanics 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.310
 sheet painting 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.840
 one year of work and taking advantage of 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.050
 situation that was postponed this 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.030
 work the boy we started doing it and 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.010
 if we were able to learn, we managed to 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.680
 take it off the street and we achieved many 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.410
 things we say during that year and the 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.540
 culture change of them that there are other 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.700
 things we better have put this 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.310
 T-shirt and we have what we have 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.050
 doing well to see that is the subject says 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.580
 but without help with own resources 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.590
 only from the narrow workshop 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.800
 painting work cooperatives 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.960
 teaching job social insertion 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.110
 Freedom is integrated to former inmates 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.899
 the delivery integrates let's say as the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.850
 secretary who is education and people 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.820
 what defense to the consumer 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.310
 we have psychologists we have some 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.620
 psychiatrists then is a team that 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.470
 It has helped us to build Expresidiario 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.060
 all this because the figure of ex 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.239
 convicts of background 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.060
 days plus a lot of things presented 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.709
 a project of this characteristic in the 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.260
 cooperative is the guarantee of these 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.090
 boys who comes out the one who does not have 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.879
 We train them in 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.560
 and with friends or acquaintances we include them 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.840
 in a job we in the work that 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.870
 we have been putting 40 for six years 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.239
 jobs let's say and theoretically 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.330
 have failed two nothing so I think 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.910
 that we are on the right track, let's say 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.060
 because people who leave prison come out 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.470
 with today let's say to see with a space 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.170
 has this space of the 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.180
 cooperative beyond falencias 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.670
 let's say economic that one has of 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.470
 labor agreements work we do 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.190
 everything possible to contain them 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.209
 we have a place that we rent 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.390
 We evict because we can not pay 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.430
 plus 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.180
 two years two years that we are in that 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.090
 local that is an important place for 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:27.140
 us but we can not have it anymore 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.920
 that there are many ways to collaborate 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.260
 plus 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.800
 the things to go arming here because 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.390
 we see that in another side we can not no 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.540
 we can hold it you have seen 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.380
 we have a canvas roof the floor of 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.590
 land 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.680
 we return valdano we do not have the resources 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.150
 since the place that we had good and today 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.610
 we have to adapt what we have 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.070
 with this effort is that we want 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.570
 demonstrate that if we can continue to 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.240
 that if you can go beyond all this 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.790
 but if we ask who can collaborate 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.000
 let's say with a businessman is not much to 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.010
 Sometimes a country of metal sheets are few and 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.570
 poblana arena let's say we 're not 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.500
 measuring one million pesos 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:15.820
 a collaboration the number of the 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:19.830
 cooperative is 470 51 71 is the number 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.830
 official of the cooperative 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.830
 and 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.520
 one
