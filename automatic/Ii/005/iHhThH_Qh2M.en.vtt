post<00:01:43.500> workout<00:01:43.829> meal<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:45.299> about<00:01:45.509> an<00:01:45.689> hour

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
post workout meal and then about an hour

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.560 
post workout meal and then about an hour
and<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.350> half<00:01:46.590> or<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:46.829> later<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.250> eat<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.790> solid

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and a half or so later I eat a solid

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.109 
and a half or so later I eat a solid
meal<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.020> something<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.770> nature<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.850> am

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
meal so something of that nature if I am

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.429 
meal so something of that nature if I am
dining<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:51.990> changes<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
dining then it just changes the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.639 
dining then it just changes the
structure<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.280> what<00:01:53.909> I'm<00:01:54.180> how<00:01:55.079> much<00:01:55.140> cars<00:01:55.500> have

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
structure of what I'm how much cars have

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.020 
structure of what I'm how much cars have
been<00:01:55.710> using<00:01:55.860> afterwards<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.790> how<00:01:56.880> much

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
been using afterwards and how much

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.060 
been using afterwards and how much
protein<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.750> forth<00:01:58.020> my<00:01:58.409> protein<00:01:58.770> levels

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
protein and so forth my protein levels

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.980 
protein and so forth my protein levels
typically<00:01:59.369> go<00:01:59.549> up<00:01:59.729> when<00:02:00.210> I'm<00:02:00.299> diving<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
typically go up when I'm diving and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.109 
typically go up when I'm diving and
carbon<00:02:01.290> levels<00:02:01.350> typically<00:02:01.860> go<00:02:02.070> down<00:02:02.280> as<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
carbon levels typically go down as a

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.030 
carbon levels typically go down as a
general<00:02:03.479> rule<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.689> thumb<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.619> these<00:02:04.829> are<00:02:04.890> some

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
general rule of thumb so these are some

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.280 
general rule of thumb so these are some
of<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.399> some<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.880> ways<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.420> i<00:02:06.479> do<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.200> now

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
of the some of the ways that i do it now

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.690 
of the some of the ways that i do it now
if<00:02:07.320> i'm<00:02:07.500> working<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> evening<00:02:08.399> then<00:02:08.580> i'll

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
if i'm working on the evening then i'll

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.729 
if i'm working on the evening then i'll
usually<00:02:08.879> just<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> solid<00:02:10.140> meal<00:02:10.289> after<00:02:10.649> i

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
usually just do a solid meal after i

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.200 
usually just do a solid meal after i
work<00:02:10.920> out

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
work out

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.240 
work out
and<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.440> will<00:02:12.530> usually<00:02:12.680> consist<00:02:13.160> of

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
and so that will usually consist of

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.090 
and so that will usually consist of
something<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.790> either<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:15.140> salmon<00:02:15.650> or<00:02:15.860> steak

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
something of either a salmon or steak

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.460 
something of either a salmon or steak
some<00:02:16.910> good<00:02:17.180> good<00:02:17.510> flash<00:02:17.780> product<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.290> good

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
some good good flash product a good

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.080 
some good good flash product a good
protein<00:02:18.800> source<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.340> has<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.730> high<00:02:20.030> quality

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
protein source that has a high quality

protein<00:02:20.600> complete<00:02:21.140> proteins<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.650> them<00:02:21.770> and

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
protein complete proteins in them and

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.160 
protein complete proteins in them and
then<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.430> course<00:02:22.490> some<00:02:23.270> kind<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.570> carbohydrate

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
then of course some kind of carbohydrate

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.200 
then of course some kind of carbohydrate
source<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.590> them<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:25.280> refuel<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.760> muscles<00:02:26.090> and

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
source to them to refuel the muscles and

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.480 
source to them to refuel the muscles and
I<00:02:26.330> usually<00:02:26.630> go<00:02:26.750> something<00:02:27.080> like<00:02:27.110> rice<00:02:27.490> white

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
I usually go something like rice white

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.780 
I usually go something like rice white
rice<00:02:28.520> or<00:02:28.940> white<00:02:29.510> potato<00:02:29.950> there<00:02:30.950> they're

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
rice or white potato there they're

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.340 
rice or white potato there they're
fairly<00:02:32.060> quick<00:02:32.360> on<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.600> system<00:02:32.930> easy<00:02:33.170> to

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
fairly quick on the system easy to

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.260 
fairly quick on the system easy to
digest<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:34.010> your<00:02:34.340> body<00:02:34.490> soaks<00:02:34.940> up<00:02:35.090> those

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
digest and your body soaks up those

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.240 
digest and your body soaks up those
carbs<00:02:35.660> after<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:36.020> workout<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:36.380> we'll<00:02:36.740> load

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
carbs after the workout and we'll load

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.620 
carbs after the workout and we'll load
those<00:02:37.520> sugars<00:02:37.880> into<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.210> muscles<00:02:38.510> as

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
those sugars into the muscles as

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.200 
those sugars into the muscles as
glycogen<00:02:38.810> so<00:02:39.620> that's<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.520> those<00:02:40.820> are<00:02:40.970> some<00:02:41.030> of

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
glycogen so that's the those are some of

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.450 
glycogen so that's the those are some of
the<00:02:41.270> best<00:02:41.450> ways<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.920> don't<00:02:42.980> cut<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.340> by

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
the best ways to to I don't cut it by

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.560 
the best ways to to I don't cut it by
the<00:02:43.520> way<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:43.670> don't<00:02:43.910> convolute<00:02:44.390> my

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
the way I don't convolute my

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.470 
the way I don't convolute my
post-workout<00:02:45.110> meal<00:02:45.620> with<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> lot<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.670> fat<00:02:46.940> it's

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
post-workout meal with a lot of fat it's

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.700 
post-workout meal with a lot of fat it's
not<00:02:47.570> a<00:02:47.630> good<00:02:47.810> idea<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:48.200> slows<00:02:48.470> down<00:02:48.500> and

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
not a good idea it slows down and

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.500 
not a good idea it slows down and
absorbs<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.160> slows<00:02:49.370> down<00:02:49.520> digestion<00:02:49.970> you

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
absorbs and slows down digestion you

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.000 
absorbs and slows down digestion you
need<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.750> put<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.020> fat<00:02:51.170> in<00:02:51.350> later<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:51.860> you

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
need to put the fat in later but you

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.250 
need to put the fat in later but you
certainly<00:02:52.550> need<00:02:52.790> in<00:02:52.970> your<00:02:53.060> day<00:02:53.240> but<00:02:53.870> I'm<00:02:54.080> right

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
certainly need in your day but I'm right

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.750 
certainly need in your day but I'm right
after<00:02:54.470> work<00:02:54.620> out<00:02:54.800> it's<00:02:55.220> really<00:02:55.430> not<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.730> best

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
after work out it's really not the best

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.870 
after work out it's really not the best
thing<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.480> be<00:02:56.960> put<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.380> so<00:02:57.890> hopefully<00:02:58.700> that

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
thing to be put in so hopefully that

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.390 
thing to be put in so hopefully that
answered<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.450> hope<00:03:00.350> that<00:03:00.380> your<00:03:00.800> question<00:03:01.130> and
