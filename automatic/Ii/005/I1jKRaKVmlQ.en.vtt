00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
world a big question is speed and

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.740 
world a big question is speed and
developing<00:00:24.590> speed<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:26.180> important<00:00:26.689> thing

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
developing speed and the important thing

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.730 
developing speed and the important thing
to<00:00:27.009> realize<00:00:28.009> is<00:00:28.579> that<00:00:28.820> it<00:00:29.689> really<00:00:30.259> doesn't

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
to realize is that it really doesn't

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.880 
to realize is that it really doesn't
take<00:00:30.800> that<00:00:30.949> long<00:00:31.160> to<00:00:31.730> get<00:00:32.050> fast<00:00:33.050> or<00:00:33.380> efficient

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
take that long to get fast or efficient

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.340 
take that long to get fast or efficient
at<00:00:34.070> any<00:00:34.280> technique<00:00:34.820> as<00:00:35.020> long<00:00:36.020> as<00:00:36.200> you're

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
at any technique as long as you're

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.870 
at any technique as long as you're
willing<00:00:36.500> to<00:00:36.620> put<00:00:36.710> in<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:36.950> little<00:00:37.340> bit<00:00:37.550> of<00:00:37.579> time

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
willing to put in a little bit of time

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.080 
willing to put in a little bit of time
and<00:00:38.559> most<00:00:39.559> importantly<00:00:39.770> take<00:00:40.640> your<00:00:40.879> time

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
and most importantly take your time

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.150 
and most importantly take your time
because<00:00:41.360> if<00:00:41.570> you<00:00:41.660> take<00:00:41.870> your<00:00:42.050> time<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:43.100> you

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
because if you take your time and you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.740 
because if you take your time and you
don't<00:00:43.340> rush<00:00:43.579> things<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:44.210> you<00:00:44.270> don't<00:00:44.480> try<00:00:44.719> and

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
don't rush things and you don't try and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.049 
don't rush things and you don't try and
jump<00:00:44.960> ahead<00:00:45.110> you<00:00:45.590> get<00:00:45.739> ahead<00:00:46.280> so<00:00:46.610> much<00:00:46.789> further

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
jump ahead you get ahead so much further

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.350 
jump ahead you get ahead so much further
that<00:00:47.239> way<00:00:47.800> so<00:00:48.800> I'm<00:00:49.760> going<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:50.000> show<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:50.150> an

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
constructed in a sense that it could

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.000 
constructed in a sense that it could
almost<00:00:57.920> be<00:00:58.130> like<00:00:58.250> a<00:00:58.550> passage<00:00:59.090> from<00:00:59.239> a<00:00:59.390> song<00:00:59.630> and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
can only start on a downstroke and

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.560 
can only start on a downstroke and
that's<00:01:50.780> totally<00:01:51.110> myth<00:01:51.500> because<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:52.570> personally

remember this is that when you get into

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.729 
remember this is that when you get into
constructing<00:02:17.480> like<00:02:17.630> your<00:02:17.810> own<00:02:17.930> exercises

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
constructing like your own exercises

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.460 
constructing like your own exercises
it's<00:02:19.310> very<00:02:19.670> important<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.239> keep<00:02:20.420> your<00:02:21.019> fingers

guessing most importantly to keep the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.030 
guessing most importantly to keep the
picking<00:02:25.310> hand<00:02:25.489> guessing<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.470> constantly

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
picking hand guessing so constantly

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.289 
picking hand guessing so constantly
tricking<00:02:28.489> it<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:28.850> is<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:28.970> good<00:02:29.150> one

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
tricking it and this is a good one

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.570 
tricking it and this is a good one
because<00:02:29.480> it's<00:02:30.350> kind<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.799> standard<00:02:31.250> like<00:02:31.430> with

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
because it's kind of standard like with

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.420 
because it's kind of standard like with
a<00:02:31.610> four<00:02:31.910> stroke<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:32.600> then<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.620> moves<00:02:33.890> up<00:02:34.100> you

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
a four stroke and then it moves up you

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.949 
a four stroke and then it moves up you
know<00:02:34.549> with<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.180> fretting<00:02:35.510> hand<00:02:35.540> there's

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
know with the the fretting hand there's

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.199 
know with the the fretting hand there's
a<00:02:36.049> bit<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.319> change<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:36.890> then<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.849> kind<00:02:38.120> of

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
a bit of a change and then it kind of

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.360 
a bit of a change and then it kind of
does<00:02:38.390> an<00:02:38.480> inverted<00:02:39.080> pattern<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.650> then

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
does an inverted pattern and then

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.400 
does an inverted pattern and then
there's<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.730> couple<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.209> big<00:02:41.360> jumps<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:42.140> then

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
there's a couple of big jumps and then

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.400 
there's a couple of big jumps and then
at<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.830> end<00:02:42.860> there's<00:02:43.400> like<00:02:44.019> it's<00:02:45.019> almost<00:02:45.200> like

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
at the end there's like it's almost like

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.460 
at the end there's like it's almost like
a<00:02:45.500> sweet<00:02:45.859> picking<00:02:46.870> even<00:02:47.870> though<00:02:48.019> it<00:02:48.290> doesn't

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
a sweet picking even though it doesn't

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.199 
a sweet picking even though it doesn't
really<00:02:48.739> sound<00:02:48.950> like<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.400> it's<00:02:49.549> just<00:02:49.640> common<00:02:49.910> up

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
really sound like it it's just common up

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.830 
really sound like it it's just common up
stroke<00:02:50.980> which<00:02:51.980> leads<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:53.120> do<00:02:53.299> strange

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
stroke which leads you to do strange

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.930 
stroke which leads you to do strange
skipping<00:02:54.290> at<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.590> end<00:02:54.739> which<00:02:55.310> is<00:02:55.459> also<00:02:55.790> very

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
skipping at the end which is also very

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.090 
skipping at the end which is also very
very<00:02:56.269> important<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.079> learn<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:57.709> hope<00:02:57.980> you
