expect to pay at a store for the same
fish<00:03:58.000> in<00:03:58.240> the<00:03:58.330> United<00:03:58.630> States<00:03:58.900> so<00:03:59.860> I<00:03:59.890> am<00:04:00.070> not

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
fish in the United States so I am not

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.430 
fish in the United States so I am not
convinced<00:04:00.880> that<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.120> hypothesis<00:04:01.900> that<00:04:02.140> all

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
convinced that the hypothesis that all

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.650 
convinced that the hypothesis that all
the<00:04:02.890> cool<00:04:03.100> fish<00:04:03.340> go<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:03.700> Europe<00:04:04.120> because<00:04:04.510> they

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
the cool fish go to Europe because they

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.980 
the cool fish go to Europe because they
will<00:04:04.780> pay<00:04:05.050> more<00:04:05.320> for<00:04:05.380> them<00:04:05.710> is<00:04:05.980> truly<00:04:06.520> accurate

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
will pay more for them is truly accurate

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.590 
will pay more for them is truly accurate
but<00:04:07.990> may<00:04:08.290> be<00:04:08.350> true<00:04:08.800> however<00:04:09.250> is<00:04:10.030> that<00:04:10.120> there<00:04:10.450> is
