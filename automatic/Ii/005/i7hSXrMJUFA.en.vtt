00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.750 
biceps triceps and shoulders all in one
shot<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.739> great<00:00:52.920> time<00:00:53.129> standing<00:00:53.430> movement

shot it's a great time standing movement
and<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.600> does<00:00:54.750> take<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> little<00:00:55.050> bit<00:00:55.199> of

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and it does take a little bit of

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.750 
and it does take a little bit of
coordination<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> first<00:00:56.489> time<00:00:56.640> you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
coordination so with the first time you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
do this one let's start with a light

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.860 
do this one let's start with a light
weight<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.680> go<00:00:59.039> very<00:00:59.309> very<00:00:59.399> slowly<00:00:59.870> alright

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
weight and go very very slowly alright

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.600 
weight and go very very slowly alright
so<00:01:01.020> here's<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> exercise<00:01:01.770> looks<00:01:01.980> like

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.480 

start<00:01:07.360> with<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.510> dumbbell<00:01:07.840> crow

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.999 

and<00:01:10.579> then<00:01:11.180> it's<00:01:11.360> up<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:11.570> around<00:01:11.920> into<00:01:12.920> the

shoulder<00:01:13.280> press<00:01:13.490> then<00:01:14.360> rotate<00:01:14.899> the<00:01:14.990> dumbbells

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
shoulder press then rotate the dumbbells

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.920 
shoulder press then rotate the dumbbells
I<00:01:18.580> like<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.640> bring<00:01:19.790> together<00:01:20.000> for<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:20.750> more

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
I like to bring together for the more

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.270 
I like to bring together for the more
stability<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.670> then<00:01:22.670> down<00:01:23.600> again<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.979> bottom

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
stability and then down again the bottom

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.859 
stability and then down again the bottom
of<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.399> currently<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.119> then<00:01:26.689> you'll<00:01:26.780> just

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
of the currently and then you'll just

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:52.080 
of the currently and then you'll just
repeat

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:18.970 

here's<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.210> side<00:01:53.420> view

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.339 

so<00:02:19.519> that<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:20.180> three-part<00:02:20.569> exercise<00:02:21.019> this

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
so that is the three-part exercise this

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.020 
so that is the three-part exercise this
is<00:02:21.440> an<00:02:21.530> excellent<00:02:21.769> one<00:02:22.010> if<00:02:22.610> you<00:02:22.730> want<00:02:22.909> to<00:02:22.970> hit

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
is an excellent one if you want to hit

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.270 
is an excellent one if you want to hit
the<00:02:23.180> smaller<00:02:23.420> muscles<00:02:23.780> all<00:02:24.080> in<00:02:24.200> one<00:02:24.349> shot<00:02:24.590> you

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
the smaller muscles all in one shot you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.949 
the smaller muscles all in one shot you
will<00:02:25.459> be<00:02:25.640> only<00:02:25.849> limited<00:02:26.269> by<00:02:26.299> the<00:02:26.450> amount<00:02:26.720> you

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
will be only limited by the amount you

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.720 
will be only limited by the amount you
can<00:02:27.080> lift<00:02:27.230> at<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.379> weakest<00:02:27.739> exercise<00:02:28.190> this

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
can lift at the weakest exercise this

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.979 
can lift at the weakest exercise this
could<00:02:28.909> be<00:02:28.940> any<00:02:29.180> one<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.510> three<00:02:29.629> exercises

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
could be any one of the three exercises

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.660 
could be any one of the three exercises
you<00:02:30.950> basically<00:02:31.190> just<00:02:31.280> going<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.549> have<00:02:31.640> to

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
you basically just going to have to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.250 
you basically just going to have to
gauge<00:02:31.909> that<00:02:32.180> as<00:02:32.510> you're<00:02:32.750> doing<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.959> movement

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
gauge that as you're doing a movement

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.400 
gauge that as you're doing a movement
see<00:02:34.010> which<00:02:34.159> one<00:02:34.340> fails<00:02:35.150> first<00:02:35.450> adjust<00:02:36.319> your

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
see which one fails first adjust your

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.710 
see which one fails first adjust your
weights<00:02:36.590> accordingly<00:02:36.980> so<00:02:37.299> makes<00:02:38.299> a<00:02:38.420> 3<00:02:38.629> and

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
weights accordingly so makes a 3 and

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.930 
weights accordingly so makes a 3 and
exercise<00:02:39.110> covering<00:02:39.410> biceps<00:02:39.739> triceps<00:02:40.489> and

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
exercise covering biceps triceps and

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.080 
exercise covering biceps triceps and
shoulders<00:02:41.000> it's<00:02:41.450> great<00:02:41.690> time<00:02:41.870> saver
