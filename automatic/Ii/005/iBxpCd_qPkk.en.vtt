00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.400
food ingredients

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.600
our food ingredients are here

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.820
first, cut the tomatoes into half

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.540
you don't have to skin the garlic completely

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.760
just the outer-shell

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.160
squash the garlic flat slightly

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.040
skin the potatoes

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.120
to dig the bud eyes

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.940
cut into bigger size

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.740
after washing the chicken, use tissue to make it dry

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.100
first, turn over them

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.600
add half salt, pepper and seasoning evenly

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.640
massage them A_A

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.900
and turn over them again, do what you just did again

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.120
put garlic and tomatoes around them

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.580
remember not to cover the chicken, then the chicken will be crispy

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.640
add olive oil

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.840
massage them again XD

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.380
then we can put them into oven &lt;3

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.200
put potatoes into hot water, put the lid on, turn to small fire and cook for 20 mins

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.000
turn off the fire after 20 mins, using fork or chopstick to check it's soft enough or not

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.180
add butter or milk and mash the potatoes

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.820
add less salt, pepper and seasoning and stir them evenly

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.740
when you finish making mashed potatoes, it's about to take the chicken out!

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.360
don't forget to add the meat sauce on the rice!

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.640
the garlic and tomatoes left, we can use them to fry with vegeatble!
