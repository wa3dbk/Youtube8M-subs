in<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.040> past<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.909> what<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.329> as<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> point

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
in the past and and what just as a point

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.749 
in the past and and what just as a point
of<00:02:00.869> clarification<00:02:01.020> when<00:02:01.740> video<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.460> talking

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
of clarification when video is talking

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.760 
of clarification when video is talking
about<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.939> full<00:02:03.149> face<00:02:03.439> facelift<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.560> past

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
about a full face facelift in the past

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.560 
about a full face facelift in the past
she<00:02:05.219> was<00:02:05.340> probably<00:02:05.520> talking<00:02:05.759> about<00:02:06.149> one<00:02:06.420> that

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
she was probably talking about one that

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.199 
she was probably talking about one that
extended<00:02:06.990> very<00:02:07.140> far<00:02:07.350> up<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.590> lift<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:08.250> my<00:02:08.789> my

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
extended very far up to lift but my my

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.059 
extended very far up to lift but my my
value<00:02:09.569> today<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:10.110> what<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.349> see<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
value today is what I see is that the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.710 
value today is what I see is that the
lower<00:02:11.310> face<00:02:11.640> neck<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.120> only<00:02:12.330> thing<00:02:12.569> that

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
lower face neck is the only thing that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.500 
lower face neck is the only thing that
has<00:02:12.870> any<00:02:13.080> merit

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
has any merit

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.000 
has any merit
terms<00:02:13.689> of<00:02:13.810> lifting<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.590> don't<00:02:14.709> want<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:14.890> put

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
terms of lifting you don't want to put

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.710 
terms of lifting you don't want to put
fat<00:02:15.189> in<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.400> neck<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:15.970> problem<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.569> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
fat in the neck but the problem is the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.710 
fat in the neck but the problem is the
upper<00:02:17.080> mid<00:02:17.349> face<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.829> just<00:02:17.980> way<00:02:18.280> way<00:02:19.239> over<00:02:19.269> lift

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
upper mid face is just way way over lift

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.539 
upper mid face is just way way over lift
it<00:02:19.930> looks<00:02:20.140> totally<00:02:20.500> unnatural<00:02:20.799> now<00:02:21.159> obviously

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
it looks totally unnatural now obviously

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.610 
it looks totally unnatural now obviously
she's<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:21.790> day<00:02:22.030> out<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.450> that's<00:02:22.900> normal<00:02:23.379> let<00:02:23.560> me

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
she's a day out and that's normal let me

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.319 
she's a day out and that's normal let me
just<00:02:23.799> briefly<00:02:23.980> talk<00:02:24.790> about<00:02:24.819> what<00:02:25.209> I've<00:02:25.299> done

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
just briefly talk about what I've done

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:26.940 
just briefly talk about what I've done
for<00:02:25.540> her<00:02:25.840> for<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.110> lower<00:02:26.290> face<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.799> make<00:02:26.890> a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
for her for the lower face to make a

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.069 
for her for the lower face to make a
comparison<00:02:27.400> from<00:02:28.180> what<00:02:28.390> she's<00:02:28.540> had<00:02:28.750> done<00:02:28.959> in

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
comparison from what she's had done in

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.589 
comparison from what she's had done in
the<00:02:29.170> past<00:02:29.610> basically<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:31.030> difference<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.480> in

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
the past basically the difference is in

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.350 
the past basically the difference is in
the<00:02:31.629> past<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.709> face<00:02:33.129> of<00:02:33.159> was<00:02:33.459> pulled<00:02:33.730> back<00:02:34.000> and

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
the past the face of was pulled back and

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.300 
the past the face of was pulled back and
that<00:02:34.810> can<00:02:34.989> lead<00:02:35.019> to<00:02:35.379> a<00:02:35.409> windswept<00:02:35.769> look<00:02:36.129> she

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
that can lead to a windswept look she

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.309 
that can lead to a windswept look she
didn't<00:02:36.519> have<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:36.909> fortunately<00:02:37.510> but<00:02:38.110> what<00:02:38.290> I

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
didn't have that fortunately but what I

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.229 
didn't have that fortunately but what I
did<00:02:38.530> for<00:02:38.680> her<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.040> vertical<00:02:39.370> lift<00:02:39.849> to

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
did for her is a vertical lift to

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.229 
did for her is a vertical lift to
actually<00:02:40.690> match<00:02:41.590> out<00:02:41.920> what<00:02:42.640> happens<00:02:43.090> with

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
actually match out what happens with

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.220 
actually match out what happens with
aging<00:02:43.510> because<00:02:43.569> if<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.840> think<00:02:43.870> about<00:02:44.079> it

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
aging because if you think about it

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.349 
aging because if you think about it
gravity<00:02:44.620> comes<00:02:44.799> down<00:02:45.099> so<00:02:45.730> this<00:02:45.879> is<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> vertical

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
gravity comes down so this is a vertical

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.330 
gravity comes down so this is a vertical
suspension<00:02:46.780> lift<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.500> instead<00:02:47.799> of<00:02:47.920> tacking

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
suspension lift and instead of tacking

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.030 
suspension lift and instead of tacking
muscle<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.940> muscle<00:02:49.150> which<00:02:50.049> can<00:02:50.319> loosen<00:02:50.950> over

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
muscle to muscle which can loosen over

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.119 
muscle to muscle which can loosen over
time<00:02:51.220> this<00:02:51.849> very<00:02:52.269> tight<00:02:52.629> lift<00:02:53.049> is<00:02:53.379> suspended

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
time this very tight lift is suspended

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.589 
time this very tight lift is suspended
to<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.310> little<00:02:54.519> bit<00:02:54.609> of<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.760> bone<00:02:55.030> the

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
to the little bit of the bone the

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.629 
to the little bit of the bone the
zygomatic<00:02:56.079> arch<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.470> way<00:02:56.680> outside<00:02:56.889> right<00:02:57.489> near

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
zygomatic arch is way outside right near

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.879 
zygomatic arch is way outside right near
the<00:02:57.760> ear<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.239> there's<00:02:59.109> a<00:02:59.200> so<00:02:59.560> minimal

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
the ear and there's a so minimal

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.129 
the ear and there's a so minimal
incision<00:03:00.370> this<00:03:01.209> is<00:03:01.329> probably<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.659> third<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:02.019> the

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
incision this is probably a third of the

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.479 
incision this is probably a third of the
length<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.440> what<00:03:02.620> her<00:03:02.709> previous<00:03:03.040> incision<00:03:03.400> was

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
length of what her previous incision was

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.220 
length of what her previous incision was
just<00:03:03.879> around<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.209> ear<00:03:04.359> there's<00:03:04.870> still<00:03:05.019> a<00:03:05.079> bit

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
just around the ear there's still a bit

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.720 
just around the ear there's still a bit
bunching<00:03:05.709> we<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.010> turn<00:03:06.159> over<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.459> this<00:03:06.579> way

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
bunching we to turn over to this way

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.599 
bunching we to turn over to this way
look<00:03:07.180> over<00:03:07.389> to<00:03:07.510> your<00:03:07.540> left<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:08.799> you<00:03:09.250> can<00:03:09.430> see

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
look over to your left and you can see

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.339 
look over to your left and you can see
turtle<00:03:09.909> bit<00:03:10.000> more<00:03:10.150> for<00:03:10.329> me<00:03:10.420> there's<00:03:11.049> a<00:03:11.139> little

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
turtle bit more for me there's a little

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.780 
turtle bit more for me there's a little
bit<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.530> bunching<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:12.010> can<00:03:12.129> sink<00:03:12.400> turn<00:03:12.670> back

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
bit of bunching you can sink turn back

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.759 
bit of bunching you can sink turn back
over<00:03:13.030> this<00:03:13.150> way<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:13.599> way<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:14.319> can<00:03:14.470> see<00:03:14.620> that

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
over this way this way you can see that

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.379 
over this way this way you can see that
bunching<00:03:15.190> around<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.549> ear<00:03:15.760> that's<00:03:15.970> totally

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
bunching around the ear that's totally

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.970 
bunching around the ear that's totally
normal<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.690> will<00:03:16.930> settle<00:03:17.170> out<00:03:17.379> in<00:03:17.530> about<00:03:17.620> one

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
normal that will settle out in about one

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.559 
normal that will settle out in about one
to<00:03:18.069> two<00:03:18.129> weeks<00:03:18.280> usually<00:03:18.699> it<00:03:18.940> takes<00:03:19.060> about<00:03:19.269> two

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
to two weeks usually it takes about two

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.530 
to two weeks usually it takes about two
weeks<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:19.840> get<00:03:20.019> there<00:03:20.260> hi<00:03:21.010> I'm<00:03:21.519> seven<00:03:22.060> days<00:03:22.239> out

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
weeks to get there hi I'm seven days out

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.520 
weeks to get there hi I'm seven days out
from<00:03:22.810> surgery<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.650> I'm<00:03:24.370> feeling<00:03:24.400> really<00:03:24.910> good

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
from surgery and I'm feeling really good

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.319 
from surgery and I'm feeling really good
the<00:03:26.530> first<00:03:26.799> three<00:03:27.069> days<00:03:27.280> I<00:03:27.609> was<00:03:27.910> feeling

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
the first three days I was feeling
