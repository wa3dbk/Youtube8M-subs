00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.790
 and ending the topic of sprites I will say 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.250
 a little bit autumn bit something like that 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.990
 first I will first say about the animation if 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.860
 want to create an animation image then 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.320
 you need 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.090
 but now I'll show you the required 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.460
 create image 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.650
 Here is such a one in which 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.920
 a certain size roll here from 232 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.230
 repeating for a number of times 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.759
 strictly left to right 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.750
 then when saving your file 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.380
 png format 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.180
 you put your file name after 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.700
 underscore and required 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.640
 write a strip and after this amount 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.399
 frame 5 here lights i.e. it turns out 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.910
 5 frames 32 by 32 by 32 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.120
 5 squares is today one file 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.949
 picture to do gimmik whether you 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.699
 stand underscore and purchase 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.149
 35 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.979
 well, or either not 5 or 25 whatever you want 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.790
 number of frames here 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.960
 see 8 here 8 also here 7 number 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.720
 codes that is, do not forget 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.810
 the only way you can create an animation 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:19.470
 well and now directly to with them there 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:24.210
 let's create what sprite to create 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.600
 sprite sprite test click 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.960
 edit the file and these two buttons 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.750
 create is-3 by add a strip of these 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.600
 creation replaces everything here with what you 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.329
 create suppose i want to take here 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.950
 a gear and their games well, as it were, 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.869
 This is not my and uploaded image 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.079
 Internet , we have a window here 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:51.299
 image strip what's the salt in that 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.520
 you can not only be here this 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.640
 from left to right you can have animation 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.590
 big picture with me and big in it 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.840
 picture in which there is from left to right 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.800
 then another pile down 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.690
 of images 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.790
 so here you want to slice the animation out 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.560
 of these same images so here it is with 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.650
 using strips you can do it 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.310
 that is, you take download there let's 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.820
 strip 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.970
 or create an is-3 anyway and here it is 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.830
 you open your image here 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.840
 learn to prepare everything in advance 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.000
 these are all lines around the edges to make pictures 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.010
 and you have this image from 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.680
 this grid let's all here on zero 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.170
 bear will tell this grid 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.020
 actually there is an image on 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.080
 which will cut your picture 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:41.160
 number of images from 1 module without 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:46.200
 we become from 1 2 he goes to the right three more 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.700
 right 4 still right here's an image in 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.510
 line that is, how many image 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.530
 can store . 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.590
 if we put 5 then he and then 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.220
 put only 5 no 4 give when we are here 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:03.570
 write 4 to 5 the image will go down 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.830
 so here is the width of the image height 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.260
 images accordingly can 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.820
 point there 16 suggested 16 will be us 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.910
 into smaller pieces will cut 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.790
 loves islanders 2 whatever you want 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.340
 horizontal offset and just 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.100
 offsets 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.050
 grid offsets horizontal by 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.970
 pixels that is you can also offset 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.350
 grid but it will already be pixel 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.370
 neatly here you can align 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:32.640
 center we put it 10 ok I will 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.910
 I think and you can, for example , vertically 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.680
 example 120 is not too 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:43.260
 50 well 60 that's exactly in the center 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.810
 Knight must here gray gray mesh not 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.520
 you can see how it is displayed 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.620
 gas mental separation can 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.470
 put the output excel then you see 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.810
 afraid of such a gap when you 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.090
 finished aligning your mesh by 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.370
 image, press ok and get 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.190
 individual images 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.140
 Well, and writes and spinning I mean 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.040
 you can create a whole big so 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.569
 file and create a lot of it 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.970
 images and just one of them then 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.180
 cut the pieces we need very 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:21.560
 convenient system is called she add 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:23.790
 clip or create a strip so let's 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.910
 let's set the remaining images for our 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.900
 first game that he needs an apple 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.900
 banana bomb 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.720
 cherries and strawberries will create a network of 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:43.199
 this standard material sprite games 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:45.780
 bombs load sprite bombs are here 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.160
 ready to eat can say for example 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.130
 folder let's create a folder for the sake of 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.130
 interest and call it an example of the functions and 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:01.820
 here you can say already sprite apple 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.820
 download sprite apple 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:12.599
 create it because you are in a panic 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:18.020
 windows sprite banana also load and 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:18.020
 we still have 2 2 fruits 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:27.630
 so load what century name will call 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.310
 blueberry in general I forgot how 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:34.169
 called cherries cherries 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:39.449
 and last we load the sprite 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:45.090
 strawberries i can't write right i don't 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:48.620
 I remember how it is spelled and load and 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.620
 same sprite 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:57.669
 caught and what will have to search but 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:59.590
 it looked like it was all loaded but 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.909
 principle on this you can finish in 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.180
 the next lesson is that there further 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:08.680
 make me create objects oh this is still 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.930
 that topic is big on this 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.000
 this lesson learned to create 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.830
 strip images and animations as well 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.520
 told you how to create an animation 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.830
 In general, that is, put the bottom underline 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.259
 strip the number of frames and learned 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.800
 even create folders can go to 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.800
 the next lesson
