these the light switch you can't use a
momentary<00:00:36.300> push<00:00:36.570> button<00:00:36.899> I'll<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.290> use<00:00:37.410> a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
momentary push button I'll just use a

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.660 
momentary push button I'll just use a
light<00:00:37.590> switch<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:37.980> bigger<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.550> gets

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
light switch it's bigger and it gets

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.459 
light switch it's bigger and it gets
easier<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:40.379> yeah<00:00:41.540> so<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.809> first<00:00:43.260> thing<00:00:43.379> you're

strip<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.090> back<00:01:24.299> about<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:26.000> so<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.060> can

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
strip it back about like that so you can

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.940 
strip it back about like that so you can
see<00:01:27.270> my<00:01:27.390> green<00:01:27.630> ones<00:01:27.780> broke<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.200> off<00:01:28.320> it's

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
see my green ones broke it off it's

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.359 
see my green ones broke it off it's
because<00:01:29.340> um<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.939> cut<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.900> accident<00:01:31.369> please

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
because um I cut it on accident please

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.010 
because um I cut it on accident please
do<00:01:32.579> not<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.390> want<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.659> work<00:01:33.810> right

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
do not do this if you want to work right

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.300 
do not do this if you want to work right
it'll<00:01:34.409> still<00:01:34.650> work<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.950> put<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.189> back

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it'll still work if you put it back

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.520 
it'll still work if you put it back
together<00:01:35.509> but<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.540> don't<00:01:36.780> make<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.079> recommend

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
together but I don't make it I recommend

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.600 
together but I don't make it I recommend
soldering<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.920> back<00:01:38.040> together<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.520> make

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
soldering you back together and make

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.710 
soldering you back together and make
sure<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> same<00:01:39.180> colors<00:01:39.509> together

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
sure you get the same colors together

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.929 
sure you get the same colors together
this<00:01:40.680> one<00:01:40.860> doesn't<00:01:41.009> matter<00:01:41.280> because<00:01:41.700> it's

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
this one doesn't matter because it's

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.550 
this one doesn't matter because it's
just<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.210> demo<00:01:42.390> anyways<00:01:42.840> I'm<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.380> going<00:01:43.500> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
just for demo anyways I'm not going to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.780 
just for demo anyways I'm not going to
use<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.799> one<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.159> did<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.520> show<00:01:44.610> you

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
use this one I just did it to show you

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.120 
use this one I just did it to show you
how<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.970> do<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.799> then<00:01:46.799> you're<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
how to do it and then you're going to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.980 
how to do it and then you're going to
find<00:01:47.340> your<00:01:47.490> orange<00:01:47.880> wire<00:01:48.090> your<00:01:48.390> solid<00:01:48.720> orange

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
solid orange see I'm going to cut it

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.999 
solid orange see I'm going to cut it
into<00:01:56.340> into<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.939> half<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.409> trip<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.799> about

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
into into in half do this trip it about

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.920 
into into in half do this trip it about
an<00:01:59.100> inch<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.610> then<00:02:00.570> you're<00:02:00.689> going<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.840> take

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
an inch and then you're going to take

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.149 
an inch and then you're going to take
your<00:02:01.049> light<00:02:01.259> switch<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.770> you're<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.100> to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
your light switch and you're going to

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.350 
your light switch and you're going to
loosen<00:02:02.490> up<00:02:02.640> these<00:02:03.420> right<00:02:03.659> here<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:04.649> little<00:02:04.920> bit

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
loosen up these right here a little bit

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.809 
loosen up these right here a little bit
until<00:02:06.360> they<00:02:06.750> are<00:02:07.459> until<00:02:08.459> they<00:02:08.580> were<00:02:08.640> big

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
until they are until they were big

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.309 
until they are until they were big
enough<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.060> put<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> wires<00:02:09.450> under<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.020> then

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
enough to put the wires under and then

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.180 
enough to put the wires under and then
you're<00:02:10.410> going<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.560> route<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.739> wires<00:02:11.009> around

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you're going to route the wires around

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.950 
you're going to route the wires around
it<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.520> tighten<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
it and tighten it

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.910 
it and tighten it
doesn't<00:02:12.960> matter<00:02:13.050> which<00:02:13.260> one<00:02:13.290> goes<00:02:13.500> where<00:02:13.560> just

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
doesn't matter which one goes where just

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.980 
doesn't matter which one goes where just
put<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.310> two<00:02:14.430> orange<00:02:14.670> ones<00:02:14.820> on<00:02:14.940> here<00:02:15.150> one<00:02:15.750> per

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
put the two orange ones on here one per

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.230 
put the two orange ones on here one per
thing<00:02:16.370> now<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.430> want<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.700> get<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.940> switch

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
thing now you want to get the switch

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.750 
thing now you want to get the switch
with<00:02:18.420> two<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.990> these<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.560> then<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.460> might<00:02:20.580> have

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
with two of these and then it might have

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.370 
with two of these and then it might have
three<00:02:21.000> has<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.360> ground<00:02:21.600> like<00:02:21.810> line<00:02:21.990> when<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.290> was

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
three has a ground like line when I was

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.960 
three has a ground like line when I was
the<00:02:22.440> ground<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:23.280> time<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.640> ground<00:02:23.820> all<00:02:23.940> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
the ground just time the ground all the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.090 
the ground just time the ground all the
way<00:02:24.060> down<00:02:24.240> doesn't<00:02:24.600> matter<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.920> make<00:02:26.070> sure

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
way down doesn't matter just make sure

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.190 
way down doesn't matter just make sure
that<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.550> otherwise<00:02:26.910> other<00:02:27.510> ones<00:02:27.660> will<00:02:28.050> not

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
that is to otherwise other ones will not

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.930 
that is to otherwise other ones will not
work<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:29.070> you're<00:02:29.190> going<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.340> tie<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.580> down<00:02:29.760> all

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
work so you're going to tie it down all

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.780 
work so you're going to tie it down all
the<00:02:29.970> way<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:31.140> then<00:02:31.410> that's<00:02:31.980> your<00:02:32.100> circuit

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the way and then that's your circuit

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.970 
the way and then that's your circuit
when<00:02:33.210> you<00:02:33.270> want<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.510> lag<00:02:33.770> you're<00:02:34.770> going<00:02:34.920> to
