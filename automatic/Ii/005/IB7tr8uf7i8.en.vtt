00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.850 
there she goes now we're flying it's
actually<00:02:27.840> making<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.200> pretty<00:02:28.379> nice<00:02:28.620> little

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
actually making a pretty nice little

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.949 
actually making a pretty nice little
left-hand<00:02:29.370> circle<00:02:29.879> here<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.629> I<00:02:30.659> think<00:02:30.750> I'll

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
left-hand circle here so I think I'll

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.170 
left-hand circle here so I think I'll
leave<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.230> like<00:02:31.379> that

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
leave it like that

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.130 
leave it like that
I'll<00:02:33.180> go<00:02:33.360> right<00:02:34.909> it's<00:02:35.909> got<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.060> lot<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.450> elevator

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
I'll go right it's got a lot of elevator

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:59.270 
I'll go right it's got a lot of elevator
which<00:02:37.409> is<00:02:37.560> cool

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:22.920 

let's<00:02:59.670> see<00:02:59.820> if<00:02:59.880> your<00:03:00.120> Luke<00:03:00.390> oh<00:03:02.030> yeah

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:40.589 

very<00:03:23.530> stable<00:03:24.340> pretty<00:03:24.819> good<00:03:25.120> flying<00:03:25.420> playing

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.860 

hey<00:03:41.170> having<00:03:42.069> so<00:03:42.249> much<00:03:42.400> rudder<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:42.999> just<00:03:43.180> turns

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
hey having so much rudder it just turns

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.410 
hey having so much rudder it just turns
on<00:03:44.079> a<00:03:44.140> dime<00:03:44.469> when<00:03:44.499> you<00:03:44.889> Bank<00:03:45.219> and<00:03:45.519> yank<00:03:46.209> on<00:03:46.389> it

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
on a dime when you Bank and yank on it

00:03:46.420 --> 00:04:04.990 
on a dime when you Bank and yank on it
look<00:03:46.659> at<00:03:46.689> that<00:03:46.780> flips<00:03:47.139> right<00:03:47.260> around

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:17.849 

look<00:04:06.000> at<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:07.190> it<00:04:08.190> loops<00:04:08.550> very<00:04:08.760> very<00:04:09.330> easily

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.070 

let's<00:04:18.519> try<00:04:18.669> to<00:04:18.729> get<00:04:18.909> a<00:04:18.940> low<00:04:19.180> pass<00:04:19.449> here<00:04:22.080> that

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
let's try to get a low pass here that

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.219 
let's try to get a low pass here that
was<00:04:23.229> low<00:04:23.409> enough<00:04:23.440> right<00:04:25.889> well<00:04:27.900> there<00:04:28.900> it<00:04:29.020> was

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
was low enough right well there it was

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.770 
was low enough right well there it was
anyhow
