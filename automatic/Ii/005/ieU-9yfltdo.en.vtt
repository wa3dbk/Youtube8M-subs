screwdriver and to start a wristband
which<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.230> connect<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.789> some<00:00:38.789> sort

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:38.999 
which you have to connect to some sort

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:41.270 
which you have to connect to some sort
of<00:00:39.089> point<00:00:39.390> where<00:00:39.929> you<00:00:40.140> could<00:00:40.379> reduce<00:00:41.010> your

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
of point where you could reduce your

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.669 
of point where you could reduce your
static<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.659> remove<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.199> screws<00:00:43.499> from

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:43.679 
static have to remove the screws from

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.169 
static have to remove the screws from
the<00:00:43.769> side<00:00:44.069> of<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.309> panel<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:44.940> my<00:00:45.120> case

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:45.179 
the side of the panel now in my case

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.899 
the side of the panel now in my case
it's<00:00:45.569> an<00:00:45.719> inverted<00:00:46.170> computer<00:00:47.010> case<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.819> a

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
it's an inverted computer case it's a

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.639 
it's an inverted computer case it's a
tangent<00:00:48.420> T<00:00:48.659> jo8<00:00:49.440> II<00:00:49.800> from<00:00:50.699> silverstone<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:52.049> I'm

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
tangent T jo8 II from silverstone so I'm

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.709 
tangent T jo8 II from silverstone so I'm
going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.100> removing<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.210> right<00:00:54.420> panel

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
going to be removing the right panel

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.599 
going to be removing the right panel
you're<00:00:55.139> going<00:00:55.319> to<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.499> removing<00:00:55.859> the<00:00:56.159> panel

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
you're going to be removing the panel

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:58.789 
you're going to be removing the panel
from<00:00:56.819> the<00:00:56.969> other<00:00:57.120> side<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.629> obviously<00:00:58.199> you

from the other side and obviously you

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:04.100 
from the other side and obviously you
need<00:00:58.979> a<00:00:59.299> GPU<00:01:00.769> so<00:01:01.769> let's<00:01:02.339> get<00:01:02.489> started<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.149> now

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
need a GPU so let's get started so now

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.350 
need a GPU so let's get started so now
that<00:01:04.170> everything<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.799> ready<00:01:05.149> just<00:01:06.149> going<00:01:06.299> to

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
internals of the case now um I had a GPU

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.510 
internals of the case now um I had a GPU
before<00:01:18.149> so<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> already<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.469> 2<00:01:19.950> 6<00:01:20.280> pin

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520

that already ready because as I said I
had<00:01:46.289> a<00:01:46.320> GP<00:01:46.679> installed<00:01:47.039> before<00:01:47.249> so<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.759> simply

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
had a GP installed before so I simply

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.300 
had a GP installed before so I simply
just<00:01:48.090> remove<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> GPU<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.619> cabling<00:01:50.039> ready

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
just remove the GPU the cabling ready

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.160 
just remove the GPU the cabling ready
everything<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.939> ready<00:01:51.210> now<00:01:51.810> these<00:01:51.929> particular

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
latches lock on on the card when the

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.690 
latches lock on on the card when the
card<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.469> installed<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.159> when<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.549> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
card is installed and when you have to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.789 
card is installed and when you have to
remove<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.179> have<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.539> push<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.619> down

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
you having trouble removing your card

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.139 
you having trouble removing your card
chances<00:02:03.149> are<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.509> -<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.049> also<00:02:05.030> there<00:02:06.030> are

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
chances are it's - and also there are

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.810 
chances are it's - and also there are
two<00:02:06.420> screws<00:02:06.810> here<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.829> should<00:02:07.859> should

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
two screws here that you should should

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.960 
two screws here that you should should
secure<00:02:09.150> your<00:02:09.390> card<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:10.020> all<00:02:10.340> right<00:02:11.340> now<00:02:11.850> in

my<00:02:12.120> particular<00:02:12.330> case<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:13.020> also<00:02:13.230> have

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
my particular case I also have

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.970 
my particular case I also have
and<00:02:14.310> bracket<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.240> side<00:02:15.830> guarding<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
and bracket on the side guarding the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.180 
and bracket on the side guarding the
whole<00:02:17.190> setup<00:02:17.520> so<00:02:17.820> I'll<00:02:17.880> need<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.150> remove<00:02:18.240> that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
whole setup so I'll need to remove that

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.280 
whole setup so I'll need to remove that
okay<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.730> now<00:02:21.240> definitely<00:02:21.810> everything<00:02:22.050> is

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
okay so now definitely everything is

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.380 
okay so now definitely everything is
ready<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.800> take<00:02:23.070> your<00:02:23.280> card<00:02:23.520> by<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:23.970> sides

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
ready you take your card by the sides

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.630 
ready you take your card by the sides
try<00:02:25.020> not<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.470> touch<00:02:25.980> any<00:02:26.250> ROM<00:02:26.460> modules

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
try not to touch any ROM modules

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.270 
try not to touch any ROM modules
anything<00:02:27.210> like<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.420> now<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.740> my<00:02:29.040> particular

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
anything like that now in my particular

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.170 
anything like that now in my particular
case<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:30.290> have<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.800> thingy<00:02:32.100> on<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.430> PCI

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
case I have this thingy on the PCI

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.860 
case I have this thingy on the PCI
Express<00:02:37.310> connector<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.790> definitely<00:02:39.480> remove

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
Express connector so definitely remove

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.110 
Express connector so definitely remove
that<00:02:40.140> don't<00:02:40.950> try<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.280> rolling<00:02:41.580> with<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.910> and

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
that don't try and rolling with it and

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.570 
that don't try and rolling with it and
you<00:02:43.020> just<00:02:43.050> lower<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.680> whole<00:02:43.860> thing<00:02:44.100> in<00:02:44.310> your

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
you just lower the whole thing in your

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.070 
you just lower the whole thing in your
case<00:02:45.140> now<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.410> have<00:02:46.620> very<00:02:47.070> little<00:02:47.370> space<00:02:47.930> in<00:02:48.930> my

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
case now I have very little space in my

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.170 
case now I have very little space in my
computer<00:02:49.410> case<00:02:49.740> at<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.070> moment<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:53.850> basically

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
computer case at the moment so basically

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.810 
computer case at the moment so basically
that's<00:02:54.390> how<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.780> would<00:02:54.900> sit<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:56.340> finish<00:02:56.670> it

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
that's how it would sit and to finish it

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.250 
that's how it would sit and to finish it
off<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.320> simply<00:02:58.730> push<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.940> gently<00:03:00.120> now<00:03:00.990> make

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
off you simply push it gently now make

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.050 
off you simply push it gently now make
sure<00:03:01.290> it's<00:03:01.620> aligned<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.130> can<00:03:02.310> see<00:03:02.520> from<00:03:02.760> here

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
sure it's aligned I can see from here

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.570 
sure it's aligned I can see from here
that<00:03:03.270> it's<00:03:03.390> aligned<00:03:03.720> with<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.520> PCI<00:03:05.520> Express

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
that it's aligned with the PCI Express

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.920 
that it's aligned with the PCI Express
slot<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:08.250> push<00:03:08.490> it<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.790> there<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:09.690> slight

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
slot and you push it in there is slight

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.200 
slot and you push it in there is slight
noise<00:03:10.230> but<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.190> there's<00:03:11.430> not<00:03:11.580> much<00:03:11.820> resistance

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
noise but it there's not much resistance

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.970 
noise but it there's not much resistance
it<00:03:12.660> should<00:03:12.870> definitely<00:03:13.230> go<00:03:13.320> in<00:03:13.470> without<00:03:13.710> any

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
it should definitely go in without any

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.690 
it should definitely go in without any
problem<00:03:14.460> and<00:03:14.690> here<00:03:15.690> my<00:03:16.070> PCI<00:03:17.070> Express

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
problem and here my PCI Express

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.080 
problem and here my PCI Express
connectors<00:03:18.420> I'm<00:03:18.900> going<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.110> plug<00:03:19.350> them<00:03:19.560> in<00:03:20.090> now

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
connectors I'm going to plug them in now

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.690 
connectors I'm going to plug them in now
there<00:03:21.450> we<00:03:21.600> are<00:03:21.980> because<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.100> actually<00:03:23.370> actually

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
there we are because I actually actually

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.470 
there we are because I actually actually
do<00:03:24.330> have<00:03:25.040> these<00:03:26.040> two<00:03:26.340> connectors<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:27.090> simply

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
do have these two connectors I simply

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.080 
do have these two connectors I simply
put<00:03:27.660> in<00:03:27.780> two<00:03:28.050> 6-pin<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.800> didn't<00:03:29.070> go<00:03:29.160> with<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.340> 1/8

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
put in two 6-pin I didn't go with a 1/8

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.140 
put in two 6-pin I didn't go with a 1/8
pin<00:03:30.480> which<00:03:31.140> should<00:03:31.770> be<00:03:31.920> possible<00:03:32.550> because

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
pin which should be possible because

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.910 
pin which should be possible because
that's<00:03:33.540> all<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.140> energy<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.440> need<00:03:34.530> and

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
that's all the energy you need and

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.070 
that's all the energy you need and
obviously<00:03:35.610> make<00:03:35.880> sure<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.239> secure<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.810> two

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
obviously make sure you secure the two

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.210 
obviously make sure you secure the two
screws<00:03:37.470> on<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:38.760> back<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.989> hold<00:03:40.170> your<00:03:40.470> card<00:03:40.770> in

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
screws on the back to hold your card in

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.199 
screws on the back to hold your card in
place<00:03:43.190> now<00:03:44.190> base<00:03:44.340> for<00:03:44.550> some<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:45.000> this

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
place now base for some of you this

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.620 
place now base for some of you this
particular<00:03:45.890> case<00:03:46.910> inverted<00:03:47.910> case<00:03:48.150> could<00:03:48.480> be<00:03:48.600> a

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
particular case inverted case could be a

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.940 
particular case inverted case could be a
bit<00:03:48.840> confusing<00:03:49.970> however<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.500> don't<00:03:52.500> be<00:03:52.680> thrown

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
bit confusing however I don't be thrown

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.090 
bit confusing however I don't be thrown
off<00:03:53.100> by<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.730> because<00:03:54.620> basically<00:03:55.620> in<00:03:56.040> your

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
off by that because basically in your

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.000 
off by that because basically in your
setup<00:03:56.550> it<00:03:57.180> just<00:03:57.480> going<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.630> be<00:03:57.769> card<00:03:58.769> going<00:03:58.920> to

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
setup it just going to be card going to

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.590 
setup it just going to be card going to
be<00:03:59.100> lying<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.550> different<00:03:59.970> way<00:04:00.180> but<00:04:00.480> it's

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
be lying the different way but it's

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.420 
be lying the different way but it's
still<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:01.170> installation<00:04:01.769> process<00:04:02.010> is

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
still the installation process is

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.020 
still the installation process is
exactly<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:03.120> same<00:04:04.280> so<00:04:05.280> that's<00:04:05.430> about<00:04:05.580> it<00:04:05.850> so

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
exactly the same so that's about it so

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.030 
exactly the same so that's about it so
I'm<00:04:06.120> just<00:04:06.150> going<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.510> finish<00:04:07.170> off<00:04:07.500> putting<00:04:07.920> in

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
I'm just going to finish off putting in

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.199 
I'm just going to finish off putting in
the<00:04:08.160> screws<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.580> everything<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:08.970> I'm<00:04:09.090> going

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
that's basically it that's the whole

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.590 
that's basically it that's the whole
setup<00:04:15.600> install<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.769> GPU<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.370> in<00:04:17.580> now<00:04:18.150> as<00:04:18.390> you

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
setup install the GPU is in now as you

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.170 
setup install the GPU is in now as you
see<00:04:18.870> here<00:04:19.440> I've<00:04:19.620> actually<00:04:19.950> placed<00:04:20.430> additional

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
see here I've actually placed additional

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
see here I've actually placed additional
rubber<00:04:21.570> thingy<00:04:21.959> on<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.500> top<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.919> the

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
rubber thingy on the top of the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.690 
rubber thingy on the top of the
basically<00:04:25.200> bracket<00:04:25.770> now<00:04:25.919> what<00:04:26.130> this<00:04:26.280> bracket

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
basically bracket now what this bracket

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.340 
basically bracket now what this bracket
does<00:04:26.910> is

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
does is

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.370 
does is
it<00:04:27.500> holds<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:28.160> left<00:04:29.150> side<00:04:29.420> in<00:04:29.660> my<00:04:29.780> case<00:04:30.020> of<00:04:30.230> the

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
it holds the left side in my case of the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.310 
it holds the left side in my case of the
GPU<00:04:30.800> so<00:04:31.610> when<00:04:32.060> you're<00:04:32.210> carrying<00:04:32.420> the<00:04:32.780> case<00:04:32.990> or

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
GPU so when you're carrying the case or

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.770 
GPU so when you're carrying the case or
moving<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.830> case<00:04:34.040> so<00:04:34.340> even<00:04:34.670> in<00:04:34.970> general<00:04:35.390> it

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
moving the case so even in general it

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.840 
moving the case so even in general it
actually<00:04:36.110> doesn't<00:04:36.350> allow<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:36.710> GPU<00:04:37.280> to<00:04:37.340> go

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
actually doesn't allow the GPU to go

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.960 
actually doesn't allow the GPU to go
down<00:04:38.150> and<00:04:38.510> apply<00:04:39.380> pressure<00:04:39.680> onto<00:04:40.040> PCI<00:04:40.580> Express

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
down and apply pressure onto PCI Express

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.110 
down and apply pressure onto PCI Express
slot<00:04:41.360> same<00:04:42.080> goes<00:04:42.320> for<00:04:42.350> the<00:04:42.650> CPU<00:04:43.100> a<00:04:43.190> cooler<00:04:43.910> as

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
slot same goes for the CPU a cooler as

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.790 
slot same goes for the CPU a cooler as
you<00:04:44.150> see<00:04:44.450> there<00:04:44.630> is<00:04:44.660> a<00:04:44.780> bracket<00:04:45.080> that<00:04:45.440> could<00:04:45.650> be

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
you see there is a bracket that could be

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.680 
you see there is a bracket that could be
adjusted<00:04:46.250> in<00:04:46.370> height<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:46.940> that<00:04:47.120> holds<00:04:47.480> it<00:04:47.570> as

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
adjusted in height and that holds it as

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.930 
adjusted in height and that holds it as
well<00:04:47.870> now<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:48.770> reason<00:04:49.160> for<00:04:49.190> that<00:04:49.430> is<00:04:49.610> in<00:04:49.790> this

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
well now the reason for that is in this

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.510 
well now the reason for that is in this
particular<00:04:50.150> case<00:04:50.830> so<00:04:51.830> for<00:04:52.010> you<00:04:52.070> guys<00:04:52.130> have<00:04:52.490> a

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
particular case so for you guys have a

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.390 
particular case so for you guys have a
silverstone<00:04:53.150> TJ<00:04:53.630> or<00:04:53.810> weight<00:04:53.960> case<00:04:54.230> this<00:04:55.100> is

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
silverstone TJ or weight case this is

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.220 
silverstone TJ or weight case this is
for<00:04:55.730> those<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.330> you<00:04:56.480> who<00:04:56.630> are<00:04:56.720> carrying<00:04:57.110> the

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
for those of you who are carrying the

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.690 
for those of you who are carrying the
case<00:04:57.410> for<00:04:57.680> land<00:04:57.890> parties<00:04:58.220> and<00:04:58.370> things<00:04:58.580> like

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
case for land parties and things like

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.200 
case for land parties and things like
that<00:04:58.760> now<00:04:59.510> ironically<00:05:00.020> in<00:05:00.590> my<00:05:01.400> situation<00:05:01.640> that

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
that now ironically in my situation that

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.390 
that now ironically in my situation that
whole<00:05:02.600> case<00:05:02.900> weights<00:05:03.470> probably<00:05:03.920> around<00:05:04.100> 10

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
whole case weights probably around 10

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.000 
whole case weights probably around 10
kilo<00:05:04.790> which<00:05:05.450> is<00:05:05.690> quite<00:05:05.930> a<00:05:05.960> heavy<00:05:06.200> case<00:05:06.530> and<00:05:06.890> it

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
kilo which is quite a heavy case and it

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.060 
kilo which is quite a heavy case and it
is<00:05:07.250> not<00:05:08.240> really<00:05:08.720> that<00:05:08.750> movable<00:05:09.590> for<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:09.890> land

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
is not really that movable for the land

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.180 
is not really that movable for the land
part<00:05:10.310> is<00:05:10.520> not<00:05:10.700> ideal<00:05:10.880> basically<00:05:12.010> however<00:05:13.010> it's

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
part is not ideal basically however it's

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.860 
part is not ideal basically however it's
very<00:05:13.400> sturdy<00:05:13.670> case<00:05:13.970> at<00:05:14.300> its<00:05:14.450> build<00:05:14.690> for

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
very sturdy case at its build for

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.290 
very sturdy case at its build for
purpose<00:05:15.230> so<00:05:15.800> as<00:05:15.890> you<00:05:15.980> see<00:05:16.190> my<00:05:16.370> GPU<00:05:16.730> now<00:05:16.940> sits

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
purpose so as you see my GPU now sits

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.380 
purpose so as you see my GPU now sits
here<00:05:17.720> I'm<00:05:18.140> not<00:05:18.350> going<00:05:18.740> to<00:05:18.830> use<00:05:19.010> the<00:05:19.430> SLI<00:05:19.850> links

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
here I'm not going to use the SLI links

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.270 
here I'm not going to use the SLI links
because<00:05:21.020> simply<00:05:21.380> is<00:05:21.440> going<00:05:21.470> to<00:05:21.620> be<00:05:21.770> just<00:05:22.010> one

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
because simply is going to be just one

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.240 
because simply is going to be just one
GPU<00:05:22.880> not<00:05:23.090> two<00:05:23.420> there<00:05:24.110> is<00:05:24.140> a<00:05:24.290> slot<00:05:24.620> here<00:05:24.950> for<00:05:25.160> the

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
GPU not two there is a slot here for the

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.310 
GPU not two there is a slot here for the
second<00:05:25.640> GPU<00:05:26.000> as<00:05:26.120> well<00:05:26.330> and<00:05:26.570> above<00:05:26.810> we<00:05:27.050> have<00:05:27.290> a

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
second GPU as well and above we have a

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.700 
second GPU as well and above we have a
power<00:05:27.650> supply<00:05:28.250> unit<00:05:28.760> so<00:05:29.330> basically<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:30.530> air

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
power supply unit so basically the air

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.500 
power supply unit so basically the air
is<00:05:30.890> going<00:05:31.010> to<00:05:31.070> be<00:05:31.160> pulled<00:05:31.520> from<00:05:31.760> the<00:05:31.820> top<00:05:32.150> so

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
is going to be pulled from the top so

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.180 
is going to be pulled from the top so
it's<00:05:32.810> going<00:05:32.930> to<00:05:32.990> come<00:05:33.230> in<00:05:33.290> into<00:05:33.860> the<00:05:33.980> case

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
it's going to come in into the case

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.840 
it's going to come in into the case
using<00:05:34.730> this<00:05:35.110> beefy<00:05:36.110> cooler<00:05:36.440> here<00:05:36.920> so<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.730> air

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
using this beefy cooler here so the air

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.760 
using this beefy cooler here so the air
goes<00:05:37.880> in<00:05:38.360> for<00:05:38.600> the<00:05:38.630> hard<00:05:38.960> drives<00:05:39.260> and<00:05:39.590> through

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
goes in for the hard drives and through

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.830 
goes in for the hard drives and through
the<00:05:39.920> cooler<00:05:40.190> but<00:05:40.700> also<00:05:40.820> goes<00:05:41.270> through<00:05:41.570> the<00:05:41.660> top

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
the cooler but also goes through the top

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.710 
the cooler but also goes through the top
of<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.080> case<00:05:42.410> where<00:05:43.220> three<00:05:43.880> fans<00:05:44.150> from<00:05:44.510> this

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
of the case where three fans from this

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.830 
of the case where three fans from this
gigabyte<00:05:45.940> graphics<00:05:46.940> car<00:05:47.150> going<00:05:47.330> to<00:05:47.390> pull<00:05:47.660> the

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
gigabyte graphics car going to pull the

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.470 
gigabyte graphics car going to pull the
air<00:05:47.990> in<00:05:48.230> and<00:05:48.500> blast<00:05:48.830> it<00:05:49.070> out<00:05:49.190> but<00:05:49.610> because<00:05:50.300> it's

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
air in and blast it out but because it's

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.190 
air in and blast it out but because it's
all<00:05:50.630> tunneled<00:05:51.140> out<00:05:51.320> is<00:05:51.650> going<00:05:52.520> to<00:05:52.580> be<00:05:52.700> fine<00:05:53.200> so

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
all tunneled out is going to be fine so

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.770 
all tunneled out is going to be fine so
guys<00:05:54.380> that's<00:05:54.800> about<00:05:55.010> it<00:05:55.310> the<00:05:56.060> third<00:05:56.330> video<00:05:56.570> is

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
guys that's about it the third video is

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.480 
guys that's about it the third video is
going<00:05:56.900> to<00:05:56.960> be<00:05:57.140> obviously<00:05:57.320> some<00:05:57.830> benchmarks

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
going to be obviously some benchmarks

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.860 
going to be obviously some benchmarks
and<00:05:58.580> if<00:05:58.670> you<00:05:58.760> haven't<00:05:59.060> seen<00:05:59.210> my<00:05:59.360> first<00:05:59.600> video

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
and if you haven't seen my first video

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.870 
and if you haven't seen my first video
when<00:06:00.170> I<00:06:00.200> where<00:06:00.680> I<00:06:00.710> was<00:06:01.160> unboxing<00:06:01.790> the

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
when I where I was unboxing the
