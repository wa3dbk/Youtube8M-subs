 right now on screen is a great 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.820
 shame is a great ridiculous is a great 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.590
 disgust returns loja which is a call of duty 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.690
 and this is the action in just 10 days 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.320
 since worn out we are already on day 24 and 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.260
 game about day 13 in 10 11 days 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.450
 good as yesterday because in 10 days is already 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.860
 I'm full, I 'm full so 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.590
 less in the ranking is already full 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.950
 of shit has produced some way 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.140
 as you can see people with thousands of 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.989
 points 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.989
 per minute thing quite exaggerated 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.210
 of sight 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.449
 we are not going to half an hour already in the 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.820
 first in the world seems ridiculous 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.260
 I'm not going to indicate the kind of people that 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.660
 have to be working with each other in 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.030
 activision already has to be embarrassing 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.920
 I really were professionals 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.500
 working there would have happened this 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.900
 how I felt guilty uncle I'm 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.780
 saying what the hell I'm doing with 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.580
 my work I am a failure I am a 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.479
 failed for four people 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.030
 catch me and modify the game better 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.490
 gift in this way and improve the 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.700
 ranking I would not feel I do not say it 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.820
 useless useless lost saying several 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.250
 people who are there with the 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.590
 maintenance of the game for society 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.840
 this is not good many things are going to me 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.310
 decide not quiet angel yes alone the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.740
 ranking in what is the experience of 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.780
 I play what the young woman does not relationships 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.030
 of the game do not you the young wait for you 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.850
 it seems a little wait a bit and then 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.759
 tell me later 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.369
 I recommend complaining is already 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.590
 Of course, you have paid 60 euros for 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.659
 all the game 60-70 what you paid 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.470
 has paid the cleared game on hunter or 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.170
 you have not paid a part you have not paid 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.990
 entire whole from end to end you've 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.250
 paid whole you have so much right 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.940
 like anybody since so that you see 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.170
 that have increased by all 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.900
 sides there is no where or where 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.510
 take it uncle there is no where to take it 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.370
 and wait for you in the public soon see 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.350
 what do you know what it is that 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.180
 it happens because this is chair because 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.819
 clear selena of public games this 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.130
 type of goods of public items in 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.040
 what you kill yourself and get 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.300
 points in known points for it 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.380
 ok because the proportion that they have 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.280
 those people are from people 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.340
 we go level so you're not having 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.610
 proportions of the 68 with which then 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.440
 it's officiating obviously it's not killing 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.520
 normal there were two and they will give you one 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.410
 Exaggerated amount of points and good what 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.330
 will happen with this worth other cattle won 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.550
 people if it is possible that tomorrow two or 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.440
 three people or banana all that 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.090
 can but soon they will pass 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.830
 of them there is not more and more and every time 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.370
 more a little more progressively they will not 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.850
 they will do something to cover up the gap 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.440
 what is causing all this the best 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.390
 Today it will start to make noise 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.070
 people I guess I do not know if the team that 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.720
 the same thing is happening but here already the 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.150
 shame here already gives a little bit of 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.670
 shame and sadness or sadness that 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.070
 every year the same thing this kind of thing without 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.530
 tolerate intolerable and that the 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.510
 games in these ways and the truth as 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.250
 I say seems a great shame 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.320
 principle it seems ridiculous that people 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.890
 professional is letting what happens 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.690
 happens and this is very embarrassing with both 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.550
 the game's output so much that they're going to 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.630
 be harder to both hackers 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.260
 they are going to handle them and they want 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.520
 I see myself this is awesome I do not know 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.400
 I hope you get down to work 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.140
 because it's a pretty ridiculous thing 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.730
 he's a pretty ridiculous person and the 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.530
 I really hope they fix it soon 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.120
 now if you put yourself in the face of the 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.800
 player this I am in front of 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.610
 any player that you see suspicious 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.390
 you are going to see 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.580
 how do they do this kind of shit like how 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.070
 they commit suicide and earn points so good 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.390
 recommended metals and how they earned 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.910
 points 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.950
 is very fact is very exaggerated there is a 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.850
 game that ends the first of the 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.670
 world 1 184 they have killed themselves and dies 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.370
 184 times with which there is the 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.360
 magic and nothing see you in the next 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.360
 bye until next video
