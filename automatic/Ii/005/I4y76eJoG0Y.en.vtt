yeah so we would suggest there's three
types<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.130> questions<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.549> gonna<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.790> powerful

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
types of questions are gonna be powerful

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.030 
types of questions are gonna be powerful
in<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> conversation<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.350> first<00:01:40.650> one<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.009> a

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
in a conversation the first one is a

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.130 
in a conversation the first one is a
confirming<00:01:41.610> or<00:01:41.670> clarifying<00:01:42.119> question<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
confirming or clarifying question the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.899 
confirming or clarifying question the
next<00:01:43.380> one<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.619> an<00:01:43.829> empowering<00:01:44.310> question<00:01:44.759> which

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
next one is an empowering question which

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.639 
next one is an empowering question which
we<00:01:45.060> spend<00:01:45.299> more<00:01:45.390> time<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.259> third<00:01:46.409> one<00:01:46.560> is

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
we spend more time on the third one is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.620 
we spend more time on the third one is
the<00:01:46.740> action<00:01:47.130> question<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.420> when<00:01:48.540> you're

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the action question so when you're

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.850 
the action question so when you're
involved<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.990> dialogue<00:01:49.409> with<00:01:49.560> one<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.770> your

direct reports or somebody else that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.300 
direct reports or somebody else that
you're<00:01:51.750> trying<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.079> work<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.619> toggle

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
you're trying to work with you toggle

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.920 
you're trying to work with you toggle
back<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.490> forth<00:01:53.670> between<00:01:53.909> numbers<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
back and forth between numbers one and

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.300 
back and forth between numbers one and
two<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.290> confirming<00:01:55.770> questions<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
two the confirming questions and the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.950 
two the confirming questions and the
empowering<00:01:56.670> questions<00:01:57.119> until<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.719> get<00:01:57.869> to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
empowering questions until you get to

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.240 
empowering questions until you get to
such<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> point<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.560> conversation<00:01:58.740> where

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
such a point in the conversation where

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.100 
such a point in the conversation where
you<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.430> ask<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.149> action<00:02:00.630> question<00:02:00.840> which

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
you can ask that action question which

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.200 
you can ask that action question which
really<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.500> moves<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.100> action<00:02:03.000> plan

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
really just moves the action plan

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.969 
really just moves the action plan
forward<00:02:03.570> at<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.810> point<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.110> time<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.350> we'll

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
forward at that point in time so we'll

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.260 
forward at that point in time so we'll
talk<00:02:05.159> more<00:02:05.340> about<00:02:05.399> how<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> do<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.119> but

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
talk more about how to do that but

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.639 
talk more about how to do that but
there's<00:02:06.390> really<00:02:06.509> three<00:02:06.840> steps<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.229> using

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
there's really three steps to using

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.229 
there's really three steps to using
questions<00:02:08.009> effectively<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> conversation

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
questions effectively in a conversation

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.260 
questions effectively in a conversation
it<00:02:09.840> all<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.259> sounds<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.619> easy<00:02:10.860> Jed<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.910> I

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
it all just sounds so easy Jed it's I

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.140 
it all just sounds so easy Jed it's I
wish<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.599> were

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
wish it were

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.089 
wish it were
I<00:02:13.180> think<00:02:13.689> part<00:02:13.959> of<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.110> challenge<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.739> that

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
I think part of the challenge is that

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.369 
I think part of the challenge is that
this<00:02:15.370> can<00:02:15.640> be<00:02:15.790> difficult<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.450> do<00:02:16.629> and<00:02:17.049> to<00:02:17.200> do<00:02:17.349> it

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
this can be difficult to do and to do it

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.920 
this can be difficult to do and to do it
well<00:02:17.709> is<00:02:17.950> even<00:02:18.189> harder<00:02:18.519> but<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.150> payoff<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.540> so

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
well is even harder but the payoff is so

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.509 
well is even harder but the payoff is so
huge<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.409> when<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.620> do<00:02:20.829> learn<00:02:21.099> this<00:02:21.370> skill

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
huge that when you do learn this skill

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.420 
huge that when you do learn this skill
and<00:02:21.939> do<00:02:22.390> get<00:02:22.569> better<00:02:22.780> at<00:02:23.049> this<00:02:23.290> skill<00:02:23.590> it

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
and do get better at this skill it

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.490 
and do get better at this skill it
unlocks<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.420> much<00:02:25.629> for<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.170> your<00:02:26.260> team<00:02:26.470> to
