00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:18.409
 Do you think it's the same bunny? 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:19.429
 Look, 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:20.880
 It is not the same. 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.710
 Piti, who is our actor, 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.099
 Actually 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:25.659
 It's This one. 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.439
 It's a Belier rabbit. 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.249
 If you remember the videos we recorded on rabbit breeds, 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.100
 Toy Rabbit, little bunny and ears up, 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.370
 rabbit Aries, 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.820
 a little bigger 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.040
 and ears down, ears falling. 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.710
 But this video is really going 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.360
 to talk to you about races 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.420
 In this video, we want to explain 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.700
 feeding rabbits 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.960
 and Cunipic's new Naturaliss pet range. 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.790
 It is a range that is natural. 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.080
 And what is the new offer? What he offers again 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.310
 is that we really included ingredients that they consume 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.930
 directly in the wild and we managed to recreate a diet 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.140
 as natural as possible and as true to what they actually consume 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.830
 in their wild life. 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.189
 This includes a pile of plants, 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.189
 multifloral meadow hay, lots of hay, dry grass 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.280
 from a large number of different plants. We also include different rods, 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.099
 like that of echinacea, that of milk thistle. He also wears vegetables 

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:31.649
 like for example the carrot 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.520
 dehydrated ... All this mixed 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.700
 and balanced so that everything is perfect for rabbit nutrition 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.480
 adult. 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.230
 But more important than talking about what he has 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.749
 it's about talking about what it does not have and here is what you have right next 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.510
 do not wear extruded. 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.860
 We removed it from the diet. 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.690
 What is extruded? Well, the extruded is a 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.080
 food 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.010
 mainly composed of cereals 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.050
 that explodes when it undergoes a strong heat treatment 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.059
 as we do with the pop-corns at home, when 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:12.979
 we put them in the microwave and, when they heat, 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:16.389
 they explode. We have a product that weighs little, it is 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:17.480
 very 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.259
 sparse 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:26.369
 and, really, what we do is skip a step of digestion, with this 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:27.760
 heat treatment. 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.200
 Denaturalizes the properties of cereals making it easier 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.729
 to digest and that's very good 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.440
 and really good too to feed 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.219
 animals 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.869
 monogastric, such as carnivores, 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:44.789
 like dogs and cats, 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.610
 but for herbivores and animals 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.079
 polygastric, he is not good. 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.419
 The extruded, in addition, 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:53.370
 it makes you lose 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.920
 some of the most important vitamins that have food, like, of course 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.849
 vitamin C, although in this case, rabbits are able to make them by 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:01.650
 themselves. 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.040
 But not only vitamin C, but also 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.810
 we lose vitamin A, we lose vitamin K, we lose vitamin B1 and also 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.169
 folic acid. 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:10.219
 However, 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.139
 what we can do in the diet. That's all there is here. 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.130
 We can put 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.079
 a lot of fresh vegetables, although 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.129
 always in moderation because when 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.130
 they are not used to it, all the sudden changes of food in rabbits 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.940
 can be harmful and we must put a lot of hay, too. 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.210
 Cunipic offers a wide variety of available hay 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.930
 from a pile of different plants. 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.710
 The most important thing about hay is to change it because 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.660
 some plants bring one thing, while other plants provide another. What you can 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.319
 to do is to alternate with each other. And also fresh vegetables, all with green leaves, 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.000
 how much more, better. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.569
 Also, I wanted to bring you here 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.829
 also carrots. 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.139
 Everyone knows that rabbits love carrots, but what 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.719
 you do not know is that the most important to eat. 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.099
 are the stems. 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.540
 It's much more important 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.549
 for the rabbit eat the stems 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.790
 than to eat the tuber itself. Nourishes much more 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.709
 the stem 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.379
 that the tuber, always in the rabbit, clear 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.140
 And we included both, dehydrated too 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.279
 in the new Naturaliss range. 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.109
 And I will go on to describe a little pictos. 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.080
 Here you can see them. 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.479
 Fiber, I will not insist more, is the main component. You also have a 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.219
 optimum balance of carbohydrates, which includes 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:34.510
 the minimum of cereals 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.400
 possible 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.740
 but it is true that in some measures it is also necessary 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.729
 for his diet. 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.849
 Calcium phosphorus, with which we treat to compensate for vegetables included 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.120
 so that he has very little calcium, 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.849
 against what almost everyone thinks, calcium is beneficial and best for rabbits, 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.760
 because they have a very sophisticated system of calcium absorption 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.640
 and diets, especially in adults, must be low in calcium. And 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.740
 finally, the own choice is a 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.150
 a tip that describes us as we did 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.819
 a food with what likes rabbit, with what is in nature.
