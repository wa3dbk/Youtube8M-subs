 released if a guest who 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.030

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.560
 that they subscribe to my channel because 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.290
 the truth I have nothing in it but 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:55.540

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.330
 I leave these knots in the end it 's good 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.740

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.520
 that there is good down we have to 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.520
 answer the phone 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.250
 we answer it 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.159
 here the audio is not heard in the game 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.189
 the game is yes but there they have the 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.420
 subsidies so so I do not know 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.450
 worry 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.480
 so we skip the call and go 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.460
 with ryder 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:42.790
 this is an explain a workflow so 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.280
 you must understand and if not then 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.100
 here we are with ryder 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:53.470

 let's leave them we go to the 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.650
 barbershop 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.650
 I passed 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.000
 the car is good for its own sake choco 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.270
 do not 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.940
 who already saw how I keep playing I hope 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.560
 that this is not a 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:06.690
 distraction but we're here 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:10.580
 the goal now here we are going to give the 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.580
 gray barbershop 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.480
 we got out of the car 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.480
 and we go to the nice 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.870
 x school that has to cut us the 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:27.909
 hair so wait 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.909
 we go here to the pointer 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.239
 tells us that court wants 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:39.060
 you can choose the one you want we are going to 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:44.349
 choose a new cheap but clear that 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.569
 cheapest of the caesar and mustache then 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.939
 to the periÃ£ and remember that this one 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:53.560
 I explained we will do it with absolute no 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:55.830
 absolutely no trick by cheetah 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.120
 so we'll have to keep up 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.890
 exact exact clean 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.090
 we are going to put a frontal 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.090
 Let's see how we look 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.150
 very good very well then we bought it 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:19.290
 and see what tele 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.290
 How does the car tell us? 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.490
 thanks also to the 18 subscribers 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.970
 what's on the channel, there's no 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.970
 bought 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.570
 previous yes yes I know 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.080
 when this is where he takes us to eat 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.860
 Pizza 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.860
 there is 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:50.050
 and well, that's not the bad thing, it's that 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:53.080
 there are many shots at this level 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.889
 not at this point of the game almost not but 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.490
 Then there will come a point right now, everything is 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.610
 blocked almost everything all the places in 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.650
 those who can access are blocked 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.780
 will progressively unlock pse and 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.340
 you will be able to enter more things and you will see what 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.710
 great that is waiting for both san 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.249
 Andrew 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.310
 here we are walking 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:22.100
 and then if we come we ask for something 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:25.160
 to the clear place that costs us a lot but 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.830
 to see double luxury salad that we 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.889
 we bought we went out 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.919
 then ryan tries 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:36.580
 that from all the money here watching 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:39.409
 so much that I'm from 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:43.480
 for the masses 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:48.120
 because there he gives us 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.120
 it will not jump to the s 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:56.720
 because you can not hear anything 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.860
 and it starts to shoot us and we have to 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.620
 running of runs running 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:06.479
 soon we will do this if face the 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.479
 eye care 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:18.079
 runs runs runs runs we already 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:20.849
 have fired three times goodbye 

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:23.759
 and as we said we are going to use 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.319
 Turks we are not going to use them but 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:27.230
 wait for it to be pixelated do not follow 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.240
 chasing 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.420
 They already saw the little life bar that 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.420
 we have 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.660
 what has hers has not played out 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.660
 then she was a woman 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.960
 and we go fast we go fast we go fast 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.800
 and we arrived at the house this mission was 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.930
 overcome 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.500
 is one of the easiest missions and that 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.500
 if it kills you 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.550
 6 and 8 when here 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:09.320
 come on it arrives and we arrive at the mission 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.600
 hit 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:16.020
 and I know we went through sweet 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:19.050
 if you listen and 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.639
 and what do you say we do another mission or the 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.860
 we leave waiting until the solution 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:24.479
 assembly and I say we make another 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.759
 mission anyway already long this 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:28.979
 video too nuclear ok 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:31.669
 As he said, we will do the 

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:31.669
 instructions
