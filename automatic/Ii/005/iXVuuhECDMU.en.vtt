but<00:00:45.100> basically<00:00:45.520> I'm<00:00:45.700> just<00:00:45.910> mapping<00:00:46.420> out<00:00:46.719> the

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
but basically I'm just mapping out the

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.479 
but basically I'm just mapping out the
shape<00:00:47.020> of<00:00:47.110> my<00:00:47.289> eyes<00:00:47.469> so<00:00:47.739> I<00:00:47.800> always<00:00:48.100> apply<00:00:48.370> it

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
shape of my eyes so I always apply it

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.040 
shape of my eyes so I always apply it
directly<00:00:48.700> in<00:00:49.149> the<00:00:49.270> crease<00:00:49.539> or<00:00:49.780> sort<00:00:49.960> of<00:00:49.989> like

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
directly in the crease or sort of like

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.830 
directly in the crease or sort of like
the<00:00:50.350> fold<00:00:50.680> of<00:00:50.890> my<00:00:51.460> eye<00:00:51.489> and<00:00:52.180> I'm<00:00:52.300> just<00:00:52.510> going<00:00:52.750> to

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
the fold of my eye and I'm just going to

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.510 
the fold of my eye and I'm just going to
continue<00:00:53.500> to<00:00:53.800> wing<00:00:53.980> it<00:00:54.039> out<00:00:54.190> so<00:00:54.399> basically

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
continue to wing it out so basically

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.119 
continue to wing it out so basically
feel<00:00:55.149> up<00:00:55.390> until<00:00:56.110> where<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.680> can<00:00:56.860> fill<00:00:57.039> your

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
feel up until where you can fill your

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:58.830 
feel up until where you can fill your
bar<00:00:57.430> in<00:00:57.550> sort<00:00:57.820> of<00:00:57.879> stop<00:00:58.180> if<00:00:58.390> that<00:00:58.539> makes<00:00:58.719> sense

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
bar in sort of stop if that makes sense

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.020 
bar in sort of stop if that makes sense
and<00:00:59.199> then<00:00:59.620> just<00:00:59.890> continue<00:01:00.100> past<00:01:00.579> that<00:01:00.850> rather

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
and then just continue past that rather

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.700 
and then just continue past that rather
than<00:01:01.210> connecting<00:01:01.510> down<00:01:01.899> to<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.350> end<00:01:02.469> of<00:01:02.590> your

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710

than connecting down to the end of your
lash<00:01:02.890> line<00:01:03.160> so<00:01:03.399> now<00:01:04.059> I'm<00:01:04.149> gonna<00:01:04.239> grab<00:01:04.449> a<00:01:05.130> clean

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
lash line so now I'm gonna grab a clean

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.760 
lash line so now I'm gonna grab a clean
fluffy<00:01:06.580> blending<00:01:07.000> brush<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:07.690> just<00:01:07.780> blend<00:01:08.259> it

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.270 

once<00:01:14.049> you're<00:01:14.200> happy<00:01:14.320> with<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.649> blending<00:01:15.009> even

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
once you're happy with the blending even

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.980 
once you're happy with the blending even
basically<00:01:15.640> going<00:01:15.939> and<00:01:16.090> redefine<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:16.869> make

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
basically going and redefine and make

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.660 
basically going and redefine and make
sure<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.290> shape<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.680> exactly<00:01:17.799> how<00:01:18.280> you<00:01:18.340> want

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.550 
sure the shape is exactly how you want
it<00:01:18.820> so<00:01:19.060> I<00:01:19.270> do<00:01:19.450> want<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.780> get<00:01:19.899> that<00:01:20.020> nice<00:01:20.170> depth

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
it so I do want to get that nice depth

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.410 
it so I do want to get that nice depth
of<00:01:20.680> color<00:01:20.950> built<00:01:21.220> back<00:01:21.430> up<00:01:21.610> in<00:01:21.790> there<00:01:21.939> so<00:01:22.360> you

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
of color built back up in there so you

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.300 
of color built back up in there so you
guys<00:01:22.600> can<00:01:22.840> just<00:01:22.930> keep<00:01:23.140> defining<00:01:23.470> and<00:01:23.950> blending

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
guys can just keep defining and blending

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.649 
guys can just keep defining and blending
until<00:01:24.640> you're<00:01:24.729> completely<00:01:24.880> happy<00:01:25.420> with<00:01:25.539> the

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
until you're completely happy with the

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.450 
until you're completely happy with the
shape<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:26.020> you're<00:01:26.110> working<00:01:26.259> with<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:27.280> then

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
shape that you're working with and then

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.160 
shape that you're working with and then
I'm<00:01:27.579> going<00:01:27.729> to<00:01:27.820> go<00:01:27.939> ahead<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.420> use<00:01:28.689> basically

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
I'm going to go ahead and use basically

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.870 
I'm going to go ahead and use basically
a<00:01:29.200> transition<00:01:29.860> shape<00:01:30.130> so<00:01:30.399> it's<00:01:30.549> the<00:01:30.670> shade

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
a transition shape so it's the shade

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.179 
a transition shape so it's the shade
slightly<00:01:31.119> lighter<00:01:31.659> than<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.380> CPR<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:32.860> little

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
slightly lighter than the CPR a little

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.710 
slightly lighter than the CPR a little
bit<00:01:33.280> more<00:01:33.429> warm<00:01:33.729> tone<00:01:34.030> they<00:01:34.330> look<00:01:34.479> beautiful

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
bit more warm tone they look beautiful

this concealer for it in particular

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.910 
this concealer for it in particular
because<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:01.030> honestly<00:02:01.240> don't<00:02:01.750> find<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.440> creases

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
because I honestly don't find it creases

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.800 
because I honestly don't find it creases
and<00:02:03.549> it's<00:02:03.729> got<00:02:03.909> a<00:02:03.939> thick<00:02:04.240> enough<00:02:04.420> consistency

and it's got a thick enough consistency

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.559 
and it's got a thick enough consistency
to<00:02:05.229> hold<00:02:05.500> on<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.280> eye<00:02:06.310> area<00:02:06.909> as<00:02:07.060> well<00:02:07.270> it's<00:02:07.450> not

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
to hold on the eye area as well it's not

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.389 
to hold on the eye area as well it's not
liquid<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.110> it's<00:02:08.229> not<00:02:08.380> going<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.590> be<00:02:08.709> sort<00:02:09.340> of

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
liquid and it's not going to be sort of

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.009 
liquid and it's not going to be sort of
blendable<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.299> moving<00:02:10.569> around

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
blendable and moving around

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.320 
blendable and moving around
so<00:02:11.170> yes<00:02:11.440> planning<00:02:12.130> that<00:02:12.250> up<00:02:12.400> nicely<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.239> then

care to keep it nice and thin so that

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.940

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
the cut crease that I've done but the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.199 
the cut crease that I've done but the
winged<00:03:19.989> liner<00:03:20.290> just<00:03:20.650> complements<00:03:21.609> it<00:03:21.699> so<00:03:22.000> well

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
winged liner just complements it so well

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.270 
winged liner just complements it so well
because<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:23.169> lines<00:03:23.380> weren't<00:03:23.680> joined<00:03:23.949> they'll

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
because the lines weren't joined they'll

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.410 
because the lines weren't joined they'll
just<00:03:24.459> basically<00:03:24.820> be

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
just basically be

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.180 
just basically be
aligned<00:03:25.660> with<00:03:25.870> one<00:03:26.050> another<00:03:26.290> so<00:03:26.620> basically

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
aligned with one another so basically

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.850 
aligned with one another so basically
just<00:03:27.459> connecting<00:03:27.970> that<00:03:28.300> line<00:03:28.599> up<00:03:28.990> to<00:03:29.530> make<00:03:29.709> it

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
just connecting that line up to make it

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.040 
just connecting that line up to make it
like<00:03:30.010> adjacent<00:03:30.670> from<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.270> cut<00:03:31.480> crease<00:03:31.720> line
