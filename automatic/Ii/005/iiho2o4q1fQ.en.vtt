okay<00:00:00.989> with<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.290> particular<00:00:01.620> vehicle<00:00:02.250> and

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
okay with this particular vehicle and

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.090 
okay with this particular vehicle and
with<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.820> lot<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.240> 90s<00:00:03.720> Ford's<00:00:04.230> which<00:00:04.980> is

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
with a lot of the 90s Ford's which is

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.780 
with a lot of the 90s Ford's which is
going<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.339> inertia<00:00:05.670> switch<00:00:06.180> in<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.480> trunk<00:00:06.810> and

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
going to inertia switch in the trunk and

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.669 
going to inertia switch in the trunk and
that<00:00:08.790> shuts<00:00:09.090> off<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.450> fuel<00:00:09.690> pump<00:00:09.929> so<00:00:10.260> before

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
that shuts off the fuel pump so before

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.430 
that shuts off the fuel pump so before
you<00:00:10.830> start<00:00:10.889> your<00:00:11.460> fuel<00:00:11.759> injection<00:00:12.240> cleaning

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
you start your fuel injection cleaning

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.519 
you start your fuel injection cleaning
I'm<00:00:13.440> going<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.650> take<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.830> pressure<00:00:14.580> reading<00:00:15.030> and

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
I'm going to take a pressure reading and

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.269 
I'm going to take a pressure reading and
then<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.680> want<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:18.650> find<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.859> inertia

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
then you want to find this inertia

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.250 
then you want to find this inertia
switch<00:00:20.730> sometimes<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.960> trunk

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
switch sometimes it's in a trunk

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.950 
switch sometimes it's in a trunk
sometimes<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> kick<00:00:23.400> panel<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.510> to

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
sometimes it's in the kick panel so to

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.429 
sometimes it's in the kick panel so to
trip<00:00:25.439> off<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.920> inertia<00:00:26.310> switch<00:00:27.109> you<00:00:28.109> need<00:00:28.289> to

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
trip off this inertia switch you need to

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.759 
trip off this inertia switch you need to
do<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:29.010> tap<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.210> switch<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:31.410> something

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
do is tap on the switch with something

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.549 
do is tap on the switch with something
like<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> broom<00:00:32.250> handle<00:00:32.759> or<00:00:32.940> what<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.750> use<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.140> was

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
like a broom handle or what I use it was

just about 20 pounds per square inch
when<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.300> tested<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> vehicle

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
when I tested the vehicle

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.020 
when I tested the vehicle
crusher<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:24.550> was<00:01:24.730> right<00:01:25.030> at<00:01:25.210> 30

at 35 40 psi
or<00:01:32.240> maybe<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:32.660> fuel<00:01:32.930> pump<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:33.350> all<00:01:33.530> weak

where we also applies to the five four

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.440 
where we also applies to the five four
there's<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.920> straighter<00:01:56.490> valve<00:01:56.730> right

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
there's a straighter valve right

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.360 
there's a straighter valve right
they<00:01:58.990> come<00:01:59.259> with<00:01:59.500> a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:13.350 

real<00:02:03.790> simple<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.300> hook<00:02:04.420> up

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.699 

okay<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:14.420> let's<00:02:14.810> start<00:02:15.019> over<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:15.230> around<00:02:15.439> three

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
okay so let's start over in around three

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.479 
okay so let's start over in around three
o'clock<00:02:16.900> with<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.930> sixteen<00:02:18.860> ounces<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.400> the

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
o'clock with the sixteen ounces of the

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.789 
o'clock with the sixteen ounces of the
fuel<00:02:19.700> injection<00:02:20.030> cleaner<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.500> ran<00:02:21.680> about

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
fuel injection cleaner and it ran about

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:57.710 
fuel injection cleaner and it ran about
fifteen<00:02:22.459> minutes

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.720

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
if you get your engine started this will

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:18.400 
if you get your engine started this will
have<00:02:59.880> second<00:03:00.390> week
