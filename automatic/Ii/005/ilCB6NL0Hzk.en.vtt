sagging skin and wrinkles occur because
of<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.639> loss<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.389> collagen<00:02:31.379> and<00:02:31.920> elastin<00:02:32.519> and

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
of the loss of collagen and elastin and

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.319 
of the loss of collagen and elastin and
gravity<00:02:34.349> well<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.219> whole<00:02:35.430> point<00:02:35.849> of<00:02:36.090> trying

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
gravity well the whole point of trying

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.080 
gravity well the whole point of trying
to<00:02:36.689> replace<00:02:37.200> or<00:02:37.730> stimulate<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.909> production

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
to replace or stimulate the production

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.500 
to replace or stimulate the production
of<00:02:39.629> collagen<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.920> elastin<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.879> so<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.359> it

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
of collagen and elastin is so that it

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.839 
of collagen and elastin is so that it
holds<00:02:42.720> your<00:02:42.989> skin<00:02:43.349> up<00:02:43.620> better<00:02:44.159> and<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.669> holds

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
holds your skin up better and it holds

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.729 
holds your skin up better and it holds
moisture<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.689> better<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.260> citrus<00:02:47.250> stem<00:02:48.060> cells

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
moisture in better and citrus stem cells

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.830 
moisture in better and citrus stem cells
in<00:02:49.739> particular<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.549> very<00:02:50.939> good<00:02:51.329> for<00:02:51.510> helping

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
in particular is very good for helping

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.039 
in particular is very good for helping
your<00:02:51.930> skin<00:02:52.459> promote<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:54.120> production<00:02:54.540> of

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
your skin promote the production of

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.459 
your skin promote the production of
elastin<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.099> then<00:02:56.879> our<00:02:57.060> third<00:02:57.540> ingredient<00:02:57.780> is

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.469 
elastin and then our third ingredient is

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.659 
elastin and then our third ingredient is
a<00:02:59.129> much<00:02:59.959> higher<00:03:00.959> grade<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.709> sodium<00:03:02.400> hyaluronic

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
a much higher grade of sodium hyaluronic

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.020 
a much higher grade of sodium hyaluronic
so<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:03.780> particular<00:03:04.379> ingredient<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:05.459> called

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
so this particular ingredient is called

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.110 
so this particular ingredient is called
high<00:03:06.480> lism<00:03:07.129> e.g<00:03:08.129> 10<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:10.219> sodium<00:03:11.219> hyaluronic<00:03:11.400> as

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
high lism e.g 10 so sodium hyaluronic as

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.710 
high lism e.g 10 so sodium hyaluronic as
an<00:03:12.359> ingredient<00:03:12.659> can<00:03:13.500> hold<00:03:13.859> up<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.419> 1,000<00:03:15.419> times

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
an ingredient can hold up to 1,000 times

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.379 
an ingredient can hold up to 1,000 times
its<00:03:15.959> weight<00:03:16.169> in<00:03:16.229> water<00:03:16.500> while<00:03:17.190> Hylas<00:03:17.699> ohm<00:03:17.879> EG

TM<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:19.019> actually<00:03:19.919> a<00:03:20.000> cross-linked<00:03:21.000> hyaluronic

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
TM is actually a cross-linked hyaluronic

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.189 
TM is actually a cross-linked hyaluronic
acid<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.919> has<00:03:22.979> the<00:03:23.519> ability<00:03:23.909> to<00:03:23.940> hold<00:03:24.239> five

traditional or a standard hyaluronic

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.379 
traditional or a standard hyaluronic
acid<00:03:31.439> and<00:03:31.590> because<00:03:32.310> it's<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.639> cross-linked<00:03:33.239> I

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
acid and because it's a cross-linked I

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.490 
acid and because it's a cross-linked I
mean<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.629> just<00:03:33.659> simply<00:03:34.169> think<00:03:34.319> of

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
mean you just simply think of

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.490 
mean you just simply think of
cross-linking<00:03:35.280> what<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.449> means<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:37.229> a

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
cross-linking what that means in a

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.280 
cross-linking what that means in a
formula<00:03:38.189> is<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.819> first<00:03:39.599> of<00:03:39.720> all<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:39.870> have<00:03:40.139> to

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
formula is that first of all you have to

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.469 
formula is that first of all you have to
have<00:03:40.470> an<00:03:40.709> ingredient<00:03:41.340> that<00:03:41.430> has<00:03:41.759> a<00:03:42.120> molecular

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
have an ingredient that has a molecular

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:46.999 
have an ingredient that has a molecular
weight<00:03:42.949> small<00:03:43.949> enough<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:45.750> penetrate<00:03:46.229> into

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:47.009 
weight small enough to penetrate into

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.869 
weight small enough to penetrate into
the<00:03:47.609> skin<00:03:47.729> as<00:03:48.290> deeply<00:03:49.290> as<00:03:49.560> possible<00:03:49.669> and<00:03:50.669> now

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
the skin as deeply as possible and now

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.879 
the skin as deeply as possible and now
when<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.090> have<00:03:51.329> cross-linking<00:03:52.079> going<00:03:52.470> on<00:03:52.680> you

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
when you have cross-linking going on you

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.699 
when you have cross-linking going on you
actually<00:03:53.430> have<00:03:53.579> just<00:03:53.939> the<00:03:54.180> simple<00:03:54.709> connection

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
actually have just the simple connection

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.800 
actually have just the simple connection
of<00:03:55.859> ingredients<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:56.909> it<00:03:57.060> has<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.389> ability<00:03:57.449> to

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
of ingredients so it has the ability to

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.949 
of ingredients so it has the ability to
pull<00:03:58.319> and<00:03:58.500> deposit<00:03:59.069> more<00:03:59.699> of<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.209> ingredient

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
pull and deposit more of the ingredient

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.039 
pull and deposit more of the ingredient
into<00:04:01.199> the<00:04:01.739> skin<00:04:02.069> so<00:04:02.939> the<00:04:03.209> exciting<00:04:03.659> thing

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
into the skin so the exciting thing

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.729 
into the skin so the exciting thing
about<00:04:04.079> this<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.949> that<00:04:05.299> the<00:04:06.560> combination<00:04:07.560> of

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
about this is that the combination of

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.009 
about this is that the combination of
