00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
per hour but this is one of the faster

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.139 
per hour but this is one of the faster
methods<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> little<00:00:50.039> boring<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.730> got

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.849 
this usually I'll run it in half an hour
sessions<00:00:57.690> I'll<00:00:57.840> go<00:00:57.989> for<00:00:58.140> half<00:00:58.350> an<00:00:58.500> hour<00:00:58.559> then

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
sessions I'll go for half an hour then

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.439 
sessions I'll go for half an hour then
take<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> break<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.699> bit<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.239> come

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
take a break for a bit and then come

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.779 
take a break for a bit and then come
back<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.620> that's<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.949> method<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.730> I

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
back to it so that's the method that I

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.420 
back to it so that's the method that I
choose<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.300> do<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.619> really<00:01:04.619> can't<00:01:04.830> sit<00:01:05.040> down<00:01:05.220> for

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
choose to do I really can't sit down for

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.070 
choose to do I really can't sit down for
a<00:01:05.489> whole<00:01:05.640> hour<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:06.659> kind<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.900> too

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
a whole hour to do this it's kind of too

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.020 
a whole hour to do this it's kind of too
repetitive<00:01:07.380> for<00:01:07.830> me<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.610> once<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:08.880> into

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
repetitive for me but once you get into

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.399 
repetitive for me but once you get into
the<00:01:09.150> swing<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.450> things<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.780> pretty<00:01:10.049> easy<00:01:10.260> you

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the swing of things it's pretty easy you

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.899 
the swing of things it's pretty easy you
know<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:10.890> start<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.189> your<00:01:11.340> time<00:01:11.549> or<00:01:11.760> see
