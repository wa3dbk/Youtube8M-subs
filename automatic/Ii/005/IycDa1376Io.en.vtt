00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.040
 That is now with the shovel please if 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.820
 wants to put the chips of that material 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.820
 about this jalas 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:42.199
 for more of you are going to put in 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:44.559
 today is the blend with elegance of the 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.559
 companions 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.739
 to ask me 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.660
 It is not working for them 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.630
 to the plants 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.300
 we normally use the soil that is in 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.400
 the site 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.020
 it should be a crime to buy land 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.580
 black what they call 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.560
 then we are alone 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.560
 that is the advantage of this technique 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.250
 probably only salty because I am 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.350
 so what we are doing here is 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.510
 a restoration of the soil that is the salt 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.730
 is the salts of this soil are going to be 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.120
 diluted and we are reviewing your 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.120
 fertility 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.500
 then this 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.220
 and then assistance that supports us is 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.600
 with more constancy of then joyful 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.540
 they are doing a restoration of 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.510
 ground is to say now 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.810
 a reflection when you are putting urine 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.909
 what will happen to the leaf litter 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.399
 has more nutrients work goes 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.470
 decreasing the volume we become 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.789
 as dust goes flying how will it be 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.400
 that little ones 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.360
 it's going to be a compost and it's going to be 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.400
 excellent to make other others 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.400
 if it 's on land like it's not going to have 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.600
 we can not do anything against another box 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.160
 we put up litter and already 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.960
 we put this is going to be but less 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.620
 They even go to Carla to take the bass 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.299
 do this again 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.299
 they can only do in their homes 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.500
 according to danny that everyone 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.980
 want a legacy of my life 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.980
 more than 40 hours 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.000
 and this 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.540
 then now for the plot of the crop 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.160
 as it is a square box what 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.740
 we want is that there is maximum distance 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.600
 between the plants the maximum production 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.060
 in the minimum space but the maximum 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.270
 distance between plants if we put them 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.060
 very close to what is called 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.560
 Intraspecific competition speaking 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.450
 they will compete for water for 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.160
 nutrients by light for all 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.470
 then you have to see a distance 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.050
 minimum so that they do not get in the way 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.110
 with others we are going to draw a line that 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.820
 called quaking in such a way that if 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.820
 we unite the bushes in the form 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.090
 triangulitos the age in this case we 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.970
 there would be a 2 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.070
 45 that came out 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.610
 as a general rule with those planted in 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.100
 seedbed the depth of sowing is 12 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.720
 times the diameter of the seed in this 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.570
 case may be a little more time 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.040
 because we are planting direct 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.080
 so I need a volunteer to 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.540
 this kills other volunteers for 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.090
 strahman is killing another volunteer to 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.090
 this means 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.590
 good 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.920
 is water 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.940
 and one soaks the seeds because they believe 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.940
 that are put to soak 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:30.410
 the general seeds or that are more 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:34.100
 standards whether processes processes 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.130
 biochemicals by which the seed does not 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.690
 germinates when you put the water cut 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.889
 what we are doing is breaking the norm 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.430
 doing 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.590
 2 little seeds, finite times 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.620
 with your finger I also forget if you read 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.300
 something this face that you go to 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.939
 planting has to come with very good 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.490
 it vibrates to be assigned happy happy 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:58.830
 gender for your bitterness is what 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.069
 they know about attention this they are 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.810
 doing is a divine act is an act 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:07.169
 sublime because they are collaborating with the 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.879
 nature those plants are going to clean the 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.129
 atmosphere there are many gases of effect 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.029
 greenhouse up there among them the 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.250
 carbon oxide 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:18.150
 the plants are going to convert the dioxide 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.400
 of carbon in vegetable biomass come out 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.800
 then what they are doing makes a 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.949
 high sublime a divine act an act of 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.870
 love this is an act of love boys if 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.779
 you have bad if you come in this 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.400
 heart or if they come to the fake 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:35.029
 internet and when they come happy 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.029
 then yes 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.430
 then please even that is 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.650
 moment for you sow that 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.040
 they invite the children they teach the 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.800
 children this habit of planting saleh is a 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.410
 act of love that is very clear to them 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.610
 I am home to your plants in health if we 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.610
 they give love in that time 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.400
 and now 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:17.400
 Well now we have a garden 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:21.639
 seeded that we are going to do 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.680
 They will hang your bottle with piss you go 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.070
 to put a little bit of mouth like that for 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.070
 that ferment 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.150
 let's make a dilution of a few days 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.250
 That would be more or less is 100% true 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.340
 which is 10 percent or so 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:52.060
 like this we put the pee and what 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.980
 other we put it of water is clear already 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.440
 that we stir the peppered fed with 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.080
 the water now yes we go kill for it kills you 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.930
 we are putting then this also we 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.040
 help us to save water 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.040
 because we are coming 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:18.880
 now this this must be in the sun 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.220
 the less they do good is that it's going to 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.930
 germinate because it is in the shade because 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.090
 begin to be the seedlings we are going 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.460
 to rhyming the sun so that it starts to 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.080
 make photosynthesis and start generating 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.980
 the foods that are both from the plant 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.390
 like what we 're leaving 

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.230
 we 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:37.700
 what do you think about this practice 

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:41.810
 its good state then clap your hands are 

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.810
 just time 

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.230
 yes 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:55.350
 and so 

00:07:56.689 --> 00:08:00.849
 it goes out to the Gaul can return the two 

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:00.849
 branches
