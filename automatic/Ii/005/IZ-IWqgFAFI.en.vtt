00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
wheel separate from the car so that we

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.010 
wheel separate from the car so that we
can<00:01:12.030> animate

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
can animate

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.569

the next thing we would like to do is
smooth<00:01:42.460> out<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.789> surfaces<00:01:43.240> of<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.450> car<00:01:43.659> to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
smooth out the surfaces of the car to

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.749 
smooth out the surfaces of the car to
make<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.289> textures<00:01:44.799> look<00:01:44.979> better<00:01:45.220> inside<00:01:45.640> of

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
make the textures look better inside of

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.219 
make the textures look better inside of
iphone<00:01:46.090> 3<00:01:48.209> so<00:01:49.209> let's<00:01:49.390> select<00:01:49.569> the<00:01:49.840> parts<00:01:50.140> of

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
iphone 3 so let's select the parts of

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.380 
iphone 3 so let's select the parts of
the<00:01:50.319> car<00:01:50.500> we<00:01:50.679> wish<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:51.039> export<00:01:51.399> I<00:01:51.819> think<00:01:52.149> three

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
the car we wish to export I think three

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.389 
the car we wish to export I think three
groups<00:01:52.659> will<00:01:52.840> be<00:01:52.869> good<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.619> chassis<00:01:54.100> the

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
groups will be good the chassis the

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.789 
groups will be good the chassis the
front<00:01:54.670> tires<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.209> the<00:01:55.479> back<00:01:55.630> tires<00:01:55.929> so<00:01:56.649> let's

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
front tires and the back tires so let's

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.039 
front tires and the back tires so let's
go<00:01:56.950> ahead<00:01:57.069> and<00:01:57.220> do<00:01:57.459> the<00:01:57.580> chassis<00:01:57.850> so<00:01:58.299> deselect

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
go ahead and do the chassis so deselect

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.080 
go ahead and do the chassis so deselect
all<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.590> wheels<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.130> make<00:02:00.490> sure<00:02:00.670> only<00:02:00.850> the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
all the wheels and make sure only the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.469 
all the wheels and make sure only the
chassis<00:02:01.450> remains<00:02:02.490> then<00:02:03.490> export<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.209> they

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
chassis remains then export it and they

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:11.360 
chassis remains then export it and they
need<00:02:04.659> something

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.130 

alright<00:02:12.370> now<00:02:12.880> let's<00:02:13.090> deselect<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.690> chassis

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
alright now let's deselect the chassis

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.070 
alright now let's deselect the chassis
parts<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.830> reselect<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.370> front<00:02:15.640> tires

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.930 

now<00:02:21.620> we<00:02:21.680> want<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.100> do<00:02:22.250> something<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.640> little

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
now we want to do something a little

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.550 
now we want to do something a little
different<00:02:23.240> with<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.420> tires<00:02:23.660> instead<00:02:24.410> of

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
different with the tires instead of

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.230 
different with the tires instead of
aligning<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.250> ground<00:02:25.490> we<00:02:26.000> need<00:02:26.150> to

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
aligning it to the ground we need to

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.120 
aligning it to the ground we need to
line<00:02:26.450> them<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.900> center<00:02:27.200> this<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.740> because

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
line them to the center this is because

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.310 
line them to the center this is because
later<00:02:28.400> we'll<00:02:28.700> be<00:02:28.850> adding<00:02:29.060> animation<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.200> we

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
later we'll be adding animation so we

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.540 
later we'll be adding animation so we
should<00:02:30.500> make<00:02:30.680> sure<00:02:30.710> that<00:02:30.920> they<00:02:31.190> are<00:02:31.310> aligned

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
should make sure that they are aligned

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.500 
should make sure that they are aligned
to<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.850> center<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.660> wheels<00:02:32.870> will<00:02:33.080> rotate

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
to the center so the wheels will rotate

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.700 
to the center so the wheels will rotate
so<00:02:35.510> let's<00:02:35.690> export<00:02:36.110> them<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:36.560> name<00:02:36.800> them<00:02:38.710> then

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
so let's export them and name them then

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.170 
so let's export them and name them then
let's<00:02:39.890> do<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.130> exact<00:02:40.460> same<00:02:40.490> thing<00:02:40.940> for<00:02:41.090> the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
let's do the exact same thing for the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.560 
let's do the exact same thing for the
back<00:02:41.330> tires<00:02:41.630> align<00:02:42.560> them<00:02:42.710> to<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.980> center<00:02:43.570> next

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
back tires align them to the center next

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.510 
back tires align them to the center next
one

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
one

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.340 
one
all<00:02:46.940> right<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.540> let's<00:02:47.720> start<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:48.020> build<00:02:48.050> our

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
all right so let's start to build our

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.890 
all right so let's start to build our
whole<00:02:48.590> car<00:02:49.090> let's<00:02:50.090> start<00:02:50.360> first<00:02:50.690> with<00:02:50.780> our

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
whole car let's start first with our

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.470 
whole car let's start first with our
tires<00:02:51.290> but<00:02:52.160> before<00:02:52.490> we<00:02:52.610> throw<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.880> tires<00:02:53.120> into

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
tires but before we throw the tires into

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.630 
tires but before we throw the tires into
the<00:02:53.570> scene<00:02:53.870> let's<00:02:54.470> create<00:02:54.740> a<00:02:54.800> will<00:02:55.040> helper<00:02:55.430> to

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
the scene let's create a will helper to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.550 
the scene let's create a will helper to
make<00:02:55.760> our<00:02:55.910> wheels<00:02:56.120> go<00:02:56.270> round<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:56.720> round<00:02:56.780> so

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
make our wheels go round and round so

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.810 
make our wheels go round and round so
let's<00:02:57.740> add<00:02:57.950> in<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.220> Taurus

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
let's add in a Taurus

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.640 
let's add in a Taurus
make<00:02:59.300> sure<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.630> Taurus<00:02:59.960> is<00:03:00.110> aligned<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.410> the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
make sure the Taurus is aligned to the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.980 
make sure the Taurus is aligned to the
orange<00:03:01.010> we<00:03:01.850> want<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.180> use<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.360> Taurus<00:03:02.780> because

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
orange we want to use a Taurus because

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.510 
orange we want to use a Taurus because
it's<00:03:03.140> naturally<00:03:03.590> aligned<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.100> centre<00:03:04.370> as

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
it's naturally aligned to the centre as

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.850 
it's naturally aligned to the centre as
opposed<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.150> 3d<00:03:05.420> box<00:03:05.690> which<00:03:06.260> is<00:03:06.410> aligned<00:03:06.680> to

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
opposed to a 3d box which is aligned to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.330 
opposed to a 3d box which is aligned to
the<00:03:06.950> ground

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
the ground

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.130 
the ground
since<00:03:08.030> our<00:03:08.150> tires<00:03:08.390> are<00:03:08.600> aligned<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.990> the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
since our tires are aligned to the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.810 
since our tires are aligned to the
centre<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.860> Taurus<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:10.370> aligned<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.730> the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
centre and the Taurus is aligned to the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.970 
centre and the Taurus is aligned to the
centre<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:11.570> will<00:03:11.720> make<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:12.020> easier<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.500> animate

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
centre it will make it easier to animate

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.920 
centre it will make it easier to animate
the<00:03:13.370> rotation<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.090> wheel<00:03:14.240> using<00:03:14.840> the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
the rotation of the wheel using the

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.630 
the rotation of the wheel using the
Taurus<00:03:15.260> since<00:03:15.470> its<00:03:15.620> axis<00:03:16.010> will<00:03:16.130> be<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.370> centre

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
Taurus since its axis will be the centre

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.130 
Taurus since its axis will be the centre
and<00:03:16.910> not<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.300> bottom<00:03:17.600> face<00:03:19.660> then<00:03:20.660> let's<00:03:20.930> use<00:03:21.110> a

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
and not the bottom face then let's use a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.020 
and not the bottom face then let's use a
timeline<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.830> transform<00:03:22.310> keys<00:03:22.550> to<00:03:22.730> Casa

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
timeline and transform keys to Casa

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.300 
timeline and transform keys to Casa
Taurus<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.630> rotate<00:03:23.990> floor<00:03:24.260> then<00:03:24.890> move<00:03:25.100> down

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
Taurus to rotate floor then move down

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.430 
Taurus to rotate floor then move down
the<00:03:25.520> timeline<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.120> do<00:03:26.270> the<00:03:26.390> same<00:03:26.600> thing<00:03:26.840> and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
the timeline to do the same thing and

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.230 
the timeline to do the same thing and
continue<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:28.040> do<00:03:28.160> this<00:03:28.310> until<00:03:28.520> we<00:03:28.880> have<00:03:28.970> caused

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
continue to do this until we have caused

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:36.760 
continue to do this until we have caused
the<00:03:29.390> tourist<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.960> rotate<00:03:30.320> 360<00:03:31.100> degrees<00:03:35.710> now<00:03:36.710> we

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
the tourist to rotate 360 degrees now we

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.470 
the tourist to rotate 360 degrees now we
should<00:03:37.130> collect<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.580> animation<00:03:38.120> by<00:03:38.270> using

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
should collect the animation by using

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.330 
should collect the animation by using
the<00:03:38.720> collect<00:03:39.050> lip<00:03:39.290> function<00:03:39.770> on<00:03:39.920> our<00:03:40.100> timeline

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
the collect lip function on our timeline

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.030 
the collect lip function on our timeline
to<00:03:41.150> highlight<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.690> entire<00:03:41.780> animation<00:03:42.470> then

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
to highlight the entire animation then

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.070 
to highlight the entire animation then
right-click<00:03:43.580> on<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.760> and<00:03:44.030> choose<00:03:44.180> add<00:03:44.780> to

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
right-click on it and choose add to

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.820 
right-click on it and choose add to
library<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.710> then<00:03:46.220> name<00:03:46.460> it

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.320 

then<00:03:49.830> once<00:03:50.040> we<00:03:50.220> have<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.580> animation<00:03:50.910> clip

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
then once we have the animation clip

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.300 
then once we have the animation clip
saved<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.810> library<00:03:52.260> let's<00:03:52.800> delete<00:03:53.130> all

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
saved to the library let's delete all

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.580 
saved to the library let's delete all
those<00:03:53.460> other<00:03:53.730> transform<00:03:54.240> keys<00:03:57.350> then<00:03:58.350> let's

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
those other transform keys then let's

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.650 
those other transform keys then let's
open<00:03:58.710> up<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.160> perform<00:03:59.550> track<00:03:59.880> choose<00:04:00.510> the

first key and right click to add the

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.520 
first key and right click to add the
animation<00:04:03.180> from<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.750> library

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.839 

now<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:07.590> can<00:04:07.890> see<00:04:08.069> our<00:04:08.099> tourists<00:04:08.580> will<00:04:08.700> rotate

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
now you can see our tourists will rotate

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.630 
now you can see our tourists will rotate
using<00:04:09.450> animation<00:04:10.019> we<00:04:10.170> created<00:04:10.709> so<00:04:11.370> we<00:04:11.459> can

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
using animation we created so we can

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
performances of making aspirations

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.390 
performances of making aspirations
faster<00:04:15.599> or<00:04:15.780> slower<00:04:15.900> or<00:04:16.530> copying<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.250> pasting

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.110 

but<00:04:26.710> we<00:04:26.830> want<00:04:27.069> to<00:04:27.189> make<00:04:27.340> this<00:04:27.460> Taurus<00:04:27.789> into<00:04:28.060> a

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
but we want to make this Taurus into a

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.059 
but we want to make this Taurus into a
wheel<00:04:28.330> helper<00:04:28.780> that<00:04:29.289> way<00:04:29.469> we<00:04:29.620> can<00:04:29.800> use<00:04:29.949> it

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.069 
wheel helper that way we can use it

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.679 
wheel helper that way we can use it
again<00:04:30.340> and<00:04:30.490> again<00:04:30.580> in<00:04:30.789> other<00:04:31.090> projects<00:04:31.569> as

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:31.689 
again and again in other projects as

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.600 
again and again in other projects as
well<00:04:31.870> so<00:04:32.469> let's<00:04:32.650> add<00:04:32.830> this<00:04:33.039> tourist<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.520> our

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:42.999 
all right so let's assemble our car so

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.089 
all right so let's assemble our car so
we<00:04:43.119> first<00:04:43.389> add<00:04:43.629> in<00:04:43.809> our<00:04:43.959> will<00:04:44.139> help<00:04:44.379> then<00:04:44.979> we

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
we first add in our will help then we

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.489 
we first add in our will help then we
can<00:04:45.249> add<00:04:45.429> in<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.729> front<00:04:45.969> tires<00:04:46.349> once<00:04:47.349> the

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:47.499 
can add in the front tires once the

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:49.469 
can add in the front tires once the
front<00:04:47.649> tires<00:04:47.949> are<00:04:48.189> in<00:04:48.399> we<00:04:48.789> can<00:04:48.969> then<00:04:49.119> attach

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
front tires are in we can then attach

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.399 
front tires are in we can then attach
those<00:04:49.749> front<00:04:49.989> tires<00:04:50.229> to<00:04:50.649> the<00:04:50.769> will<00:04:51.099> helpers

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:52.409 
those front tires to the will helpers

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:54.989 
those front tires to the will helpers
but<00:04:53.409> we<00:04:53.559> don't<00:04:53.769> want<00:04:53.919> that<00:04:54.069> ugly<00:04:54.309> whitish

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:54.999 
but we don't want that ugly whitish

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.889 
but we don't want that ugly whitish
yellowish

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:55.899 
yellowish

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:58.199 
yellowish
whatever<00:04:56.199> color<00:04:56.529> ish<00:04:56.679> that<00:04:56.979> Taurus<00:04:57.429> is<00:04:57.610> so

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:58.209 
whatever color ish that Taurus is so

00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:00.239 
whatever color ish that Taurus is so
let's<00:04:58.389> go<00:04:58.509> down<00:04:58.719> to<00:04:58.749> the<00:04:59.050> opacity<00:04:59.349> and<00:04:59.979> change

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:00.249 
let's go down to the opacity and change

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:03.959 
let's go down to the opacity and change
it<00:05:00.369> to<00:05:00.399> zero<00:05:01.889> and<00:05:02.889> once<00:05:03.159> the<00:05:03.339> Taurus<00:05:03.669> system

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:03.969 
it to zero and once the Taurus system

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:06.449 
it to zero and once the Taurus system
capacity<00:05:04.119> is<00:05:04.659> now<00:05:04.809> zero<00:05:05.139> now<00:05:05.889> you<00:05:05.949> can<00:05:06.249> just

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:06.459 
capacity is now zero now you can just

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:08.040 
capacity is now zero now you can just
see<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.729> wheels<00:05:06.939> and<00:05:07.179> the<00:05:07.360> wheels<00:05:07.479> maintain

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
see the wheels and the wheels maintain

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.019 
see the wheels and the wheels maintain
the<00:05:08.199> animation<00:05:08.709> of<00:05:08.769> the<00:05:08.919> Taurus<00:05:09.219> so<00:05:09.759> let's<00:05:09.909> go

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:10.029 
the animation of the Taurus so let's go

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:11.969 
the animation of the Taurus so let's go
back<00:05:10.059> up<00:05:10.269> and<00:05:10.569> merge<00:05:10.869> the<00:05:11.139> two<00:05:11.289> so<00:05:11.679> that<00:05:11.709> way

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
back up and merge the two so that way

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.619 
back up and merge the two so that way
will<00:05:12.099> be<00:05:12.189> easier<00:05:12.519> first<00:05:12.759> position<00:05:13.449> those

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:13.629 
will be easier first position those

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:15.629 
will be easier first position those
wheels<00:05:13.839> anywhere<00:05:14.319> we<00:05:14.469> want<00:05:14.679> in<00:05:14.769> our<00:05:14.860> seat<00:05:15.129> but

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
wheels anywhere we want in our seat but

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.730 
wheels anywhere we want in our seat but
keep<00:05:15.909> the<00:05:16.059> animation<00:05:16.599> the<00:05:16.719> same

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.040 

now<00:05:22.340> let's<00:05:22.610> add<00:05:22.730> in<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:22.970> chassis<00:05:23.240> let's

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
now let's add in the chassis let's

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:33.600 
now let's add in the chassis let's
adjust<00:05:24.350> the<00:05:24.530> tires<00:05:24.770> into<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:25.190> right<00:05:25.370> place

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.820 

so<00:05:34.150> let's<00:05:34.330> now<00:05:34.479> add<00:05:34.720> in<00:05:34.960> some<00:05:35.169> reflection<00:05:35.710> to

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
so let's now add in some reflection to

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.110 
so let's now add in some reflection to
make<00:05:35.979> our<00:05:36.129> car<00:05:36.370> look<00:05:36.550> better

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
make our car look better

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.999 
make our car look better
so<00:05:37.389> let's<00:05:37.539> first<00:05:37.750> select<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.169> chassis<00:05:38.500> and

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
so let's first select the chassis and

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:46.310 
so let's first select the chassis and
add<00:05:39.250> inspection

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.920 

then<00:05:46.830> let's<00:05:47.010> go<00:05:47.160> to<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.400> brake<00:05:47.670> lights<00:05:47.940> with

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
then let's go to the brake lights with

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.279 
then let's go to the brake lights with
hello<00:05:49.440> as<00:05:49.620> well<00:05:50.389> make<00:05:51.389> sure<00:05:51.419> you<00:05:51.720> experiment

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
hello as well make sure you experiment

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.110 
hello as well make sure you experiment
with<00:05:52.320> all<00:05:52.530> kinds<00:05:52.830> of<00:05:52.889> different<00:05:53.070> low<00:05:53.400> types<00:05:53.669> to

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
with all kinds of different low types to

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.850 
with all kinds of different low types to
get<00:05:54.240> the<00:05:54.360> lights<00:05:54.539> just<00:05:54.930> right<00:05:55.169> so<00:05:55.740> we<00:05:55.830> can

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
get the lights just right so we can

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.560 
get the lights just right so we can
increase<00:05:56.250> the<00:05:56.490> strength<00:05:56.759> to<00:05:56.970> also<00:05:57.240> make<00:05:57.419> it<00:05:57.449> a

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
increase the strength to also make it a

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.230 
increase the strength to also make it a
little<00:05:57.690> brighter<00:05:58.430> then<00:05:59.430> we<00:05:59.669> can<00:05:59.820> do<00:05:59.910> the<00:06:00.060> same

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
little brighter then we can do the same

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:10.390 
little brighter then we can do the same
thing<00:06:00.479> to<00:06:00.600> the<00:06:00.720> headlights

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.310 

but<00:06:11.030> what<00:06:11.180> are<00:06:11.300> headlights<00:06:11.690> without<00:06:11.960> actual

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
but what are headlights without actual

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.920 
but what are headlights without actual
light<00:06:12.620> so<00:06:13.160> let's<00:06:13.610> attach<00:06:13.970> the<00:06:14.000> few<00:06:14.419> spotlights

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
light so let's attach the few spotlights

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.570 
light so let's attach the few spotlights
to<00:06:15.169> the<00:06:15.259> front<00:06:15.500> of<00:06:15.560> the<00:06:15.620> car<00:06:15.830> that<00:06:16.310> way<00:06:16.460> the

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
to the front of the car that way the

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.020 
to the front of the car that way the
headlights<00:06:16.910> actually<00:06:17.360> seem<00:06:17.540> to<00:06:17.570> function<00:06:19.030> and

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
headlights actually seem to function and

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.820 
headlights actually seem to function and
what<00:06:20.210> about<00:06:20.360> the<00:06:20.539> tires<00:06:20.840> we<00:06:21.289> should<00:06:21.440> add<00:06:21.590> in<00:06:21.740> a

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
what about the tires we should add in a

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.230 
what about the tires we should add in a
little<00:06:22.070> bit<00:06:22.160> of<00:06:22.250> reflection<00:06:22.669> to<00:06:22.699> the<00:06:22.880> rims<00:06:23.060> as

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
little bit of reflection to the rims as

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:32.959 
little bit of reflection to the rims as
well

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:32.969 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:35.549 

finally<00:06:33.969> I<00:06:34.149> think<00:06:34.389> a<00:06:34.539> red<00:06:34.809> car<00:06:35.110> will<00:06:35.259> be<00:06:35.349> more

00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:35.559 
finally I think a red car will be more

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:37.379 
finally I think a red car will be more
fun<00:06:35.889> so<00:06:36.279> let's<00:06:36.460> change<00:06:36.639> the<00:06:36.849> color<00:06:37.059> of<00:06:37.270> the

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:37.389 
fun so let's change the color of the

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.420 
fun so let's change the color of the
diffuse<00:06:37.809> and<00:06:37.960> the<00:06:38.050> ambient<00:06:38.619> to<00:06:38.919> have<00:06:39.009> a<00:06:39.069> shiny

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
diffuse and the ambient to have a shiny

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
diffuse and the ambient to have a shiny
red<00:06:39.729> car

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.960 

so<00:06:50.020> here's<00:06:50.230> my<00:06:50.440> finished<00:06:50.710> card<00:06:51.100> we<00:06:51.730> can<00:06:51.820> now

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
so here's my finished card we can now

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.790 
so here's my finished card we can now
add<00:06:52.210> in<00:06:52.360> some<00:06:52.570> scenery<00:06:52.810> as<00:06:53.080> well<00:06:53.290> to<00:06:53.530> change

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
add in some scenery as well to change

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.530 
add in some scenery as well to change
the<00:06:53.950> lighting<00:06:54.160> to<00:06:54.640> make<00:06:54.670> the<00:06:54.910> car<00:06:55.150> look<00:06:55.330> more

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
the lighting to make the car look more

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.780 
the lighting to make the car look more
cool<00:06:55.750> press<00:06:56.590> play<00:06:56.860> and<00:06:57.040> notice<00:06:57.280> how<00:06:57.370> my<00:06:57.520> tires

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
cool press play and notice how my tires

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.970 
cool press play and notice how my tires
are<00:06:57.880> rolling<00:06:58.210> but<00:06:58.660> loose<00:06:58.990> that<00:06:59.590> doesn't<00:06:59.890> look

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980 
are rolling but loose that doesn't look

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.950 
are rolling but loose that doesn't look
right<00:07:00.040> so<00:07:00.550> let's<00:07:01.060> add<00:07:01.210> in<00:07:01.360> some<00:07:01.390> transport

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
right so let's add in some transport

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.870 
right so let's add in some transport
animation<00:07:02.500> to<00:07:02.650> the<00:07:02.680> car<00:07:02.950> so<00:07:03.490> that<00:07:03.520> the<00:07:03.700> car

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880 
animation to the car so that the car

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.570 
animation to the car so that the car
actually<00:07:04.090> seems<00:07:04.450> to<00:07:04.600> be<00:07:04.690> moving<00:07:05.220> first<00:07:06.220> find<00:07:06.490> a

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
actually seems to be moving first find a

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.950 
actually seems to be moving first find a
point<00:07:06.730> on<00:07:06.880> the<00:07:07.000> timeline<00:07:07.240> and<00:07:07.570> create<00:07:07.930> a

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
point on the timeline and create a

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.020 
point on the timeline and create a
transform<00:07:08.530> key<00:07:08.710> then<00:07:09.310> once<00:07:09.490> you<00:07:09.670> create<00:07:10.000> that

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
transform key then once you create that

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.240 
transform key then once you create that
key<00:07:10.480> we<00:07:10.990> can<00:07:11.140> then<00:07:11.320> move<00:07:11.530> the<00:07:11.710> car<00:07:11.920> into<00:07:12.190> a

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
key we can then move the car into a

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.420 
key we can then move the car into a
different<00:07:12.520> position

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.879 

once<00:07:18.090> the<00:07:18.210> car<00:07:18.419> is<00:07:18.509> in<00:07:18.630> position<00:07:19.169> then<00:07:19.650> we<00:07:19.740> can

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:19.889 
once the car is in position then we can

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:22.040 
once the car is in position then we can
press<00:07:20.100> play<00:07:20.310> the<00:07:20.940> car<00:07:21.180> will<00:07:21.360> move<00:07:21.509> from<00:07:21.690> first

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
press play the car will move from first

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.290 
press play the car will move from first
position<00:07:22.560> to<00:07:22.830> the<00:07:22.979> second<00:07:23.310> position<00:07:23.400> now<00:07:24.180> the

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 
position to the second position now the

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.580 
position to the second position now the
car<00:07:24.570> looks<00:07:24.780> like<00:07:24.840> it's<00:07:25.080> really<00:07:25.350> driving

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590 
car looks like it's really driving

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.390 
car looks like it's really driving
across<00:07:25.949> the<00:07:26.039> terrain<00:07:27.680> so<00:07:28.680> this<00:07:28.800> is<00:07:28.979> how<00:07:29.100> we<00:07:29.160> can

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 
across the terrain so this is how we can

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.249 
across the terrain so this is how we can
take<00:07:29.430> a<00:07:29.639> car<00:07:29.970> from<00:07:30.000> Sketchup<00:07:30.660> and<00:07:30.840> make<00:07:31.139> it

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:31.259 
take a car from Sketchup and make it

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:33.170 
take a car from Sketchup and make it
into<00:07:31.470> a<00:07:31.530> realistic<00:07:32.100> sports<00:07:32.280> car<00:07:32.580> and<00:07:32.729> animated

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
into a realistic sports car and animated

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.960 
into a realistic sports car and animated
in<00:07:33.270> iclone<00:07:33.630> three
