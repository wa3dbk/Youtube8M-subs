today we're taking a look at the RBZ
skates<00:00:10.320> from<00:00:10.800> CCM<00:00:11.450> there's<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.540> lot<00:00:12.780> of

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
skates from CCM there's a lot of

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.810 
skates from CCM there's a lot of
exciting<00:00:13.349> stuff<00:00:13.380> going<00:00:13.889> on<00:00:13.980> with<00:00:14.160> these<00:00:14.309> so

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
exciting stuff going on with these so

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.740 
exciting stuff going on with these so
let's<00:00:15.030> get<00:00:15.179> started

combination of light weight and
stiffness<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:32.159> fact<00:01:32.850> CCM<00:01:33.360> claims<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.810> it's

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979

24% stiffer than the MU plus crazy light

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.749 
24% stiffer than the MU plus crazy light
so<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.439> really<00:01:37.829> get<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.009> lot<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.549> lateral

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
so you really get a lot of lateral

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.480 
so you really get a lot of lateral
