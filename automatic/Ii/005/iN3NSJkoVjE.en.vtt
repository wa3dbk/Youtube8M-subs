00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.290 
you can still see the little trim right
around<00:00:24.960> here<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.740> would<00:00:26.640> recommend<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.180> you

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
around here I would recommend that you

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.880 
around here I would recommend that you
take<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:27.720> piece<00:00:28.020> off<00:00:28.230> before<00:00:28.590> installing

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
take this piece off before installing

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.560 
take this piece off before installing
the<00:00:29.130> dash<00:00:29.340> kit<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.850> go<00:00:29.970> ahead<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.420> maybe

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the dash kit and go ahead and maybe

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.569 
the dash kit and go ahead and maybe
paint<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.050> black<00:00:31.350> because<00:00:32.130> once<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.369> get<00:00:32.460> it

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
paint that black because once you get it

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.940 
paint that black because once you get it
on<00:00:32.669> there<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.970> kid's<00:00:33.180> gonna<00:00:33.329> stay<00:00:33.800> but<00:00:34.800> as

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
on there that kid's gonna stay but as

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.610 
on there that kid's gonna stay but as
you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.220> see<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.579> covers<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:37.500> entire

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
you can see it covers the entire

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.840 
you can see it covers the entire
steering<00:00:38.340> column<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:40.670> obviously<00:00:41.670> this

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
steering column and obviously this

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.340 
steering column and obviously this
drives<00:00:42.180> me<00:00:42.360> crazy<00:00:42.630> right<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.230> little

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
drives me crazy right here this little

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.440 
drives me crazy right here this little
piece<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:43.950> notice<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:44.820> all<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> way<00:00:45.180> back

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
piece but notice it's all the way back

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.540 
piece but notice it's all the way back
so<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.440> bad<00:00:46.620> cut<00:00:46.950> from<00:00:47.100> rimming

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
so this is just a bad cut from rimming

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.549 
so this is just a bad cut from rimming
this<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.390> really<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> only<00:00:48.930> piece<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.320> kit

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
this is really the only piece of the kit

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.350 
this is really the only piece of the kit
that<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.610> kind<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.850> mounts<00:00:51.180> off<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
that I can see that kind of mounts off a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.750 
that I can see that kind of mounts off a
little<00:00:51.629> bit<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.710> may<00:00:52.950> be<00:00:53.010> hard<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
little bit it may be hard to get the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.310 
little bit it may be hard to get the
breakout<00:00:54.210> right<00:00:54.450> there<00:00:54.750> because<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.200> the<00:00:55.289> way

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
breakout right there because of the way

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.910 
breakout right there because of the way
the<00:00:55.559> kit<00:00:55.770> mounts<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.680> there

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the kit mounts but see it's on there

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.369 
the kit mounts but see it's on there
together<00:00:59.899> goes<00:01:00.899> all<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.230> way<00:01:01.350> back<00:01:03.229> covers<00:01:04.229> on

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
together goes all the way back covers on

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.969 
together goes all the way back covers on
the<00:01:04.529> dash<00:01:05.179> right<00:01:06.179> there<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:08.549> overhead<00:01:09.060> piece

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
the dash right there the overhead piece

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.209 
the dash right there the overhead piece
all<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.009> the<00:01:11.429> dash<00:01:11.639> this<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.749> another<00:01:13.170> kind<00:01:14.130> of

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
all of the dash this is another kind of

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.129 
all of the dash this is another kind of
mistake<00:01:14.579> right<00:01:14.759> here<00:01:14.939> by<00:01:15.090> rimming<00:01:15.479> see<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:16.139 
mistake right here by rimming see the

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:18.069 
mistake right here by rimming see the
kit<00:01:16.380> doesn't<00:01:16.619> come<00:01:16.950> all<00:01:17.219> the<00:01:17.520> way<00:01:17.549> together

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
kit doesn't come all the way together

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:19.780 
kit doesn't come all the way together
kind<00:01:19.079> of<00:01:19.139> has<00:01:19.259> yeah

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790

kind of has yeah
right<00:01:19.880> there<00:01:20.090> but<00:01:20.960> once<00:01:21.170> it's<00:01:21.320> in<00:01:21.500> it<00:01:21.830> still

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
right there but once it's in it still
