00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 so hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.000
 slash a new let's play 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:14.719
 tutorial today I show you how to 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.940
 a medieval wooden house 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.150
 then you take this one at the beginning 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.170
 then the new fabric bedrock and wool 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.300
 Of course, wood is a wooden house 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:33.529
 then you take this at the beginning 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.529
 Floor plan of ten times ten so exactly 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:42.570
 then you make the corners so high 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:46.110
 So of course you have to do all this 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.629
 look a bit old-fashioned like you 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.640
 Here you can see that one has for the idea 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.149
 to be familiar with history 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.789
 you have such things earlier you have 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:04.219
 yes, quite often seen everywhere before 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.219
 and then we'll pack this in here 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.560
 that's how we get to it 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:18.960
 next material is this i know 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:22.500
 not exactly as it is called but 20,000 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:29.520
 pipapo like that and then of course holzhausen 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:31.200
 very clearly comes out of there right there 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.500
 you already have been here already 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.119
 times ever in the display is 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.490
 Of course, everything has 100 percent live 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.959
 here you can even the floor plan 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:51.720
 recognizing quite well has such a form of 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:55.459
 you honor and then you were right here 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.459
 the streamer toward each 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.179
 the second floor then here 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.069
 bedroom or you need something else 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:10.789
 that's exactly what this is for her 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.789
 bedroom hung 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:36.440
 and I believe right here so you can 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.530
 of course still vary 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:46.460
 I'll show you some more 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:50.730
 variations here briefly you could too 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.820
 At the same time , build something here 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:59.750
 for this is now only times only 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.750
 small example like that 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.160
 exactly one connects here as one sees 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.870
 the bedroom with the dining room 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:17.080
 so exactly 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.390
 and then you have it and I would 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.520
 say subscribe to leichenteilen 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.710
 do not favor and do not spread 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.870
 to forget 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.300
 I do not know if I mentioned licon 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.860
