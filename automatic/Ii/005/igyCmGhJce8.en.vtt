00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.339
 the google nexus 4 many hardly know it 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.810
 someone has because it is constantly 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.370
 sold out 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.990
 at android could be one of the first 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.170
 Get hold of models and here is ours 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.160
 impression after two months of continuous use 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.810
 First of all something for a short time 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.430
 You really have to work with that 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.560
 do not say much because the nexus 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.430
 percent lg has excellent work here 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.230
 done 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.090
 you just see the volume rocker 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.890
 the left side and the bottom side with 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.350
 the micro usb connection and the branch 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.570
 screw and it all makes a lot 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.240
 stable impression of wobbles nothing under 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.329
 scarcely anything else sees the device 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.920
 top off although only 300 euro costs for 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.270
 This noble look is provided by the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.130
 small metal plate on the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.810
 back placed under the glass 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.730
 and the light became different 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.220
 then what do you really think 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.990
 Spacy glitter effect but that provides 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.370
 nexus 4 can do even better than that 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.860
 most other smartphones 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.170
 It supports the new ski standard 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.640
 written to the wireless charging qi 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.930
 and there are already 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.360
 corresponding accessories 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.330
 Here you can see the charging station of 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.619
 sens costs about 55 euros and the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.420
 put somewhere in the apartment 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.310
 can if you then come home 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.670
 put the nexus on it simply the blue 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.829
 lamp lights up when switched on 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.289
 we see the android system in the 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.420
 latest version 4.2 jelly bean 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.340
 That's a big advantage of the nexus 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.039
 series that you always first the newest 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.899
 software gets and here is the now 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.210
 Direct access to the google 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.799
 knowledge service google now to see the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.200
 you stand out of the lock screen 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.950
 but we are leaving now 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.600
 not out 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.609
 we prefer to look at the homescreen 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.310
 and the main menu and how to get there very much 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:50.689
 Everything can see and see 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.310
 reacts fluidly and without delay 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.990
 the device gives itself no at all 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.969
 nakedness the android system makes it 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.200
 really great fun 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.759
 ok now the company will google that 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.889
 offers on the home page with a 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.259
 Search term and there is an important 

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:06.749
 update from android 4.2 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.459
 namely the improved keyboard with the 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:09.869
 I can text second now 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.030
 Enter by finger 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.100
 just fish over the letter without 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.380
 what the input pretty much 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.630
 accelerated and if we google now 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.160
 a concrete second question then comes 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.319
 also a concrete answer back 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.180
 So instead of any left to 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.210
 wikipedia will show me then just 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.340
 eg the height 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.400
 of the eiffel tower 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.690
 wish also further additional information 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.580
 the new quick are also practical 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.710
 settings via the status bar of 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.810
 android 4.2 achieved if they 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.460
 pull down then you see and then 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.810
 also the symbol top right then tip 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.130
 do you have access to the most important 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.510
 Features of the phone 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.700
 you can about the display brightness 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.980
 down when the battery is running out 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.930
 you can turn off wlan you can in 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.180
 change the complete settings menu 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.560
 almost everything you need is just one 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.260
 fingertip away 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.150
 google is also strong in the camera menu 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.190
 Hand applied if I longer on the 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.750
 focus ring in preview with the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.140
 I can focus objects 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.310
 then a circular menu will appear 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.560
 this shows the access to all 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.200
 settings allowed and also applies here 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.000
 again the access is intuitively solved 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.760
 By the way, back in the same way 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.560
 picture gallery 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.540
 simply from right to left over the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.220
 Pretend and you can already 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.230
 through all your snapshots 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.810
 scroll and if you then click one 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.490
 symbol bottom right then you can tap 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.360
 she directly on the next four 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.090
 to edit 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.610
 you can use filter for example 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.950
 and the photo so a black and white note 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.840
 miss you can cut it or 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.890
 the contrasts and the brightness 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.780
 change 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.360
 google packs a whole photo here 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.520
 construction kit with on the nexus 4 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.290
 but you do not always want to be productive 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.540
 or be creative but sometimes 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.100
 also just have fun and also 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.020
 of course there are apps for that 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.210
 example the brand new game temple rank 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.770
 two of them just in the play store 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.170
 has appeared and already more than five 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.060
 was downloaded millions of times the 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.650
 action game is great fun and that 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.140
 not only lies in the beautiful 3d 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.450
 graphic but also very fast-paced 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.190
 if you only have one second 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.700
 do not pay attention then get the 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.930
 monkey and who wants to throw that okay 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.810
 Let's take a look at the conclusion 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.489
 youtube and not for you one 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.840
 great star trek trailer show 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.150
 but the high quality of the 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.850
 Presentation to demonstrate the nexus 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.350
 Displays a mighty 4.7 inches tall and 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.360
 resolves to sharp 1280 x 768 pixels and 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.460
 the presentation does not distort either 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.009
 strong if you use the device for example 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.319
 I like the crisp presentation 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:41.169
 the lcd also much better than the 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:43.569
 example the amulet on the galaxy s s 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.940
 3 but of course that is a matter of taste 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.440
 However, it is beyond question that that 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.539
 nexus four among the currently best 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.539
 smartphones heard on this planet
