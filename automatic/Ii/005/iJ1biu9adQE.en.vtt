here<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:28.320> holds<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:29.010> whole<00:03:29.220> day<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:30.390> to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
here it holds the whole day and that to

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.410 
here it holds the whole day and that to
me<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.930> was<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.110> wonder<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:31.799> for<00:03:32.340> curl<00:03:32.579> this<00:03:33.150> does

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
me it was a wonder so for curl this does

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.759 
me it was a wonder so for curl this does
do<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.780> gives<00:03:33.989> you<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.079> really<00:03:34.260> nice<00:03:34.440> curve

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
do it gives you a really nice curve

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.819 
do it gives you a really nice curve
within<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.700> last<00:03:35.820> now<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.630> formula<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.590> a

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
within the the last now the formula is a

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.030 
within the the last now the formula is a
kind<00:03:38.519> of<00:03:38.670> more<00:03:38.910> dry<00:03:39.299> side<00:03:39.660> formula<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.799> does

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
kind of more dry side formula it does

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.100 
kind of more dry side formula it does
build<00:03:41.310> on<00:03:41.549> itself<00:03:41.880> very<00:03:42.150> nicely<00:03:42.480> so<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.870> can

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
build on itself very nicely so you can

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.600 
build on itself very nicely so you can
get<00:03:43.260> about<00:03:43.500> three<00:03:43.799> coats<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.220> this<00:03:44.370> without

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
get about three coats of this without

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.150 
get about three coats of this without
looking<00:03:44.910> clumpy<00:03:45.450> or<00:03:45.630> over<00:03:45.900> spidery<00:03:46.470> which<00:03:47.040> I

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
looking clumpy or over spidery which I

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.789 
looking clumpy or over spidery which I
thought<00:03:47.310> was<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.519> very<00:03:47.790> very<00:03:48.000> very<00:03:48.060> nice<00:03:48.450> thing

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
thought was a very very very nice thing

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.590 
thought was a very very very nice thing
so<00:03:49.799> it<00:03:49.860> does<00:03:50.010> build<00:03:50.250> on<00:03:50.459> very<00:03:50.640> nicely<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.360> a

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
so it does build on very nicely it is a

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.690 
so it does build on very nicely it is a
jet<00:03:51.930> black<00:03:52.200> mascara<00:03:52.560> when<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.040> goes<00:03:53.220> on<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.579> is

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
jet black mascara when it goes on it is

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.490 
jet black mascara when it goes on it is
very<00:03:53.970> very<00:03:54.060> very<00:03:54.329> black<00:03:54.630> it's<00:03:54.840> not<00:03:54.989> grave<00:03:55.260> like

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
very very very black it's not grave like

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.920 
very very very black it's not grave like
it's<00:03:55.709> not<00:03:55.890> brown<00:03:56.519> black<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:57.090> is<00:03:57.239> just<00:03:57.660> straight

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
it's not brown black it is just straight

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.780 
it's not brown black it is just straight
black<00:03:57.959> mascara<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:58.799> that's<00:03:59.010> also<00:03:59.220> fantastic

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
black mascara so that's also fantastic

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.050 
black mascara so that's also fantastic
and<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:01.500> didn't<00:04:01.860> flake<00:04:02.130> too<00:04:02.430> much<00:04:02.579> of<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.910> day

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
and it didn't flake too much of the day

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.250 
and it didn't flake too much of the day
I<00:04:03.090> did<00:04:03.329> notice<00:04:03.480> when<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.750> was<00:04:03.870> hitting<00:04:04.019> about

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
I did notice when I was hitting about

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.840 
I did notice when I was hitting about
the<00:04:04.500> eight<00:04:04.739> hour<00:04:04.980> mark<00:04:05.280> but<00:04:05.430> I<00:04:05.489> did<00:04:05.670> notice

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
the eight hour mark but I did notice

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.060 
the eight hour mark but I did notice
very<00:04:06.299> small<00:04:06.720> tiny<00:04:06.989> flecks<00:04:07.350> of<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.709> bit<00:04:07.860> of<00:04:07.950> a

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
very small tiny flecks of a bit of a

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.340 
very small tiny flecks of a bit of a
mascara<00:04:08.430> but<00:04:09.090> nothing<00:04:09.600> too<00:04:09.900> much<00:04:10.049> that<00:04:10.230> you'd

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
mascara but nothing too much that you'd

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.630 
mascara but nothing too much that you'd
worry<00:04:10.530> about<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:10.799> they<00:04:10.859> were<00:04:10.980> very<00:04:11.100> dry<00:04:11.459> that

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
worry about and they were very dry that

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.039 
worry about and they were very dry that
you<00:04:11.730> could<00:04:12.000> wipe<00:04:12.180> them<00:04:12.390> away<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.750> not<00:04:12.840> have<00:04:13.019> a

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
you could wipe them away and not have a

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.530 
you could wipe them away and not have a
problem<00:04:13.350> so<00:04:13.650> that<00:04:13.680> on<00:04:14.370> itself<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.209> shouldn't

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
problem so that on itself it shouldn't

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.449 
problem so that on itself it shouldn't
flake<00:04:15.780> but<00:04:16.049> it's<00:04:16.440> not<00:04:16.709> such<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:16.950> big<00:04:17.250> hassle

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
flake but it's not such a big hassle

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.370 
flake but it's not such a big hassle
that<00:04:17.669> you<00:04:17.789> can<00:04:17.910> just<00:04:18.060> get<00:04:18.209> rid<00:04:18.329> of<00:04:18.390> them<00:04:18.660> so

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
that you can just get rid of them so

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.110 
that you can just get rid of them so
overall<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:19.829> would<00:04:20.010> say<00:04:20.220> this<00:04:20.549> is<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.729> hotmess

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
overall I would say this is a hotmess

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.339 
overall I would say this is a hotmess

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
that have a beautiful curl to them

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.520 
that have a beautiful curl to them
and<00:04:27.090> you<00:04:27.210> don't<00:04:27.330> have<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.630> use<00:04:27.780> this<00:04:27.990> tool<00:04:28.290> of

mascara<00:04:31.200> I<00:04:31.590> would<00:04:32.100> repurchase<00:04:32.340> this<00:04:32.850> the

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
mascara I would repurchase this the

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.910 
mascara I would repurchase this the
moment<00:04:33.330> that<00:04:33.420> it<00:04:33.540> is<00:04:33.720> over<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.140> do<00:04:34.290> like<00:04:34.620> that<00:04:34.650> it

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
moment that it is over I do like that it

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.190 
moment that it is over I do like that it
is<00:04:35.040> a<00:04:35.070> more<00:04:35.310> dryer<00:04:35.670> formula<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.660> only<00:04:37.020> thing<00:04:37.140> i

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
is a more dryer formula the only thing i

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.140 
is a more dryer formula the only thing i
will<00:04:37.260> say<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:37.860> kind<00:04:38.280> of<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.490> con<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:38.760> if<00:04:39.060> it

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
will say that is kind of a con and if it

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.240 
will say that is kind of a con and if it
does<00:04:39.330> bother<00:04:39.570> you<00:04:39.720> don't<00:04:40.080> get<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.650> does<00:04:41.040> go

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
does bother you don't get it it does go

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.850 
does bother you don't get it it does go
a<00:04:41.280> little<00:04:41.460> bit<00:04:41.670> hard<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.090> crunchy<00:04:42.560> but<00:04:43.560> that's

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
a little bit hard and crunchy but that's

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.590 
a little bit hard and crunchy but that's
only<00:04:44.070> if<00:04:44.280> you<00:04:44.460> build<00:04:44.700> up<00:04:44.820> on<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.120> third<00:04:45.300> layer

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
only if you build up on the third layer

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.840 
only if you build up on the third layer
if<00:04:45.930> you<00:04:46.110> stick<00:04:46.410> with<00:04:46.440> two<00:04:46.800> it's<00:04:47.100> a<00:04:47.460> little<00:04:47.700> less

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
if you stick with two it's a little less
