got this first flap in between these two

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.430 
got this first flap in between these two
pieces<00:00:51.550> are<00:00:51.730> gonna<00:00:51.879> be<00:00:52.180> a<00:00:52.210> high<00:00:52.750> density<00:00:52.960> foams

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
pieces are gonna be a high density foams

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.709 
pieces are gonna be a high density foams
on<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:53.770> side<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.280> then<00:00:54.760> some<00:00:55.000> medium<00:00:55.360> density

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
on the side and then some medium density

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.660 
on the side and then some medium density
perforated<00:00:56.410> foams<00:00:56.680> you<00:00:57.160> could<00:00:57.309> see<00:00:57.520> the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
perforated foams you could see the

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.639 
perforated foams you could see the
segmentations<00:00:58.480> all<00:00:58.719> the<00:00:58.809> way<00:00:58.899> throughout<00:00:59.230> so

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
segmentations all the way throughout so

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.680 
segmentations all the way throughout so
this<00:01:00.100> is<00:01:00.219> going<00:01:00.340> to<00:01:00.399> be<00:01:00.520> a<00:01:00.579> nice<00:01:00.940> real<00:01:01.390> mobile

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
this is going to be a nice real mobile

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.810 
this is going to be a nice real mobile
pad<00:01:02.050> giving<00:01:02.710> that<00:01:02.980> real<00:01:03.309> high<00:01:03.550> level

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
pad giving that real high level

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.120 
pad giving that real high level
protection<00:01:04.210> now<00:01:05.170> going<00:01:05.619> up<00:01:05.830> into<00:01:06.040> the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
protection now going up into the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.039 
protection now going up into the
clavicle<00:01:06.760> guard<00:01:06.970> this<00:01:07.180> is<00:01:07.360> a<00:01:07.390> nice<00:01:07.659> high

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
clavicle guard this is a nice high

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.500 
clavicle guard this is a nice high
density<00:01:08.560> foam<00:01:08.799> wraps<00:01:09.549> around<00:01:09.760> front<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.360> back

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
density foam wraps around front to back

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.969 
density foam wraps around front to back
completely<00:01:11.110> so<00:01:11.290> you've<00:01:11.470> got<00:01:11.590> some<00:01:11.770> really

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
completely so you've got some really

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.740

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
shoulder caps this is what we're gonna

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.740 
shoulder caps this is what we're gonna
see<00:01:15.189> a<00:01:15.220> big<00:01:15.490> difference<00:01:15.640> from<00:01:15.970> these<00:01:16.210> pads<00:01:16.509> are

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
see a big difference from these pads are

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.690 
see a big difference from these pads are
that<00:01:16.960> from<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.439> other<00:01:17.619> Easton<00:01:18.189> shoulder<00:01:18.490> pads

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
that from the other Easton shoulder pads

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.200 
that from the other Easton shoulder pads
this<00:01:19.479> is<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.689> really<00:01:20.110> big<00:01:20.409> winding<00:01:21.210> shoulder

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
this is a really big winding shoulder

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.539 
this is a really big winding shoulder
cat<00:01:22.420> there's<00:01:23.290> not<00:01:23.560> a<00:01:23.590> whole<00:01:23.830> lot<00:01:23.860> of<00:01:24.159> phones<00:01:24.369> in

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
cat there's not a whole lot of phones in

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.429 
cat there's not a whole lot of phones in
this<00:01:24.670> there's<00:01:24.909> one<00:01:24.970> big<00:01:25.360> plastic<00:01:25.630> insert<00:01:26.259> that

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
this there's one big plastic insert that
