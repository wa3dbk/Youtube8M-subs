00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.990
 the point is we are here where he was 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.120
 that of the expo 2008 in zaragoza we see that 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.309
 is now in transformation in 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.690
 renovation of buildings 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.610
 that were of pavilions there are the 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.180
 last pavilions of communities 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.039
 autonomous 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.640
 there is the one of aragÃ³n good all this 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.040
 will be expected in the future a wind 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.480
 next business percent and of 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.670
 business we know some operators 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.010
 working and what we are going to visit here 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.020
 is the aquarium of zaragoza this building 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.550
 that we see here that is the only pavilion 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.739
 in the building of the expo that continues 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.929
 in operation after the closure 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.249
 without any change it is a magnificent 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.769
 aquarium the largest water europe 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.749
 sweet where are we going to see species 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.420
 animals in the environment 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:53.270
 represented of five great rivers of 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.220
 world let's see it 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.950
 good the first of the rivers that we see 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.130
 represented here we see that it 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.050
 reproduces a bit of the physiognomy of 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.330
 message of the place in this case is the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.210
 nilo but black has more than 6000 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.240
 kilometers long and good we see what 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.979
 what is the fauna and vegetation of the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.510
 equatorial Africa in this place also 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.180
 we feel even the humidity sometimes gets 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.320
 they hear the sounds also of these from 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.240
 these places and we see different fish and 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.920
 animals anyway within a 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.799
 moment let's move on from the part 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.240
 in the tropical part of the nile we pass to 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.950
 course under this will happen in all 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.360
 rivers of the upper course the lower course and in 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.250
 this course evidently under the and what 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.950
 that we can not see anything other than 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.530
 the famous Nile crocodiles have 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.980
 here and there we have some fantastic 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.800
 there we can see it 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.860
 like all reptiles have some 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.270
 lamps they use to make each other 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.130
 since they can not be heated with light 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.050
 of the sun let's forget that the reptiles all 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.520
 they just appeared here a 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.890
 crocodile menacing with mouth open 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.690
 Awesome 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.750
 because to threaten us obviously does not 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.030
 has seen here perched on the glass 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.720
 the channel is spectacular there are two 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.720
 copies here 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.329
 to the reptiles also the turtles 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.010
 snakes have those cold water 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.569
 cold-blooded forgiveness because they had to 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.549
 warm up so as not to die sing your 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.470
 blood and here you can not do it with a 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.760
 alone so they do it with those lamps 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.200
 that have been put to the effect 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.200
 awesome crocodiles 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.790
 the second river that we see here is the 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.819
 better in which we can see for example 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:53.680
 some sharks 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.239
 yes these little fish of just 15 20 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.409
 logical centimeters are sharks the 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.209
 family and sharks and others that from 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.010
 the way they clearly have sharks 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.069
 but see sharks there in that family 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.599
 many types and some are very 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.129
 small and absolutely harmless 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.500
 like these and of course they are water 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.910
 where there are some rivers well here 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.800
 we see in this 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.090
 in this reproduction of the high course of 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.530
 I'm talking about a river 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.320
 Asian that goes through all of China 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.000
 and therefore has a tropical zone 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.000
 how wonderful the prices here 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.990
 the mekong river its use under dare to the 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.460
 programs on the Chinese side and some 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.580
 of paddy fields here we can see by 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:34.570
 supposedly beautiful Asian carps or 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.290
 this curious turtle great fracture 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.290
 of soft shell 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.100
 and other animals that we see in this area 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.530
 we can see for example here 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.620
 a knife fish 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.580
 this fish will have 40 in 50 centimeters 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.110
 length 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.120
 a process that has the shape of a knife 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.250
 here are the needlefish to deal with 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.530
 are here 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.120
 species needles 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.830
 I love to say because they call themselves 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.780
 Of course 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.780
 and others say what species 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.870
 always the market area we find 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.640
 some small species 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.800
 tiny ones of small size like these 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.310
 who are the fighters of fasts 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.110
 reds is therefore not wrong if I say 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.450
 that is a female and the male is more 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.480
 back with end the tail fins a lot 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.490
 the biggest more showy are at the bottom 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.420
 can see how it looks from another good blue 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.850
 any other culture not be 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.080
 separated by this this separation 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.560
 because if the males were together 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.090
 they would fight to kill themselves where 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.530
 There may be a male with females but in 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.340
 the two males together in this same 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.340
 place we can also see 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.310
 we can see also for example some 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.580
 transparent fish look down there 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.139
 is it so 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.810
 you can see through them between 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.960
 all are piled up and spaces 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.960
 little ones 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.340
 very interesting in this place too 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.850
 we see some tiny and tiny tents the 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.850
 mosquito fish 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.900
 and the rest how it moves 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.580
 well in the guard of zaragoza we have 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.840
 apart from the five great rivers that 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.910
 are represented we also have a 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.130
 huge water tank water tank 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.840
 The world's largest sweet it is 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.430
 they call is the great river of the world nine 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.930
 million liters with are the big 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.790
 fish this for example is a branch of the 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.530
 giant amazons we have in two meters 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.550
 length is right on top of me because 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.650
 here 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.170
 we went under this this huge 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.330
 tank we will pass six seven times as 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.940
 along the path next to this this 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.620
 fantastic huge freshwater tank and 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.900
 here we come to the amazon river where 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.310
 we can see then this beautiful is 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.620
 beautiful setting made by way of 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:55.550
 Amazonian jungle on two levels between 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.740
 other animals we see the Amazonian caiman 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.620
 what's here 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.050
 here we have it 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.870
 majestic half the size 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.670
 nile crocodiles but that does not stop 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.510
 to be awesome 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:13.840
 good infinity of fish of all 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:17.669
 sizes and colors tortoises 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.669
 They are not very big but they are terrapins 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.550
 we have snooping 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.100
 let's see if the fingers pass more than 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.880
 near 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.880
 there they add up 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.640
 and good also the catfish this fish 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.280
 amazonian cat measures a meter 30 in a 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.790
 huge mouth is carnivore of two colors 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.790
 beautiful 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.270
 and always in the Amazon region we 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.680
 we find the line also exists 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.610
 the stingrays will 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.610
 try it on the other side 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:56.520
 there is hitting the wall 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.520
 for the 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.880
 Glass
