00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.089
 good afternoon dear friends today we are with 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:13.780
 you compare two phones land rover a8 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:17.080
 So he and H5 Hummer and immediately draw 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.240
 attention to the difference is harmful facial 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.770
 panel land rover a8 is present 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.610
 mechanical reset buttons home 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:31.150
 page 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:34.660
 and under menu x x mirage-5 these are all buttons 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.030
 performed in sensory performance on 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.570
 right side we can see u wlan 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.230
 driver di reset button and power on 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.930
 Shutting down ondraw Hammer Shkatov 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.380
 volume buttons on the right 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.350
 to the side 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.120
 your 5 volume button on the button 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.870
 on and off button 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.960
 camera 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.470
 wlan driver camera button and buttons 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.380
 adjust the volume and immediately draw 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.839
 your attention to how to assemble the two 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.449
 phone wlan driver 2 halves 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.310
 fasten 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.369
 additionally staples provides 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.439
 extra strength at Hammer as much as 5 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.390
 just an increased number of screws on 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.590
 I'm not a massive perimeter etc. 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.850
 top part 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.450
 both phones and ear plugs mirage 5 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.110
 this headphone plug is enough 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.200
 deep nest at land rover a8 here 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.520
 combined at once two jacks and headphones and 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.670
 and mini usb micro usb input for charging and 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:46.270
 connect the computer at the bottom 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:49.429
 lan driver is clean at Hammer already 5 nest 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.090
 for connecting usb cable too 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.959
 deep enough made further out 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.140
 external yet 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.670
 difference of features can be identified 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.549
 presence of plastic 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.570
 framework wlan driver and the absence of this 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:09.259
 plastic frame at Hammer already 5 topics not 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.569
 less at the Hammer already 5 rubber board 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.400
 slightly above the glass that 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.560
 gives him a distinct advantage of railing n 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.550
 the lan driver driver is plastic 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.150
 border 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.890
 towering is not very 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:27.810
 the back of both is comfortable 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.760
 phones done the same in different 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.659
 executions 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.090
 first of all wlan driver 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.159
 5 megapixel camera flash and 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.829
 speaker located above 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:42.099
 ear mirage 5 8 megapixel camera though 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.030
 it really is 5 megapixel flash 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.730
 also done 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.379
 wlan driver flash still done 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.400
 somehow more pleasant 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:53.709
 the eye then there are thoughts to see this ear 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.769
 mirage 5 on a little bit recessed deep into it 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.940
 wlan driver 4 does not look very nice 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:04.650
 Screw fastens the cover and ear mirage 5 of these 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.650
 screws only 2 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.280
 they are made of plastic both his fights 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.210
 around the perimeter in the same place 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.680
 passes the rubber gasket that's here it 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.170
 wlan driver 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.840
 such can be seen 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.599
 the same gasket is present kitchens 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.930
 World already 5, too, here it passes a copy of 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.360
 around the perimeter and it adjoins 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.450
 the inside of the phone case then 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.450
 there is 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.520
 here it is here to effectively do your 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.350
 function and also draw your attention 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.110
 that there is another one in the lan driver 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.180
 another line of protection from moisture here it is 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.040
 Here I think the reserve is all that black is 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.970
 tires at the Hummer as much as 5 after all only 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.970
 one gasket and 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:14.330
 the plastic part is no gum 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.040
 contains respectively the level of protection 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.519
 lan driver is still higher though both 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.640
 positioned like both 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.610
 api 68 protection level is positioned 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.340
 Hammer piece has a 2400 battery 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.370
 milliamps per hour land rover a8 even 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.800
 visually it is visible that the battery is more than 3000 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.350
 milliamps per hour this is basically time 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.990
 the difference is essential i must say for 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.870
 smartphones 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.530
 next we 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.530
 will consider 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.779
 the work of these phones on the example 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.779
 antutu programs 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.460
 Well, here we can not fail to note the quality 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.280
 button presses 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.250
 both phones have a wlan driver button 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.830
 buttons are pressed much nicer than them 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.390
 feel when the button is triggered 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.520
 work time activation button wow 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.070
 driver felt ear mirage 5 buttons 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.720
 very tight and pressed moment 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.030
 actuation of the button I do not feel that there is 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.330
 have to wait for the reaction of the phone itself 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.420
 performance wlan driver 10000 132 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.020
 antutu shows u homy rush 5 11 thousand 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.400
 80 that in principle of course and surprising 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:30.160
 because the phone is in different 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.870
 price categories and x and 1 5 did not promise 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.990
 be so productive and very too 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.850
 important moment immediately visible quality 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.860
 pictures quality pictures perfect 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.310
 different and it can be noted that the Hammer already 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.410
 five 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.120
 the picture is much brighter and it is 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.240
 really really right away 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.580
 barometer at h5 striking but 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.560
 This is also reflected in the standard 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.410
 phone wallpaper programs 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.030
 Well, in general, programs antutu 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.020
 shows benefits only by 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.810
 barometer 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.240
 By the way a very interesting point concerns 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.210
 again lan driver of cases more 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.650
 plastic present in the rubber case 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.690
 only black 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.060
 wherever we are it is black 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.790
 vich he meets on the phone that's it 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.160
 tires certainly but also to see him he 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:19.880
 driver a lot of plastic plastic yellow 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:23.510
 colors ear mirage 5 plastic blocked 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.280
 rubber and this is a very important point and gives 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.590
 big plus when operating 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.210
 some extreme conditions this here 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.729
 Of course, for the most part 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.320
 builders of course both phones 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:37.790
 there are special crossbars 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.889
 for hanging phones on the carbine and 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.889
 there or on any straps dimensions 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:45.290
 these two phones are also in principle 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:47.150
 very close to each other and still have 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.419
 Hammer already 5 more while you 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.389
 corners are over such rounded all 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:55.610
 design elements 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:59.300
 which makes him so less aggressive 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.830
 lan driver is more aggressive just the same 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.320
 because of these here own 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:08.450
 angular design elements 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.800
 Well, the price category of price 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.890
 categories in which both phones 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:16.520
 is in principle not much 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:19.419
 different, that is, there is already a question of taste 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.470
 in fact, who will prefer what 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:24.520
 this dear friends we say goodbye 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.520
 goodbye
