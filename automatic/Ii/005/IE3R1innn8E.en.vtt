00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.879
 Welcome to today's daily news 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.179
 today as topics for you the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.460
 playstation 4 and xbox from simcity and 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:19.890
 to finish the nintendo view and how 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:22.050
 always in the gate the first topic is the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.880
 Playstation 4 with her dual shock four 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.920
 controller a new example one 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.960
 skater editor shows the pretty 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.849
 cheap at bad processing of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.740
 analog sticks of the mentioned controller 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.290
 editor plays about three 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.510
 hours daily fifa 14 and assassin's 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.219
 creed 4 black flag also at the games on 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.989
 Colleagues is one of the analog sticks 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.730
 now may already accounts for 60 hours 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.440
 pure use time already 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.760
 written off and place the rough 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.129
 Surface is already complete 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.350
 cut off and it is already one 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.730
 crack in the middle of the plane to see 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.469
 Dealers speak of it clearly 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.940
 increase the payback 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.770
 this tour is for the business 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.059
 are not harmful in the long run or not 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.649
 really to handle 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.539
 and there we have the point again 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.850
 that companies with their greed for 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.320
 maximum success the product at events 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.270
 is not so super great 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.890
 bring mature to the market that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.360
 hubbles of it son you have the bad 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.950
 Process control brought to market 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.950
 and there will be others 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.710
 you clearly about this piece here 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.689
 Complain this subject in the city 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.130
 and that will see updates with the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.720
 since the beginning of wish 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.490
 finally give offline mode 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.259
 this should then all contents and 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.000
 data he already downloaded and 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.979
 used synonymous in the offline mode 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.140
 after that you can use it already 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.400
 existing data and scores have that 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.020
 no influence at all 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.670
 you can use another one if 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.229
 in turn , how does one have to 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.990
 that are present since 10 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.430
 sat updates as they have but their 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.899
 can you make a better game and 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.040
 probably now after that 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.159
 Half a year out there they have it 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.020
 kroes hey we want offline mode that 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.500
 an innovation again and you have it 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.970
 Got it 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.950
 Now we can only wait if 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.810
 sometime five years the maps bigger 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.280
 or the other bugs 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.110
 be fixed but it is at least times 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.579
 a start a first step where you 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.890
 perhaps many consider outside 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.670
 if you are the one you might 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.049
 the eighth is still a role in that 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.509
 city ​​has a few problems 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.400
 next topic playstation 4 and that 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.780
 are now supposedly the playstation 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.220
 plus free games 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.440
 for the coming month of february 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.510
 to be published here 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.880
 klaas as first publication for the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.220
 nextgen consoles and is of course in the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.319
 playstation plus special offer then too 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.720
 be joined for free to then 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.130
 probably bioshock infinite and metro last 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.380
 light for the playstation 3 as well 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.050
 dynasty warriors grows and modnation 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.310
 racers for the ps vita I am very 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.920
 curious if now, sometimes 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.280
 sometime at microsoft or the xbox 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.950
 want 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.810
 in a great yellow gold program too 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.930
 have good splits even though that 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.370
 last offer with 360 yes but even a 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.959
 step in the right direction 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.610
 we are curious what's in there 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.989
 still to come, you can 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.950
 yes sometimes a comment write what you 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.470
 would wish 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.470
 what then in the month of march for playstation 4 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.480
 and Xbox in February of their desired title 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.769
 but they would still be a little bit 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.110
 Realistically we are not with us 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.760
 exaggerate theme again four has is 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.709
 the xbox bronnen is the new console 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.989
 just outside with this man jean 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.340
 this game and there are already 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.840
 first rumors for succession 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.910
 You've already heard of consoles 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.310
 xbox want that microsoft more and more 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.780
 on cloud computing and not more 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.120
 on the traditional type of value memory 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.920
 method phil spencer now has one 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.500
 Ask a hitter user answered 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.239
 when it came to whether xbox at night 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.980
 another console in the 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.690
 living room in the next few years once 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.820
 this coming he posed as 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.950
 Realistic scenario as he thinks 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.720
 that local computing power continues 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.400
 will grow and also in several years 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.780
 is still of great importance 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.519
 then we are looking forward to the 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.109
 The next one will come in sometime 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.730
 five to seven years 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.489
 and there are probably with which 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.250
 sideboard suits in front of and steam 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.430
 then the motion control works 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.739
 with kinect the movie is not like 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.150
 at the end I see it linked to the world 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.750
 I have the wonderful surprise 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.790
 in it 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.470
 but let's face it, we are curious so 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.880
 Personally, in any case, what 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.340
 expect us in five to seven 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.870
 years in the console generation with 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.239
 new possibilities of the cologne rock 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.070
 not always everything 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.470
 curious and then you can yours 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.079
 suggestions racing break you would want 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.200
 for the next generation will be 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.390
 the new collection outside 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.830
 but let's just do it 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.290
 kind of comment a welcome to 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.840
 nintendo with the 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.610
 wii u as conclusion anonymous zwickler 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.950
 has now published information 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.990
 which I think is pretty incredible 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.580
 incomprehensible blade and indeed it was 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.700
 a conference call from several 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.740
 nintendo official high animals around that 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.060
 online system and just like that 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.050
 network on his interview 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.430
 should work 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.350
 the anonymous developer has this 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.930
 multiple xbox live and the playstation 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.280
 network as references mentioned there was 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.200
 but already told him directly that 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.390
 makes no sense to talk about it because 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.890
 the people present notice this system 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.390
 do not use at all and at all 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.430
 no idea of ​​it have the feature 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.680
 Again, how great Nintendo is to your customers 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.900
 hears and generally their eyes open for 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.760
 the world you live keeps your mario 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.050
 and zelda league world my darling 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.640
 of course a bit exaggerated 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.900
 but if I do not formulate anymore 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.270
 have a clue of functioning 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.160
 systems out there and then I wonder 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.140
 why my system does not arrive you 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.310
 knows him something wrong I'm curious 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.720
 whether it's the curve at some point 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.460
 with their reelection, how much 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.470
 Sells interest where I have four million 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.390
 Comparison has been made 100 million times 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.430
 she sold it last year so 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.170
 she can spend a little bit to 30 days 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.950
 shitty than the new consoles yet 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.500
 were not outside 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.610
 psp xbox bonn and now you have to 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.610
 somehow look great with smash 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.320
 brothers and super mario 3d and such 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.940
 on and so forth somehow purely to 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.500
 come in this rail i believe it 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.880
 will be difficult if i would be happy 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.340
 they can do it because we are they de me 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.410
 a friend of the very early generations 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.180
 okay I'm only 19 but that's it 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.100
 pretty early for my life in the 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.470
 Temple 64 and we look forward to it 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.520
 will give good games and nintendos 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.290
 manages to get out downstairs 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.570
 and I'm talking too much to come 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.160
 to the end card and spurred on this 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.080
 Bald are I hope I have the 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.940
 Daily News again now please the
