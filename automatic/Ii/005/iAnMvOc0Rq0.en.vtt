morning the next day the train gets
overrun<00:03:44.200> by<00:03:44.260> some<00:03:44.740> orcs<00:03:45.070> but<00:03:46.230> just<00:03:47.230> see<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:47.740> a

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
overrun by some orcs but just see that a

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:59.260 
overrun by some orcs but just see that a
minute<00:03:51.240> we<00:03:52.240> are<00:03:52.360> clear<00:03:52.930> for<00:03:53.080> passage

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.910 

if<00:03:59.480> you<00:03:59.750> look<00:03:59.870> at<00:03:59.990> the<00:04:00.020> clock<00:04:00.290> apparently<00:04:00.770> the

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
if you look at the clock apparently the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.670 
if you look at the clock apparently the
big<00:04:01.760> one<00:04:01.880> on<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.090> station<00:04:02.510> apparently<00:04:03.410> at<00:04:03.530> two

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
big one on the station apparently at two

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.640 
big one on the station apparently at two
o'clock<00:04:03.800> it<00:04:04.250> gets<00:04:04.810> that's<00:04:05.810> one<00:04:06.140> their<00:04:06.380> son

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
o'clock it gets that's one their son

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.200 
o'clock it gets that's one their son
starts<00:04:06.980> to<00:04:07.070> go<00:04:07.190> down<00:04:08.140> interesting

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.620 

actually<00:04:13.960> I<00:04:13.990> think<00:04:14.020> that<00:04:14.320> reads<00:04:14.530> your<00:04:15.120> um

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
actually I think that reads your um

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.479 
actually I think that reads your um
I<00:04:17.720> actually<00:04:18.350> think<00:04:18.620> it<00:04:18.800> reads<00:04:19.010> your<00:04:19.220> clock

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
I actually think it reads your clock

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.900 
I actually think it reads your clock
from<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:23.590> gamekeeper<00:04:24.590> we<00:04:24.770> would<00:04:24.920> of<00:04:25.040> you<00:04:25.160> have

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
from the gamekeeper we would of you have

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.880 
from the gamekeeper we would of you have
the<00:04:26.120> game<00:04:26.360> in<00:04:26.600> and<00:04:26.810> then<00:04:26.900> display<00:04:27.350> is<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.650> time

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
the game in and then display is the time

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.510 
the game in and then display is the time
that<00:04:27.920> it<00:04:28.190> is<00:04:28.720> on<00:04:29.720> your<00:04:30.140> system<00:04:30.470> which<00:04:31.370> is

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
that it is on your system which is

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:42.740 
that it is on your system which is
measured<00:04:32.440> easter<00:04:33.440> egg

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:52.380 

let's<00:04:42.990> go<00:04:43.140> back<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.560> Train

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:05:04.690 

and<00:04:52.570> then<00:04:53.110> it'll<00:04:53.290> be<00:04:53.410> high<00:04:53.650> already

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.460 

and<00:05:05.240> yeah<00:05:05.420> the<00:05:05.600> next<00:05:05.810> part<00:05:06.020> will<00:05:06.110> be<00:05:06.140> the<00:05:06.290> boss

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
and yeah the next part will be the boss

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.570
