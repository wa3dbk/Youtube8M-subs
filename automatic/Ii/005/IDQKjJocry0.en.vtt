00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.830 
rough things in and i change it but i
like<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.160> just<00:03:12.310> do<00:03:12.520> it<00:03:12.670> i<00:03:12.940> go<00:03:13.750> back<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:13.930> forth

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
like to just do it i go back and forth

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.000 
like to just do it i go back and forth
when<00:03:16.840> there's<00:03:16.989> something<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.290> specifically

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
when there's something I specifically

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.100 
when there's something I specifically
want<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.430> include<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:19.030> know<00:03:19.060> as<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.480> focal

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
want to include you know as a focal

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.130 
want to include you know as a focal
point<00:03:20.290> or<00:03:20.709> off<00:03:21.550> all<00:03:21.940> chocolate<00:03:22.300> in<00:03:22.810> because

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
point or off all chocolate in because

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.979 
point or off all chocolate in because
it's<00:03:23.290> going<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.500> be<00:03:23.650> more<00:03:24.360> crisply<00:03:25.360> realized

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
it's going to be more crisply realized

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.960 
it's going to be more crisply realized
so<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:26.980> placements<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.550> little<00:03:27.730> bit<00:03:27.819> more

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
so the placements a little bit more

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.699 
so the placements a little bit more
crucial<00:03:28.390> but<00:03:28.840> when<00:03:28.989> is<00:03:29.140> more<00:03:29.410> sort<00:03:29.680> of

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
crucial but when is more sort of

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.910 
crucial but when is more sort of
impressions<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.430> feel<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.330> things<00:03:31.630> I'll<00:03:32.500> do

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
impressions to feel the things I'll do

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:50.970 
impressions to feel the things I'll do
it<00:03:33.100> more<00:03:33.880> by<00:03:34.030> feel

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.150 

plants<00:03:51.980> really<00:03:52.460> create<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.940> structure<00:03:53.240> of

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
plants really create the structure of

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.770 
plants really create the structure of
you<00:03:55.160> know<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.430> environment<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.240> of<00:03:56.570> course

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
you know the environment and of course

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.740 
you know the environment and of course
as<00:03:56.930> we<00:03:57.080> know<00:03:57.110> that<00:03:58.030> temperate<00:03:59.030> zone<00:03:59.240> like<00:03:59.510> your

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
as we know that temperate zone like your

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.870 
as we know that temperate zone like your
changes<00:04:00.350> which<00:04:00.620> is<00:04:05.860> so<00:04:06.860> when<00:04:07.010> these<00:04:07.130> we're<00:04:07.760> all

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
changes which is so when these we're all

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:22.000 
changes which is so when these we're all
nuts<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:09.170> height<00:04:09.380> of<00:04:10.480> activity

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.000 

so<00:04:22.580> we<00:04:22.700> are<00:04:23.090> right<00:04:23.270> now<00:04:23.450> in<00:04:23.480> a<00:04:23.720> backyard<00:04:24.010> yeah

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
so we are right now in a backyard yeah

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.840 
so we are right now in a backyard yeah
this<00:04:25.430> is<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.700> backyard<00:04:27.310> at<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.550> edge<00:04:28.640> of<00:04:28.670> a

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
this is the backyard at the edge of a

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.620 
this is the backyard at the edge of a
woodland<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:31.450> its<00:04:32.450> backyard<00:04:33.170> in<00:04:33.320> which<00:04:33.530> the

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
woodland and its backyard in which the

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.900 
woodland and its backyard in which the
people<00:04:35.630> who<00:04:37.960> tended<00:04:38.960> her<00:04:39.170> on<00:04:39.350> it<00:04:39.530> have<00:04:40.220> allowed

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
people who tended her on it have allowed

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.620 
people who tended her on it have allowed
and<00:04:41.330> a<00:04:41.960> lot<00:04:42.830> for<00:04:43.130> and<00:04:43.280> created<00:04:43.820> an<00:04:44.440> implanted<00:04:45.440> a

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
and a lot for and created an implanted a

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:53.170 
and a lot for and created an implanted a
lot<00:04:47.630> of<00:04:47.750> our<00:04:48.460> native<00:04:49.460> species<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:52.180> support

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
lot of our native species to support

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.590 
lot of our native species to support
that<00:04:53.510> most<00:04:54.380> pieces<00:04:54.650> of<00:04:54.770> plans<00:04:55.010> to<00:04:55.280> support

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
that most pieces of plans to support

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.830 
that most pieces of plans to support
obviously<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:56.690> plants<00:04:56.990> themselves<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:58.840> the

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
obviously the plants themselves and the

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.650 
obviously the plants themselves and the
animals<00:05:00.440> depend<00:05:00.830> on<00:05:01.160> so<00:05:02.120> that<00:05:02.240> we<00:05:02.360> have<00:05:02.390> a<00:05:02.480> nice

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
animals depend on so that we have a nice

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.440 
animals depend on so that we have a nice
healthy<00:05:02.870> ecosystem<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:04.460> right<00:05:04.910> now<00:05:05.060> here<00:05:05.300> we

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
healthy ecosystem and right now here we

maybe an hour or two but they tend to be

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.600 
maybe an hour or two but they tend to be
nocturnal<00:05:51.160> obvious<00:05:52.560> we'll<00:05:53.560> have<00:05:53.680> more<00:05:53.889> signs

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:36.259 
looks the hardware really is what we

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:39.010 
looks the hardware really is what we
have<00:07:36.289> and<00:07:36.740> dom<00:07:37.069> and<00:07:37.400> they<00:07:38.000> said<00:07:38.569> they<00:07:38.750> tend<00:07:38.990> to
