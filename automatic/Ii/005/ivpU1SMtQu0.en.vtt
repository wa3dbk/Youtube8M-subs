and add enough for that and decided to
do<00:02:08.190> something<00:02:08.429> about<00:02:08.640> it

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.240 

the<00:02:11.480> good<00:02:11.690> news<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:11.930> i'm<00:02:12.380> currently<00:02:12.740> getting

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
the good news is i'm currently getting

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.760 
the good news is i'm currently getting
around<00:02:14.120> eighty-seven<00:02:14.900> percent<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.380> all<00:02:15.500> my

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
around eighty-seven percent of all my

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.640 
around eighty-seven percent of all my
pupils<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.340> pass<00:02:16.580> first-time<00:02:17.200> now<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.440> is<00:02:18.620> a

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
pupils to pass first-time now that is a

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.040 
pupils to pass first-time now that is a
huge<00:02:19.160> amount<00:02:19.610> different<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.570> lose<00:02:20.750> about

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
huge amount different to lose about

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.770 
huge amount different to lose about
better<00:02:21.380> than<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.160> national<00:02:22.370> average<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.630> this

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
better than the national average so this

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.570 
better than the national average so this
is<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.050> driving<00:02:24.350> standards<00:02:24.680> agency's<00:02:25.460> own

failing first time or second time now I

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.460 
failing first time or second time now I
am<00:02:46.940> waiting<00:02:47.270> for<00:02:47.690> those<00:02:47.780> figures<00:02:48.260> from<00:02:48.380> the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
am waiting for those figures from the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.490 
am waiting for those figures from the
driving<00:02:48.920> standards<00:02:49.130> agency<00:02:49.580> but<00:02:50.570> I<00:02:50.810> firmly

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
driving standards agency but I firmly

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.949 
driving standards agency but I firmly
believe<00:02:51.980> in<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:52.489> I<00:02:52.850> think<00:02:53.390> this<00:02:53.510> isn't<00:02:53.840> an

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
believe in this I think this isn't an

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.199 
believe in this I think this isn't an
exaggerated<00:02:54.680> figure<00:02:55.250> that<00:02:55.700> around<00:02:55.970> eighty

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
exaggerated figure that around eighty

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.050 
exaggerated figure that around eighty
percent<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:56.930> first<00:02:57.230> attempt<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.950> Rome<00:02:58.340> are

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
percent of first attempt to Rome are

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.900 
percent of first attempt to Rome are
ending<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.630> failure<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:01.370> with<00:03:01.700> all<00:03:01.730> that

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
ending and failure so with all that

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.060 
ending and failure so with all that
information<00:03:02.390> I've<00:03:03.020> got<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.560> be<00:03:03.709> along<00:03:03.950> the
