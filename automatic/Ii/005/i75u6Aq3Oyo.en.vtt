00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.350 
see they're shooting now I would
actually<00:03:28.799> in<00:03:29.040> fact<00:03:29.250> put<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.640> free<00:03:29.880> spell<00:03:30.120> on<00:03:30.209> it

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
actually in fact put a free spell on it

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.930 
actually in fact put a free spell on it
as<00:03:31.200> soon<00:03:31.440> as<00:03:31.500> they<00:03:31.680> started<00:03:31.950> touching<00:03:32.190> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
as soon as they started touching the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.259 
as soon as they started touching the
loons<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.769> allows<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.459> loons<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.120> have

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
loons so it allows the loons to have

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.789 
loons so it allows the loons to have
more<00:03:36.630> health<00:03:36.810> points<00:03:37.170> when<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.320> gets<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.650> the

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
more health points when it gets to the

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.750 
more health points when it gets to the
center<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.600> knock<00:03:39.600> out<00:03:39.780> those<00:03:40.140> defenses<00:03:41.100> if<00:03:41.549> I

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
center and knock out those defenses if I

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.880 
center and knock out those defenses if I
also<00:03:41.940> have<00:03:42.239> freeze<00:03:42.600> I<00:03:42.840> also<00:03:43.140> would<00:03:43.680> have<00:03:43.739> been

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
also have freeze I also would have been

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.509 
also have freeze I also would have been
able<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.370> knock<00:03:44.640> out<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.209> Expo<00:03:46.220> because<00:03:47.220> I

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
able to knock out that Expo because I

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.130 
able to knock out that Expo because I
had<00:03:47.670> more<00:03:47.850> health<00:03:48.090> points<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.660> knock<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:49.080> out

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
had more health points to knock that out

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.160 
had more health points to knock that out
so<00:03:49.920> ideally<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:51.000> would<00:03:51.480> have<00:03:51.570> cleared<00:03:51.870> that

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
so ideally I would have cleared that

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.150 
so ideally I would have cleared that
center<00:03:52.709> area<00:03:53.239> pause<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.540> also<00:03:55.079> that<00:03:55.320> Expo<00:03:55.890> and

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
center area pause and also that Expo and

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.220 
center area pause and also that Expo and
order<00:03:56.880> ideally<00:03:57.920> deployed<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.810> heroes<00:04:00.810> in<00:04:01.110> the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
order ideally deployed the heroes in the

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.020 
order ideally deployed the heroes in the
right<00:04:01.440> place<00:04:01.739> so<00:04:02.010> they<00:04:02.280> went<00:04:02.519> for<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.790> Town

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
right place so they went for the Town

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.620 
right place so they went for the Town
