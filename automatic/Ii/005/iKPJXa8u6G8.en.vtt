those things
another<00:02:40.290> thing<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.709> it's<00:02:40.860> really<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:42.150> it's

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
another thing that it's really it's it's

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.780 
another thing that it's really it's it's
good<00:02:42.660> at<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:43.050> video<00:02:43.650> editing<00:02:43.890> it's<00:02:44.430> great<00:02:44.670> for

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
good at is video editing it's great for

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.449 
good at is video editing it's great for
that<00:02:44.910> it's<00:02:45.120> got<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.269> 2<00:02:45.540> terabyte<00:02:46.049> hard<00:02:46.260> drive<00:02:46.650> so

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
that it's got a 2 terabyte hard drive so

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.410 
that it's got a 2 terabyte hard drive so
it<00:02:47.819> can<00:02:48.000> definitely<00:02:48.620> fit<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:50.160> know<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.640> large

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
it can definitely fit you know a large

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.960 
it can definitely fit you know a large
amount<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.989> video<00:02:52.350> or<00:02:52.799> it's<00:02:53.549> great<00:02:53.730> for

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
amount of video or it's great for

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.960 
amount of video or it's great for
YouTube<00:02:54.299> so<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:56.280> actually<00:02:56.580> comes<00:02:56.849> with

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
YouTube so it actually comes with

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.570 
YouTube so it actually comes with
CyberLink<00:02:57.720> PowerDirector<00:02:58.110> 10<00:02:58.680> built<00:02:59.010> into<00:02:59.430> it

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
CyberLink PowerDirector 10 built into it

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.030 
CyberLink PowerDirector 10 built into it
so<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.239> can<00:03:00.390> just<00:03:00.540> straight<00:03:00.840> off<00:03:00.870> use<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.830> to

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
so you can just straight off use that to

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.160 
so you can just straight off use that to
do<00:03:02.160> some<00:03:02.430> editing<00:03:02.819> if<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.780> have<00:03:03.900> your<00:03:04.049> own

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
do some editing if you have your own

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.400 
do some editing if you have your own
program<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:05.099> runs<00:03:05.549> very<00:03:05.760> quickly<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.870> has<00:03:07.110> very

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
program it runs very quickly it has very

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.180 
program it runs very quickly it has very
little<00:03:07.739> lag<00:03:08.010> 1<00:03:08.370> video<00:03:08.700> editing<00:03:09.769> which<00:03:10.769> is<00:03:10.950> very

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
little lag 1 video editing which is very

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.660 
little lag 1 video editing which is very
key<00:03:11.489> actually<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:12.959> it'll<00:03:13.920> it'll<00:03:14.310> get<00:03:14.459> that

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
key actually so it'll it'll get that

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.710 
key actually so it'll it'll get that
stuff<00:03:14.970> done<00:03:15.209> nicely<00:03:16.519> so<00:03:17.519> when<00:03:17.970> recording<00:03:18.329> for

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
stuff done nicely so when recording for

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.870 
stuff done nicely so when recording for
YouTube<00:03:18.930> on<00:03:19.440> games<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:20.010> will<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.370> course<00:03:20.549> have

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
YouTube on games you will of course have

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.910 
YouTube on games you will of course have
that<00:03:21.120> FPS<00:03:21.720> drop<00:03:22.049> so<00:03:22.230> that's<00:03:22.410> when<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.709> might

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
that FPS drop so that's when you might

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.160 
that FPS drop so that's when you might
have<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.280> go<00:03:23.400> from<00:03:23.670> high<00:03:23.850> settings<00:03:24.329> to<00:03:24.630> medium
