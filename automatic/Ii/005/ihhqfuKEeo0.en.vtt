right<00:01:46.040> now<00:01:46.220> I<00:01:46.250> have<00:01:46.610> four<00:01:46.760> milling<00:01:47.240> machines

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
right now I have four milling machines

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.950 
right now I have four milling machines
they<00:01:48.020> still<00:01:48.350> great<00:01:48.680> ones<00:01:48.980> and<00:01:49.220> in<00:01:50.150> my<00:01:50.780> old

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
they still great ones and in my old

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.710 
they still great ones and in my old
workshop<00:01:51.370> those<00:01:52.370> smaller<00:01:52.730> ones<00:01:52.880> than<00:01:53.510> these

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
workshop those smaller ones than these

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:03.150 
workshop those smaller ones than these
both<00:01:54.410> monsters<00:01:55.960> so<00:01:58.870> this<00:01:59.870> is<00:02:00.080> remote<00:02:00.650> control

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
both monsters so this is remote control

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.480 
both monsters so this is remote control
right<00:02:04.160> here<00:02:04.300> we<00:02:05.300> have<00:02:05.740> another<00:02:06.740> remote

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
right here we have another remote

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.620 
right here we have another remote
control<00:02:07.970> I<00:02:09.729> think<00:02:10.729> it's<00:02:10.910> more<00:02:11.510> better<00:02:11.780> than

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
control I think it's more better than

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.750 
control I think it's more better than
cranks<00:02:14.630> handles<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.440> something<00:02:16.400> like<00:02:16.550> that

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
cranks handles and something like that

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.840 
cranks handles and something like that
you<00:02:17.180> know<00:02:17.330> oh<00:02:18.070> this<00:02:19.070> is<00:02:19.310> built<00:02:19.610> in<00:02:19.820> 87<00:02:22.930> so

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
you know oh this is built in 87 so

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.210 
you know oh this is built in 87 so
thanks<00:02:25.850> for<00:02:25.970> watching<00:02:26.440> good<00:02:27.440> luck<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.890> how
