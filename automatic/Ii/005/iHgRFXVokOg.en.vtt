 I'm going to play it down for you guys. 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:50.479
 to see what Paul is not just for 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.069
 you had a ruler to write 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.960

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:58.870

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.919
 You guys end up following this line. 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.330
 passing is a tip I give to 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:10.460
 you 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.650

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:20.870
 missing part of you can put a 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.639
 black vinyl here revealed little clothing that 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:27.050
 the majority two hours after she revealed 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:31.229
 pay little and put the sponsorships that 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:34.690
 You have the chevrolet there. 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:37.090

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.790
 play 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.960
 It's only with the brand that I think so. 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:46.870
 practically everybody knows how to do is not 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.120

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.650
 You can put the wine here too. 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:58.680
 to black the rear view mirror and airfoil 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:01.960
 Leave her and I lost the line that I do not see 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.460
 No one talks about trees doing it again. 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.430
 for you to see 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.199
 I'm not going to tell you much now 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.740
 pay attention when you spend a little 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:14.100
 more calm without knowing where they are and 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.100
 Chicago 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:19.020
 finally pay attention to this part of the 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.020
 video 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.800
 we left that donkey roll 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.800

 and that's it people take a chuchu right 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:51.740
 They thought I was quiet. 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:54.710
