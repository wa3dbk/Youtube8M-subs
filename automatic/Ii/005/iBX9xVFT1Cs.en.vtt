great<00:04:19.320> deal<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.799> potential<00:04:20.150> and<00:04:21.150> there<00:04:21.269> are

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
great deal of potential and there are

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.000 
great deal of potential and there are

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
many talented players at South so we

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.740 
many talented players at South so we
have<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.310> set<00:04:26.490> up<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.880> requisite<00:04:27.330> conditions
