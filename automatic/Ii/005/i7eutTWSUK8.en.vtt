hello<00:00:01.770> there<00:00:01.920> once<00:00:02.190> again<00:00:02.550> and<00:00:03.330> I<00:00:03.419> just<00:00:03.449> want

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
hello there once again and I just want

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.490 
hello there once again and I just want
to<00:00:03.990> introduce<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:05.609> project<00:00:06.420> that<00:00:07.140> I've

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
to introduce a project that I've

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.600 
to introduce a project that I've
undertaken<00:00:07.950> for<00:00:08.730> my<00:00:08.970> PC<00:00:09.750> basically<00:00:10.620> wanting

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
undertaken for my PC basically wanting

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.400 
undertaken for my PC basically wanting
to<00:00:11.700> put<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.849> fan<00:00:12.090> controller<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.200> can

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
to put a fan controller in this so I can

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.340 
to put a fan controller in this so I can
switch<00:00:13.679> between<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.280> whisper<00:00:14.940> mode<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.420> a

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
switch between a whisper mode and a

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.990 
switch between a whisper mode and a
performance<00:00:17.070> mode<00:00:17.250> most<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.550> time<00:00:17.730> I'll<00:00:17.850> only

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
performance mode most the time I'll only

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.370 
performance mode most the time I'll only
need<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.240> whisper<00:00:18.539> mode<00:00:18.660> particularly<00:00:19.260> for

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
need a whisper mode particularly for

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.380 
need a whisper mode particularly for
recording<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.520> I've<00:00:20.699> decided<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.090> make<00:00:21.240> my

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
recording and I've decided to make my

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.779 
recording and I've decided to make my
own<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.199> how<00:00:23.010> I'm<00:00:23.160> going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.640> it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
own and this is how I'm going to do it

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.939 
own and this is how I'm going to do it
this<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.510> enclosure<00:00:25.260> for

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
this is going to be the enclosure for

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.230 
this is going to be the enclosure for
all<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> wiring<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.730> I've<00:00:26.849> got<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.150> do

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
all of the wiring that I've got to do

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.070 
all of the wiring that I've got to do
it's<00:00:27.390> basically<00:00:27.539> AM<00:00:28.910> CD<00:00:29.910> ROM<00:00:30.090> case<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.929> all

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
it's basically AM CD ROM case with all

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.389 
it's basically AM CD ROM case with all
the<00:00:31.199> innards<00:00:31.410> removed<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.980> I've<00:00:32.070> just<00:00:32.219> taken

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the innards removed and I've just taken

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.170 
the innards removed and I've just taken
a<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:33.110> blanking<00:00:34.110> plate<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.700> in<00:00:35.700> there<00:00:35.880> I've<00:00:35.969> put

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
a a blanking plate and in there I've put

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.090 
a a blanking plate and in there I've put
three<00:00:36.329> toggle<00:00:37.260> switches<00:00:37.469> which<00:00:37.739> I'm<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:38.040> to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
three toggle switches which I'm going to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.930 
three toggle switches which I'm going to
use<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.780> switch<00:00:39.780> between<00:00:39.960> 12<00:00:40.890> volts<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.340> seven

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
use to switch between 12 volts and seven

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.340 
use to switch between 12 volts and seven
volts<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> fund<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:42.930> will<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.200> using

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
volts on the fund so we will be using

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.619 
volts on the fund so we will be using
the<00:00:43.500> seven<00:00:43.739> volt<00:00:43.920> fan<00:00:44.340> mod<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:45.239> switch

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the seven volt fan mod on this switch

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.810 
the seven volt fan mod on this switch
involves<00:00:46.530> basically<00:00:46.860> using<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.250> five<00:00:47.520> volt

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
involves basically using the five volt

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.479 
involves basically using the five volt
rail<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:48.629> an<00:00:48.750> earth<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.260> there's<00:00:50.190> also<00:00:50.280> this

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
rail as an earth and there's also this

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.119 
rail as an earth and there's also this
little<00:00:50.820> gap<00:00:51.149> at<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.360> back<00:00:51.570> where<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.530> can

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
little gap at the back where I can I can

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.580 
little gap at the back where I can I can
put<00:00:53.280> all<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.489> connectors<00:00:54.289> and<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.440> think

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
put all the connectors and I think

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.650 
put all the connectors and I think
that's<00:00:55.739> going<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.070> nice<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.879> nice<00:00:57.420> little

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
that's going to be a nice a nice little

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.170 
that's going to be a nice a nice little
solution<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:59.129> way<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.370> will<00:00:59.579> work<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
solution the way this will work is the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.000 
solution the way this will work is the
the<00:01:00.510> left-hand<00:01:00.840> switches<00:01:01.170> will<00:01:01.320> control<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the left-hand switches will control the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.189 
the left-hand switches will control the
intake<00:01:02.699> fans<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.600> right-hand<00:01:04.019> switch

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
intake fans and the right-hand switch

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.250 
intake fans and the right-hand switch
will<00:01:04.379> control<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.309> exhaust<00:01:05.670> vent<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.260> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
will control the exhaust vent and the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.440 
will control the exhaust vent and the
switch<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> middle<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:09.000> will<00:01:09.119> actually

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
switch in the middle and will actually

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.870 
switch in the middle and will actually
turn<00:01:09.600> off<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> second<00:01:10.110> fan<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.320> my<00:01:10.409> CPU<00:01:11.070> cooler

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
turn off the second fan of my CPU cooler

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.550 
turn off the second fan of my CPU cooler
and<00:01:12.060> my<00:01:12.150> CPU<00:01:12.450> coolers<00:01:12.750> ozone<00:01:13.020> wood<00:01:13.170> vivo<00:01:13.470> which

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and my CPU coolers ozone wood vivo which

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350 
and my CPU coolers ozone wood vivo which
has<00:01:13.710> two<00:01:13.890> fans<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.939> will<00:01:15.150> leave<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
has two fans on it so I will leave the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.210 
has two fans on it so I will leave the
main<00:01:15.600> fan<00:01:15.869> running<00:01:16.110> all<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.710> time<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.130> it's

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
main fan running all the time and it's

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.289 
main fan running all the time and it's
just<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.460> second<00:01:17.820> fan<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.090> I'll<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.240> able

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
just that second fan that I'll be able

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.740 
just that second fan that I'll be able
to<00:01:18.420> switch<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.960> off<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.600> how<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
to switch on and off so this is how the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.420 
to switch on and off so this is how the
wiring<00:01:22.049> works<00:01:22.409> out<00:01:22.650> there's<00:01:22.890> quite<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> bit<00:01:23.340> of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
wiring works out there's quite a bit of

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.330 
wiring works out there's quite a bit of
it<00:01:23.549> involved<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.570> lot<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.810> splicing<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.250> be

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
it involved a lot of splicing to be

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.940 
it involved a lot of splicing to be
honest<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.270> lot<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.570> little<00:01:27.840> bits<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.290> cable

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
honest and a lot of little bits of cable

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.999 
honest and a lot of little bits of cable
but<00:01:29.250> um<00:01:29.689> I've<00:01:30.689> got<00:01:31.020> there<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.439> maybe<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
but um I've got there with it maybe I

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.260 
but um I've got there with it maybe I
should<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.280> used<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> terminal<00:01:32.820> block<00:01:32.939> I

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
should have used a terminal block I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.609 
should have used a terminal block I
don't<00:01:33.840> know<00:01:34.159> but<00:01:35.159> anyway<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.390> does<00:01:36.570> work<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:37.439> I

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
don't know but anyway it does work if I

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.620 
don't know but anyway it does work if I
switch<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.280> intake<00:01:38.790> fan<00:01:39.060> side<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.390> things

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
switch on the intake fan side of things

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.660 
switch on the intake fan side of things
my<00:01:39.810> red<00:01:40.020> LED<00:01:40.500> comes<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.979> show<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.400> on

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
my red LED comes on to show that it's on

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.389 
my red LED comes on to show that it's on
on<00:01:41.880> 12<00:01:42.180> volts<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:43.020> fan<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.649> now<00:01:44.040> spinning

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
on 12 volts and that fan is now spinning

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.399 
on 12 volts and that fan is now spinning
and<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.329> switch<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> exhaust<00:01:46.140> fans

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and I can switch on the exhaust fans

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.590 
and I can switch on the exhaust fans
again<00:01:47.250> red<00:01:47.579> fan<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.880> tell<00:01:48.030> me<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.360> 12

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
again red fan to tell me it's on 12

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.300 
again red fan to tell me it's on 12
volts<00:01:48.840> full<00:01:49.020> speed<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.890> that's<00:01:50.070> spinning

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
volts full speed and that's spinning

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.760 
volts full speed and that's spinning
also<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.149> then<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.750> use<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> second

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
also and then I can just use the second

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
also and then I can just use the second
switch<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.280> connected<00:01:53.670> this

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
switch you have just connected this

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.660 
switch you have just connected this
little<00:01:54.299> older<00:01:54.689> heatsink<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.500> fan<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
little older heatsink and fan up to the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.209 
little older heatsink and fan up to the
CPU<00:01:57.509> switch<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.930> there<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.140> go<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.469> spins<00:01:59.130> as

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
CPU switch and there we go that spins as

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.490 
CPU switch and there we go that spins as
well<00:01:59.369> always<00:01:59.610> encouraging<00:02:00.329> when<00:02:01.049> you've<00:02:01.469> just

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
well always encouraging when you've just

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.560 
well always encouraging when you've just
done<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.920> wiring<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.000> fade<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
done this wiring and you fade it for the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.480 
done this wiring and you fade it for the
first<00:02:03.750> time<00:02:03.869> when<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.079> works<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:04.799> ifs<00:02:05.159> switch

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
first time when it works if ifs switch

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.819 
first time when it works if ifs switch
it<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> other<00:02:05.820> way<00:02:05.939> my<00:02:06.509> blue<00:02:06.869> LEDs<00:02:07.320> come<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.680> to

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
it the other way my blue LEDs come on to

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.380 
it the other way my blue LEDs come on to
tell<00:02:08.009> me<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> fans<00:02:08.550> are<00:02:08.700> now<00:02:08.819> operating

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
tell me that the fans are now operating

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.290 
tell me that the fans are now operating
on<00:02:09.509> seven<00:02:10.110> volts<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.610> does<00:02:12.150> obviously

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
on seven volts so that does obviously

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.490 
on seven volts so that does obviously
slow<00:02:12.720> them<00:02:12.900> down

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
slow them down

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.200 
slow them down
and<00:02:13.590> quite<00:02:14.160> everything<00:02:14.640> down<00:02:14.760> considerably

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
and quite everything down considerably

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.090 
and quite everything down considerably
as<00:02:16.140> well<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.090> thing<00:02:18.300> now<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:19.080> get<00:02:19.980> it

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
as well so the thing now is to get it

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.120 
as well so the thing now is to get it
put<00:02:20.280> into<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.540> enclosure<00:02:21.810> which<00:02:22.770> here<00:02:22.980> we've

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
put into the enclosure which here we've

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.220 
put into the enclosure which here we've
done<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:24.060> think<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.300> looks<00:02:24.570> rather<00:02:24.870> smart

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
done and I think that looks rather smart

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.220 
done and I think that looks rather smart
to<00:02:25.410> be<00:02:25.500> honest<00:02:25.710> really<00:02:26.490> really<00:02:27.090> pleased<00:02:27.360> with

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
to be honest really really pleased with

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.920 
to be honest really really pleased with
how<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.530> has<00:02:28.830> turned<00:02:29.580> out<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.510> end<00:02:30.660> it

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
how that has turned out in the end it

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.480 
how that has turned out in the end it
wasn't<00:02:31.200> possible<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.890> deliver<00:02:32.310> the

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
wasn't possible to deliver the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.920 
wasn't possible to deliver the
connectors<00:02:32.910> on<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.030> back<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.570> I've<00:02:33.660> just<00:02:33.780> left

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
connectors on the back so I've just left

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.570 
connectors on the back so I've just left
them<00:02:34.080> hanging<00:02:34.320> out<00:02:34.470> if<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.100> glue<00:02:35.250> them<00:02:35.400> on

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
them hanging out if you glue them on

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.920 
them hanging out if you glue them on
that<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.910> danger<00:02:36.210> is<00:02:36.330> they<00:02:36.450> because<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
that the danger is they because the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.450 
that the danger is they because the
molex<00:02:37.260> connectors<00:02:37.650> particularly<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.250> can<00:02:38.400> be

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
molex connectors particularly it can be

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.400 
molex connectors particularly it can be
quite<00:02:38.670> stiff<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.150> they'll<00:02:39.690> just<00:02:39.780> break<00:02:40.170> off

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
quite stiff that they'll just break off

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.230 
quite stiff that they'll just break off
so<00:02:40.740> in<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.370> end<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.580> was<00:02:41.670> better<00:02:41.850> just<00:02:41.970> to

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
so in the end it was better just to

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.120 
so in the end it was better just to
leave<00:02:42.390> them<00:02:42.570> hanging<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.440> let's<00:02:43.860> get<00:02:43.980> that

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
leave them hanging so let's get that

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.910 
leave them hanging so let's get that
installed<00:02:44.460> in<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.700> computer<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.830> here<00:02:46.830> we

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
installed in the computer and here we

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920 
installed in the computer and here we
are<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.190> what<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.490> looks<00:02:47.670> like<00:02:47.760> as<00:02:48.750> you

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
are this is what it looks like as you

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.960 
are this is what it looks like as you
can<00:02:49.080> see<00:02:49.260> I've<00:02:49.470> got<00:02:49.620> intake<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.490> exhaust<00:02:50.550> fans

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
can see I've got intake and exhaust fans

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.790 
can see I've got intake and exhaust fans
on<00:02:51.120> seven<00:02:51.570> volts<00:02:51.840> there<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.500> I've<00:02:52.590> got<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
on seven volts there and I've got the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.970 
on seven volts there and I've got the
second<00:02:53.100> CPU<00:02:53.550> fan<00:02:53.910> on<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.360> can<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:55.320> switch<00:02:55.920> that

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
second CPU fan on I can just switch that

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.880 
second CPU fan on I can just switch that
off<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.760> does<00:02:56.910> drop<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.510> volume<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.740> little

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
off that does drop the volume a little

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.030 
off that does drop the volume a little
bit<00:02:59.280> and<00:03:00.140> there<00:03:01.140> we<00:03:01.170> go<00:03:01.350> that's<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.650> got<00:03:01.920> the

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
bit and there we go that's just got the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.520 
bit and there we go that's just got the
second<00:03:02.580> CPU<00:03:03.000> fan<00:03:03.180> on<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.510> there<00:03:04.230> we<00:03:04.290> go<00:03:04.380> that's

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
second CPU fan on and there we go that's

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.710 
second CPU fan on and there we go that's
everything<00:03:05.070> now<00:03:05.250> on<00:03:05.640> fall<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.360> would<00:03:06.570> be

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
everything now on fall that would be

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.260 
everything now on fall that would be
performance<00:03:07.440> mode<00:03:08.130> it's<00:03:08.910> quite<00:03:09.150> loud

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
performance mode it's quite loud

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.030 
performance mode it's quite loud
particularly<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.870> intake<00:03:10.320> fan<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.770> the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
particularly the intake fan is the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.280 
particularly the intake fan is the
loudest<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.730> be<00:03:11.820> honest<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.959> then<00:03:13.080> if<00:03:13.200> I

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
loudest to be honest and then if I

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.960 
loudest to be honest and then if I
switch<00:03:13.530> them<00:03:13.709> all<00:03:13.830> off<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.280> just<00:03:14.520> leaves<00:03:14.760> the

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
switch them all off that just leaves the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.840 
switch them all off that just leaves the
main<00:03:15.270> CPU<00:03:15.810> fan<00:03:16.020> on<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.920> that's<00:03:17.100> pretty<00:03:17.400> quiet

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
main CPU fan on and that's pretty quiet

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.750 
main CPU fan on and that's pretty quiet
so<00:03:18.150> that's<00:03:18.300> full<00:03:18.840> whisper<00:03:19.680> mode<00:03:20.130> but

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
so that's full whisper mode but

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.949 
so that's full whisper mode but
