just<00:00:01.979> like<00:00:02.190> the<00:00:02.310> mountains<00:00:02.730> they're<00:00:03.120> always

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
just like the mountains they're always

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.440 
just like the mountains they're always
changing<00:00:03.659> so<00:00:04.529> will<00:00:04.680> your<00:00:04.799> applications<00:00:05.549> same

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
changing so will your applications same

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.740 
changing so will your applications same
as<00:00:06.629> with<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.020> way<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.170> walk<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.859> so<00:00:08.340> forth

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
as with the way you walk and so forth

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.089

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
and I'm actually gonna do what's called

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.510 
and I'm actually gonna do what's called
a<00:00:11.280> basket<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.870> not<00:00:13.170> do<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> girth<00:00:13.950> hitch<00:00:16.520> and

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
a basket and not do a girth hitch and

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.130 
a basket and not do a girth hitch and
the<00:00:17.609> basket<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.180> just<00:00:18.390> looping<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.930> through

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
the basket is just looping it through

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.960 
the basket is just looping it through
there<00:00:19.289> but<00:00:19.830> I'll<00:00:19.920> tie<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.220> off<00:00:20.369> you'll<00:00:20.640> see<00:00:22.970> so

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
there but I'll tie it off you'll see so

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.169 
there but I'll tie it off you'll see so
I<00:00:24.000> lay<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> dead<00:00:24.539> man<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.930> there<00:00:27.170> with<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:29.880> fin

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
I lay the dead man in there with the fin

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.600 
I lay the dead man in there with the fin
going<00:00:30.869> downhill<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.560> catch<00:00:31.769> into<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.189> snow

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.350 

I'm<00:00:35.610> being<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:36.239> careful<00:00:36.920> to<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:38.360> damage

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
I'm being really careful to not damage

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.029 
I'm being really careful to not damage
the<00:00:39.750> snow<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.230> going<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.469> come<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:46.039> pound

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the snow it's going to come in to pound

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:56.350 
the snow it's going to come in to pound
it<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:50.360> want<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.390> make<00:00:51.590> room<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.620> my<00:00:52.949> sling

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:05.280 

so<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.420> take<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> little<00:00:57.899> trough<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.350> that

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.070 

step<00:01:05.950> around<00:01:06.100> I<00:01:06.580> don't<00:01:06.880> care<00:01:07.060> what<00:01:07.270> I<00:01:07.540> do<00:01:07.870> to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
step around I don't care what I do to

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.070 
step around I don't care what I do to
the<00:01:08.170> snow<00:01:08.380> above<00:01:08.680> it<00:01:09.330> but<00:01:10.330> below<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.750> I<00:01:10.840> want<00:01:11.020> to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
the snow above it but below it I want to

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.730 
the snow above it but below it I want to
keep<00:01:11.230> it<00:01:12.780> nice<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:13.810> firm<00:01:14.200> so<00:01:14.230> I'm<00:01:14.560> going<00:01:14.680> to

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
keep it nice and firm so I'm going to

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.270 
keep it nice and firm so I'm going to
pull<00:01:15.310> in<00:01:15.430> this<00:01:15.580> snow<00:01:16.620> you<00:01:17.620> pack<00:01:17.860> it<00:01:18.070> in<00:01:20.280> just

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
pull in this snow you pack it in just

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:45.899 
pull in this snow you pack it in just
pack<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.730> with<00:01:21.850> my<00:01:21.970> feet

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.990 

so<00:01:46.909> if<00:01:46.969> this<00:01:47.060> is<00:01:47.270> real<00:01:47.509> sugary<00:01:47.990> snow<00:01:48.819> just<00:01:49.819> by

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
so if this is real sugary snow just by

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.240 
so if this is real sugary snow just by
me<00:01:50.179> dancing<00:01:50.689> in<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.079> energy<00:01:51.259> of<00:01:51.859> me<00:01:52.069> moving

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
me dancing in it the energy of me moving

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.749 
me dancing in it the energy of me moving
creates<00:01:53.210> that<00:01:53.329> energy<00:01:53.719> it'll<00:01:53.869> bring<00:01:54.860> water<00:01:55.579> to

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
creates that energy it'll bring water to

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.600 
creates that energy it'll bring water to
the<00:01:55.939> snow<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:57.009> eventually<00:01:58.009> it'll<00:01:58.159> become

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
the snow and eventually it'll become

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.990 
the snow and eventually it'll become
hard<00:01:58.969> packed<00:01:59.799> so<00:02:00.799> I've<00:02:00.859> maybe<00:02:01.100> do<00:02:01.789> this<00:02:01.969> a

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
hard packed so I've maybe do this a

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.779 
hard packed so I've maybe do this a
little<00:02:02.240> bit<00:02:02.450> go<00:02:02.869> do<00:02:03.049> something<00:02:03.469> come<00:02:03.709> back<00:02:03.920> do

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
little bit go do something come back do

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.199 
little bit go do something come back do
it<00:02:04.819> again<00:02:04.939> if<00:02:05.539> I<00:02:05.659> was<00:02:05.810> in<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.590> hurry<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:07.209> would

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
it again if I was in a hurry I would

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:19.289 
it again if I was in a hurry I would
just<00:02:08.330> continue<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.810> do<00:02:08.989> it<00:02:09.080> till<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:09.319> was<00:02:09.410> doing

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.720 

so<00:02:20.299> I<00:02:20.630> have<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:20.959> basket<00:02:21.530> I'm<00:02:22.340> gonna<00:02:22.489> do<00:02:22.640> an

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
so I have a basket I'm gonna do an

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.860 
so I have a basket I'm gonna do an
overhand<00:02:23.090> knot<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:24.560> tie<00:02:24.799> this<00:02:24.860> off<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:26.569> make<00:02:26.720> it

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
overhand knot to tie this off to make it

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.500 
overhand knot to tie this off to make it
redundant<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:27.819> any<00:02:28.819> one<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.090> these<00:02:29.239> things

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
redundant so any one of these things

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.930 
redundant so any one of these things
could<00:02:29.629> get<00:02:29.870> chopped<00:02:30.170> right<00:02:30.379> now<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.849> would

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
could get chopped right now and it would

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.690 
could get chopped right now and it would
still<00:02:32.209> be<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.329> good<00:02:32.510> anchor
