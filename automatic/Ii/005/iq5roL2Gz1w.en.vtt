00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.750 
now back at the tower we used to have
balls

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.100 

and<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.849> mean<00:03:41.030> like<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.390> soccer<00:03:41.629> balls<00:03:41.930> on<00:03:42.080> a

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
and I mean like the soccer balls on a

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.690 
and I mean like the soccer balls on a
big<00:03:42.290> purple<00:03:42.560> ball<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:43.370> people<00:03:43.640> were

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
big purple ball and people were

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.130 
big purple ball and people were
wondering<00:03:43.940> where's<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.510> ball<00:03:44.659> in<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.959> reef

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
wondering where's the ball in the reef

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:52.149 
wondering where's the ball in the reef
so<00:03:46.040> here's<00:03:46.400> our<00:03:46.580> ball<00:03:48.459> right<00:03:49.459> here<00:03:50.769> it's<00:03:51.769> it's

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
so here's our ball right here it's it's

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.690 
so here's our ball right here it's it's
basically<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.819> shell<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.330> a<00:03:53.420> servitor<00:03:54.190> so<00:03:55.190> you

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
basically the shell of a servitor so you

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:05.110 
basically the shell of a servitor so you
can<00:03:55.849> try<00:03:56.239> to<00:03:56.299> get<00:03:56.480> that<00:03:56.599> out<00:03:56.780> sure<00:03:57.379> how<00:04:00.069> 10<00:04:04.120> ok
