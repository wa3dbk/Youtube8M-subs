00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.330
 the camaro is considered a small car 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.330
 but with a strong engine 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.130
 just take a look because this and others 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.330
 Myths gain a rereading for this 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.330
 early 21st century 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:38.690
 beautiful and fast these were the rebels 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:41.030
 ford chrysler and gm in the 60s after 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.590
 for so long thinking that they took 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.449
 judgment and nothing 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.930
 they are out there are still having dinner 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.900
 more mature and bold attitude shows 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:58.040
 how important is a myth to give 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:01:00.140
 back on top of a face of the 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.050
 another one is when you open the hoods 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.770
 who understands what 40 years of 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.770
 technology 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:16.530
 in 66 the chelsea gt350 had 270 horses 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.420
 it was the most modern 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.420
 who imagined flying low 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.190
 perhaps because of this a seat belt 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.920
 a house jet then v8 engine of 4,700 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.680
 mended it has the front suspension 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.560
 reinforced brake is also better but it is the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.120
 which is good in the age of 66 in a 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.120
 compare what you have in today's market 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.520
 2009 mustang gt version let's clear 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.580
 the consequences of using the injection 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.820
 electronics and super chardy 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.220
 The latter is the error in 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:59.950
 inside the cylinders and cause the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:02.350
 in this Mustang in 1966 that you 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.660
 had to wake up a pilot who is 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.600
 inside you because the machine was 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.910
 angry but had little ground 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.580
 made that whole problem in the car 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.980
 modern rival is a binomial pilot and 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:20.080
 car easier than you and fastback 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.180
 this quick-fall back with a 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.430
 very sharp angle a characteristic 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.200
 which marks the design of the classic master and 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.200
 which was retained in the new version 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.880
 now the basis of comparison is precisely 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.880
 66 luggage carrier and the side window 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.540
 the rival to the height 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:47.440
 the camaro arrives at 77 and share the attention 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.200
 of young people interested in 87 score a 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.849
 alternative six cylinder version 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.000
 everyone dreamed they were with the models 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.000
 anabolics passed the 500 horses 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.730
 intention to update the car with the 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.880
 over the years did not do well to the camaro 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.880
 lost identity and left the scene in 2002 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.270
 four years after testing it back 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.270
 as concept 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.459
 in 2009 puts the camaro back on tape 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.219
 the brazilian designer luciano nakamura 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.379
 had the pleasure of putting his hand in this 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:33.420
 mass design work that likes 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.730
 success achieved 1 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.310
 re-reading the camaro in a way that 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.010
 to achieve a whole new 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.010
 audience of sports car lovers 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:53.549
 is the dodge challenger rt 1970 motor the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.420
 block 383 6.3 liter three-speed 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.420
 automatic 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:04.220
 Ok Mauricio, now there's a look in this 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.220
 version the challenger repaginated 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.550
 just like it happened in the 60's is there 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:16.130
 dodge's answer that mustang and the 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.260
 Camaro is striking the resemblance until 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.760
 in details such as the tank cover 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:27.280
 O fuel that now is the harder it is 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.280
 decide which one to accelerate first 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:38.300
 old vinyl ceiling model and bands give 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.500
 a classic touch any 2009 rice 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.320
 Irga by default 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.530
 one of the great cullen taboos is to innovate 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:51.230
 everything is new and without losing 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:53.750
 total fit the date was to preserve the 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.620
 structure original car profile was 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.780
 sustained 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.860
 shape rear window shape 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.860
 cooperated its body 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:07.520
 the fun is listening to the change more 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:12.190
 sensitive motor rt not the snoring 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.190
 traditional of 8 383 is unmistakable 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:19.720
 already the 2009 shallon 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.820
 in other tuning the d8 uses technology 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.550
 rene electronic injection 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.310
 the challenger 70 is a car you have 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.830
 that carrying on the arm is a lot of brute force 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.080
 without any kind of electronic control 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.360
 to ensure the more than 300 horsepower 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.900
 motor force drum brakes in the 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.900
 four wheels 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.240
 the challenge is again different story 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.130
 disc brakes with latest generation abs 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.770
 stability control 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:54.810
 traction is a much easier and 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.560
 more safe to drive on the ice 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.419
 little wallet 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.479
 It's time for Mauritius to take a test 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.479
 drive 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.110
 It is a sensational guy temple Sufi tonic 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.210
 ps but after all only I still 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.220
 I would rather stay in my original car 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.169
 70 what I think a car has more 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.169
 class c feels more the car in hand 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.979
 is those who enjoy the classics not even give 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.129
 arm twisting 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.129
