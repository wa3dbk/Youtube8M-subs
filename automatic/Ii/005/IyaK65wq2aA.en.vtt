ball hitting and sit here basically this

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.880 
ball hitting and sit here basically this
is<00:02:11.360> probably<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.780> most<00:02:11.810> annoying<00:02:12.350> part<00:02:12.710> of

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
is probably the most annoying part of

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.770 
is probably the most annoying part of
doing<00:02:13.310> this<00:02:13.610> but<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.090> worth<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.540> in<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.660> end

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
doing this but it worth it in the end

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.810 
doing this but it worth it in the end
can<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.110> get<00:02:15.260> tons<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.710> VC<00:02:16.100> once<00:02:16.370> you've<00:02:16.550> done

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
can you get tons of VC once you've done

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.310 
can you get tons of VC once you've done
it<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.970> would<00:02:19.970> just<00:02:20.300> go<00:02:20.750> ahead<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.170> show<00:02:21.260> you

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
it so I would just go ahead and show you

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.430 
it so I would just go ahead and show you
got<00:02:21.470> at<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.590> end<00:02:21.650> but<00:02:21.860> already<00:02:22.100> done<00:02:22.430> this

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
got at the end but already done this

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.990

what<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.560> want<00:02:24.740> to<00:02:24.800> do<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:25.190> when<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:25.610> gets<00:02:25.760> to

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
what you want to do is when it gets to

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.270 
what you want to do is when it gets to
10<00:02:26.390> seconds<00:02:27.050> in<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.320> fourth<00:02:27.590> quarter<00:02:27.890> just

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
10 seconds in the fourth quarter just

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.180 
10 seconds in the fourth quarter just
all<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.730> time<00:02:28.940> out<00:02:32.320> just<00:02:33.320> hit<00:02:33.500> B<00:02:33.709> get<00:02:34.010> ready

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.250 
time you've pawed the game go to quit
and<00:02:38.900> save<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.440> quit<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:40.640> late<00:02:40.850> yes<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:42.080> get

that and then you name the file as
whatever<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:46.970> want

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
whatever you want

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.199 
whatever you want
I<00:02:47.740> suggest<00:02:48.740> you<00:02:48.830> name<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.160> like<00:02:49.280> these<00:02:49.520> should

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
I suggest you name it like these should

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.960 
I suggest you name it like these should
do<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:51.100> once<00:02:52.100> you've<00:02:52.310> done<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.520> you

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
do that and once you've done that you

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.960 
do that and once you've done that you
hit<00:02:53.180> load<00:02:56.620> then<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:57.740> hit<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.160> game<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:58.790> you

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
hit load then you hit the game that you

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.340 
hit load then you hit the game that you
have<00:02:59.000> just<00:02:59.450> played<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.840> point<00:03:03.140> of<00:03:03.260> the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
have just played the point of the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.650 
have just played the point of the
timeout<00:03:03.769> is<00:03:04.010> because<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:05.150> have<00:03:05.330> to<00:03:05.480> have<00:03:05.630> a

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
timeout is because you have to have a

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.990 
timeout is because you have to have a
dead<00:03:05.989> ball<00:03:06.200> if<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:07.160> don't<00:03:07.340> have<00:03:07.489> a<00:03:07.519> dead<00:03:07.790> ball

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
dead ball if you don't have a dead ball

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.670 
dead ball if you don't have a dead ball
that<00:03:08.239> probably<00:03:08.690> just<00:03:08.750> gonna<00:03:09.080> start<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.650> back

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
that probably just gonna start you back

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.259 
that probably just gonna start you back
in<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.100> fourth<00:03:10.340> quarter<00:03:10.580> once<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.030> save<00:03:11.239> the

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
in the fourth quarter once you save the

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.729 
in the fourth quarter once you save the
game<00:03:11.600> or<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.870> beginning<00:03:12.019> of<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.470> fourth

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.650 
game or the beginning of the fourth
quarter<00:03:12.950> that's<00:03:13.850> why<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.150> just<00:03:14.360> call<00:03:14.630> a

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
quarter that's why you just call a

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:33.200 
quarter that's why you just call a
timeout

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
nine-minute one I'll probably cut this
