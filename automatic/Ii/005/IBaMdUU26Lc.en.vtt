sort<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.570> things<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.289> know<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.500> looked

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
sort of things and you know it looked

really<00:00:49.800> cool<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.550> was<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:50.820> so

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
really cool but it was just so

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.369 
really cool but it was just so
entertaining<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.449> lot<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.719> fun<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.960> do<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.230> I

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
entertaining a lot of fun to do this I

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.750 
entertaining a lot of fun to do this I
guess<00:00:52.620> mainly<00:00:52.949> because<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.370> know<00:00:53.520> it's

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
guess mainly because you know it's

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.250 
guess mainly because you know it's
something<00:00:53.910> different<00:00:54.180> what<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.570> normally<00:00:54.690> do<00:00:55.050> I

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
something different what I normally do I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.319 
something different what I normally do I
started<00:00:55.949> off<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.219> pretty<00:00:56.550> rough<00:00:56.910> set<00:00:57.180> of

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
started off with a pretty rough set of

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.389 
started off with a pretty rough set of
my<00:00:57.510> ability<00:00:57.870> bar<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.230> before<00:00:58.800> any<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.280> guys

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
my ability bar so before any of you guys

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.920 
my ability bar so before any of you guys
actually<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.180> know<00:01:00.300> make<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> comment<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.870> that

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
actually you know make a comment on that

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.200 
actually you know make a comment on that
I<00:01:01.079> need<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.410> change<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.920> pretty<00:01:02.579> much<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
I need to change it pretty much the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.670 
I need to change it pretty much the
reason<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:03.750> rough<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.170> because<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.409> never

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
reason it's so rough is because I never

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.649 
reason it's so rough is because I never
even<00:01:04.890> looked<00:01:05.220> at<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.430> before<00:01:05.549> i<00:01:06.000> went<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
even looked at it before i went to the

even looked at it before i went to the
abyss<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.500> because<00:01:07.710> basically<00:01:08.369> as

yes<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.979> didn't<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:24.119> ranging<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.110> I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
yes so I didn't really do ranging so I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.499 
yes so I didn't really do ranging so I
guess<00:01:25.590> when<00:01:25.770> Aras<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.159> came<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:27.000> did<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
guess when Aras we came out I just did a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.240 
guess when Aras we came out I just did a
random<00:01:27.750> set<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.530> whatever<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.189> doing

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
random set up for whatever I was doing

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.100 
random set up for whatever I was doing
then<00:01:29.610> however<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.119> did<00:01:30.360> change<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.990> way

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
then however I did change it to a way

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.870 
then however I did change it to a way
which<00:01:31.619> was<00:01:31.770> actually<00:01:32.040> really<00:01:32.220> good<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.640> made

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
which was actually really good and made

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.550 
which was actually really good and made
kills<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.240> lot<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.450> fast<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.930> DPS<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> lot

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
kills a lot of fast and the DPS a lot

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560 
kills a lot of fast and the DPS a lot

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
who don't know it basically increases

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.050 
who don't know it basically increases
your<00:04:10.350> prayer<00:04:10.680> experience<00:04:11.160> by<00:04:11.310> 1%<00:04:11.640> when<00:04:11.910> it's

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
your prayer experience by 1% when it's

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.729 
your prayer experience by 1% when it's
worn<00:04:12.269> so<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.930> know<00:04:13.049> it's<00:04:13.260> not<00:04:13.380> a<00:04:13.440> lot<00:04:13.530> but

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.470 
worn so you know it's not a lot but
hopefully<00:04:14.579> over<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.820> long<00:04:15.000> run<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.299> should

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
hopefully over the long run it should

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.940 
hopefully over the long run it should
add<00:04:15.600> up<00:04:15.720> so<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.049> was<00:04:16.140> a<00:04:16.169> pretty<00:04:16.500> good<00:04:16.739> start

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.190 
and by the way before I get any comments
about<00:04:20.100> my<00:04:20.250> steadfast<00:04:20.519> yes<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.450> am<00:04:21.660> wearing<00:04:22.020> them

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
instead of the Ranger version or a sort

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.219 
instead of the Ranger version or a sort
of<00:04:24.300> range<00:04:24.539> of<00:04:24.720> boots<00:04:24.870> stuff<00:04:25.080> like<00:04:25.200> that

of range of boots stuff like that

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.360 
of range of boots stuff like that
because

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
because

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.340 
because
I<00:04:26.430> love<00:04:26.699> my<00:04:26.850> steadfast<00:04:27.090> so<00:04:27.479> much<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:28.080> wasn't

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
I love my steadfast so much and I wasn't

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.780 
I love my steadfast so much and I wasn't
really<00:04:28.500> planning<00:04:28.770> on<00:04:28.949> enjoying<00:04:29.100> range<00:04:29.580> as

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
really planning on enjoying range as

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.430 
really planning on enjoying range as
much<00:04:29.940> as<00:04:30.060> I<00:04:30.120> did<00:04:30.389> I<00:04:30.540> thought<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.050> was<00:04:31.229> just<00:04:31.320> going

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
much as I did I thought I was just going

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.290 
much as I did I thought I was just going
to<00:04:31.560> go<00:04:31.650> to<00:04:31.680> 70<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.340> then<00:04:32.490> stop<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:32.850> not<00:04:33.120> go

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
to go to 70 and then stop and not go

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.210 
to go to 70 and then stop and not go
back<00:04:33.479> for<00:04:33.690> a<00:04:33.720> while<00:04:33.840> but<00:04:34.500> because<00:04:34.770> I<00:04:34.889> enjoyed

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
back for a while but because I enjoyed

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.070 
back for a while but because I enjoyed
it<00:04:35.370> when<00:04:35.669> I<00:04:35.729> finish<00:04:36.030> up<00:04:36.120> my<00:04:36.270> Slayer<00:04:36.540> goals<00:04:36.780> and

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
it when I finish up my Slayer goals and

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.960 
it when I finish up my Slayer goals and
I<00:04:37.139> will<00:04:37.680> probably<00:04:37.860> go<00:04:38.100> back<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.400> start<00:04:38.639> ranging

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
I will probably go back to start ranging

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.280 
I will probably go back to start ranging
properly<00:04:39.270> again<00:04:39.419> I'll<00:04:39.600> definitely<00:04:39.780> sort<00:04:40.169> out

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
properly again I'll definitely sort out

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.170 
properly again I'll definitely sort out
a<00:04:40.320> proper<00:04:40.650> setup<00:04:40.919> for<00:04:41.490> my<00:04:41.639> armor<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.090> stuff

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
a proper setup for my armor and stuff

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.909 
a proper setup for my armor and stuff
like<00:04:42.419> that<00:04:42.479> so<00:04:42.630> don't<00:04:42.930> worry<00:04:43.080> about<00:04:43.139> that<00:04:43.470> also

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
like that so don't worry about that also

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.350 
like that so don't worry about that also
something<00:04:44.100> which<00:04:44.250> is<00:04:44.400> quite<00:04:44.580> cool<00:04:44.820> is<00:04:45.030> the

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
something which is quite cool is the

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.170 
something which is quite cool is the
range<00:04:45.690> Cape<00:04:46.020> than<00:04:46.260> 90<00:04:46.590> 91<00:04:46.800> it's<00:04:47.490> really<00:04:48.030> nice

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
range Cape than 90 91 it's really nice

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.480 
range Cape than 90 91 it's really nice
and<00:04:48.479> actually<00:04:48.810> maybe<00:04:49.320> after<00:04:49.740> I<00:04:49.800> go<00:04:49.919> for<00:04:50.160> 99

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
and actually maybe after I go for 99

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.850 
and actually maybe after I go for 99
attack<00:04:50.790> I<00:04:50.970> may<00:04:51.300> go<00:04:51.540> for<00:04:51.750> 99<00:04:52.169> range<00:04:52.380> I'm<00:04:52.710> not

attack I may go for 99 range I'm not

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.250 
attack I may go for 99 range I'm not
hundred<00:04:53.130> percent<00:04:53.340> sure<00:04:53.400> yet<00:04:53.669> obviously<00:04:54.630> 199

hundred percent sure yet obviously 199

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.020 
hundred percent sure yet obviously 199
at<00:04:55.380> a<00:04:55.410> time<00:04:55.650> that's<00:04:55.919> one<00:04:56.130> focusing<00:04:56.580> on<00:04:56.639> 99

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
at a time that's one focusing on 99

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.730 
at a time that's one focusing on 99
attack<00:04:57.300> right<00:04:57.510> now<00:04:57.540> once<00:04:58.169> I've<00:04:58.350> sorted<00:04:58.650> out

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
attack right now once I've sorted out

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.230 
attack right now once I've sorted out
the<00:04:58.800> Slayer<00:04:59.160> I<00:04:59.400> don't<00:04:59.610> know<00:04:59.699> it<00:04:59.789> wouldn't<00:05:00.000> take

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
the Slayer I don't know it wouldn't take

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.490 
the Slayer I don't know it wouldn't take
overly<00:05:00.690> long<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:00.960> do<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.080> so<00:05:01.320> it's<00:05:01.470> a

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
overly long to do it so it's a

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.560 
overly long to do it so it's a
possibility<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.550> possible<00:05:03.000> challenge<00:05:03.389> for

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
possibility and a possible challenge for

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.420 
possibility and a possible challenge for
the<00:05:03.630> near<00:05:03.870> future<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.289> expect<00:05:04.800> I<00:05:04.979> think

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
the near future to expect I think

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.740 
the near future to expect I think
someone<00:05:05.669> actually<00:05:05.789> in<00:05:06.000> this<00:05:06.120> video<00:05:06.360> was<00:05:06.570> just

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.129 
standing in the abyss after the creature
became<00:05:08.580> an<00:05:08.820> aggressive<00:05:09.510> but<00:05:09.660> they<00:05:09.750> had<00:05:09.930> one

which<00:06:24.360> is<00:06:24.479> actually<00:06:24.630> crazy<00:06:25.590> so<00:06:25.979> I<00:06:26.220> was<00:06:26.639> you

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849 
which is actually crazy so I was you

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.129 
which is actually crazy so I was you
know<00:06:26.880> it's<00:06:27.210> nice<00:06:27.360> to<00:06:27.479> have<00:06:27.539> a<00:06:27.599> bit<00:06:27.690> of<00:06:27.780> a<00:06:27.930> change

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
know it's nice to have a bit of a change

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:30.200 
know it's nice to have a bit of a change
of<00:06:28.349> scenery<00:06:28.560> I<00:06:28.740> guess<00:06:28.979> a<00:06:29.010> bit<00:06:29.160> of<00:06:29.340> a<00:06:29.520> different

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
of scenery I guess a bit of a different

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.520 
of scenery I guess a bit of a different
challenge<00:06:30.389> to<00:06:30.690> normal<00:06:30.960> so<00:06:31.110> hopefully<00:06:31.470> you

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
as well I'm just off focusing on hitting

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.040 
as well I'm just off focusing on hitting
my<00:06:38.580> goals<00:06:38.820> and<00:06:38.969> my<00:06:39.060> targets<00:06:39.510> first

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
my goals and my targets first

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.839 
my goals and my targets first
for<00:06:40.199> you<00:06:40.620> know<00:06:40.740> I<00:06:40.770> get<00:06:40.949> sidetracked<00:06:41.220> and<00:06:41.669> never

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:41.849 
for you know I get sidetracked and never

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:43.700 
for you know I get sidetracked and never
end<00:06:42.060> up<00:06:42.150> finishing<00:06:42.180> them<00:06:42.780> because<00:06:43.020> I<00:06:43.199> do<00:06:43.409> that

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
end up finishing them because I do that

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.170 
end up finishing them because I do that
cut<00:06:43.889> a<00:06:43.919> lot<00:06:44.129> so<00:06:44.310> I'm<00:06:44.400> trying<00:06:44.550> to<00:06:44.669> focus<00:06:44.819> on<00:06:45.030> this

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
cut a lot so I'm trying to focus on this

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.969 
cut a lot so I'm trying to focus on this
once<00:06:45.810> I've<00:06:45.990> done<00:06:46.110> that<00:06:46.169> I'll<00:06:46.470> definitely<00:06:46.650> go

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
once I've done that I'll definitely go

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:48.980 
once I've done that I'll definitely go
ahead<00:06:47.220> and<00:06:47.430> do<00:06:47.580> some<00:06:47.759> bossing<00:06:48.150> get<00:06:48.599> some<00:06:48.810> cool

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
ahead and do some bossing get some cool

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.140 
ahead and do some bossing get some cool
drops<00:06:49.259> fingers<00:06:49.710> crossed<00:06:50.039> and<00:06:50.310> some<00:06:50.610> XP<00:06:50.940> so

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
drops fingers crossed and some XP so

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.279 
drops fingers crossed and some XP so
that<00:06:51.240> would<00:06:51.330> be<00:06:51.360> really<00:06:51.509> fun<00:06:51.720> to<00:06:51.840> do<00:06:51.930> that<00:06:52.080> but

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
that would be really fun to do that but

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:54.589 
that would be really fun to do that but
overall<00:06:52.949> I<00:06:53.129> did<00:06:53.340> enjoy<00:06:53.550> the<00:06:53.669> task<00:06:53.909> and<00:06:54.210> even

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 
overall I did enjoy the task and even

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:56.149 
overall I did enjoy the task and even
though<00:06:54.690> it<00:06:54.750> was<00:06:54.900> quite<00:06:55.080> sure<00:06:55.319> I<00:06:55.560> also<00:06:55.800> managed

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:56.159 
though it was quite sure I also managed

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:57.770 
though it was quite sure I also managed
to<00:06:56.310> get<00:06:56.460> a<00:06:56.520> few<00:06:56.639> adamant<00:06:57.270> bar<00:06:57.419> drops<00:06:57.659> that

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
to get a few adamant bar drops that

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.119 
to get a few adamant bar drops that
you'll<00:06:57.930> see<00:06:58.080> in<00:06:58.110> my<00:06:58.259> invent<00:06:58.620> which<00:06:58.860> is<00:06:58.949> pretty

00:06:59.119 --> 00:06:59.129 
you'll see in my invent which is pretty

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:00.980 
you'll see in my invent which is pretty
cool<00:06:59.400> but<00:06:59.819> apart<00:07:00.120> from<00:07:00.150> that<00:07:00.270> the<00:07:00.629> loop<00:07:00.840> was

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
cool but apart from that the loop was

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.659 
cool but apart from that the loop was
pretty<00:07:01.199> poor<00:07:01.409> I<00:07:01.470> think<00:07:01.800> I<00:07:01.889> totaled<00:07:02.340> roughly

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:02.669 
pretty poor I think I totaled roughly

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:05.360 
pretty poor I think I totaled roughly
260<00:07:03.449> k<00:07:03.569> so<00:07:03.840> nothing<00:07:04.440> crazy<00:07:04.680> but<00:07:04.949> I<00:07:04.979> guess<00:07:05.190> after

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
260 k so nothing crazy but I guess after

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.760 
260 k so nothing crazy but I guess after
the<00:07:05.580> 20<00:07:05.940> to<00:07:06.030> 30<00:07:06.240> minutes<00:07:06.479> it<00:07:06.629> took<00:07:06.780> it<00:07:07.110> wasn't

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
the 20 to 30 minutes it took it wasn't

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.320 
the 20 to 30 minutes it took it wasn't
too<00:07:07.979> bad<00:07:08.009> I<00:07:08.220> guess<00:07:08.370> for<00:07:08.639> lower<00:07:08.819> level<00:07:09.090> players

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
too bad I guess for lower level players

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.939 
too bad I guess for lower level players
looking<00:07:09.629> for<00:07:09.810> easy<00:07:09.930> money<00:07:10.169> this<00:07:10.710> could<00:07:10.889> be

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
looking for easy money this could be

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.680 
looking for easy money this could be
something<00:07:11.129> you<00:07:11.250> do<00:07:11.490> miss<00:07:11.610> about<00:07:11.699> 5<00:07:12.090> to<00:07:12.210> 600<00:07:12.419> k

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.690 
something you do miss about 5 to 600 k

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.450 
something you do miss about 5 to 600 k
an<00:07:12.750> hour<00:07:12.900> I<00:07:12.990> guess<00:07:13.229> if<00:07:13.349> you<00:07:13.440> go<00:07:13.560> by<00:07:13.770> the<00:07:14.039> rate

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 
an hour I guess if you go by the rate

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.219 
an hour I guess if you go by the rate
that<00:07:14.610> I<00:07:14.669> just<00:07:14.909> went<00:07:15.120> by<00:07:15.270> and<00:07:15.509> you<00:07:15.930> know<00:07:16.050> my

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:16.229 
that I just went by and you know my

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:18.020 
that I just went by and you know my
level<00:07:16.500> stuff<00:07:16.770> like<00:07:16.919> that<00:07:16.949> but<00:07:17.340> either<00:07:17.729> way<00:07:18.000> I

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.030 
level stuff like that but either way I

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.399 
level stuff like that but either way I
wasn't<00:07:18.300> there<00:07:18.539> for<00:07:18.599> the<00:07:18.750> money<00:07:18.900> or<00:07:19.050> the<00:07:19.199> loot

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:19.409 
wasn't there for the money or the loot

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:21.290 
wasn't there for the money or the loot
anyway<00:07:19.740> so<00:07:19.800> I<00:07:20.190> guess<00:07:20.550> anything<00:07:20.909> I<00:07:21.000> got<00:07:21.150> was

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 
anyway so I guess anything I got was

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.670 
anyway so I guess anything I got was
just<00:07:21.449> a<00:07:21.509> bonus<00:07:21.719> but<00:07:21.990> I<00:07:22.050> did<00:07:22.229> manage<00:07:22.319> to<00:07:22.500> get<00:07:22.620> the

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 
just a bonus but I did manage to get the

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.930 
just a bonus but I did manage to get the
key<00:07:22.830> piece<00:07:23.009> which<00:07:23.219> is<00:07:23.340> cool<00:07:23.520> and<00:07:23.729> I'll

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 
key piece which is cool and I'll

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.279 
key piece which is cool and I'll
definitely<00:07:24.090> look<00:07:24.360> really<00:07:24.690> awesome<00:07:24.840> in<00:07:25.169> the

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:25.289

kill 106 fungal mages which should be

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.129 
kill 106 fungal mages which should be
quite<00:07:29.430> fun<00:07:29.639> to<00:07:29.699> do<00:07:29.879> and<00:07:30.090> not<00:07:30.330> a<00:07:30.389> bad<00:07:30.599> task<00:07:30.870> if<00:07:31.080> I

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:31.139 
quite fun to do and not a bad task if I

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:33.649 
quite fun to do and not a bad task if I
remember<00:07:31.500> rightly<00:07:31.770> so<00:07:32.280> 106<00:07:32.879> points<00:07:33.060> total<00:07:33.330> now

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:33.659 
remember rightly so 106 points total now

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:35.240 
remember rightly so 106 points total now
what<00:07:33.840> I've<00:07:33.930> got<00:07:34.110> so<00:07:34.139> far<00:07:34.319> it<00:07:34.889> shouldn't<00:07:35.219> really

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.250 
what I've got so far it shouldn't really

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.520 
what I've got so far it shouldn't really
take<00:07:35.550> overly<00:07:36.210> too<00:07:36.330> long<00:07:36.509> I<00:07:36.569> don't<00:07:36.750> think<00:07:36.960> but

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:37.530 
take overly too long I don't think but

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.080 
take overly too long I don't think but
we<00:07:37.650> should<00:07:37.800> get<00:07:37.919> some<00:07:38.129> nice<00:07:38.280> levels<00:07:38.639> and<00:07:38.759> XP

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.090
