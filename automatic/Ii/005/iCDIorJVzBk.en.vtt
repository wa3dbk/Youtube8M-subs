00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.470
 there is everyone it's sir intox 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.349
 I hope you are well 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.939
 so today a new video that 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.610
 done a long time so I know I want to 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.779
 excuse me so be aware that if 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.609
 particular or simply it's 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.020
 because that was the end the two coach 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.630
 young people who were playing more simply 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.949
 in any case very little and then I had 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.510
 more good dishes or 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.500
 things like that so I preferred 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.920
 wait for the release of gloss everything 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.830
 just to be able to give you a 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.989
 new gameplay and all so to do 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.780
 rest gameplay in may on the map 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.830
 octane so we liked the level of the 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.839
 class 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.510
 you will see it appear for 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.949
 a few seconds later but I you 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.440
 as you had so then I play 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.600
 with the cad 12 it's a bit like the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.600
 deficiency is somehow I wish 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.260
 the cahc 12 handle silent points and 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.540
 silent for me who 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.710
 who is more is very well took no 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.580
 but I can advise you it is 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.920
 really very good weapons 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.210
 so I do not play his high school without 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.650
 deadly tactical senses that all 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.020
 simply to be able to have several 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.900
 hours to have a place for 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.520
 assets in addition just simply 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.350
 so compared to the assets I play 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.890
 with three passes to recharge 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.930
 faster 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.940
 it's very important tracker especially 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.040
 honestly I really have a lot less 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.690
 the age of his tracker and you can 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.120
 win many duels thanks to tracker 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.900
 Anyway it's my opinion you've tested 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.610
 to test after looters and even before 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.070
 to take a lounge bar you that 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.690
 ammunition but then I was told to test 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.759
 something else is how 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.380
 is called direct power of the party 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.520
 she starts ammunition my taste 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.530
 it was that except at the creation of football 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.390
 ration is like robustness on tray 2 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.560
 it serves to make you shudder 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.560
 less in a few hours 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.550
 as I shot you and 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.030
 determination to be able to settle but 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.920
 it's loops 8.8 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.470
 so at level 2 in my series 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.260
 you can see these radars including 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.429
 claude rolin who is no longer useful for anything 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.420
 does they do but it's just he 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.430
 you have to put 2 2 it's his 2 e 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.320
 or 3 so that there is a sweep on the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.209
 map and after a fourth for who is 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.280
 a kind of micro station gilles said 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.600
 a kind a so after good there's the dog 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.239
 dog he is the helicopter pilot 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.590
 where you are at the level of 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.760
 gameplay or at the party really not 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.950
 really care finally I mean 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.560
 it's a trivial gameplay he does not know 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.350
 a football game I want to you 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.880
 specify because you have to know that the 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.459
 brew his closure in ghost is out 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.049
 but so I have not yet tour mark 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.540
 on the game 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.450
 I still have a hard time playing it at 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.739
 to make me somehow occupy 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.970
 it's not the best, but it's 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.860
 there and it's one of the best parts 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.950
 that I was able to film because there is no 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.250
 my studio in any case on ps3 and 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.170
 hot guys next gen so then 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.940
 than at the level of 7.7 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.860
 this video so I wanted to talk to you 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.950
 of the new team I decided to 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.250
 do it apply if it's called the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:20.090
 team avox so broke a name rather 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.890
 styled after at the criteria level so 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.100
 good I know that some people do not 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.600
 will disagree did not like 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.260
 write that I 'm going to impose but that's 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.230
 like that I can not take anything 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.440
 who I wanted to give 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.260
 so if you meet these criteria and 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.450
 that you think you can enter the 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.420
 team to leave a comment and I 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.680
 look at it so just right 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.760
 between corraza I hope I heard 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.180
 not my dog ​​screaming 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.490
 what makes me hit the pit on time 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.530
 so here is the recruitment 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.900
 it would be nice if you had years 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.940
 10 16 years old and 16 years old 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.580
 because most of the time with the 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.830
 people to whom I play my age in 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:12.080
 average you have to know that I'm 21 years old 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:15.890
 so I can not finally play who 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.280
 should not take people a 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:23.180
 build what would be too young by 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.920
 example simply because we play 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.630
 quite late 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.580
 possible one to one learns to play 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.850
 some sit on weekends how 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.230
 weeks so it has to be 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.620
 senior officials other all 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.020
 simply 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.420
 it's in his sernam without saying an example 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.850
 if how do I say if I take someone 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.370
 who at 13 14 but who will be able 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.620
 play a little at night until then to say 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.850
 10 o'clock in the evening 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.220
 certainly I would have with us but the baule 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.930
 lower all this stuff so we 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.380
 is in a team to be alone that does not 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.180
 not worth it 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.460
 so that's why the level of 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.800
 criteria I need 17 years minimum 17 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.930
 years or 16 years later he can see some 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.540
 exceptions after that you have to be 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:07.430
 mature to be mature know how to have fun 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:10.640
 it is the berrigaud the aigoual and have 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.950
 the schedules you said pretty flexible I 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:18.080
 do not know me play about this art 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:20.600
 like the night whether it's on your 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.490
 midnight tv 1am something 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.990
 like that so sometimes we really play 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.850
 very very late until sunrise 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.220
 sometimes 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.630
 so that's to say so at 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.360
 age level you i them you i 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.550
 explain no mans did not hold rigor 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.800
 it's like I said it's a good 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.980
 collaboration at the team level after 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.770
 you must have a microphone at 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.810
 psn and have the opportunity to be able 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.070
 login on skype so that's true 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.720
 a good microphone for pro sky 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.610
 I know daddy you something 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.800
 mandatory but it is possible that 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.210
 for example we decide to make a lake of 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.890
 tignes but that the bar of es14 evil 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.930
 it would be simpler we are con 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.560
 subscribed 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:02.420
 after at the ratio of judge less 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.450
 of a minimum ratio to this 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.920
 what is the viti I insists of course that by 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.790
 compared to what had woven the wake 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.970
 post 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:14.810
 should we say at least 1 1 32 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.790
 ration so for a moment I had thought about 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.990
 do a little more but honestly seen 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.650
 that the game wins started that he is 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.150
 really hard for me 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.580
 how the hell to put in when 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.550
 somehow 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.909
 the ratio is easy to hold in any 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.479
 kind 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:37.490
 here I ask even 1.32 ratio it takes 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.840
 also have the possibility of being able to 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.810
 pass on the ps4 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.430
 eventually because it's never 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:48.570
 recruitment on ps3 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:50.250
 so so you have to go 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.710
 on ps4 thereafter I say not since the 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.870
 August is the month she goes out a 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:57.060
 palace month of December what but we're going 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.820
 say later tonight or Feb. 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.930
 just like that because even I do not know 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.910
 I still do not really take 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.260
 risks 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:07.200
 then simply because 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:10.230
 that although you are a player who 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.970
 play the victory because personally me 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.410
 when I play certainly and to make a 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:18.650
 good part but it's mostly doomed 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:21.630
 no it's no use broken my opinion and 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:26.490
 so that's it I explain to you a little 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.870
 shit rings with what so the party 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.820
 it's over I hope the video 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.080
 you enjoyed the gameplay is not a good 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.830
 crazy gameplay as you explain 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:37.080
 but I'll try to get out some good ones 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.760
 gameplay afterwards I really 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.800
 possible in any case so leave some 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.740
 comments and apply to death and then 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.670
 I will look at all this here is it 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.670
 chat
