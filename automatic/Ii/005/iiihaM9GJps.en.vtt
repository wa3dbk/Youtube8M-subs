00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.710 
they are made with recycled plastic and
we<00:02:43.660> try<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.930> be<00:02:44.260> as<00:02:44.380> green<00:02:44.920> as<00:02:44.980> we<00:02:45.310> can<00:02:45.570> it's<00:02:46.570> not

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
we try to be as green as we can it's not

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.240 
we try to be as green as we can it's not
always<00:02:46.960> difficult<00:02:47.290> when<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.860> run<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.040> business

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
always difficult when you run a business

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.760 
always difficult when you run a business
to<00:02:48.610> be<00:02:48.730> completely<00:02:49.300> green<00:02:49.600> but<00:02:50.110> whatever<00:02:50.590> we

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
to be completely green but whatever we

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.750 
to be completely green but whatever we
can<00:02:50.950> do<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:51.790> between<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.690> metal<00:02:53.730> canister<00:02:54.730> and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
can do so between the metal canister and

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.350 
can do so between the metal canister and
the<00:02:55.720> green<00:02:55.960> cups<00:02:56.260> with<00:02:56.740> something<00:03:00.300> okay<00:03:01.300> so

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
the green cups with something okay so

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.790 
the green cups with something okay so
that's<00:03:02.320> almost<00:03:02.680> boiling<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.910> I'm<00:03:04.030> going<00:03:04.270> to

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
that's almost boiling so I'm going to

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:20.230 
that's almost boiling so I'm going to
open<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:06.040> canister

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.640 

then<00:03:21.240> put<00:03:21.570> one<00:03:22.110> cup

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.190 

of<00:03:25.159> the<00:03:25.420> powder<00:03:26.420> /<00:03:26.959> pieces<00:03:28.599> you<00:03:29.599> can<00:03:29.629> see<00:03:30.019> that

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
of the powder / pieces you can see that

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.649 
of the powder / pieces you can see that
we<00:03:30.319> put<00:03:30.530> really<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.280> lot<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.610> calculates<00:03:32.510> in

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
we put really a lot of calculates in

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.670 
we put really a lot of calculates in
there<00:03:34.060> so<00:03:35.060> that's<00:03:35.599> something<00:03:35.810> very<00:03:36.140> important

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
there so that's something very important

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.280 
there so that's something very important
when<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.370> make<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.640> hot<00:03:37.790> chocolates<00:03:38.290> you

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
when you make the hot chocolates you

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.920 
when you make the hot chocolates you
have<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.650> stir<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.099> chocolates<00:03:40.549> contain<00:03:40.670> sugar

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
have to stir it chocolates contain sugar

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.289 
have to stir it chocolates contain sugar
sugar<00:03:41.930> will<00:03:42.319> caramelize<00:03:43.129> and<00:03:43.670> stick<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.060> the

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
sugar will caramelize and stick to the

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.839 
sugar will caramelize and stick to the
pot<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.799> attach<00:03:45.799> to<00:03:46.099> the<00:03:46.220> pot<00:03:46.400> if<00:03:46.579> you<00:03:46.670> don't

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
pot and attach to the pot if you don't

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.140 
pot and attach to the pot if you don't
stir<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.629> stir<00:03:48.019> until<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.970> hot<00:03:49.970> chocolate

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
stir so stir until the hot chocolate

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.479 
stir so stir until the hot chocolate
boil<00:03:50.689> now<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.079> hot<00:03:51.379> chocolate<00:03:51.560> has<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.250> boil

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
boil now the hot chocolate has to boil

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.789 
boil now the hot chocolate has to boil
the<00:03:53.090> reason<00:03:53.420> is<00:03:53.569> we<00:03:53.750> put<00:03:53.930> a<00:03:53.959> little<00:03:54.200> tiny<00:03:54.620> bit

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
the reason is we put a little tiny bit

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.460 
the reason is we put a little tiny bit
of<00:03:54.950> starch<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:56.150> activate<00:03:56.750> that<00:03:56.780> stuff<00:03:57.230> to

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
of starch and to activate that stuff to

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.970 
of starch and to activate that stuff to
keep<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.920> give<00:03:58.099> that<00:03:58.280> velvety<00:03:59.440> texture<00:04:00.440> you

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
keep to give that velvety texture you

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.199 
keep to give that velvety texture you
need<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.489> boil<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:03.530> hot<00:04:04.040> chocolates<00:04:04.489> so

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
need to boil the hot chocolates so

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.599 
need to boil the hot chocolates so
that's<00:04:05.389> important<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:06.170> it's<00:04:06.920> almost<00:04:07.250> going<00:04:07.430> to

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
that's important so it's almost going to

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:15.860 
that's important so it's almost going to
boil<00:04:07.760> here

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:27.670 

so<00:04:16.870> we<00:04:16.989> give<00:04:17.140> it<00:04:17.230> another<00:04:17.470> second<00:04:17.920> here

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.590 

you<00:04:28.680> can<00:04:28.830> stop<00:04:29.160> stirring<00:04:29.669> for<00:04:30.000> a<00:04:30.060> few<00:04:30.210> seconds

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
you can stop stirring for a few seconds

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.469 
you can stop stirring for a few seconds
it's<00:04:30.960> okay<00:04:31.380> but<00:04:31.949> not<00:04:32.310> that<00:04:32.430> long<00:04:35.150> okay<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:36.210> now

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
it's okay but not that long okay so now

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.629 
it's okay but not that long okay so now
it's<00:04:36.780> start<00:04:37.050> boiling<00:04:37.259> oh<00:04:40.069> I<00:04:41.069> wish<00:04:41.370> that<00:04:41.490> you

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
it's start boiling oh I wish that you

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.430 
it's start boiling oh I wish that you
can<00:04:41.789> smell<00:04:42.120> that<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.810> chocolate<00:04:46.259> is<00:04:46.410> ready

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
can smell that so the chocolate is ready

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.680 
can smell that so the chocolate is ready
to<00:04:46.800> be<00:04:46.919> served<00:04:46.949> now<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:47.880> can<00:04:48.060> take<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.389> hot

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
to be served now you can take the hot

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.570 
to be served now you can take the hot
chocolate<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:49.289> put<00:04:49.440> it<00:04:49.590> directly<00:04:50.160> in<00:04:50.460> the

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
chocolate and put it directly in the

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.540 
chocolate and put it directly in the
cups<00:04:50.819> or<00:04:51.720> what<00:04:52.259> you<00:04:52.410> can<00:04:52.590> do<00:04:52.740> is<00:04:52.860> transfer<00:04:53.340> that

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
cups or what you can do is transfer that

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.129 
cups or what you can do is transfer that
into<00:04:55.220> this<00:04:56.220> container<00:04:56.849> here<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.630> reason<00:04:57.990> is

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
into this container here the reason is

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.029 
into this container here the reason is
that<00:04:58.729> has<00:04:59.729> a<00:05:00.060> blade<00:05:00.479> inside<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.590> going<00:05:01.860> to

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
that has a blade inside that going to

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.490 
that has a blade inside that going to
form<00:05:02.729> the<00:05:03.000> chocolate<00:05:03.389> give<00:05:03.570> it<00:05:03.660> a<00:05:03.750> form<00:05:04.050> in<00:05:04.199> the

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
form the chocolate give it a form in the

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.350 
form the chocolate give it a form in the
past<00:05:04.770> and<00:05:05.039> you<00:05:05.130> can<00:05:05.310> see<00:05:05.520> some<00:05:07.520> drawing<00:05:08.520> from

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
past and you can see some drawing from

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.689 
past and you can see some drawing from
the<00:05:09.509> Aztec<00:05:09.870> time<00:05:10.139> when<00:05:10.440> they<00:05:10.530> was<00:05:10.710> starting<00:05:11.520> to

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
the Aztec time when they was starting to

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.310 
the Aztec time when they was starting to
make<00:05:11.849> hot<00:05:12.000> chocolate<00:05:12.030> and<00:05:12.539> they<00:05:12.870> used<00:05:13.020> to<00:05:13.139> take

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
make hot chocolate and they used to take

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.589 
make hot chocolate and they used to take
two<00:05:13.979> parts<00:05:14.370> one<00:05:14.550> like<00:05:14.759> that<00:05:14.910> and<00:05:14.970> another<00:05:15.389> one

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
two parts one like that and another one

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.480 
two parts one like that and another one
on<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.780> floor<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:16.229> pull<00:05:16.949> all<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.340> hot

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
on the floor and pull all the hot

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.310 
on the floor and pull all the hot
chocolates<00:05:17.940> into<00:05:18.180> one<00:05:18.810> pot<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.229> then

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
chocolates into one pot and then

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.560 
chocolates into one pot and then
transfer<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.130> then<00:05:20.250> do<00:05:20.400> it<00:05:20.550> again<00:05:20.849> four<00:05:21.479> or

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
transfer and then do it again four or

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.839 
transfer and then do it again four or
five<00:05:21.780> six<00:05:22.139> time<00:05:22.409> until<00:05:23.039> the<00:05:23.159> chocolates<00:05:23.639> get

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
five six time until the chocolates get

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:25.850 
five six time until the chocolates get
very<00:05:24.360> Airy<00:05:24.690> aided<00:05:25.139> and<00:05:25.259> then<00:05:25.470> they<00:05:25.620> used<00:05:25.650> to

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
very Airy aided and then they used to

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.790 
very Airy aided and then they used to
serve<00:05:26.159> it<00:05:26.340> so<00:05:27.060> here<00:05:27.780> you<00:05:28.289> don't<00:05:28.380> have<00:05:28.500> to<00:05:28.710> go

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
serve it so here you don't have to go

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:40.820 
serve it so here you don't have to go
crazy<00:05:28.830> like<00:05:29.280> that<00:05:29.340> you<00:05:29.610> can<00:05:29.789> just<00:05:30.199> do<00:05:31.199> that
