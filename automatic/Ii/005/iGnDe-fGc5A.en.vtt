00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.130 
with about 10 15 feet of this hose here
which<00:00:34.469> pretty<00:00:35.280> good<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.540> connect<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
which pretty good you just connect the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.410 
which pretty good you just connect the
tank<00:00:38.100> cover<00:00:39.410> and<00:00:40.410> as<00:00:41.340> well<00:00:41.550> as<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.879> these

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
tank cover and as well as this these

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.220 
tank cover and as well as this these
connectors<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.969> therefore<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.930> actual

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
connectors here therefore the the actual

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.380 
connectors here therefore the the actual
sprayer<00:00:46.559> wand<00:00:46.860> won't<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.670> using<00:00:47.940> those<00:00:48.059> but

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
sprayer wand won't be using those but

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.650 
sprayer wand won't be using those but

multi-purpose battery charger so I'll

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.969 
multi-purpose battery charger so I'll
give<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.329> go<00:01:48.780> we'll<00:01:49.079> get<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.409> all<00:01:49.530> charged

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
give that a go we'll get it all charged

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.660 
give that a go we'll get it all charged
up<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.430> connected<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.229> tank<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.380> pump

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.650 
battery here obviously we'd want to get
a<00:02:06.740> proper<00:02:07.190> battery<00:02:07.700> box<00:02:08.000> for<00:02:08.240> this<00:02:08.360> for<00:02:08.630> a

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
a proper battery box for this for a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.130 
a proper battery box for this for a
safer<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.110> faster<00:02:09.380> hook<00:02:09.740> up<00:02:10.660> black<00:02:11.660> foam<00:02:11.960> is

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
safer and faster hook up black foam is

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.250 
safer and faster hook up black foam is
coming<00:02:12.440> from<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.680> pump<00:02:13.780> which<00:02:14.780> at<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.020> end<00:02:15.140> I

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
coming from the pump which at the end I

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.430 
coming from the pump which at the end I
got<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.410> ball<00:02:15.650> valve<00:02:16.150> out<00:02:17.150> there<00:02:17.510> where's<00:02:18.260> my

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
got a ball valve out there where's my

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.430 
got a ball valve out there where's my
gold<00:02:18.740> lows<00:02:19.300> aggression<00:02:20.300> so<00:02:21.020> we're<00:02:21.140> just<00:02:21.170> going

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
gold lows aggression so we're just going

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.300 
gold lows aggression so we're just going
to<00:02:21.500> turn<00:02:21.710> this<00:02:21.920> on<00:02:22.160> temporarily<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:24.190> see<00:02:25.190> what

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
to turn this on temporarily and see what

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.250 
to turn this on temporarily and see what
we<00:02:25.400> got<00:02:28.180> okay<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:29.270> I<00:02:29.540> got<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.720> battery<00:02:30.080> hooked

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
we got okay so I got the battery hooked

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:47.770 
we got okay so I got the battery hooked
up

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.410 

pretty<00:02:48.780> good<00:02:48.959> distance<00:02:49.880> see<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.030> distance

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
pretty good distance see the distance

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.480 
pretty good distance see the distance
there<00:02:51.630> it's<00:02:51.990> pretty<00:02:52.230> windy<00:02:52.440> input<00:02:52.950> for<00:02:53.340> the

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
there it's pretty windy input for the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:10.610 
there it's pretty windy input for the
water<00:02:53.670> back<00:02:53.940> down<00:03:04.580> here<00:03:09.140> maybe<00:03:10.140> that's<00:03:10.380> plenty

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
water back down here maybe that's plenty

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.890 
water back down here maybe that's plenty
of<00:03:10.800> water<00:03:11.040> there<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:12.270> wash<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.989> rinse<00:03:14.780> but<00:03:15.780> it

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
of water there to wash it rinse but it

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
of water there to wash it rinse but it
is<00:03:16.050> coming<00:03:16.290> out<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.530> also<00:03:17.209> pulsating<00:03:18.209> crashing

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
is coming out of also pulsating crashing

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.979 
is coming out of also pulsating crashing
one<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.130> things<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.550> noticed<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.930> that

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
one of the things I noticed is that

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.229 
one of the things I noticed is that
there's<00:03:22.260> actually<00:03:22.620> two<00:03:22.860> tabs<00:03:23.220> for<00:03:23.940> one<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.180> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
there's actually two tabs for one of the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.660 
there's actually two tabs for one of the
leads<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:26.000> before<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.300> was<00:03:27.480> on<00:03:27.980> this<00:03:28.980> tab<00:03:29.280> here

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
leads and before it was on this tab here

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.460 
leads and before it was on this tab here
so<00:03:30.540> I'm<00:03:30.600> going<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.810> switch<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:30.989> over<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.290> this

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
so I'm going to switch it over to this

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.380 
so I'm going to switch it over to this
tab<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:33.980> hook<00:03:34.980> everything<00:03:35.250> up<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.700> see<00:03:36.239> what

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
tab and hook everything up and see what

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.690 
tab and hook everything up and see what
kind<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.569> a<00:03:36.690> difference<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:37.170> makes<00:03:37.519> might<00:03:38.519> be<00:03:38.670> a

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
kind of a difference it makes might be a

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:46.520 
kind of a difference it makes might be a
different<00:03:39.420> power<00:03:39.600> power<00:03:40.410> rating<00:03:40.860> PSI<00:03:41.400> rating

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.510 

hearing<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.620> pump

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
I guess the last thing they need to do

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.820 
I guess the last thing they need to do
