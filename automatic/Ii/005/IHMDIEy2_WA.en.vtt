00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
site aiming at this 45-degree wall which

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.380 
site aiming at this 45-degree wall which
I<00:00:34.590> don't<00:00:34.950> know<00:00:35.130> how<00:00:35.399> many<00:00:35.460> people<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.910> this

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
I don't know how many people know this

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.690 
I don't know how many people know this
there's<00:00:36.750> actually<00:00:37.320> three<00:00:37.350> walls<00:00:38.070> here

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
there's actually three walls here

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.600 
there's actually three walls here
there's<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.540> wall<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.710> wall<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.280> then

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
there's this wall this wall and then

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.060 
there's this wall this wall and then
this<00:00:41.820> 45-degree<00:00:42.690> wall<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:43.950> actually

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
this 45-degree wall and you can actually

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.450 
this 45-degree wall and you can actually
Bank<00:00:44.879> smokes<00:00:45.840> flashes<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.590> maids<00:00:46.829> off<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
Bank smokes flashes and maids off of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.479 
Bank smokes flashes and maids off of
that<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.450> from<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.590> far<00:00:49.800> back<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.190> hard<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
that so from this far back it's hard to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.549 
that so from this far back it's hard to
tell<00:00:50.730> where<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.050> sort<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.379> look<00:00:52.469> at

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
tell where it is you can sort of look at

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.310 
tell where it is you can sort of look at
the<00:00:52.590> ground<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.070> tell<00:00:53.870> right<00:00:54.870> there<00:00:54.899> it's

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the ground and tell right there it's

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.639 
the ground and tell right there it's
slightly<00:00:55.879> angled<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.050> takes<00:00:58.440> time

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
slightly angled but it just takes time

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.279 
slightly angled but it just takes time
getting<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.309> know<00:00:59.489> where<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.940> wall<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.629> but

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
getting to know where that wall is but

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.229 
getting to know where that wall is but
then<00:01:01.469> basically<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.190> about<00:01:02.789> halfway<00:01:03.059> up

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
then basically I just about halfway up

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.670 
then basically I just about halfway up
the<00:01:03.420> wall<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:04.080> run<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.830> throw<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:07.560> this

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the wall I just run and throw and this

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.700 
the wall I just run and throw and this
will<00:01:07.830> smoke<00:01:08.070> off<00:01:08.250> ramp<00:01:08.930> any<00:01:09.930> terrorist<00:01:10.590> that

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
will smoke off ramp any terrorist that

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.170 
will smoke off ramp any terrorist that
wants<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.130> push<00:01:11.310> through<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.670> smoke<00:01:12.000> is

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
wants to push through this smoke is

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.330 
wants to push through this smoke is
gonna<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.479> at<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.659> huge<00:01:12.960> disadvantage<00:01:13.340> they

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
gonna be at a huge disadvantage they

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.649 
gonna be at a huge disadvantage they
won't<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.610> able<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.760> see<00:01:15.000> until<00:01:15.299> about<00:01:15.420> right

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
won't be able to see until about right

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.859 
won't be able to see until about right
here<00:01:15.960> where<00:01:17.150> you'll<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.299> able<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.659> them

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
here where you'll be able to see them

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.780 
here where you'll be able to see them
you<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.320> advantage<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.979> matchup

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
you have the advantage of that matchup

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.910 
you have the advantage of that matchup
if<00:01:20.909> they<00:01:21.030> run<00:01:21.240> through<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> smoke<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.320> tell<00:01:22.860> us

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
if they run through a smoke so I tell us

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.770 
if they run through a smoke so I tell us
about<00:01:23.070> halfway<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.880> toss<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.210> higher<00:01:24.390> and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
about halfway you can toss it higher and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.120 
about halfway you can toss it higher and
it'll<00:01:24.960> go<00:01:25.049> further<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.650> toss<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> lower

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
it'll go further you can toss a lower

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.110 
it'll go further you can toss a lower
it'll<00:01:26.430> stop<00:01:26.759> sure<00:01:27.110> this<00:01:28.110> is

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.150 

you<00:01:32.870> can<00:01:33.050> completely<00:01:33.500> just<00:01:33.620> smoke<00:01:33.980> off

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
you can completely just smoke off

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.070 
you can completely just smoke off
interest<00:01:34.610> there<00:01:34.990> or<00:01:36.010> you<00:01:37.010> toss<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:37.460> higher<00:01:38.080> but

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
interest there or you toss it higher but

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.580 
interest there or you toss it higher but
you<00:01:39.110> can<00:01:39.290> see<00:01:39.440> how<00:01:39.560> far<00:01:39.800> back<00:01:40.160> it<00:01:41.090> goes<00:01:41.120> so<00:01:41.590> just

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
you can see how far back it goes so just

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.890 
you can see how far back it goes so just
play<00:01:43.130> around<00:01:43.250> with<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:43.670> find<00:01:44.300> out<00:01:44.450> how<00:01:44.690> far

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
play around with that find out how far

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.540 
play around with that find out how far
you<00:01:45.110> want<00:01:45.320> it<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.770> go<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.070> do<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.280> want<00:01:46.400> to<00:01:46.460> go

really good then they might have the

really good then they might have the
advantage<00:02:40.100> just<00:02:40.340> because<00:02:40.430> they<00:02:41.209> only<00:02:41.360> have<00:02:41.510> to

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
advantage just because they only have to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.300 
advantage just because they only have to
peek<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.900> small<00:02:42.200> portion<00:02:43.160> but<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:45.410> good<00:02:46.100> place<00:02:46.280> to

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
peek a small portion but a good place to

peek a small portion but a good place to
play<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.670> sort<00:02:47.209> of<00:02:47.270> lower<00:02:47.690> on-ramp<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:48.950> just

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
play is sort of lower on-ramp and just

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.180 
play is sort of lower on-ramp and just
playing<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.730> passive<00:02:50.120> letting<00:02:50.660> them<00:02:50.920> push<00:02:51.920> up

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.440 
playing it passive letting them push up
and<00:02:52.430> they're<00:02:52.520> gonna<00:02:52.640> check<00:02:52.820> headshot<00:02:53.239> box

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
and they're gonna check headshot box

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.570 
and they're gonna check headshot box
they'll<00:02:53.750> check<00:02:53.930> this<00:02:54.080> big<00:02:54.350> box<00:02:54.560> will<00:02:55.370> check

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
flash will actually go really high into

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.590 
flash will actually go really high into
the<00:04:00.290> room<00:04:00.830> and<00:04:01.700> it'll<00:04:01.970> pretty<00:04:02.270> much<00:04:02.420> get

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
flash that I really use the most and

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.770 
flash that I really use the most and

it's probably the best flash I've seen
for<00:04:57.050> ramp<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:58.300> I'm<00:04:59.300> not<00:04:59.480> just<00:04:59.720> saying<00:04:59.870> that

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
for ramp and I'm not just saying that

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.710 
for ramp and I'm not just saying that
because<00:05:00.050> I<00:05:00.410> found<00:05:00.620> it<00:05:00.830> but<00:05:01.340> if<00:05:01.940> you<00:05:02.390> leave<00:05:02.660> a

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
because I found it but if you leave a

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.340 
because I found it but if you leave a
gap<00:05:03.080> here<00:05:03.890> between<00:05:03.950> this<00:05:04.820> big<00:05:05.060> box<00:05:05.300> and<00:05:05.690> the

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
gap here between this big box and the

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.340 
gap here between this big box and the
corner<00:05:06.740> of<00:05:07.010> ramp<00:05:07.310> so<00:05:07.669> between<00:05:07.910> this<00:05:08.240> corner<00:05:08.630> in

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
corner of ramp so between this corner in

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.659 
corner of ramp so between this corner in
this<00:05:09.620> corner<00:05:11.650> if<00:05:12.650> you<00:05:12.710> leave<00:05:13.040> a<00:05:13.070> gap<00:05:13.370> like<00:05:13.640> that

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
this corner if you leave a gap like that

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.040 
this corner if you leave a gap like that
you<00:05:14.630> can<00:05:15.610> notice<00:05:16.610> that<00:05:17.030> this<00:05:17.180> arrow<00:05:17.510> on<00:05:17.870> this

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
you can notice that this arrow on this

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.830 
you can notice that this arrow on this
box<00:05:18.400> directly<00:05:19.400> lines<00:05:20.030> up<00:05:20.240> with<00:05:20.390> this<00:05:20.540> wall

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
box directly lines up with this wall

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.190 
box directly lines up with this wall
here<00:05:21.160> so<00:05:22.160> that's<00:05:22.730> a<00:05:22.820> good<00:05:23.000> visual<00:05:23.330> cue<00:05:23.600> you

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
here so that's a good visual cue you

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.020 
here so that's a good visual cue you
know<00:05:24.290> you<00:05:24.350> can<00:05:24.560> get<00:05:24.680> back<00:05:24.860> here<00:05:25.190> just<00:05:25.730> aim<00:05:25.910> your

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
know you can get back here just aim your

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.980 
know you can get back here just aim your
crosshair<00:05:26.360> over<00:05:26.390> this<00:05:26.840> arrow<00:05:28.660> and<00:05:29.660> you've<00:05:29.810> got

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
crosshair over this arrow and you've got

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.530 
crosshair over this arrow and you've got
a<00:05:30.020> perfect<00:05:30.620> pop<00:05:30.800> flash<00:05:31.040> for<00:05:31.910> a<00:05:31.940> ramp<00:05:32.150> if<00:05:32.390> they

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
a perfect pop flash for a ramp if they

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.830 
a perfect pop flash for a ramp if they
try<00:05:32.690> to<00:05:32.750> push<00:05:32.990> you<00:05:33.169> that<00:05:33.770> is<00:05:34.100> it<00:05:34.850> it<00:05:35.210> pops<00:05:35.510> quick

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
try to push you that is it it pops quick

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.690 
try to push you that is it it pops quick
so<00:05:36.050> it's<00:05:36.169> hard<00:05:36.320> for<00:05:36.350> them<00:05:36.500> to<00:05:36.590> turn<00:05:36.770> around<00:05:37.070> but

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
so it's hard for them to turn around but

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.640 
so it's hard for them to turn around but
it<00:05:37.820> also<00:05:37.970> lets<00:05:38.270> you<00:05:38.450> toss<00:05:38.660> it<00:05:38.900> in<00:05:39.020> peak<00:05:39.260> to<00:05:39.530> get

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
it also lets you toss it in peak to get
