00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:07.950
 yes, it was a very adventurous one 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.230
 history so 1989 was with a 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.450
 Known by me on a vintage car 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.500
 market and when we walked around it 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.180
 Suddenly I saw this car 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.260
 actually just as gerippe stood with 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.410
 some boxes 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.359
 it was almost kita cartons then I have 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.330
 asked the dealer what kind of a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.590
 Car is he says that everything has to be 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.590
 definitely a bmw said 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.690
 and then I have an adventurous way 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.500
 I've bought all this ramshit 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.910
 then and have it home 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.350
 brought and my wife then the 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.670
 Behind the head has beaten up 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.670
 never believed that it wants to be in the car 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.410
 when I noticed that it was a 3 0 3 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.149
 there was the big surprise and the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.150
 I am also glad that you are really one 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.720
 rare pre-war car has risen 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.320
 and, moreover, once her from history 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.900
 valuable car 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.050
 because the workshop would have to be brought 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.890
 unloaded posed and noted that time 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.380
 that there was a whole lot missing 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.720
 then stop trying so too 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.400
 then are in world history 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.200
 I fell down to Switzerland 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.250
 once driven to a dealer around 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.890
 to get metals 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.050
 Of course, the restoration was not 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.780
 no problem man had no 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.240
 pattern nothing to see like the car 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.460
 will look finished and what parts 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.530
 Recommend lawyers are all important 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.340
 Of course you have to go to the books 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.979
 read a lot we needed 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.500
 from the first sale to the first 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.020
 about ten years in rheine time over there 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.530
 had tinkered were about 1700 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.530
 hours 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.370
 than the car then finish building 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.440
 was ready to drive and is the first time 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.660
 that was it was already was 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.190
 a big feeling only what has all 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.410
 it was difficult to have a scary one 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.480
 communicate the gear had constantly 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.480
 in debt with growls and brought 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.480
 if bmw 303 makes it especially that it 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.060
 actually the first car was something bmw 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.700
 has built in eisenach with a 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.320
 six-cylinder engine and that was that too 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.520
 first vehicle in which the kidney 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.520
 has been installed 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.880
 You feel right as a owner 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.740
 proud that you have your vehicle and 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.910
 also restored and built 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.700
 Has 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.300
 my name is helmut schlosser and that 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.300
 is my story
