00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.180
 welcome to home with you today we are going 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.450
 to cook a cod tapa with 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.920
 Peas and ham looks classic but the 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.740
 let's do it in a very different way 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.529
 and that surely you have never seen or 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.179
 almost never good ingredients that 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.599
 we need for today's stage 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:25.730
 Well, 4 lobs of cod from the loin 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.669
 of fresh cod that we found in the 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.099
 supermarkets and that come to the point 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.200
 of salt is a fresh cod that has been 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.690
 salty and is no longer necessary now 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.100
 we have 4 little cubes that we have 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:45.530
 prepared we need it about 23 teeth 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.750
 of garlic about 150 grams of peas a 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.870
 little bit of olive oil and here I have 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.489
 a julienne of ham we have cut 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.100
 some thin slices of ham we have 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.839
 cut a julienne and we fried it in 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.660
 very hot oil that we get 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.200
 as a crisp crunchy ham 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.449
 ham for today's stage 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.300
 first step and the most important of this 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.160
 stage as with citing a cod like 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.840
 we say we have the loins and we have this 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.510
 pan with extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.270
 important that the oil is very good 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.070
 of very good quality we have it we have 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.750
 given temperature we have it warm 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.210
 so now what we are going to do is 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.600
 with garlic cloves cut them but not 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.800
 we are going to cut it into slices 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.880
 for do 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:35.690
 our oil with garlic and oil where 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.760
 let's take the cod we cut the 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.470
 sheets as finite as we can 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.960
 do not worry about the amount of garlic 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.960
 with 23 teeth is fine 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.830
 here we have it and this oil as 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.410
 we say that we have given it temperature and 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.990
 it's warm 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:02.439
 we now throw the rolled garlic 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.320
 as you see neither very strong nor very soft 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:08.229
 you see there and we will not understand the oil 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.110
 we have it like that and we leave it off that 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.870
 take a little color of our garlic 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.220
 Well, here we have our garlic 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.739
 You see he's taking a little bit of 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.860
 color and the oil is coming down from 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.989
 temperature at this time that garlic 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.450
 it has some color and the oil has 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.390
 lowered temperature is the time to 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.480
 toss the cod cocks 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.540
 we throw them 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.849
 with the skin facing up 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.060
 and what we are going to do now is to quote him 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.370
 to bring up what it is to stir up is a 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.549
 cooking in oil at very low temperature 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.319
 for a long period of time to 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.900
 these 24 cubes with the oil is 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.689
 we will leave it between 10 15 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.569
 minutes if we see that the 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:03:00.500
 temperature we raise it a little bit what 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:04.250
 we turn on and we put it very very soft 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.650
 and we leave that 10-15 minutes that the 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.080
 cod go with lentito lentito 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.450
 when we see that he is super 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.540
 transparent there will be the moment of 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.720
 remove it we leave it and you'll see how 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.750
 we are staying because they have passed 12 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.080
 15 minutes and the cod with the oil 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.670
 very very soft it has attracted us as 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.610
 we see it in what we have left the dice 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.580
 a cod like transparent and they start 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.320
 to open the plates the cod is 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.239
 is formed by beef is 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.300
 It consists of sheets we begin to 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.520
 open the super soft oil and you're 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.830
 attracted let's make 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.800
 remove it and then sautÃ© a pea 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.500
 and with our crunchy ham 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.900
 the clove of garlic that we have left 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.540
 let's chop to skip the pea 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.329
 pea that will be accompanied by 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.060
 cod and crispy ham it 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:06.090
 we eat well finite well we have good 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.090
 minced the garlic we throw it in the pan 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.080
 two teaspoons 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.080
 of oil 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.930
 and always the garlic in the pan we put it 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.090
 from cold that we never throw the garlic 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.280
 when the pan is very hot very 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.920
 hot but we throw the oil 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.840
 we throw in the garlic and now it's when 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.970
 we light up because this way oil goes 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.770
 to catch much more much more flavor 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.640
 we hope it lasts for us and when 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.620
 We toss well browned garlic pea 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.450
 the golden point just without us 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.450
 let's eat the peas 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.440
 a little salt 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.440
 and the one of love 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.330
 the pea is to give it a strong blow from 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.310
 heat with the stir and the oil and what 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.600
 we have then we leave it here and 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.630
 while we can go preparing 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.720
 our plate to place the lid 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.670
 we have the pea we stop our 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.670
 frying pan we throw a little dish 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:24.220
 and it's time to plate 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:27.700
 rectangular and well then we cast our 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.870
 we are going to make it as a line 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.870
 along 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:38.919
 always as you know you have to play 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:42.030
 with the way of inventing the imagination 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:45.210
 the colors 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.000
 Here we have a little path 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.370
 Peas, well, we have it, I've already 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.140
 prepared the cod loins 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.360
 confit in virgin olive oil 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:59.479
 extra and garlic we put them 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.349
 on the pea we take a spatula 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.349
 to help us 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.240
 and we have it 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.980
 so along this ideal layer well for 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.980
 example for two people 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:22.450
 our four pieces and now a 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:24.400
 touch let a crisp touch one 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.350
 julienne ham in oil very strong 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.090
 we fried it and it was super 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:34.360
 crunchy we are going to throw it over 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.639
 and see how wonderful how it will be 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.590
 this 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.210
 I think the whole team is going to 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.250
 eat as soon as we finish 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.259
 Well, here we have some little pieces of 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.690
 cod with peas and crunchy 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:50.289
 ham I wait for you here and in gastronomic 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.289
