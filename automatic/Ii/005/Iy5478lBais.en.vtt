hi everyone and welcome to new egg TV my
name<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:06.029> Paul<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.569> today<00:00:06.960> in<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.440> pursuit<00:00:07.770> of

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
name is Paul and today in the pursuit of

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.830 
name is Paul and today in the pursuit of
knowledge<00:00:08.040> we<00:00:08.519> have<00:00:08.760> put<00:00:09.120> together<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.599> little

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
knowledge we have put together a little

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.209 
knowledge we have put together a little
test<00:00:10.019> for<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.260> guys<00:00:10.380> because<00:00:10.620> NVIDIA<00:00:11.160> has

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
test for you guys because NVIDIA has

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.180 
test for you guys because NVIDIA has
recently<00:00:11.490> released<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.389> geforce<00:00:12.840> gtx<00:00:13.259> 660

recently released the geforce gtx 660

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.640 
recently released the geforce gtx 660
bringing<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.940> kepler<00:00:15.360> architecture<00:00:16.049> at<00:00:16.260> a

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
much lower price point than what was

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.689 
much lower price point than what was
previously<00:00:18.779> available<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:20.130> big<00:00:20.520> question

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
previously available so a big question

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.189 
previously available so a big question
that<00:00:20.910> popped<00:00:21.210> into<00:00:21.359> my<00:00:21.539> head<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.840> hopefully<00:00:22.140> a

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
that popped into my head and hopefully a

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.170 
that popped into my head and hopefully a
lot<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.410> your<00:00:22.500> heads<00:00:22.650> as<00:00:22.769> well<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:23.910> does

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
lot of your heads as well is what does

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.900 
lot of your heads as well is what does
it<00:00:24.210> take<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:25.140> be<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> 680<00:00:25.800> because<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> 680<00:00:26.640> for

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
it take to be a 680 because the 680 for

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
let's take a look at our test bed again

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.509 
let's take a look at our test bed again
I<00:02:21.780> did<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.349> as<00:02:22.500> an<00:02:22.650> open<00:02:22.920> air<00:02:23.040> solution

I did this as an open air solution

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.670 
I did this as an open air solution
because<00:02:23.879> well<00:02:24.599> I<00:02:24.629> didn't<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.019> enough<00:02:25.500> time

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
because well I didn't have enough time

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.140 
because well I didn't have enough time

I also have an SSD over on this side so

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.280 
I also have an SSD over on this side so
it's<00:03:00.689> a<00:03:00.810> simply<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.319> 64<00:03:02.010> gig<00:03:02.250> SanDisk<00:03:03.180> SATA

for<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.159> test<00:03:08.310> bed<00:03:08.579> so<00:03:09.419> now<00:03:09.540> we've<00:03:09.719> taken<00:03:10.019> a

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.169 
for the test bed so now we've taken a

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.050 
for the test bed so now we've taken a
look<00:03:10.260> at<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.530> contenders<00:03:11.069> let's<00:03:11.609> take<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.849> look

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
look at the contenders let's take a look

00:03:12.060 --> 00:04:57.930 
look at the contenders let's take a look
at<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.209> benchmarks

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.760 

so<00:04:58.660> there<00:04:58.780> you<00:04:58.840> have<00:04:58.900> it<00:04:58.990> folks<00:04:59.230> as<00:04:59.470> you<00:04:59.620> can

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
so there you have it folks as you can

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.490 
so there you have it folks as you can
probably<00:05:00.040> tell<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.850> 660<00:05:01.630> s<00:05:01.690> in<00:05:01.840> SLI<00:05:02.290> and

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
probably tell the 660 s in SLI and

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.320 
probably tell the 660 s in SLI and
pretty<00:05:02.680> much<00:05:02.800> every<00:05:03.070> benchmark<00:05:03.400> Iran<00:05:04.060> are

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
pretty much every benchmark Iran are

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.690 
pretty much every benchmark Iran are
beating<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:05.020> 680<00:05:05.470> and<00:05:05.680> they're<00:05:06.340> beating<00:05:06.490> it

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
beating the 680 and they're beating it

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.850 
beating the 680 and they're beating it
by<00:05:06.820> as<00:05:06.910> much<00:05:07.060> as<00:05:07.120> 20<00:05:07.480> to<00:05:07.570> 50<00:05:07.840> percent<00:05:07.870> depending

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
by as much as 20 to 50 percent depending

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.230 
by as much as 20 to 50 percent depending
on<00:05:08.950> what<00:05:09.160> test<00:05:09.400> I<00:05:09.550> was<00:05:09.670> running<00:05:09.910> in<00:05:10.030> what

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
on what test I was running in what

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.020 
on what test I was running in what
resolution<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:11.170> was<00:05:11.290> running<00:05:11.560> it<00:05:11.650> at<00:05:11.770> so<00:05:12.220> the

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
resolution I was running it at so the

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.210 
resolution I was running it at so the
answer<00:05:13.330> off<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.380> top<00:05:14.530> of<00:05:14.800> your<00:05:14.890> head<00:05:15.040> would

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
answer off the top of your head would

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.250 
answer off the top of your head would
probably<00:05:15.550> be<00:05:15.670> let's<00:05:15.880> go<00:05:16.060> with<00:05:16.180> to<00:05:16.480> 660<00:05:17.110> s<00:05:17.170> in

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
probably be let's go with to 660 s in

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.900 
probably be let's go with to 660 s in
