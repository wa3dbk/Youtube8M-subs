00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.030
 fire 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.360
 it's a very long and complicated story 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.119
 in fact it's a mythical story is something 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.589
 that one can not invent in 1939 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.269
 when robert cappa had to hear from 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.539
 France because I was in danger of being 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.820
 of being imprisoned for being Jewish and of 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.410
 left caught a ship went to new 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.300
 york asked for a game in his studio all his 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.250
 material in charge of his assistant that 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.190
 he was also hungarian who was also 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.719
 Hungarian and Jewish and that was supposed to go 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.910
 to follow robert cappa forward 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.739
 had to travel to the south of france and in 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.350
 his backpack carried all the negatives 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.670
 but with the confusion of the moment it seems 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.980
 be that he left the backpack to someone 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.780
 to keep him safe 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.579
 then he was interned in Morocco and 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 years later you can escape to mexico 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.030
 but the truth is that there was no 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.239
 trace of those negative ones you did not know 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.829
 very well how to follow it later in 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.040
 1954 with oca for the brother of robert 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.570
 cappa tried by all means 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.070
 find them the negatives of that 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.650
 story that had been the story that 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.660
 most important had been for 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.550
 able because he had made him famous and 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.220
 because he had a personal relationship in 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.050
 that story but found no trace 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.250
 some of those negative and until 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.140
 in 1950 and 1995 a letter came from mexico 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.870
 written by such an increase of a 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.970
 filmmaker who said he thought that 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.550
 I was in possession of some negatives of 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.090
 the spanish civil war of robert cappa 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:41.490
 and that's where the hysteria starts 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.490
 the time the west ham 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:55.940
 and the excitement of the Mexican suitcase ' 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.100
 is that it's not just Robert's work 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.720
 cappa but there is also work from 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.060
 folder what was your lover and your 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.940
 partner also assumes friends 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.370
 three were exiled photojournalists and 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.640
 they came to Spain to cover the war 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.410
 Spanish civil service for the French press 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.970
 but there is not all the work of any 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.370
 of the three there is part of the work of 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.230
 each of them is a selection the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.260
 of work is an extraction that 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.489
 we think it's done in 1939 we assume 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.890
 than for a book for an exhibition 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.540
 for some kind of project then the 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.190
 exhibition is divided into three thirds 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.630
 the first third is that of ching with the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.459
 beginning of the second war 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.130
 third is the tarot is from 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.660
 1937 and the third third is already the end 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.250
 of the War of Robert Cappa 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.380
 there's everything we have portraits of 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.780
 officers of farmers' soldiers 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.300
 children of refugee women there 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.100
 battles we have even moments in the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.520
 that art is washed out of the 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.200
 palace 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.120
 of the fight or the monastery of the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.070
 barefoot to safeguard it during 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.300
 the bombings in madrid so there's a 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.010
 combination of small stories 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.000
 big stories that are the ones that create 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.000
 The exhibition 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.480
 obviously layer but they are not the only ones 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.270
 photographers who portrayed the war 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.150
 Spanish civil law but the photos were 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.640
 the foreign photojournalists more 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.660
 important who photographed all the 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.010
 civil war 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.010
 obviously this template is that also 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.960
 it was very important and he portrayed all the 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.290
 Teruel's moment 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.110
 and in fact we can see him on the side 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.390
 of some layer photo is this pressure 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.910
 of papers but the important thing about this 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.310
 exhibition is that we mark the work 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.810
 of these three journalists and their point of 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.970
 totally particular view them 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.380
 they wanted to document something they considered 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.790
 that was obviously very important 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.340
 they made through the eyes of people 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.720
 foreigner who did not live things from 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.520
 the same perspective that maybe 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.860
 people is that he was a soldier and that he was 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.180
 living the battle they had a 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.670
 very committed perspective and 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.440
 politicized but having total freedom 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.030
 of movement could go where they wanted 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.820
 In fact they were taken to two points where 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.100
 they wanted to be and what the public that 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.690
 come you can see it will surely be like 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.760
 they composed their work as 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.160
 they worked and also how they shouted 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.080
 magazines because thanks to the titles 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.240
 that they put leading to each of the 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.680
 photographs we see the strength that 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.260
 they wanted to give the magazines to each of 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.120
 the stories we see why some the 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.470
 they published and others did not communicate them to 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.790
 the best because some did not have the 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.760
 same force the same emotion is 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.870
 simply because they were not interested in 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.500
 no one 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.500
 many work 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.370
 it was of view
