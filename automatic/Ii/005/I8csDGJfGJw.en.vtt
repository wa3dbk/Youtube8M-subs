you<00:00:52.440> know<00:00:52.559> where<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:52.920> am<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.399> how<00:00:53.489> far<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.910> go

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
you know where I am and how far I can go

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.729 
you know where I am and how far I can go
around<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.360> my<00:00:54.449> house<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.809> stuff<00:00:55.020> could<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.590> a

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
around in my house and stuff could be a

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.319 
around in my house and stuff could be a
little<00:00:56.010> bit<00:00:56.129> better<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.579> think

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
little bit better I think

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.319 
little bit better I think
I<00:00:57.390> think<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> logitech<00:00:58.410> g930<00:00:58.949> has<00:00:59.579> a<00:01:00.000> little

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
I think the logitech g930 has a little

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.450 
I think the logitech g930 has a little
bit<00:01:00.420> better<00:01:00.480> range<00:01:01.050> than<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.469> Astros<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.129> but

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
bit better range than the Astros do but

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.920 
bit better range than the Astros do but
you<00:01:02.820> know<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.149> can't<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.600> complain

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
