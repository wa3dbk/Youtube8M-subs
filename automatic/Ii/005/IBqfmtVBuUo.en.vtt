huge<00:00:32.630> and<00:00:32.960> there<00:00:33.350> are<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:33.680> many<00:00:33.860> different

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
huge and there are so many different

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.130 
huge and there are so many different
ways<00:00:34.220> to<00:00:34.460> go<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:34.880> monster<00:00:35.600> spawner<00:00:36.020> z'

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
ways to go and monster spawner z'

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.680 
ways to go and monster spawner z'
everywhere<00:00:37.130> you<00:00:37.820> can<00:00:37.970> see<00:00:38.150> there's<00:00:38.360> like<00:00:38.480> a

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
everywhere you can see there's like a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.510 
everywhere you can see there's like a
thousand<00:00:39.350> ways<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.620> go<00:00:39.740> from<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:39.980> start<00:00:40.250> here

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
thousand ways to go from the start here

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.940 
thousand ways to go from the start here
and<00:00:40.940> there's<00:00:41.480> a<00:00:41.540> very<00:00:41.690> good<00:00:41.810> reason<00:00:41.990> that<00:00:42.590> i<00:00:42.770> am

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
and there's a very good reason that i am

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.610 
and there's a very good reason that i am
not<00:00:43.340> in<00:00:43.640> survival<00:00:44.540> i<00:00:44.750> tried<00:00:45.200> to<00:00:45.320> make<00:00:45.440> it

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
not in survival i tried to make it

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.680 
not in survival i tried to make it
through<00:00:45.860> this<00:00:45.980> whole<00:00:46.190> place<00:00:46.520> in<00:00:46.790> creative<00:00:47.450> it

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
through this whole place in creative it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.870 
through this whole place in creative it
took<00:00:48.080> me<00:00:48.230> like<00:00:48.350> 20<00:00:48.860> minutes<00:00:49.040> to<00:00:49.340> find<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.760> way

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
took me like 20 minutes to find the way

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.300 
took me like 20 minutes to find the way
up<00:00:50.120> it's<00:00:50.750> completely<00:00:51.290> randomly<00:00:51.770> generated

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
up it's completely randomly generated

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.340 
up it's completely randomly generated
and<00:00:52.460> you're<00:00:53.300> basically<00:00:53.690> looking<00:00:53.930> for<00:00:54.110> a

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
and you're basically looking for a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.050 
and you're basically looking for a
ladder<00:00:54.650> and<00:00:55.040> i<00:00:55.730> know<00:00:55.820> you're<00:00:55.970> probably

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
ladder and i know you're probably

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.280 
ladder and i know you're probably
thinking<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:56.630> could<00:00:56.780> break<00:00:56.960> through<00:00:57.080> these

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
thinking you could break through these

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.320 
thinking you could break through these
walls<00:00:57.560> you<00:00:57.950> can't<00:00:58.250> these<00:00:58.400> are<00:00:58.550> special<00:00:59.030> blocks

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
walls you can't these are special blocks

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.090 
walls you can't these are special blocks
that<00:00:59.570> are<00:00:59.690> unbreakable<00:01:00.170> unless<00:01:00.830> you're<00:01:00.980> in

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
that are unbreakable unless you're in

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.530 
that are unbreakable unless you're in
creative<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:01.820> i'm<00:01:02.060> probably<00:01:02.180> going<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.480> use

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
creative so i'm probably going to use

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.090 
creative so i'm probably going to use
that<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:02.930> find<00:01:03.140> my<00:01:03.260> way<00:01:03.380> up<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.680> top<00:01:03.860> just

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
that to find my way up to the top just

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.160 
that to find my way up to the top just
to<00:01:04.159> show<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:04.369> guys<00:01:04.549> and<00:01:04.939> yeah<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:05.810> have<00:01:06.049> to

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
to show you guys and yeah you have to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.450 
to show you guys and yeah you have to
make<00:01:06.290> your<00:01:06.409> way<00:01:06.530> through<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.710> entire<00:01:07.100> place

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
you can't like start at the top and just

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.270 
you can't like start at the top and just
break<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.229> block<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:09.770> get<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:10.100> treasure

room you really do need to get through

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.540 
room you really do need to get through

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
the whole maze and there's spoilers

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.030 
the whole maze and there's spoilers
everywhere<00:01:14.090> in<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.840> higher<00:01:15.020> up<00:01:15.260> you<00:01:15.290> go<00:01:15.710> the

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
everywhere in the higher up you go the

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.890 
everywhere in the higher up you go the

full diamond gear when you get to the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.980 
full diamond gear when you get to the
top<00:01:21.650> it's<00:01:22.010> pretty<00:01:22.400> crazy<00:01:22.760> if<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:23.480> enjoy<00:01:23.720> good

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
maze you're definitely going to like

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.910 
maze you're definitely going to like
this<00:01:25.610> it's<00:01:26.300> very<00:01:26.540> intricate<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.380> hard<00:01:27.740> to

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
this it's very intricate and hard to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.750 
this it's very intricate and hard to
find<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.340> way

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
find the way

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.810 
find the way
like<00:01:29.360> honestly<00:01:29.600> I<00:01:30.170> struggle<00:01:31.010> with<00:01:31.040> mazes<00:01:31.550> and

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
like honestly I struggle with mazes and

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.760 
like honestly I struggle with mazes and
you<00:01:32.390> could<00:01:32.510> probably<00:01:32.659> tell<00:01:32.960> why<00:01:33.170> in<00:01:33.380> this<00:01:33.500> one

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
you could probably tell why in this one

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.219 
you could probably tell why in this one
there's<00:01:34.190> like<00:01:34.370> a<00:01:34.520> thousand<00:01:35.120> ways<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.300> go<00:01:35.659> but

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
there's like a thousand ways to go but

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.390

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
find yourself a ladder which is going to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.870 
find yourself a ladder which is going to
be<00:01:53.180> somewhere<00:01:53.600> in<00:01:53.780> this<00:01:54.020> terrible<00:01:54.590> place<00:01:54.880> and

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
be somewhere in this terrible place and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.700 
be somewhere in this terrible place and
basically<00:01:56.150> oh<00:01:56.630> there's<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.080> ladder<00:01:57.290> it<00:01:57.590> was

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
basically oh there's a ladder it was

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.410 
basically oh there's a ladder it was
right<00:01:57.979> over<00:01:58.280> here<00:01:58.549> so<00:01:58.820> that<00:01:58.970> was<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.150> way<00:01:59.270> up

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
right over here so that was the way up

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.320 
right over here so that was the way up
as<00:01:59.659> you<00:01:59.930> can<00:02:00.020> see<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.470> now<00:02:01.130> this<00:02:01.880> area<00:02:02.150> is<00:02:02.270> a

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
as you can see and now this area is a

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.670 
as you can see and now this area is a
little<00:02:02.450> bit<00:02:02.659> smaller<00:02:02.990> because<00:02:03.200> you<00:02:03.380> know<00:02:03.500> it's

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
little bit smaller because you know it's

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.530 
little bit smaller because you know it's
a<00:02:03.770> pyramid<00:02:04.250> so<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:04.850> know<00:02:04.940> get<00:02:05.090> smaller<00:02:05.360> as<00:02:05.510> you

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
a pyramid so you know get smaller as you

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.380 
a pyramid so you know get smaller as you
go<00:02:05.659> further<00:02:05.960> up<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:07.520> mobs<00:02:07.760> are<00:02:08.000> going<00:02:08.299> to

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
go further up and the mobs are going to

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.630 
go further up and the mobs are going to
get<00:02:08.539> a<00:02:08.569> little<00:02:08.840> bit<00:02:09.080> more<00:02:09.229> difficult<00:02:09.860> on<00:02:10.009> every

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
get a little bit more difficult on every

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.880 
get a little bit more difficult on every
single<00:02:10.970> layer<00:02:11.180> but<00:02:11.959> eventually<00:02:12.440> you'll<00:02:12.739> make

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
single layer but eventually you'll make

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.229 
single layer but eventually you'll make
your<00:02:13.040> way<00:02:13.129> here<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.580> now<00:02:13.939> there's<00:02:14.120> like

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
your way here and now there's like

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.929 
your way here and now there's like
blazes<00:02:14.989> spawning<00:02:15.469> and<00:02:15.859> you're<00:02:16.609> going<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.760> see

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
blazes spawning and you're going to see

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.320 
blazes spawning and you're going to see
a<00:02:16.969> lot<00:02:17.359> of<00:02:17.540> mobs<00:02:17.779> with<00:02:18.139> actual<00:02:18.920> arm

see<00:02:21.700> it's<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.970> lot<00:02:22.240> more<00:02:22.390> dangerous<00:02:22.600> now

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
see it's a lot more dangerous now

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.500 
see it's a lot more dangerous now
there's<00:02:23.110> Enderman<00:02:23.590> spoilers<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.480> blazes<00:02:25.480> like

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
there's Enderman spoilers in blazes like

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.080 
there's Enderman spoilers in blazes like
spawning<00:02:26.050> everywhere<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.730> should<00:02:27.880> get<00:02:28.030> a

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
spawning everywhere and it should get a

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.640 
spawning everywhere and it should get a
little<00:02:28.330> easier<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:29.110> higher<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.470> are

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
little easier the higher you are

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.380 
little easier the higher you are
actually<00:02:29.950> finding<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.760> way<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.060> next

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
actually finding the way to the next

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.480 
actually finding the way to the next
level<00:02:31.840> alright<00:02:32.500> guys<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:32.800> actually<00:02:32.980> found<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
level alright guys I actually found the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.520 
level alright guys I actually found the
way<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.910> next<00:02:34.090> level<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:34.810> if<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.290> spend

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
way to the next level so if you spend

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.410 
way to the next level so if you spend
some<00:02:35.680> time<00:02:35.740> like<00:02:36.250> traveling<00:02:36.880> around<00:02:37.000> you

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
some time like traveling around you

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.870 
some time like traveling around you
eventually<00:02:37.810> will<00:02:38.620> find<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.040> ladder<00:02:39.250> up<00:02:39.550> and

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
eventually will find a ladder up and

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.910 
eventually will find a ladder up and
here<00:02:40.240> we<00:02:40.330> go<00:02:40.480> this<00:02:41.050> is<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.410> most<00:02:41.620> dangerous

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
here we go this is the most dangerous

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.700 
here we go this is the most dangerous
one<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.760> spawns<00:02:43.270> them<00:02:43.540> with<00:02:43.750> armor<00:02:44.200> on<00:02:44.380> like

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
one it spawns them with armor on like

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.090 
one it spawns them with armor on like
diamond<00:02:45.550> swords<00:02:46.060> diamond<00:02:46.570> armor<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.290> iron

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
diamond swords diamond armor and iron

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.410 
diamond swords diamond armor and iron
too<00:02:48.460> so<00:02:48.730> yeah<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.060> going<00:02:49.210> to<00:02:49.270> be

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
too so yeah this is going to be

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.630 
too so yeah this is going to be
extremely<00:02:49.900> difficult<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.710> you<00:02:51.280> need<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.520> make

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
extremely difficult and you need to make

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.670 
extremely difficult and you need to make
your<00:02:51.760> way<00:02:51.880> through<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.330> level<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:53.380> actually

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
your way through this level to actually

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.140 
your way through this level to actually
get<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:53.980> treasure<00:02:54.160> room<00:02:54.490> but<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.880> course

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
get to the treasure room but of course

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.990 
get to the treasure room but of course
it<00:02:55.390> is<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.660> shortest<00:02:56.050> one<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.560> yeah<00:02:57.459> beware

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
it is the shortest one and yeah beware

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.670 
it is the shortest one and yeah beware
because<00:02:58.450> this<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.810> going<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.020> be<00:02:59.140> really<00:02:59.380> hard

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
because this is going to be really hard

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.910 
because this is going to be really hard
and<00:03:00.340> there<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.000> is<00:03:01.090> we<00:03:01.390> finally<00:03:02.170> made<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.530> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
and there it is we finally made it the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.350 
and there it is we finally made it the
treasure<00:03:03.280> room<00:03:03.580> it's<00:03:03.940> kind<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.209> cool-looking

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
treasure room it's kind of cool-looking

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.449 
treasure room it's kind of cool-looking
and<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:05.470> can<00:03:05.590> see<00:03:05.740> there's<00:03:05.920> an<00:03:06.010> enchantment

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
and you can see there's an enchantment

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.640 
and you can see there's an enchantment

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
the cool thing about this is this block

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.370 
the cool thing about this is this block
right<00:03:39.850> here<00:03:39.910> is<00:03:40.209> a<00:03:40.239> teleporter<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.140> what<00:03:41.260> it's

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
right here is a teleporter so what it's

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.100 
right here is a teleporter so what it's
going<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.560> do<00:03:41.769> is<00:03:41.980> teleport<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.700> out<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:43.239> now

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110

the cool thing is it's now breakable it

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.880 
the cool thing is it's now breakable it
turned<00:03:46.360> all<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.840> blocks<00:03:47.140> into<00:03:47.440> normal

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
turned all the blocks into normal

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.560 
turned all the blocks into normal
sandstone<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:48.700> now<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:48.940> can<00:03:49.120> go<00:03:49.209> back<00:03:49.360> in

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
sandstone and now you can go back in

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.210 
sandstone and now you can go back in
whenever<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:49.989> want<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.380> break<00:03:50.830> through<00:03:51.010> any

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
whenever you want and break through any

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.160 
whenever you want and break through any
part<00:03:51.550> so<00:03:52.269> once<00:03:52.420> you<00:03:52.510> actually<00:03:52.690> make<00:03:52.959> it<00:03:53.050> to<00:03:53.140> the

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
part so once you actually make it to the

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.060 
part so once you actually make it to the
end<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.680> can<00:03:53.830> come<00:03:54.280> in<00:03:54.430> anytime<00:03:54.820> you<00:03:55.150> want<00:03:55.360> at

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
end you can come in anytime you want at

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.440 
end you can come in anytime you want at
the<00:03:57.070> moment<00:03:57.100> guys<00:03:57.519> there<00:03:57.820> are<00:03:57.850> only<00:03:58.090> two

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
the moment guys there are only two

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.060 
the moment guys there are only two
different<00:03:58.780> kinds<00:03:59.050> of<00:03:59.110> pyramids<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.769> this<00:03:59.950> is

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
different kinds of pyramids and this is

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.340 
different kinds of pyramids and this is
the<00:04:00.190> one<00:04:00.340> that<00:04:00.459> spawns<00:04:00.790> in<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.090> jungle<00:04:01.600> and<00:04:01.810> as

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
the one that spawns in the jungle and as

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.870 
the one that spawns in the jungle and as
I<00:04:02.470> mentioned<00:04:02.860> you<00:04:02.980> start<00:04:03.310> on<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.489> top<00:04:03.700> and

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
I mentioned you start on the top and

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.580 
I mentioned you start on the top and
this<00:04:03.970> one<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:04.450> rooms<00:04:04.630> are<00:04:04.780> kind<00:04:04.989> of<00:04:05.140> easier

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
this one so the rooms are kind of easier

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.900 
this one so the rooms are kind of easier
to<00:04:05.709> find<00:04:05.890> your<00:04:06.070> way<00:04:06.160> through<00:04:06.190> maybe<00:04:06.730> I'll<00:04:06.820> have

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
to find your way through maybe I'll have

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.850 
to find your way through maybe I'll have
some<00:04:06.970> better<00:04:07.239> luck<00:04:07.450> this<00:04:07.630> time<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:08.110> of<00:04:08.650> course

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
some better luck this time and of course

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.400 
some better luck this time and of course
all<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.370> blocks<00:04:09.700> are<00:04:10.000> unbreakable<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.230> less

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
all the blocks are unbreakable and less

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.490 
all the blocks are unbreakable and less
in<00:04:11.590> creative<00:04:12.370> so<00:04:13.239> yeah<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.510> monsters<00:04:13.930> instead

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
in creative so yeah the monsters instead

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.680 
in creative so yeah the monsters instead
are<00:04:14.860> very<00:04:15.070> weak<00:04:15.280> at<00:04:15.519> the<00:04:15.610> top<00:04:15.850> and<00:04:16.120> get<00:04:16.540> much

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
are very weak at the top and get much

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.330 
are very weak at the top and get much
stronger<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.260> further<00:04:17.410> you<00:04:17.620> go<00:04:17.709> down<00:04:17.739> making

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
stronger the further you go down making

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.920 
stronger the further you go down making
this<00:04:18.580> one<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:18.910> little<00:04:19.120> bit<00:04:19.239> more<00:04:19.450> difficult

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
this one a little bit more difficult

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.960 
this one a little bit more difficult
probably<00:04:20.200> because<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.310> bigger<00:04:21.519> rooms

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
probably because the bigger rooms

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.180 
probably because the bigger rooms
actually<00:04:22.300> have<00:04:22.960> all<00:04:23.200> like<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.680> tough<00:04:23.919> mobs

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
actually have all like the tough mobs

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.330 
actually have all like the tough mobs
and<00:04:24.550> yeah<00:04:24.910> I<00:04:24.940> found<00:04:25.090> my<00:04:25.240> way<00:04:25.330> down<00:04:25.540> already<00:04:26.340> so

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
and yeah I found my way down already so

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.310 
and yeah I found my way down already so
these<00:04:27.669> small<00:04:27.850> ones<00:04:28.240> really<00:04:28.600> easy<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:29.140> find

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
these small ones really easy to find

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.170 
these small ones really easy to find
your<00:04:29.470> way<00:04:29.530> down<00:04:29.620> but<00:04:30.100> you<00:04:30.370> know<00:04:30.490> once<00:04:30.910> you<00:04:31.000> get

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
your way down but you know once you get

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.490 
your way down but you know once you get
to<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.419> larger<00:04:31.600> rooms

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
to the larger rooms

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.470 
to the larger rooms
get<00:04:32.650> pretty<00:04:32.890> lucky<00:04:33.160> and<00:04:33.910> remember<00:04:34.330> these<00:04:34.420> are

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
get pretty lucky and remember these are

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.300 
get pretty lucky and remember these are
randomly<00:04:34.930> generated<00:04:35.530> so<00:04:35.680> every<00:04:35.980> single<00:04:36.160> time

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
randomly generated so every single time

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.280 
randomly generated so every single time
you<00:04:36.640> find<00:04:36.940> one<00:04:37.210> they're<00:04:37.960> gonna<00:04:38.050> be<00:04:38.200> in

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
you find one they're gonna be in

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.170 
you find one they're gonna be in
different<00:04:38.560> spots<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:39.130> got<00:04:39.580> really<00:04:39.760> lucky<00:04:39.940> right

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
different spots I got really lucky right

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.960 
different spots I got really lucky right
there<00:04:40.420> gone<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:41.020> like<00:04:41.200> right<00:04:41.440> in<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.650> row<00:04:41.970> but

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
no armor at all like this zombie right

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.200 
no armor at all like this zombie right
here<00:04:59.200> and<00:05:00.010> yep<00:05:00.160> pretty<00:05:00.280> cool<00:05:00.550> I<00:05:00.760> found<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.090> way

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
here and yep pretty cool I found the way

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.600 
here and yep pretty cool I found the way
down<00:05:01.510> it<00:05:01.750> is<00:05:01.900> right<00:05:02.470> around<00:05:02.590> here<00:05:03.040> and<00:05:03.340> I

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
down it is right around here and I

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.000 
down it is right around here and I
notice<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:04.000> water<00:05:04.240> is<00:05:04.540> like<00:05:04.810> right<00:05:05.350> there<00:05:05.620> do

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
notice the water is like right there do

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.770 
notice the water is like right there do
kind<00:05:06.400> of<00:05:06.520> weird<00:05:06.700> but<00:05:07.360> it<00:05:07.480> doesn't<00:05:07.690> really

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
kind of weird but it doesn't really

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.750 
kind of weird but it doesn't really
matter<00:05:07.990> since<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.620> actual<00:05:09.130> way<00:05:09.220> down<00:05:09.490> is

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
matter since the actual way down is

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.540 
matter since the actual way down is
right<00:05:10.510> here<00:05:10.810> so<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:11.890> reward<00:05:12.190> should<00:05:12.250> be

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
right here so the reward should be

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.100 
right here so the reward should be
slightly<00:05:13.030> different<00:05:13.810> they're<00:05:13.930> pretty

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
slightly different they're pretty

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.230 
slightly different they're pretty
similar<00:05:14.350> though<00:05:14.620> like<00:05:15.010> this<00:05:15.160> one<00:05:15.430> same<00:05:15.910> stuff

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
similar though like this one same stuff

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.060 
similar though like this one same stuff

because I think the last one did not
have<00:05:22.660> any<00:05:22.900> diamonds<00:05:23.470> in<00:05:23.620> it<00:05:23.650> so<00:05:24.040> kind<00:05:24.220> of<00:05:24.280> cool
