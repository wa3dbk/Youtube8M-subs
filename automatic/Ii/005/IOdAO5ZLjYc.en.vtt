00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
how far that comes up again high use

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.350 
how far that comes up again high use
areas<00:04:05.020> these<00:04:05.800> are<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:05.950> pro<00:04:06.250> level<00:04:06.580> pant<00:04:06.820> so<00:04:07.240> it's

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
areas these are a pro level pant so it's

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.120 
areas these are a pro level pant so it's
going<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.510> be<00:04:07.570> extra<00:04:08.080> protection<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:08.800> it's

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
going to be extra protection and it's

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.100 
going to be extra protection and it's
again<00:04:09.760> they're<00:04:10.150> not<00:04:10.300> cheap<00:04:10.570> so<00:04:10.600> it's<00:04:10.840> meant<00:04:11.020> to

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
again they're not cheap so it's meant to

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.590 
again they're not cheap so it's meant to
increase<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:11.620> longevity<00:04:11.830> of<00:04:12.340> these<00:04:12.520> guys<00:04:12.730> you

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
increase the longevity of these guys you

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.940 
increase the longevity of these guys you
know<00:04:13.630> we<00:04:13.810> talked<00:04:14.050> about<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.380> way<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.620> yoke<00:04:14.770> is

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
know we talked about the way the yoke is

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.260 
know we talked about the way the yoke is
set<00:04:15.130> up<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.430> length<00:04:15.640> of<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.880> throw<00:04:16.120> which

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
set up and the length of the throw which

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.210 
set up and the length of the throw which
is<00:04:16.359> gonna<00:04:16.510> be<00:04:16.570> longer<00:04:16.810> than<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.049> GPS<00:04:17.530> open

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
is gonna be longer than the GPS open
