00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:31.609 
just awesome the lore of this place is
absolutely<00:01:29.549> awesome<00:01:29.729> over<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.409> have

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
absolutely awesome over here we have

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.010 
absolutely awesome over here we have
some<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.099> fields<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.669> is<00:01:32.819> there's<00:01:33.539> bushes

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
some more fields this is there's bushes

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.809 
some more fields this is there's bushes
I<00:01:34.200> guess<00:01:34.349> this<00:01:34.560> would<00:01:34.649> be<00:01:34.799> like<00:01:34.919> a<00:01:34.979> grape<00:01:35.279> grape

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
I guess this would be like a grape grape

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.940 
I guess this would be like a grape grape
farm<00:01:36.270> where<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:37.079> grapes<00:01:37.319> was<00:01:37.499> growing<00:01:37.859> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
farm where the grapes was growing the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.769 
farm where the grapes was growing the
vines<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.609> the<00:01:38.639> vineyard<00:01:39.179> I<00:01:39.299> guess<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.630> what

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:39.779 
vines and the vineyard I guess is what

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:41.059 
vines and the vineyard I guess is what
you'd<00:01:39.899> call<00:01:40.109> it<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.319> what<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.560> looks<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:40.799> to

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
you'd call it is what it looks like to

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.789 
you'd call it is what it looks like to
me<00:01:41.219> anyways<00:01:41.609> a<00:01:41.880> few<00:01:42.299> different<00:01:42.599> markets<00:01:43.499> over
