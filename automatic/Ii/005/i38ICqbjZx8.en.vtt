impact<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> school<00:01:40.950> board<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.369> keep

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
impact on the school board but keep

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.340 
impact on the school board but keep
scale<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.000> away<00:01:42.180> yeah<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:42.960> i<00:01:43.049> think<00:01:43.259> if<00:01:43.320> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
scale it away yeah but i think if you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.620 
scale it away yeah but i think if you
talk<00:01:43.590> about<00:01:43.649> impact<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.250> school<00:01:44.520> by<00:01:44.700> school<00:01:45.329> by

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
talk about impact on school by school by

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.630 
talk about impact on school by school by
measuring<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.680> pure<00:01:46.950> girls<00:01:47.250> kicked<00:01:47.549> I

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
measuring it on pure girls kicked I

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.370 
measuring it on pure girls kicked I
thought<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:47.939> function<00:01:48.299> rigidly<00:01:48.840> well<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.259> had

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
thought we function rigidly well we had

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.370 
thought we function rigidly well we had
a<00:01:49.409> number<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.770> shots<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.520> might<00:01:51.119> even<00:01:51.380> dylan

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
a number of shots and I might even dylan

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.780 
a number of shots and I might even dylan
keep<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.590> first<00:01:52.860> goal<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> last<00:01:53.369> call<00:01:53.700> and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
keep the first goal in the last call and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.399 
keep the first goal in the last call and
there<00:01:53.909> was<00:01:54.030> an<00:01:54.149> arm<00:01:54.329> wrestle<00:01:54.720> for<00:01:54.750> 18<00:01:55.229> minutes

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
there was an arm wrestle for 18 minutes

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.499 
there was an arm wrestle for 18 minutes
but<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.799> certainly<00:01:55.979> had<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.640> think<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.240> name<00:01:57.390> is

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
but we certainly had I think the name is

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.630 
but we certainly had I think the name is
three<00:01:57.780> or<00:01:57.990> four<00:01:58.409> shots<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.159> know<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.460> were

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
three or four shots you know that were

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.819 
three or four shots you know that were
would<00:02:00.540> get<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> ball<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.079> could<00:02:01.259> reel<00:02:01.469> them<00:02:01.619> off

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
would get a ball I could reel them off

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.380 
would get a ball I could reel them off
it<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.250> know<00:02:02.399> who<00:02:02.579> they<00:02:02.729> work<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.180> think

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
it you know who they work but I think

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.660 
it you know who they work but I think
that's<00:02:03.570> pointless<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.170> then<00:02:04.460> with<00:02:05.460> five

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
that's pointless and then with five

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.090 
that's pointless and then with five
minutes<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.090> guy<00:02:06.240> was<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> draw<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.409> know<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
minutes the guy was a draw you know and

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.620 
minutes the guy was a draw you know and
the<00:02:08.490> season<00:02:08.790> was<00:02:08.880> down<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.210> last<00:02:09.420> five

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
the season was down the last five

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.160 
the season was down the last five
minutes<00:02:09.870> and<00:02:10.170> Geelong<00:02:10.980> found<00:02:11.280> away<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:12.170> took

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
minutes and Geelong found away and took

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.750 
minutes and Geelong found away and took
their<00:02:13.350> opportunities<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.220> we'd<00:02:14.520> certainly

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
their opportunities and we'd certainly

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.450 
their opportunities and we'd certainly
had<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> lot<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.300> previous<00:02:16.290> opportunities<00:02:17.010> you

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
had a lot of previous opportunities you

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.710 
had a lot of previous opportunities you
know<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.730> I'm<00:02:17.820> on<00:02:17.970> record<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.540> know<00:02:18.570> you've

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
know and I'm on record you know you've

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.830 
know and I'm on record you know you've
done<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.900> lot<00:02:19.110> right<00:02:19.580> 37<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.730> 16<00:02:21.240> I've<00:02:21.390> all<00:02:21.600> those

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
done a lot right 37 to 16 I've all those

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.990 
done a lot right 37 to 16 I've all those
things<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.440> know<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.160> spilt<00:02:23.490> milk<00:02:23.730> and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
things you know but it is spilt milk and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000 
things you know but it is spilt milk and
they<00:02:24.630> our<00:02:24.810> premieres<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.350> where<00:02:25.500> runners<00:02:25.710> up

they our premieres and where runners up
and<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.490> haven't<00:02:26.790> got<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:26.940> luxury<00:02:27.420> we

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
and I haven't got that luxury we

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.320 
and I haven't got that luxury we
certainly<00:02:27.840> need<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.170> learn<00:02:28.320> from<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.330> you

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
certainly need to learn from it and you

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.660 
certainly need to learn from it and you
know<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.750> get<00:02:30.870> better<00:02:31.170> there's<00:02:31.920> noted<00:02:32.250> no

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
know and get better there's noted no

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.070 
know and get better there's noted no
doubt<00:02:32.850> about<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.390> we<00:02:33.750> talked<00:02:33.960> about

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
doubt about that and we talked about

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.660 
doubt about that and we talked about
well<00:02:34.380> on<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.650> day<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:35.340> didn't<00:02:35.580> execute

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
well on the day we didn't execute

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.980 
well on the day we didn't execute
probably<00:02:36.300> then<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.720> look<00:02:36.840> at<00:02:36.930> your

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
probably then you look at your

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.870 
probably then you look at your
preparation<00:02:37.740> over<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.160> course<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.610> year

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
preparation over the course of the year

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.510 
preparation over the course of the year
and<00:02:39.120> as<00:02:39.470> coaches<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.680> individual<00:02:41.280> players

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
and as coaches and individual players

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.070 
and as coaches and individual players
what<00:02:42.120> could<00:02:42.270> we<00:02:42.360> have<00:02:42.390> done<00:02:42.480> maybe<00:02:42.810> in

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
what could we have done maybe in

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.360 
what could we have done maybe in
preparation<00:02:43.710> that<00:02:43.740> will<00:02:43.980> allow<00:02:44.160> us<00:02:44.190> to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
preparation that will allow us to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.180 
preparation that will allow us to
execute<00:02:44.880> better<00:02:45.720> than<00:02:45.930> we<00:02:46.050> did<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.980> that's

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
execute better than we did so so that's

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.310 
execute better than we did so so that's
been<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.430> real<00:02:47.670> focus<00:02:48.060> for<00:02:48.270> us<00:02:48.300> as<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.930> message

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
been a real focus for us as a message

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.840 
been a real focus for us as a message

events that i really would have foreseen

events that i really would have foreseen
obviously<00:03:09.240> would<00:03:09.390> look<00:03:09.600> those<00:03:09.900> negotiations

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
obviously would look those negotiations

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.870 
obviously would look those negotiations
that<00:03:11.490> were<00:03:11.610> started<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:12.330> june<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:14.190> then<00:03:14.670> that

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
and I mean a simple thing is is the

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.140 
and I mean a simple thing is is the
collingwood<00:05:10.590> player<00:05:10.740> they<00:05:11.370> came<00:05:11.670> and<00:05:11.970> he

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
collingwood player they came and he

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.610 
collingwood player they came and he
really<00:05:12.420> got<00:05:12.540> it<00:05:12.660> under<00:05:12.900> one<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.080> weekend<00:05:13.530> I

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
really got it under one the weekend I

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.770 
really got it under one the weekend I
didn't<00:05:13.860> see<00:05:14.040> that<00:05:14.070> and<00:05:14.400> we<00:05:14.880> wish<00:05:15.060> look<00:05:15.330> all<00:05:15.630> the

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
didn't see that and we wish look all the

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.370 
didn't see that and we wish look all the
best<00:05:17.270> you<00:05:18.270> know<00:05:18.360> worked<00:05:18.660> really<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.260> it

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
best you know worked really and it

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.230 
best you know worked really and it
looked<00:05:19.890> the<00:05:20.220> way<00:05:20.250> Luke<00:05:20.610> spoke<00:05:20.940> on<00:05:21.120> the

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
looked the way Luke spoke on the

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.360 
looked the way Luke spoke on the
football<00:05:21.690> show<00:05:21.990> I<00:05:22.350> thought<00:05:22.770> he<00:05:22.890> summed<00:05:23.160> it<00:05:23.250> up

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
football show I thought he summed it up

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.290 
football show I thought he summed it up
he<00:05:24.270> did<00:05:24.480> do<00:05:24.660> did<00:05:25.230> decide<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.590> leave<00:05:25.980> and<00:05:26.400> he

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
he did do did decide to leave and he

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.420 
he did do did decide to leave and he
felt<00:05:27.690> there<00:05:28.140> was<00:05:28.260> a<00:05:28.320> number<00:05:28.500> of<00:05:28.740> variables<00:05:29.310> on

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
felt there was a number of variables on

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.130 
felt there was a number of variables on
the<00:05:29.550> way<00:05:29.670> but<00:05:29.730> ultimately<00:05:30.360> he<00:05:30.630> wasn't<00:05:30.960> sure<00:05:31.110> of

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
the way but ultimately he wasn't sure of

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.680 
the way but ultimately he wasn't sure of
his<00:05:31.350> fit<00:05:31.680> and<00:05:32.340> obviously<00:05:32.820> I<00:05:32.880> couldn't<00:05:33.030> placate

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
his fit and obviously I couldn't placate

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.780 
his fit and obviously I couldn't placate
him<00:05:33.840> on<00:05:33.960> that<00:05:34.200> and<00:05:34.440> and<00:05:35.220> that's<00:05:35.340> the<00:05:35.610> bottom

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
him on that and and that's the bottom

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.300 
him on that and and that's the bottom
line<00:05:35.970> and<00:05:36.390> so<00:05:36.840> I<00:05:36.900> think<00:05:36.990> you<00:05:37.740> know<00:05:37.860> Nick's

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
line and so I think you know Nick's

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.860 
line and so I think you know Nick's
comments<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:38.940> mind<00:05:39.120> about<00:05:39.300> a<00:05:39.360> contract<00:05:39.780> on

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
comments and mind about a contract on

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.630 
comments and mind about a contract on
the<00:05:39.990> table<00:05:40.440> ultimately<00:05:40.950> looked<00:05:41.310> he'd<00:05:41.460> make

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
the table ultimately looked he'd make

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.080 
the table ultimately looked he'd make
the<00:05:41.820> decision<00:05:42.300> and<00:05:42.800> you<00:05:43.800> know<00:05:43.950> he<00:05:44.640> felt<00:05:44.910> he

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
the decision and you know he felt he

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.910 
the decision and you know he felt he
didn't<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:45.870> I<00:05:46.230> couldn't<00:05:46.470> placate<00:05:46.890> that

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
didn't and I couldn't placate that

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.850 
didn't and I couldn't placate that
so<00:05:47.430> that<00:05:47.790> that's<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.570> the<00:05:48.840> ultimate<00:05:49.230> line<00:05:49.500> and

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
so that that's the the ultimate line and

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.410 
so that that's the the ultimate line and
to<00:05:50.280> see<00:05:50.460> Luke<00:05:50.700> I<00:05:50.880> thought<00:05:51.090> he<00:05:51.150> was<00:05:51.210> still

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
to see Luke I thought he was still

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.530 
to see Luke I thought he was still
relatively<00:05:52.050> emotional<00:05:52.770> you<00:05:53.070> know<00:05:53.330> but<00:05:54.330> to<00:05:54.450> get

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
relatively emotional you know but to get

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.270 
relatively emotional you know but to get
his<00:05:54.690> season<00:05:54.930> underway<00:05:55.350> that's<00:05:55.800> good<00:05:55.980> for<00:05:56.130> Luke

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
his season underway that's good for Luke

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
his season underway that's good for Luke
it's<00:05:56.550> good<00:05:56.730> for<00:05:56.910> us<00:05:56.970> and<00:05:57.390> we<00:05:57.960> all<00:05:58.050> move<00:05:58.260> on
