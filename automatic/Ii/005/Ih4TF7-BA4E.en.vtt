00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.570
 Patrick last Saturday the Topspiel 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.599
 against the sc freiburg that was quite nice 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.920
 heated the party or yes in any case 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.689
 I think the number of cards that 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.859
 speaks a clear language 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.420
 but it is not unusual if so then 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.320
 place 1 2 plays and because the 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.599
 teams wanted to play the essential 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.900
 win and we succeeded 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.790
 from there heatedly back and forth the three 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.680
 Points like to take with what was good where 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.409
 it still a bit 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.879
 potential for improvement in the future 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:44.790
 yes i think when you see us 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.540
 then played against ten man 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.530
 we hope we do not need any 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.699
 grieving when the opponent the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.580
 next time again has a place reference 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.799
 that's always such a question yes 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.760
 you often go back a bit 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.650
 then if you think now it works 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.489
 but only that and the case 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.260
 very well 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.940
 On the other hand , of course, it is seen in 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.290
 the first half there was certainly 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.850
 still air upwards quite defensive to 90 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.330
 percent did very well, too 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.490
 since a huge chance admitted that 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.750
 then it does not have to be but after 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.160
 the front would have been much more in it 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.480
 but then it works too 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.620
 to think perfectionist and of 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.990
 so I think that we are 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.410
 because very very good performance went down 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.410
 to have 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.860
 Now it is noticeable that you have so far 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.840
 in all three league games always 0 10 0 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.940
 You've been there at half past time 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.979
 explanation for it 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.950
 yes i just believe we are one piece 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.000
 have become a bit more experienced 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.950
 patient in our appearance too 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.780
 So we try not play the 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.880
 already decided the first 20 minutes 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.649
 or decided against us 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.720
 and to have somehow residue ago 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.750
 to run but must go 90 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.759
 minutes we have the power and the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.440
 stability also out the back of the game too 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.300
 decide 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.590
 and from that I think that's a whole 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.430
 very important factor for us now 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.820
 have learned 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.320
 towards the second half and that brings 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.320
 we are currently holding a new point 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.970
 but comes the first fc Nuremberg the 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.890
 So far, they have won 9th place at alba 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.420
 once lost a team once played 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.519
 is that a bit far 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.730
 unpredictable opponent that there everything 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:49.000
 can happen what is waiting for us there 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.610
 I think the table space is now 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.570
 not so meaningful we mean 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.570
 Of course we are happy about that 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.709
 can currently greet from above but if 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.750
 now a new, partly twelfth or 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.340
 or fifth so why not on the 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.730
 table place to look always 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.280
 to draw any conclusions from it 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.410
 I think the FC NÃ¼rnberg is a very 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.500
 playing awkward team 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.350
 physically also very robust and have 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.400
 a high individual quality in theirs 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.590
 rows and yes there are well advised not to 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.630
 think everything goes by itself and the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.780
 three points are already in the bag so we 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.700
 have to work concentrated and so on 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.530
 works go like the last weeks then 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.680
 but also a very good chance 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:46.239
 So that's the game to win 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:49.239
 I have been optimistic so far 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.500
 Now only 15,000 tickets are sold 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.980
 actually still potential upwards 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:58.120
 open or even there are still a few 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.709
 days time and I think they are there 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.750
 they always have great support 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:06.579
 stadium so could never complain 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.540
 in the past and especially we 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.459
 We are also easy to look at 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.570
 submit and then comes the mood 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.310
 already by itself and I believe 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.250
 if we then like a good result 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.489
 then achieve least monday then 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.440
 a home game again and then I think 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.949
 the typical is still the number of spectators 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.949
 still go upstairs 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.650
 your tip is the next three points 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.830
 in it 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.180
 yes I hope so of course so I am 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.360
 No friend of the thing is to say 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.740
 sure by but i have the confidence 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.780
 team in our own strength i 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.770
 think proved very stable and therefore 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.280
 I would not mind if we had the 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.280
 keep three points
