00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.530
 concentration 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.780
 why tonight shopping song 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.780
 firm 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.430
 do not deceive yourself with that shine that has 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.400
 additional we have asked other students 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.300
 that are clean in all the notes that 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.100
 they are excessively neat and he does not 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.410
 we have asked you have to polish the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.780
 way to sing your technique is bad what 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.320
 that he lacks technique to spare 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.410
 charisma your angel greatly exceeds your 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.660
 talent 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.760
 he risks all weekends 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.830
 that he is scattered, that does not take away 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.559
 it does not take away the talent that has come back 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.250
 and if it can become a big 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.250
 finalist 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.100
 and they know that in all these concerts 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.990
 christopher has had 27 green lights and 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.610

 christopher sings us danger of king 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.130
 That's wrong 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.960
 and so much criticism I'm wrong again 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.770
 this critical history in multinationals 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.990
 pushing time to my heart correct 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.260
 those almost so many more 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.340
 frantic tenzing a point 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:54.600

 and not 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.290
 plus 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:45.020
 the theme of the new yacht does not have 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:51.500
 logic I do not know how to thwart a crime 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:55.240
