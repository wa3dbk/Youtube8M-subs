00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
fence and a sturdy bid again there are

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.650 
fence and a sturdy bid again there are
laminate<00:02:11.280> ones<00:02:11.430> out<00:02:11.640> there<00:02:11.670> which<00:02:12.180> are<00:02:12.300> okay

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
laminate ones out there which are okay

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.700 
laminate ones out there which are okay
but<00:02:12.900> they're<00:02:12.959> not<00:02:13.080> as<00:02:13.230> good<00:02:13.410> as<00:02:13.500> the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
but they're not as good as the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.130 
but they're not as good as the
is<00:02:13.770> also<00:02:14.610> invest<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.330> good<00:02:15.360> extraction<00:02:15.990> kit

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
is also invest in a good extraction kit

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.690 
is also invest in a good extraction kit
you<00:02:16.350> can<00:02:16.380> see<00:02:16.680> here<00:02:16.920> we're<00:02:17.070> linked<00:02:17.340> up<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.520> a

you can see here we're linked up to a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.760 
you can see here we're linked up to a
good<00:02:17.850> extraction<00:02:18.450> you'd<00:02:19.140> be<00:02:19.260> surprised<00:02:19.620> how

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
good extraction you'd be surprised how

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.350 
good extraction you'd be surprised how
much<00:02:20.040> debris<00:02:20.430> comes<00:02:20.790> out<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.030> these<00:02:21.090> cutters

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
much debris comes out of these cutters

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.390 
much debris comes out of these cutters
not<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.320> much<00:02:22.470> here<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.830> our<00:02:22.950> test<00:02:23.130> fees

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
not so much here in our test fees

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.710 
not so much here in our test fees
because<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.850> small<00:02:24.090> cutter<00:02:24.360> but<00:02:24.600> when

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
because this is a small cutter but when

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.210 
because this is a small cutter but when
we<00:02:24.810> use<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:24.960> bigger<00:02:25.230> cutters<00:02:25.650> there's<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.100> lot

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
we use the bigger cutters there's a lot

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.770 
we use the bigger cutters there's a lot
of<00:02:26.250> wastage<00:02:26.700> at<00:02:26.820> least<00:02:27.000> we<00:02:27.120> get<00:02:27.240> up<00:02:27.360> got<00:02:27.540> away

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
of wastage at least we get up got away

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.170 
of wastage at least we get up got away
if<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.440> don't<00:02:28.680> use<00:02:28.860> an<00:02:29.010> extraction<00:02:29.370> kit<00:02:29.700> this

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
if you don't use an extraction kit this

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.000 
if you don't use an extraction kit this
tends<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.630> clot<00:02:30.840> up<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.140> bid<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.530> make<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
tends to clot up the bid and make the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.010 
tends to clot up the bid and make the
cartridge<00:02:32.340> other<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.700> jump<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.780> now<00:02:33.930> I'm

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
cartridge other and jump so now I'm

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.150 
cartridge other and jump so now I'm
going<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.230> run<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.380> piece<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.740> show<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:34.950> how<00:02:35.100> to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
going to run a piece and show you how to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.660 
going to run a piece and show you how to
use<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:36.620> basically<00:02:37.620> as<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.770> turn<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.190> here<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
use it basically as I turn on here the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.010 
use it basically as I turn on here the
Hoover<00:02:38.970> will<00:02:39.090> automatically<00:02:39.600> come<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
Hoover will automatically come on the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:03:02.300 
Hoover will automatically come on the
extraction

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.890 

so<00:03:03.310> there<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:03.550> have<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:04.030> perfect<00:03:04.390> Reuters

so there you have it a perfect Reuters

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.720 
so there you have it a perfect Reuters
run<00:03:05.080> with<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.230> router<00:03:05.440> table<00:03:05.890> as<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.130> sigh<00:03:06.430> you

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
run with a router table as I sigh you

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.370 
run with a router table as I sigh you
can<00:03:06.880> use<00:03:07.000> this<00:03:07.150> for<00:03:07.300> decorative<00:03:07.599> moldings<00:03:08.110> or
