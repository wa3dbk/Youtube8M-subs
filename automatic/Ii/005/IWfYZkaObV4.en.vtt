00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello friends welcome once more to 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.950
 the tutorial videos of calculators 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.260
 point cl in this opportunity I'm going to 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.790
 show how to solve a system of 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.769
 equations with complex numbers 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.500
 for this the first thing we must do 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.290
 is to go to the settings menu in the 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.250
 option number 5 of the main menu and in 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.440
 option 2 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:30.470
 and select where it says real or complex 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.370
 the rectangular or polar mode according to 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.370
 we want to select 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.370
 rectangular 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.820
 and let's give it 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.590
 where it says norm 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.610
 and then we open a spreadsheet 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.800
 new 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.910
 and we go to the menu 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.280
 option 3 algebra option 7 solve a 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.960
 system of equations and option 2 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.190
 solve a system of equations 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.850
 linear press enter in this 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:09.580
 opportunity will be of two variables 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:12.270
 and we enter our first equation 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.890
 for example 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.810
 3 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.300
 x 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.810
 x 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.810
 Y 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.540
 less 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:30.810
 2 x and equal 4 and the second in this case 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.810
 will be 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.040
 less 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.270
 4x 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.200
 plus 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.200
 7 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.510
 and for iu 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:56.350
 equal to minus 3 we press 30 and we have 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.320
 here our two possible solutions 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.850
 if we want to convert it to polar mode 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.850
 we go to menu 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.009
 option number two number option nine 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.590
 complex number options 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.239
 and we select option 6 convert to 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:21.890
 polar press enter and enter again 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:25.640
 and we have our two solutions 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.640
 both the argument and the good angle 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.590
 friends that has been all for today follow 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.860

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.800
 and we will answer your questions will be until the 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.800
 next
