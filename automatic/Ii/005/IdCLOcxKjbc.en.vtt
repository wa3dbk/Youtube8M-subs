00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.140
 hey people what is going to be hot fitness 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.240
 here and this video number a little one 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.940
 justification or possible explanation 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.929
 Although I write a lot of people to 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.330
 example here 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.130
 scary how can you spot and sum 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.170
 tick pack so much but im 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.289
 bank press and then just military 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.890
 times as much as I do you're both 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.810
 work out 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.869
 again no videos because I really 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.840
 Keep up the good work so I'll be fine again 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.759
 dull environment makes so few bench presses 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.950
 why do you have such small anne why 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.239
 Do you stink why they shit on it ? 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.920
 So what is writing really becomes 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.360
 again first to bankprints around it 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.340
 Me so little why so little 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.370
 work tight i had one to one and a half 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.500
 Years I have counted myself exactly 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.809
 a pitch with all shoulder and off 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.800
 I could only now, for the reason I can 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.480
 now only two months 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.969
 about bank press shoulder press 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.039
 make that is shoulder press schulte 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.789
 make a press or do something 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.350
 school press however the blog 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.930
 That is, the brand sat two months 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.790
 and I have about my old ones now 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.680
 achieved values that I once had 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.360
 one and a half years ago 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.010
 and this time I really 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.140
 nothing done no chest exercises 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.640
 not really the motivation was gone 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.119
 if you could not do anything and so on 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.310
 and that was really a meal 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.500
 shit time then I could but 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.390
 fixen now it goes back then then too 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.340
 the topic with the arm elbows is 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.570
 area of ​​help for parents sees or or 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.759
 to like so he comes the two 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.400
 Do not brutally leave her upper body 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.689
 Not at all not so small 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.369
 I'm not even my friends I'm lying 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.780
 no value on my upper body so 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.009
 at least not on the optical 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.540
 I do not know how many times I do that 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.610
 actually has to emphasize mine 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.079
 channel's no optics obmann 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.659
 channel 's functional 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.009
 power training that means powerlifting and 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.689
 I have to clear the bench first 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.460
 Then something will come to my breast 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.710
 and triceps on accordingly issue 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.630
 biceps, for example, the trainings once 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.969
 every two weeks and then halfheartedly 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.469
 because i do not mind hawaii in itself 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.170
 is unnecessary mass for me then me 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.310
 I'm in competition with Trapp and I have 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.690
 actually no time for 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.340
 Exercising biceps I'm so broke 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.960
 after my three 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.350
 say lower body legs 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.970
 yes, there is also that I just me 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.420
 no more desire on biceps then 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.180
 I do that 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.310
 Two sets of tips cross and that's it 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.280
 yes, but I just do not value 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.540
 more attention to the optical and more 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.740
 It's really just about that 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.110
 functional my body needs 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.100
 work in the way of how 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.200
 I would like that 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.350
 and that is easy at the moment 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.280
 keyboard short and at the bench press and 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.900
 Bank just does it the big one 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.950
 weakness through the injury but that 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.190
 come my friends 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.840
 and in two years, then it will look 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.720
 also different from mine 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.280
 Friends of the triceps away anyway 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.700
 biceps look something with the brands 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.070
 just a little bit more fun 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.150
 of course no symptom but look there 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.700
 Let's see what we do there 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.100
 As I said here are optics here 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.970
 we are all about performance and that 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:11.320
 That's why I'm as weak as that 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.540
 I will call the video why do you have 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.510
 so little arms and that is the reason 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.400
 why is my poor has my friends 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.550
 until then until the next video 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.550
 Well
