compared a vegetable like when does it

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.120 
compared a vegetable like when does it
stop<00:01:19.720> mattering<00:01:20.020> but<00:01:20.380> is<00:01:20.470> it<00:01:20.560> just<00:01:20.590> too<00:01:20.920> big

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
stop mattering but is it just too big

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.609 
stop mattering but is it just too big
what<00:01:22.000> I<00:01:22.210> mean<00:01:22.450> when<00:01:22.630> it<00:01:22.720> gets<00:01:22.869> so<00:01:23.080> big<00:01:23.320> like
