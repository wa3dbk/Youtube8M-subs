reading<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.750> think<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.110> plot<00:02:04.380> was<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> little

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
reading I think the plot was a little

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.029 
reading I think the plot was a little
bit<00:02:05.549> slow<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.420> there's<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.710> lack<00:02:08.009> of

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
bit slow and there's a lack of

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.050 
bit slow and there's a lack of
consistency<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.569> the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
consistency in the

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.820 
consistency in the
urines<00:02:10.270> of<00:02:10.450> magic<00:02:10.899> there<00:02:11.140> is<00:02:11.349> a<00:02:11.380> magical

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
urines of magic there is a magical

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.650 
urines of magic there is a magical
element<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.250> this<00:02:12.340> book<00:02:12.550> but<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.819> like<00:02:12.970> pops<00:02:13.330> in

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
element to this book but it like pops in

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.089 
element to this book but it like pops in
here<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.290> there<00:02:14.500> it's<00:02:14.830> not<00:02:14.860> like<00:02:14.950> a

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
here and there it's not like a

consistent element of the book

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.300 
consistent element of the book
I<00:02:16.690> think<00:02:16.989> chars<00:02:17.230> out<00:02:17.380> our<00:02:17.530> main<00:02:17.680> character<00:02:18.040> let

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
I think chars out our main character let

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.160 
I think chars out our main character let
her<00:02:18.520> guard<00:02:18.670> down<00:02:18.790> too<00:02:19.270> easily<00:02:19.300> too<00:02:19.930> quickly

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
her guard down too easily too quickly

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.080 
her guard down too easily too quickly
but<00:02:20.500> other<00:02:20.739> than<00:02:20.920> those<00:02:21.069> minor<00:02:21.340> gripes<00:02:21.700> I

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
but other than those minor gripes I

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.250 
but other than those minor gripes I
thought<00:02:22.300> this<00:02:22.420> book<00:02:22.630> was<00:02:22.780> really<00:02:23.020> really
