mobile OS it will run through the major
ones<00:00:18.750> here<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.289> first<00:00:19.529> one<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.460> proximity

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
ones here the first one is the proximity

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.000 
ones here the first one is the proximity
sensor<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> big<00:00:22.199> one<00:00:22.320> if<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.619> have<00:00:22.769> an

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
sensor this is a big one if you have an

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.980 
sensor this is a big one if you have an
iPhone<00:00:23.220> 4<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.119> basically<00:00:24.720> what<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
iPhone 4 and basically what the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.230 
iPhone 4 and basically what the
proximity<00:00:25.380> sensor<00:00:25.590> does<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.880> detects

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
proximity sensor does is it detects

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.759 
proximity sensor does is it detects
whether<00:00:27.449> or<00:00:27.630> not<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.900> phone<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.320> up<00:00:28.470> against

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
whether or not the phone is up against

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.050 
whether or not the phone is up against
your<00:00:28.890> head<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.189> if<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:30.029> will

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
your head and if it is it will

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.790 
your head and if it is it will
deactivate<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.750> touchscreen<00:00:31.260> well<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
deactivate the touchscreen well the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.290 
deactivate the touchscreen well the
problem<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.309> touch<00:00:32.640> screen<00:00:32.669> gets

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
problem is that touch screen gets

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.150 
problem is that touch screen gets
activated<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.320> end<00:00:34.440> up<00:00:34.590> pushing<00:00:34.770> buttons

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
activated and you end up pushing buttons

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.380 
activated and you end up pushing buttons
with<00:00:35.280> your<00:00:35.399> cheek<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:36.149> annoying

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
with your cheek it's really annoying

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.580 
with your cheek it's really annoying
you'll<00:00:36.630> hang<00:00:36.780> up<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.989> phone<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.230> start

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you'll hang up the phone you start

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.090 
you'll hang up the phone you start
pushing<00:00:37.890> numbers<00:00:38.570> 4.1<00:00:39.570> looks<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.050> fix<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
pushing numbers 4.1 looks to fix that it

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.530 
pushing numbers 4.1 looks to fix that it
pretty<00:00:41.489> well<00:00:41.640> yeah<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> think<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.090> still<00:00:42.300> may

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
pretty well yeah I think you still may

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.880 
pretty well yeah I think you still may
have<00:00:42.690> some<00:00:42.960> issues<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.469> looks<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.680> it's

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
have some issues but it looks like it's

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.170 
have some issues but it looks like it's
quite<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> bit<00:00:44.340> better<00:00:44.460> than<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.820> was<00:00:44.850> before

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
quite a bit better than it was before

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.090 
quite a bit better than it was before
what's<00:00:46.079> actually<00:00:46.200> interesting<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.920> I've

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
what's actually interesting is I've

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.590 
what's actually interesting is I've
noticed<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.610> right<00:00:47.760> above<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> ear<00:00:48.059> piece<00:00:48.329> is

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
noticed I right above the ear piece is

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.660 
noticed I right above the ear piece is
the<00:00:48.780> sensor<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.410> when<00:00:49.800> you're<00:00:49.920> now<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> call

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the sensor and when you're now on a call

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.490 
the sensor and when you're now on a call
it<00:00:51.149> will<00:00:51.449> come<00:00:51.690> up<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.199> actually<00:00:52.320> see

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
it will come up and you can actually see

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.920 
it will come up and you can actually see
it<00:00:52.890> turn<00:00:53.370> red<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> little<00:00:54.030> bit<00:00:54.210> right<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.840> I'm

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
it turn red a little bit right so I'm

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.479 
it turn red a little bit right so I'm
guessing<00:00:55.110> Apple<00:00:55.559> cranked<00:00:55.890> up<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.010> sensor

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
guessing Apple cranked up the sensor

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.610 
guessing Apple cranked up the sensor
higher<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:57.300> detect<00:00:57.629> whether<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.109> you're

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
higher to detect whether or not you're

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.040 
higher to detect whether or not you're
the<00:00:58.680> phone<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.250> use<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.300> way<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.449> always<00:01:00.750> ran

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the phone is in use the way I always ran

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.389 
the phone is in use the way I always ran
to<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.649> try<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> hold<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> phone

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
to this is if I try to hold the phone

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.160 
to this is if I try to hold the phone
kind<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.940> my<00:01:03.059> shoulder<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.660> would<00:01:03.870> trip<00:01:04.049> on

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
kind of in my shoulder it would trip on

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.719 
kind of in my shoulder it would trip on
it<00:01:04.439> doesn't<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.040> anymore<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.549> looks

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
it doesn't do that anymore so it looks

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.700 
it doesn't do that anymore so it looks
like<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.060> improved<00:01:06.510> quite<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.110> bit<00:01:07.200> may<00:01:07.560> not

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
like it's improved quite a bit may not

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.469 
like it's improved quite a bit may not
be<00:01:07.860> perfect<00:01:08.130> or<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.670> good<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.270> know<00:01:09.330> we'd

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
be perfect or as good as you know we'd

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.789 
be perfect or as good as you know we'd
like<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.080> definitely<00:01:10.470> seems<00:01:10.680> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
like to have it but definitely seems to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.260 
like to have it but definitely seems to
be<00:01:10.830> an<00:01:11.130> improvement<00:01:11.250> now<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.850> next<00:01:11.970> big

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
be an improvement now the next big

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.969 
be an improvement now the next big
feature<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:12.930> game<00:01:13.350> center<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.890> actually

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
feature here is game center and actually

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.800 
feature here is game center and actually
right<00:01:14.280> now<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.580> not<00:01:14.640> active<00:01:15.270> yet<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.630> it'll

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
right now it's not active yet so it'll

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.440 
right now it's not active yet so it'll
probably<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.590> active<00:01:17.009> once<00:01:17.729> Apple<00:01:18.090> flips<00:01:18.330> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
probably be active once Apple flips a

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.880 
probably be active once Apple flips a
switch<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.259> pretty<00:01:19.439> cool<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.830> is

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
switch for this is pretty cool this is

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.130 
switch for this is pretty cool this is
sort<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.520> Xbox<00:01:20.850> Live<00:01:21.299> PlayStation

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
sort of like the Xbox Live PlayStation

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.200 
sort of like the Xbox Live PlayStation
Network<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> iOS<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.909> think<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.119> is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
Network for the iOS I think this is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.550 
Network for the iOS I think this is
gonna<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.420> pretty<00:01:24.540> big<00:01:24.780> you'll<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.170> able<00:01:25.229> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
gonna be pretty big you'll be able to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.190 
gonna be pretty big you'll be able to
assign<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.460> basically<00:01:27.450> track<00:01:28.049> your

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
assign in and basically track your

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.380 
assign in and basically track your
friends<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.220> join<00:01:29.579> games<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.270> your

it<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.180> basically<00:03:00.720> help<00:03:00.959> out<00:03:01.170> with<00:03:01.290> some<00:03:01.470> of

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
it to basically help out with some of

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.500 
it to basically help out with some of
the<00:03:01.859> light<00:03:02.190> saturation<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.150> here's<00:03:03.299> this<00:03:03.389> an

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
the light saturation so here's this an

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.240 
the light saturation so here's this an
example<00:03:03.780> we've<00:03:04.170> got<00:03:04.260> some<00:03:04.409> dark<00:03:04.739> colors<00:03:05.040> up

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
example we've got some dark colors up

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.649 
example we've got some dark colors up
here<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.909> then<00:03:06.030> right<00:03:06.180> along<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.450> wall<00:03:06.629> here

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
here and then right along the wall here

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.119 
here and then right along the wall here
you<00:03:06.959> can<00:03:07.079> barely<00:03:07.290> see<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.650> it's<00:03:08.010> just

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
you can barely see it it's just

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.619 
you can barely see it it's just
completely<00:03:08.310> washed<00:03:08.790> out<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.389> little<00:03:09.540> bit

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
completely washed out and a little bit

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.180 
completely washed out and a little bit
of<00:03:09.659> a<00:03:09.720> carpet<00:03:10.079> too<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.709> this<00:03:10.829> is<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.069> original

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
of a carpet too so this is the original

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.610 
of a carpet too so this is the original
photo<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.060> then<00:03:12.239> here<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.659> the<00:03:12.959> fixed<00:03:13.200> photo<00:03:13.530> I

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
photo and then here is the fixed photo I

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.960 
photo and then here is the fixed photo I
guess<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.010> here<00:03:14.129> you<00:03:14.220> can<00:03:14.340> actually<00:03:14.489> see<00:03:14.670> the

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
guess and here you can actually see the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.280 
guess and here you can actually see the
wall<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.510> carpet<00:03:15.840> comes<00:03:15.989> out<00:03:16.139> a<00:03:16.170> little

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
wall and the carpet comes out a little

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.379 
wall and the carpet comes out a little
bit<00:03:16.409> better<00:03:16.560> but<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.430> doesn't<00:03:17.790> really<00:03:18.120> mess

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
bit better but it doesn't really mess

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.059 
bit better but it doesn't really mess
with<00:03:18.419> any<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.019> blacks<00:03:19.260> up<00:03:19.560> here<00:03:19.829> so<00:03:20.010> a

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
with any of the blacks up here so a

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.920 
with any of the blacks up here so a
pretty<00:03:20.310> cool<00:03:20.549> function<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.510> then<00:03:21.660> right<00:03:21.840> up

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
pretty cool function and then right up

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.539 
pretty cool function and then right up
here<00:03:22.079> is<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.440> function<00:03:22.799> in<00:03:22.949> order<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.310> turn<00:03:23.430> it

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
here is the function in order to turn it

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.189 
here is the function in order to turn it
on<00:03:23.639> you<00:03:23.940> just<00:03:24.120> have<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.299> tap<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:24.780> now<00:03:25.049> it's

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
on you just have to tap it and now it's

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.199 
on you just have to tap it and now it's
activated<00:03:25.650> one<00:03:26.010> thing<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.190> note<00:03:26.459> if<00:03:26.639> you<00:03:26.910> have

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
the flash on and you turn on HDR it

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.309 
the flash on and you turn on HDR it
disables<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.180> flash<00:03:30.419> this<00:03:30.660> does<00:03:30.840> not<00:03:30.959> work

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
disables the flash this does not work

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.229 
disables the flash this does not work
with<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.709> flash<00:03:32.099> something<00:03:32.849> else<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.060> note<00:03:33.209> that

probably<00:04:18.810> not<00:04:19.079> going<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.229> be<00:04:19.320> as<00:04:19.409> fast<00:04:19.620> as<00:04:19.889> iOS

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
probably not going to be as fast as iOS

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.149 
probably not going to be as fast as iOS
3.2<00:04:20.609> but<00:04:21.599> it<00:04:21.780> should<00:04:21.930> make<00:04:22.049> 4.1<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.770> little<00:04:23.070> more

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
3.2 but it should make 4.1 a little more

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.399 
3.2 but it should make 4.1 a little more
bearable<00:04:23.370> on<00:04:23.760> those<00:04:23.909> older<00:04:24.240> devices<00:04:24.659> and<00:04:25.020> one

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409
