00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
over and vault over the door and when

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.860 
over and vault over the door and when
you're<00:01:53.280> inside<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.880> also<00:01:54.150> a<00:01:54.330> really<00:01:54.630> good

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
you're inside it's also a really good

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.800 
you're inside it's also a really good
spot<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.440> just<00:01:56.070> hide<00:01:56.220> from<00:01:56.370> ponies<00:01:56.790> are<00:01:57.000> hide

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
spot to just hide from ponies are hide

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.480 
spot to just hide from ponies are hide
from<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.110> cops<00:01:58.260> but<00:01:58.590> firstly<00:01:59.010> you<00:01:59.220> cannot

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
from the cops but firstly you cannot

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.149 
from the cops but firstly you cannot
shoot<00:01:59.790> or<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.090> shoot<00:02:00.780> out<00:02:00.870> and<00:02:01.140> kill<00:02:01.320> people<00:02:01.650> but

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
shoot or a shoot out and kill people but

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.310 
shoot or a shoot out and kill people but
that<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.940> probably<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.299> only<00:02:03.510> downside<00:02:04.170> to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
that is probably the only downside to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.620 
that is probably the only downside to
this<00:02:04.470> but<00:02:04.740> as<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.010> said<00:02:05.070> before<00:02:05.330> people<00:02:06.330> cannot

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
this but as I said before people cannot

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.229 
this but as I said before people cannot
shoot<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.789> unfortunately<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.000> cannot

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
shoot in and unfortunately you cannot

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.609 
shoot in and unfortunately you cannot
you<00:02:09.569> out<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:09.929> that's<00:02:10.020> probably<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.470> only

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
you out so that's probably the only

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.860 
you out so that's probably the only
downfall<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.430> part<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.300> overall<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
downfall to this part but overall it's a

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.540 
downfall to this part but overall it's a
really<00:02:12.900> nice<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.350> secret<00:02:13.950> spot<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.370> wall

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
really nice a secret spot and wall

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.980 
really nice a secret spot and wall
breach

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
breach

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.770 
breach
so<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:15.980> last<00:02:16.250> secret<00:02:16.700> spot<00:02:17.030> /<00:02:17.360> wallbreach

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780
