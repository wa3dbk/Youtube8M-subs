00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.140 
and go to the drivers folder and then go
to<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:24.010> USB<00:02:25.010> Driver<00:02:25.310> 64<00:02:25.849> folder<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:28.150> it's

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
to the USB Driver 64 folder and it's

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.690 
to the USB Driver 64 folder and it's
going<00:02:29.299> to<00:02:29.360> warn<00:02:29.569> you<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:29.930> it's<00:02:30.170> not<00:02:30.700> signed

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
going to warn you that it's not signed

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.130 
going to warn you that it's not signed
and<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:33.049> can<00:02:33.260> install<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.650> anyway<00:02:38.110> also<00:02:39.110> I

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
and you can install it anyway also I

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.979 
and you can install it anyway also I
think<00:02:39.349> this<00:02:39.709> will<00:02:39.890> get<00:02:40.099> around<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.880> not<00:02:41.660> being

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
think this will get around the not being

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.870 
think this will get around the not being
able<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.260> use<00:02:42.500> unsigned<00:02:43.069> drivers<00:02:43.250> because

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
able to use unsigned drivers because

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.370 
able to use unsigned drivers because
we're<00:02:44.209> forcing<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.870> insult<00:02:45.349> manually<00:02:45.769> and

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
we're forcing it to insult manually and

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.220 
we're forcing it to insult manually and
if<00:02:48.380> not<00:02:48.739> my<00:02:49.730> computer<00:02:50.299> I've<00:02:50.510> got<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.019> little

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
if not my computer I've got a little

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.759 
if not my computer I've got a little
script<00:02:51.590> on<00:02:51.799> it<00:02:51.980> that<00:02:52.160> makes<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.610> always

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
script on it that makes it always

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.900 
script on it that makes it always
disable<00:02:55.600> required<00:02:56.600> signed<00:02:57.049> drivers<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.910> you

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
disable required signed drivers and you

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.970 
disable required signed drivers and you
can<00:02:59.090> find<00:02:59.359> other<00:02:59.600> programs<00:03:00.170> online<00:03:00.470> that'll

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
can find other programs online that'll

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
having this problem but I've looked

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.190 
having this problem but I've looked
everywhere<00:04:10.120> on<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.750> internet<00:04:11.050> and<00:04:11.140> I

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
everywhere on the internet and I

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.840 
everywhere on the internet and I
couldn't<00:04:11.410> find<00:04:11.620> any<00:04:11.830> installer<00:04:12.310> that<00:04:12.580> I'd<00:04:12.700> do

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
couldn't find any installer that I'd do

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.490 
couldn't find any installer that I'd do
it<00:04:12.940> for<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:13.570> you<00:04:13.660> can't<00:04:13.870> just<00:04:14.110> click<00:04:14.320> and

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
it for you and you can't just click and

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.270 
it for you and you can't just click and
drag<00:04:14.560> these<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.550> your<00:04:16.620> two<00:04:17.620> drivers<00:04:18.100> folder

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
drag these to your two drivers folder

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.610 
drag these to your two drivers folder

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.680 
because then it's not in the registry
and<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:21.310> don't<00:04:21.579> remember<00:04:21.790> how<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.210> add<00:04:22.450> things

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.290 
and I don't remember how to add things
to<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:22.960> registry<00:04:23.500> manually<00:04:23.980> so<00:04:24.340> this<00:04:24.820> is<00:04:25.120> see

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
to the registry manually so this is see

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.870 
to the registry manually so this is see
if<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.690> could<00:04:25.870> get<00:04:26.140> it<00:04:26.940> alright<00:04:27.940> guys<00:04:28.090> just
