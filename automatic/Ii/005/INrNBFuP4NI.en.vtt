00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
start to build is that right

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.450

so<00:01:07.049> tell<00:01:07.229> yeah<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.500> mean<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:07.890> that's<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
so tell yeah I mean that's that's the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.420 
so tell yeah I mean that's that's the
old<00:01:08.670> concept<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.360> that's<00:01:09.600> what<00:01:10.439> again<00:01:11.130> is

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
old concept and that's what again is

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.429 
old concept and that's what again is
gonna<00:01:11.670> make<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> car<00:01:12.210> look<00:01:12.780> unique<00:01:13.140> when<00:01:13.290> it's

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
gonna make the car look unique when it's

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.660 
gonna make the car look unique when it's
on<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.619> road<00:01:13.740> there's<00:01:14.040> nothing<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.520> that

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
on the road there's nothing like that

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.859 
on the road there's nothing like that
right<00:01:14.850> well<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.030> reason<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.420> unique<00:01:15.720> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
right well the reason it's unique is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.510 
right well the reason it's unique is
because<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.439> crossover<00:01:16.860> isn't<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.340> that's

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
because it's a crossover isn't it that's

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.429 
because it's a crossover isn't it that's
the<00:01:17.670> word<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:18.570> keep<00:01:18.780> hearing<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the word we keep hearing it's a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.410 
the word we keep hearing it's a
crossover<00:01:19.770> between<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.939> two<00:01:21.119> different

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
crossover between the two different

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.620 
crossover between the two different
types<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.720> cars<00:01:21.900> there's<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.409> big<00:01:22.770> car<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
types of cars there's a big car and a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.289 
types of cars there's a big car and a
sporty<00:01:25.049> car<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.860> sports<00:01:26.130> car<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:27.030> so

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
sporty car it's a sports car it's so

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.700 
sporty car it's a sports car it's so
real<00:01:27.540> coupe<00:01:28.640> there's<00:01:29.640> nothing<00:01:30.409> on<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> market

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
real coupe there's nothing on the market

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.149 
real coupe there's nothing on the market
right<00:01:32.040> now<00:01:32.210> but<00:01:33.259> it's<00:01:34.259> definitely<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:35.100> course

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
right now but it's definitely of course

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.630 
right now but it's definitely of course
over<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.840> bloodline<00:01:36.840> crisp<00:01:37.350> angle<00:01:37.829> Jamie<00:01:38.430> talk

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
over a bloodline crisp angle Jamie talk

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.910 
over a bloodline crisp angle Jamie talk
about<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> bloodline<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.689> mean<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.049> think<00:01:40.110> it's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
about a bloodline I mean I think it's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.590 
about a bloodline I mean I think it's
just<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.280> know<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.060> might<00:01:42.360> well<00:01:42.540> be

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
just you know on this it might well be

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.539 
just you know on this it might well be
something<00:01:43.110> wrong<00:01:43.290> there<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.250> mean<00:01:44.430> I'm

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
something wrong there but you mean I'm

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.310 
something wrong there but you mean I'm
no<00:01:44.700> expert<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:45.060> what<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.659> think<00:01:45.750> about<00:01:45.990> it

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
no expert but what do you think about it

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.380 
no expert but what do you think about it
a<00:01:46.590> bloodline<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.220> think<00:01:47.640> when<00:01:48.149> he's<00:01:48.270> talking

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
a bloodline I think when he's talking

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.810 
a bloodline I think when he's talking
about<00:01:48.630> bloodline<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.439> basically<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.549> line

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
about bloodline it's basically a line

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.399 
about bloodline it's basically a line
that<00:01:51.000> really<00:01:51.270> could<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.720> really<00:01:52.170> comes<00:01:52.350> from

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
that really could that really comes from

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.889 
that really could that really comes from
your<00:01:52.649> heart<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.130> think<00:01:53.430> when<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:54.000> do<00:01:54.240> sketch

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
your heart and I think when we do sketch

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.679 
your heart and I think when we do sketch
when<00:01:55.170> we<00:01:55.320> do<00:01:55.500> make<00:01:55.979> those<00:01:56.159> cars<00:01:56.689> those

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
when we do make those cars those

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.179 
when we do make those cars those
drawings<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.320> those<00:01:58.469> signs<00:01:58.710> come<00:01:58.950> from<00:01:59.100> our

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
drawings and those signs come from our

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.279 
drawings and those signs come from our
hearts

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
hearts

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.679 
hearts

you could say you know he was talking
earlier<00:02:02.780> about<00:02:02.960> this<00:02:03.320> his<00:02:03.829> back<00:02:04.039> lying<00:02:04.310> on<00:02:04.490> the

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
earlier about this his back lying on the

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.760 
earlier about this his back lying on the
bike<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:05.180> could<00:02:05.299> say<00:02:05.479> this<00:02:05.600> is<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.810> bloodline<00:02:06.259> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.619 
bike you could say this is a bloodline a
couple<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.729> lines<00:02:07.909> on<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.149> car<00:02:08.330> can<00:02:08.479> be

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
couple of lines on the car can be

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.229

bloodlines it's basically one or two

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.670 
bloodlines it's basically one or two
lines<00:02:11.420> that<00:02:11.540> are<00:02:11.629> very<00:02:11.900> characteristic<00:02:12.200> of

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
lines that are very characteristic of

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.020 
lines that are very characteristic of
the<00:02:12.830> car<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.370> looks<00:02:13.519> like<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.670> bullet<00:02:13.879> now<00:02:16.030> we

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.050 
can only see it remember you've seen it
none<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:18.980> us<00:02:19.160> have<00:02:19.310> seen<00:02:19.400> we're<00:02:19.640> not<00:02:19.760> allowed
