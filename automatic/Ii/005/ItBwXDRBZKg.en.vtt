already already clipped into its mount

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.590 
already already clipped into its mount
here<00:03:37.070> it<00:03:37.190> is<00:03:37.250> without<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.970> mount<00:03:38.180> so<00:03:38.390> you<00:03:38.480> can

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
here it is without the mount so you can

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.750 
here it is without the mount so you can
see<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:38.930> it's<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.620> really<00:03:39.829> low<00:03:40.010> profile<00:03:40.489> mount

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
see it it's a really low profile mount

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.340 
see it it's a really low profile mount
doesn't<00:03:41.269> actually<00:03:41.360> add<00:03:41.570> too<00:03:41.810> much<00:03:41.989> to<00:03:42.230> the
