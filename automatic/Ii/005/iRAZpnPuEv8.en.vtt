00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.759
 eiffarie tg second part of this 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.970
 debriefing canadian grand prix post 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.960
 prediction of the grand prize of trisha ziff 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.119
 circuit that we like because we are 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.150
 still in a very different decor 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.340
 of my real but where we will also have 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.349
 a slightly different engine battle 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.869
 because we are at altitude finally good 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.579
 may have a hierarchy a little a 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.230
 little evolved there are quite a few 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.800
 neck development to all teams 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.030
 work hard but the the debate of 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.950
 bottom still in the paddock 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.500
 right now what are we doing 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.440
 because the f1 is in a dead end and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.539
 my faith everyone that's true all the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.700
 world is going to sound from its grain of salt 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.860
 despite that finally the numbers of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.449
 hearings have not hurt it seems but 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 we feel it everyone feels it in the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.010
 paddock the journalists everyone 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.850
 the stables chiefs think that 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.730
 what to do because we have 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.970
 the impression that the larceny is moving away a 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.979
 little of his dna of the race and we have 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.950
 the impression that everything goes from 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.750
 remotely controlled way between 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.740
 engineers and pilots who are more or 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.840
 less red dresses 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.970
 somewhere the sport has become too 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.590
 technological 1 it's a bit like that 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.619
 the impasse in which we find ourselves 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.330
 let the power to the engineers 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.729
 to the stables have the power to do the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.320
 regulation and that's where we are we are 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.220
 we are we are in a race we are talking 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.189
 24 hours of mans 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.119
 I have the impression that at mans 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.960
 pilots in any case it's not a 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.020
 impression that's what pilots 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.200
 say themselves to the mans drivers 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.490
 explodes 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.740
 because they have to attack they are at 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.439
 the limit of permanent grip 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.659
 much more efficient tires Engine 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.090
 who are who have a return 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.070
 extraordinary energy and in f1 on 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.860
 see them with radio communications 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.479
 they say lewis dave asselin was camping 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.570
 rose 100 meters because we have a little 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.000
 saved from gasoline finally good it no longer 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.600
 really make sense what worries me more 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.270
 moldy 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.490
 is that the strategic group the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.329
 decide on whatever it is 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.770
 fail to agree 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.160
 so how are we going to get out of 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.259
 this impasse 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.850
 yes and that kind of communication to 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.770
 deserved 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.390
 stone at the highest point to this terrible 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.620
 it's more of the race we want to 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.080
 see sprints we want to see the 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.400
 ring hours we do not have and the mans 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.840
 finds it very well that it is not a 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.340
 technological problem since 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.630
 porsche audi toyota nor 5 each of the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.430
 different technologies and yet that 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.890
 fight on a tenth of a second so he 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.170
 is a way of doing well I believe that the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.270
 dictators time a little bit of what they 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.700
 impose rules rather than 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.680
 ask the teams 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.000
 the time of the dictators we miss him 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.490
 it's pretty amazing because 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.450
 that indeed the meeting last 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.460
 strategic group meeting really 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.800
 accentuate the failure 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.360
 somewhere and that of team managers 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.390
 them but now that they say so 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.920
 we surrender the weapons we make the power or 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.840
 in any case there is this species 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.060
 of helplessness compared to the fact that 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.080
 here are the big teams preserve 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.060
 their little privileges 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.840
 small stables are considered 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.990
 as such there are like extras 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.710
 now offers customer cars 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.420
 story of 1,2 to further accentuate this 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.290
 difference between the small rates but the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.600
 private teams 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.880
 is that the way to follow me I 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.900
 do not believe we throw ideas then 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.980
 every week there are ideas 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.510
 different races and the 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.790
 refueling one shot it's 6 inches 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.980
 and tires pushed there is missing 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.680
 actually from a leadership of a 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.130
 vision and then especially of a capacity of 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.020
 decision 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.520
 a decision ability it takes someone 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.260
 who says this is the regulation and 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.130
 Sort this out now you're apologizing 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.380
 My French 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.120
 but we must not let the 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.010
 teams to decide because they have nothing 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.690
 decided for years he decides nothing 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.920
 they just managed to decide that 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.690
 did not have the right to change 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.310
 design of 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.930
 two helmets finally it's one of the rules 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.540
 one of the only rules that has been 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.160
 accepted that it was a system 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.150
 ridiculous should we bring back the 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.890
 refueling 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.770
 I do not think it's necessary either 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.770
 really think about going back to the dnf this 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:09.460
 which saddens me a bit is that all 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.790
 world is complaining while m 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.290
 an exceptional show a level of 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.450
 exceptional technology maybe 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.100
 too exceptional in some cases even 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.570
 if the comparison with the mans such 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.370
 sense you can see it in the last 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.930
 number of faults magazine besides 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.540
 where there is a record dedicated to that but 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.480
 good who will decide now some 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.160
 share a leu leu christian horner 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.290
 himself said to monaco good now 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.600
 this is a bernie and jean todt of 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.910
 take back the hand life is a curiously 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.830
 is very absent from this of this debate and 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.650
 for cause we have signed agreements 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.130
 up to 2020 the distribution of 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.260
 powers is very clear between the aspect 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.090
 commercial the management of the f1 on one side 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.050
 for last the iphone m 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.550
 and yes the legislation of which some 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.700
 part of the technical regulation is 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.280
 still girls who are the 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.590
 ultimate responsible but the deal of the 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.760
 concord agreements is that there is a 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.410
 procedure a structure the group 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.870
 strategic commission f1 etc 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.370
 however this procedure does not work in 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.230
 anyway, we must think about the four 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.020
 essential parameters well ie 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.720
 that in formula 1 there are the tires there are 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.270
 the chassis to aerodynamics there is the 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.680
 via the engine went driver is for 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.050
 the moment what we see is that 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.040
 the motor parameter determines all those 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.420
 who have a mercedes engine 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.040
 they can make a bad chassis 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.370
 go into points what in engines 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.590
 renault 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.670
 they go a very good endless chassis 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.470
 they are to see here they can be 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.880
 red bull and could have to tell us 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.040
 yes finally all the ways of the world 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.230
 that they will be behind so somewhere 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.520
 it is necessary to bring this balance between 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.610
 different parameters because the 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.740
 hyper important driver aerodynamics 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.210
 also the tires finally but does that 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.620
 was always like that we complained 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.520
 not long ago two years ago 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.230
 hardly aero too much aero too 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.000
 of importance to aerodynamics and so 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.490
 they become youri red bull who 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.830
 crush motor competition regaled the 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.480
 limit with go so we're in a 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.990
 kind of vicious circle of which we 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.580
 fails to come out so if decision 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.460
 must be taken because we mean 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:15.430
 horner who says let's delete 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.680
 wind tunnels the research 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.140
 aerodynamic no longer do the cfd 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.590
 on the cua the ingenious directors 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.220
 techniques answer it's a nonsense 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.110
 horner it's still not the last 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.350
 idiots so why's that launches 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.970
 test balls like that so if that did not 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.970
 no sense sergio marchionne the big 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.750
 boss of fiat and ferrari who says no 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.919
 no it's a good idea 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.520
 refueling while we have just 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.640
 Say the opposite 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.630
 finally it's a cacophony and spo 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.470
 does not come out grown up 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.030
 so now we almost crave 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.640
 actually the return of dictators 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.560
 in quotation marks the Balèze era 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.419
 considers it blessed today but at 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.419
 the time remember 1 we were a 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:57.280
 passing delay of max mosley and bernie 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.590
 who lock the system but at least 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.479
 we call somewhere to jean todt 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.229
 and at the fia to say take your 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:04.180
 responsibilities 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:06.190
 it is necessary to act and it is true because 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.110
 jean todt someone who has lived any 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.479
 this period who is a true passionate 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.440
 someone who loves auto racing who has 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:13.210
 been on both sides of the fence 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.529
 implied not to say a 3 and that 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.259
 is smart enough 

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:18.909
 for you can impose things which 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:20.679
 we see the singer 

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:22.689
 please save us the formula 1 

00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:24.609
