 the celtic tend to pass for a crossover 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.470
 it must be realized being based on the sport finish we find at 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:31.699
 the inside of the wraparound seats 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.460

 the 4 cylinder flat diesel unicom were remarkable flowers and 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 low speed availability 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.910
 still a nice surprise at the back where the passengers enjoy a 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.150
 lower rates not for the cabaret the car

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.530
 the millions of young people in fifth pass 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.740
 to note the presence of a single way of being who will propose 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.860
