00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
course the bicycle is computer program

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.110 
course the bicycle is computer program
to<00:00:49.500> provide<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> same<00:00:50.220> amount<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.640> friction

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
to provide the same amount of friction

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.240 
to provide the same amount of friction
as<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.780> cyclists<00:00:52.260> would<00:00:52.410> experience<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.130> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
as the cyclists would experience on the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.000 
as the cyclists would experience on the
course<00:00:53.489> cycling<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.720> hill<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.860> can

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
course cycling up the hill you can

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.799 
course cycling up the hill you can
definitely<00:00:56.130> feel<00:00:56.550> coming<00:00:57.030> down<00:00:57.390> here<00:00:57.630> because

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
definitely feel coming down here because

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.020 
definitely feel coming down here because
the<00:00:57.899> resistance<00:00:58.320> that's<00:00:58.469> off<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.910> then

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the resistance that's off so and then

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.370 
the resistance that's off so and then
that's<00:01:00.180> where<00:01:00.329> new<00:01:00.420> cookies<00:01:00.750> come<00:01:01.020> into<00:01:01.200> play

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
that's where new cookies come into play

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.380 
that's where new cookies come into play
so<00:01:01.410> you'll<00:01:01.829> bet<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> map<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.270> then

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
so you'll bet the map so you can then

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.149 
so you'll bet the map so you can then
get<00:01:03.510> your<00:01:03.600> speed<00:01:03.809> going<00:01:04.079> you<00:01:04.680> get<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.949> ride<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
get your speed going you get to ride the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.770 
get your speed going you get to ride the
course<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.180> see<00:01:06.360> where<00:01:06.540> you're<00:01:06.630> going

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
course you get to see where you're going

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.810 
course you get to see where you're going
see<00:01:07.110> where<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.320> corners<00:01:07.680> are<00:01:07.830> see<00:01:08.700> where

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
see where the corners are see where

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.100 
see where the corners are see where
their<00:01:08.909> descent<00:01:09.240> start<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.690> can<00:01:09.840> really

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
their descent start so you can really

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.130 
their descent start so you can really
get<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.760> good<00:01:11.760> idea<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> course<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:12.960> what's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
get a good idea of the course and what's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.020 
get a good idea of the course and what's
involved<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.830> its<00:01:14.340> opposed<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.850> sitting

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
myself back a little

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.990 
myself back a little
when<00:01:51.440> can<00:01:51.650> I<00:01:51.740> open<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.250> up<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.400> give<00:01:52.730> as<00:01:52.850> much

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
as I possibly can and the idea by going

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.540 
as I possibly can and the idea by going
through<00:01:56.630> this<00:01:57.020> creation<00:01:57.500> of<00:01:57.800> these<00:01:57.950> simulated

through this creation of these simulated

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.070 
through this creation of these simulated
environments<00:01:59.210> is<00:01:59.570> that<00:01:59.750> when<00:01:59.870> the<00:01:59.960> athletes

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
environments is that when the athletes
