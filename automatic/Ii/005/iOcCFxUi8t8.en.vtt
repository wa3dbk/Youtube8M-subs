00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.560
 where this type of competition is, it is not at all easy to see scifo 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.560
 Perhaps this is the toughest thing on artificial turf that is the customs 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.809
 difficult of course 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.289
 in addition, a very tough period, others with lyon won with psv the third of the 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:16.919
 suspect also to be doing 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.939
 so from there I am very happy with these results 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.410
 only when I have the very good tactical seventh away match in a row that you have 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.929
 He was a shy and great leader 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.269
 end of contract 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.470
 third was also left over in the dressing room and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.210
 better find on wall street a loss against the strong match 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.760
 that is way too much luck to score then it is also easy 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.000
 I can imagine that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.990
 the a reinforcement on the way that we work with a certain focus 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.210
 well on 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.310
 think that we give very little away from day two chances and yes they first them 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.790
 will be a corner the two years he will go more wrong agree I see you marble 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.640
 a fault 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.640
 have heard a goal out of nothing 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.990
 the cjg what else player the clinic where he also were the last ten minutes 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.650
 the first half saw some more room that came everywhere 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.710
 more dangerous 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.620
 happy then for for the damage 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.590
 at a major and the area something completely different in the second room we 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.010
 are glad that he felt for this match goes from match to 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.670
 contest 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.990
 themselves 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.799
 but the regions are not where we end up but the competition is yes the women 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.570
 want to stand but he was replaced 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.540
 hopefully we can 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.730
 it was all 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.830
 What a nice thing if that moment you go through his lawyer announced Monday that one 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.780
 beautiful participants and did you know that too 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.410
 of course what you get for it 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.500
 we will throw in the corridors 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.350
 2011 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.210
 I think it's gloomy 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.210
 it may be that you then think that ajax will make it a little easier for you 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.090
 are going to pay a lot of attention on both sides lokeren neurenberg imagine what happened 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.120
 no no man overboard under other side 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.720
 take three points away 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.710
 within that there is another motivation 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.839
 that creates a little extra motivation there 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:14.289
 so being able to take the lead and mouse play is six years in this summer me 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:15.839
 have not yet 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:17.389
 often in the lead 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.579
 it is of course the 34 zz you go up the Randstad the man so fine 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.259
 to build a lead once 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.259
 that way points can be safer last year 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.949
 are glad that we are now at the top, so we have to make things worse for a while 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:32.780
 francs from before 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.620
 how important it is to four soldiers but mentally as 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.929
 you are not at the top with its often program ahead 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.569
 yes it certainly can even though it can also be among the next two 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.989
 Competition matches are also all foreign athletes was in Almere 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.759
 tip to catch that 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:50.289
 we must have left 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:53.289
 yes also with a view to top chefs league it is handy 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:57.169
 In addition, you are just seeing a lot of confidence that will be disappointing 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.169
 the purchasing power not to trust us very much 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:03.969
 the belief in our own football also not placed
