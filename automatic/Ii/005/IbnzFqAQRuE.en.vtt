for gauging from hatch named about four

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.619 
for gauging from hatch named about four
months<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.469> cage<00:00:53.100> them<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> 10<00:00:54.360> gallon

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
months you can cage them in a 10 gallon

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.709 
months you can cage them in a 10 gallon
container<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:56.309> 10<00:00:56.879> gallon<00:00:57.059> aquarium<00:00:57.480> and

then<00:00:58.680> four<00:00:59.100> months<00:00:59.219> up<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.180> do<00:01:00.329> 20<00:01:00.690> allen

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
then four months up you can do 20 allen

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.439 
then four months up you can do 20 allen
and<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.800> fit<00:01:02.010> about<00:01:02.160> three<00:01:02.730> comfortably

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449

reptiles<00:01:06.930> height<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.040> much<00:01:08.280> better<00:01:08.460> than

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
reptiles height is so much better than

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.399 
reptiles height is so much better than
width<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.630> want<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.990> make<00:01:10.020> sure<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.350> you

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
width so you want to make sure that you

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.170 
width so you want to make sure that you
have<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> lot<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.830> height<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.220> your<00:01:11.369> cage<00:01:11.549> I'm<00:01:12.090> at

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
have a lot of height in your cage I'm at

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.359 
have a lot of height in your cage I'm at
a<00:01:12.210> steady<00:01:12.540> temperature<00:01:12.659> between<00:01:13.260> 72<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.100> 80

a steady temperature between 72 and 80
degrees<00:01:14.820> anything<00:01:15.659> above<00:01:15.930> 85<00:01:16.350> degrees

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
degrees anything above 85 degrees

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.929 
degrees anything above 85 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:17.490> will<00:01:18.090> actually<00:01:18.540> cause<00:01:18.780> them<00:01:19.170> to

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
Fahrenheit will actually cause them to

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.730 
Fahrenheit will actually cause them to
get<00:01:20.939> stressed<00:01:21.360> out<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.780> they<00:01:21.900> could<00:01:22.080> die<00:01:22.350> or

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
get stressed out and they could die or

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.560

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
suffer some type of illness so always

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.050 
suffer some type of illness so always
try<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.930> keep<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.229> below<00:01:25.380> 85<00:01:26.070> her<00:01:26.460> diet<00:01:26.759> there

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
try to keep it below 85 her diet there

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.940 
try to keep it below 85 her diet there
are<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.240> couple<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.689> options<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> species

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
are a couple of options for the species

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.399 
are a couple of options for the species
now<00:01:29.880> there's<00:01:30.329> something<00:01:30.570> called<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> crested

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
now there's something called the crested

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.550 
now there's something called the crested
gecko<00:01:31.770> diet<00:01:32.009> which<00:01:32.430> was<00:01:32.790> created<00:01:33.150> by<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.290> man

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.600 
another option is to do crested gecko
tide<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.299> insects<00:01:57.899> combined<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.610> another

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
tide and insects combined and another

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.840 
tide and insects combined and another
option<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.390> insects<00:02:01.380> only<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.579> could<00:02:02.670> be

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
option is insects only and it could be

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.959 
option is insects only and it could be
crickets<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.750> feeding<00:02:04.020> roaches<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:05.700> can't

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
crickets and feeding roaches you can't

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.690 
crickets and feeding roaches you can't
have<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> shallow<00:02:06.479> dish<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.590> spray

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
have a shallow dish I just spray

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.639 
have a shallow dish I just spray
once<00:02:09.030> or<00:02:09.179> twice<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.420> day<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.959> they<00:02:10.229> love

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
once or twice a day and they love

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.920 
once or twice a day and they love
drinking<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.819> water<00:02:11.970> off<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.510> sides<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.840> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
drinking the water off the sides of the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.869 
drinking the water off the sides of the
cage<00:02:13.110> if<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.349> have<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.500> glass<00:02:13.680> cage<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.760> can

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
cage if you have a glass cage you can

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.339 
cage if you have a glass cage you can
also<00:02:15.000> keep<00:02:15.150> them<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.540> screen<00:02:15.840> cage<00:02:16.050> if<00:02:16.200> you'd

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
also keep them in a screen cage if you'd

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.320 
also keep them in a screen cage if you'd
like<00:02:16.530> but<00:02:16.920> they're<00:02:17.190> very<00:02:17.220> easily<00:02:17.670> Hannibal

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
like but they're very easily Hannibal

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.390 
like but they're very easily Hannibal
actually<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.260> would<00:02:19.470> honestly<00:02:19.620> say<00:02:19.890> probably

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
actually I would honestly say probably

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.650 
actually I would honestly say probably
more<00:02:20.610> than<00:02:20.700> leopard<00:02:20.970> geckos<00:02:21.300> but<00:02:21.510> they<00:02:21.599> do

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
more than leopard geckos but they do

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.449 
more than leopard geckos but they do
jump<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.739> have<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.890> be<00:02:22.920> careful<00:02:23.129> because

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
jump so you have to be careful because

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.490 
jump so you have to be careful because
they<00:02:24.090> have<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.269> sticky<00:02:24.750> paws<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.230> they<00:02:25.349> can

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
they have the sticky paws so they can

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.140 
they have the sticky paws so they can
jump<00:02:25.709> out<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:25.950> your<00:02:26.069> hand<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.640> jump<00:02:26.940> onto

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
jump out of your hand and jump onto

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.660 
jump out of your hand and jump onto
something<00:02:27.860> whereas<00:02:28.860> leopard<00:02:29.190> geckos<00:02:29.519> will

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
something whereas leopard geckos will

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.180 
something whereas leopard geckos will
squirm<00:02:30.090> they<00:02:30.510> will<00:02:30.690> literally<00:02:30.959> jump<00:02:31.590> so

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
squirm they will literally jump so

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.040 
squirm they will literally jump so
especially<00:02:32.970> when<00:02:33.269> they're<00:02:33.360> babies<00:02:33.480> it's<00:02:33.870> hard
