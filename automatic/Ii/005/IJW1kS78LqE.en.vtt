cycle<00:00:24.510> better<00:00:24.869> with<00:00:25.680> those<00:00:26.300> cycling

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
cycle better with those cycling

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.179 
cycle better with those cycling
techniques<00:00:27.689> which<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.050> going<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.650> allow<00:00:28.920> me<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
apply my bodyweight better to the pedals

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.139 
apply my bodyweight better to the pedals
which<00:00:34.290> will<00:00:34.559> allow<00:00:35.309> me<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.520> be<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> faster

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
which will allow me to be a faster

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.200 
which will allow me to be a faster

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
these bike fit tips with the people I

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.319 
these bike fit tips with the people I
know<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.180> fights<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.620> did<00:00:43.770> was

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
know that the fights so what we did was

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.660

it<00:00:45.329> turns<00:00:45.690> out<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.770> my<00:00:47.010> seat<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.430> far

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it turns out that I have my seat as far

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.760 
it turns out that I have my seat as far
forward<00:00:47.910> as<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.480> go<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.230> still<00:00:49.559> not

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
forward as I can go and it is still not

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.160 
forward as I can go and it is still not
enough<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.309> you'll<00:00:50.879> see<00:00:51.120> me<00:00:51.300> today<00:00:51.480> sitting<00:00:52.020> on

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
enough so you'll see me today sitting on

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.010 
enough so you'll see me today sitting on
the<00:00:52.440> horn<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> saddle<00:00:53.610> here<00:00:53.879> because<00:00:54.719> when

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the horn of the saddle here because when

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.600 
the horn of the saddle here because when
I'm<00:00:55.170> sitting<00:00:55.500> here<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.800> too<00:00:55.949> far<00:00:56.160> back<00:00:56.309> so

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
I'm sitting here it's too far back so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610 
I'm sitting here it's too far back so
some<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> demonstration<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.379> drills

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
some of the demonstration of drills

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.869 
some of the demonstration of drills
you're<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> see<00:00:59.160> I'm<00:00:59.309> sitting<00:00:59.550> quite

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you're going to see I'm sitting quite

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.150 
you're going to see I'm sitting quite
forward<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:01.289> other<00:01:01.320> thing<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:01.859> did<00:01:02.010> was

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
forward the other thing that we did was

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.039 
forward the other thing that we did was
to<00:01:02.219> actually<00:01:02.670> tilt<00:01:02.969> down<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.449> whole<00:01:03.690> arrow

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
to actually tilt down this whole arrow

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.010 
to actually tilt down this whole arrow
bar<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.100> my<00:01:05.309> arms<00:01:05.760> could<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.600> very

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
bar so that my arms could be very

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.050 
bar so that my arms could be very
relaxed<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.830> hanging<00:01:08.250> down<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:08.670> they<00:01:08.820> should

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
relaxed and hanging down as they should

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.270 
relaxed and hanging down as they should
be<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> little<00:01:10.080> bit<00:01:10.170> up<00:01:10.350> which<00:01:10.979> would<00:01:11.189> have

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
be with a little bit up which would have

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.330 
be with a little bit up which would have
engaged<00:01:11.760> these<00:01:12.030> muscles<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.960> no<00:01:13.080> need

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
engaged these muscles here for no need

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.219 
engaged these muscles here for no need
creating<00:01:15.180> muscular<00:01:15.570> effort<00:01:15.720> when<00:01:16.110> there

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
creating muscular effort when there

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.170 
creating muscular effort when there
shouldn't<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.009> tilted<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.909> whole

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
shouldn't be so we tilted this whole

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.920 
shouldn't be so we tilted this whole
position<00:01:19.080> down<00:01:20.780> we<00:01:21.780> also<00:01:21.960> want<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.710> widen<00:01:23.100> my

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
position down we also want to widen my

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.510 
position down we also want to widen my
pants<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.200> my<00:01:25.320> elbows<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.040> they<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.369> be

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
pants for my elbows so that they can be

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.359 
pants for my elbows so that they can be
more<00:01:27.450> comfortable<00:01:28.020> out<00:01:28.259> here<00:01:28.320> help<00:01:29.159> me

more comfortable out here help me

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.730 
more comfortable out here help me
produce<00:01:29.729> better<00:01:30.390> power<00:01:30.720> by<00:01:31.020> applying<00:01:31.290> my<00:01:31.500> body

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740

weight<00:01:32.009> yes<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.970> been<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.450> more

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
weight yes I have been in a more

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.080 
weight yes I have been in a more
aerodynamic<00:01:33.840> position<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> would<00:01:35.759> prefer

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
aerodynamic position that I would prefer

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.300 
aerodynamic position that I would prefer
to<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.299> more<00:01:36.540> powerful<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.380> will<00:01:37.530> gain<00:01:37.740> make

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
to be more powerful and will gain make

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.399 
to be more powerful and will gain make
me<00:01:38.490> much<00:01:38.670> bigger<00:01:38.939> gains<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.049> I'm<00:01:40.229> actually

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
me much bigger gains so I'm actually

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.870 
me much bigger gains so I'm actually
gonna<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.979> do<00:01:41.100> something<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:41.670> this

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
gonna have to do something with this

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.749 
gonna have to do something with this
when<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> get<00:01:42.240> home<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.960> widen<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.619> bit<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
when I get home and widen it a bit and

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.580 
when I get home and widen it a bit and
the<00:01:44.850> last<00:01:45.030> thing<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.299> did<00:01:45.450> was<00:01:45.659> lower<00:01:45.930> my<00:01:46.229> seat<00:01:46.560> a

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590

bit<00:01:47.360> my<00:01:48.360> seat<00:01:48.810> was<00:01:49.140> correct<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.340> height<00:01:50.579> for

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
bit my seat was correct and height for

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.469 
bit my seat was correct and height for
most<00:01:51.780> standards<00:01:52.590> however<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:54.030> was<00:01:54.240> not

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
most standards however it was not

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.630 
most standards however it was not
allowing<00:01:55.229> me<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.619> an<00:01:55.799> effective<00:01:56.189> peddler
