00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.900
 hello welcome to this new tutorial 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.270
 today we will make this little flower form 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.930
 for this tutorial you will need 5 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:38.250
 say from 6 mm cone and I use the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:42.629
 remember about 2.5 mm that match 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:47.280
 of the 90 half black crystals in this 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.410
 case I use blacks and not crystal 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.559
 like these to make you see better 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.129
 work as it proceeds entered five 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.620
 means for the 5 b cone in the wire e 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.960
 close in a circle close to some 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.500
 means to pass back into the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:15.479
 beads on the opposite side where one is 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:20.760
 comes out with which so here and at work yes 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.979
 will form this circle that we must 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.939
 close with nodes by closing a 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.700
 circle this this sequence of b cones 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.619
 see that a five-star is formed 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.170
 tips between each say you have to enter 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.780
 three rocailles this hetero that they will go to 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.570
 form a triangle then what 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:49.969
 means to insert kyle in between 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.969
 lake came into the next say 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.760
 and see that this tip is formed 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.690
 this work we must owe you 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:06.530
 we have to do this until we finish the tour 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:11.210
 which is achieved by the end of this 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.960
 it is this five-pointed star 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:18.440
 five b-cone tips and five others 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.030
 hawkeye tips and exit from a b cone e 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.520
 by two rails 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:28.010
 so you will find yourself with the thread on 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:31.850
 tip on one of the tips now inserted 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.550
 a half crystal three ro kyle is a 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.920
 half a crystal is threaded and lake 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:44.870
 in the other tip that was formed in 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:48.650
 previous lap with the rails and forms 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.830
 to this jumper this work 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.910
 we have to do it until I finish the ho ride 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.120
 finished the tour and I left this one 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.140
 it had been my last bridge 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.959
 I have created for which I came from 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.269
 obviously from this rocaille and then I am 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.530
 entry with the needle in this medium 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:15.080
 crystal and in the three following rooms 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:19.130
 coming out of these we have to insert 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:22.700
 in the lake the thread 9 rocaille inserted the 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:27.070
 9 rocaille with the needle go into the three 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:30.680
 subsequent pro kyle of the previous round 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:33.500
 so get out of the three and come back 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.310
 in the next three others and a 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.970
 Petal should remain pointy so e 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:44.239
 instead it's probably not if yes 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.120
 put 11 rockice shape the tip here 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:51.260
 having said that we must do the same thing 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.470
 for the rest of the petals inserted the 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.730
 last nine rooms 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.720
 this is the result and comparison a 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.950
 the one with crystal crystal maladies 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.930
 I hope it was in this form 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.939
 clear 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.579
 if you have questions like always write to me 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:12.849
 below I will try to answer you in 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:17.310
 better than in the best possible way 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.310
 so I greet you the next hello video
