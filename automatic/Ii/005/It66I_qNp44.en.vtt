00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
like you'll see me using both of these a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.729 
like you'll see me using both of these a
lot<00:00:47.550> more<00:00:47.730> later<00:00:47.970> on<00:00:48.150> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> video<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.350> last

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
lot more later on in the video the last

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.650 
lot more later on in the video the last
time<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.460> looked<00:00:50.820> at<00:00:50.970> this<00:00:51.059> weapon<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.600> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
time I looked at this weapon for you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.410 
time I looked at this weapon for you
guys<00:00:51.900> was<00:00:52.559> before<00:00:53.040> it<00:00:53.280> was<00:00:53.400> patched<00:00:53.730> last<00:00:54.120> year

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
guys was before it was patched last year

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.610 
guys was before it was patched last year
and<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.570> remember<00:00:54.900> saying<00:00:55.080> in<00:00:55.290> that<00:00:55.440> video

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and I remember saying in that video

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.830 
and I remember saying in that video
there<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.580> time<00:00:56.820> nothing<00:00:57.239> particularly

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
there the time nothing particularly

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.780 
there the time nothing particularly
stood<00:00:58.170> out<00:00:58.320> about<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.800> jaenshi<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.580> it<00:00:59.670> was

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
stood out about the jaenshi and it was

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.270 
stood out about the jaenshi and it was
really<00:01:00.150> a<00:01:00.330> perfectly<00:01:01.229> kind<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.710> mediocre

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
really a perfectly kind of mediocre

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.000 
really a perfectly kind of mediocre
weapon<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.900> that<00:01:03.930> still<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.320> case<00:01:04.620> now

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
weapon so is that still the case now

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.740 
weapon so is that still the case now
with<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> J&amp;G<00:01:05.990> ensure<00:01:06.990> no<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.310> jain<00:01:08.610> g9e<00:01:09.420> was

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
with the J&amp;G ensure no the jain g9e was

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
with the J&amp;G ensure no the jain g9e was
one<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.110> biggest<00:01:10.350> winners<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> sniper

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
one of the biggest winners of the sniper

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.000 
one of the biggest winners of the sniper
rifle<00:01:12.090> balancing<00:01:12.659> which<00:01:12.780> took<00:01:13.049> place<00:01:13.110> almost

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
rifle balancing which took place almost

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.090 
rifle balancing which took place almost
six<00:01:14.790> months<00:01:15.000> ago<00:01:15.270> now<00:01:15.570> popular<00:01:16.500> weapons<00:01:16.860> like

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
six months ago now popular weapons like

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.390 
six months ago now popular weapons like
the<00:01:17.220> srr<00:01:17.940> 61<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.170> GOL<00:01:19.380> magnum<00:01:19.409> they<00:01:20.159> took

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the srr 61 and the GOL magnum they took

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.940 
the srr 61 and the GOL magnum they took
a<00:01:20.430> bit<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> enough<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.360> at<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> same<00:01:22.020> time<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
a bit of enough and at the same time the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.130 
a bit of enough and at the same time the
JMG<00:01:23.400> was<00:01:23.790> improved<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.510> that<00:01:24.659> gave<00:01:24.900> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
JMG was improved and that gave it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.010 
JMG was improved and that gave it
overall<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.130> more<00:01:26.610> viable<00:01:26.909> place<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
overall a more viable place in the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.500 
overall a more viable place in the
bolt-action<00:01:28.440> category<00:01:29.220> as<00:01:29.580> it<00:01:30.090> stands<00:01:30.390> right

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
bolt-action category as it stands right

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.319 
bolt-action category as it stands right
now<00:01:30.690> the<00:01:31.500> JMG<00:01:31.920> has<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> highest<00:01:32.939> muzzle

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
now the JMG has the highest muzzle

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.660 
now the JMG has the highest muzzle
velocity<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.840> any<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> sniper<00:01:34.979> rifles<00:01:35.460> and

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
velocity of any of the sniper rifles and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.389 
velocity of any of the sniper rifles and
that's<00:01:36.240> an<00:01:36.509> all-important<00:01:37.229> value<00:01:37.649> for<00:01:38.009> you

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
that's an all-important value for you

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.910 
that's an all-important value for you
guys<00:01:38.670> who<00:01:39.060> budding<00:01:39.450> long-range<00:01:39.990> sniper's<00:01:40.770> out

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
guys who budding long-range sniper's out

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.709 
guys who budding long-range sniper's out
there<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.250> which<00:01:41.609> I'm<00:01:41.880> clearly<00:01:42.149> not<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.689> of

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
there of which I'm clearly not one of

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.090 
there of which I'm clearly not one of
them<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.109> you'll<00:01:43.200> see<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.679> this<00:01:43.770> video

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
them and you'll see that in this video

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.160 
them and you'll see that in this video
now<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.909> think<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.270> would<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.479> fair<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.750> say<00:01:46.140> that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
now I think it would be fair to say that

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.050 
now I think it would be fair to say that
the<00:01:46.619> JMG<00:01:46.979> 90<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.030> m<00:01:48.149> 98<00:01:48.420> V<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.289> the<00:01:49.829> srr<00:01:50.340> 61

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the JMG 90 the m 98 V and the srr 61

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.359 
the JMG 90 the m 98 V and the srr 61
would<00:01:51.539> probably<00:01:52.079> be<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.469> free<00:01:52.740> bolt-action

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
would probably be the free bolt-action

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.730 
would probably be the free bolt-action
rifles<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.240> look<00:01:54.450> at<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.259> are<00:01:55.469> a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
rifles to look at if you are a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.739 
rifles to look at if you are a
long-range<00:01:56.219> sniper<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.539> really

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:57.749 
long-range sniper and this is really

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:59.929 
long-range sniper and this is really
because<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.409> muzzle<00:01:58.829> velocity<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.729> j

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
because of the muzzle velocity of the j

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.749 
because of the muzzle velocity of the j
&amp;<00:02:00.090> g<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> m<00:02:00.600> 98<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.189> bullet<00:02:02.520> drop

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
&amp; g and the m 98 be and the bullet drop

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.200 
&amp; g and the m 98 be and the bullet drop
on<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> srr<00:02:03.810> 61<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:04.710> basically<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.579> best<00:02:05.939> of

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
on the srr 61 it's basically the best of

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.450 
on the srr 61 it's basically the best of
all<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> bolt<00:02:07.020> action<00:02:07.380> sniper<00:02:07.590> rifles<00:02:08.340> out

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
all the bolt action sniper rifles out

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.029 
all the bolt action sniper rifles out
there<00:02:08.700> all<00:02:09.450> three<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.899> these<00:02:10.110> sniper<00:02:10.500> rifles

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
there all three of these sniper rifles

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.340 
there all three of these sniper rifles
dish<00:02:11.340> out<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.640> maximum<00:02:12.240> damage<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.810> hundred

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
dish out a maximum damage of a hundred

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.890 
dish out a maximum damage of a hundred
and<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.920> minimum<00:02:14.220> damage<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.790> 59<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.540> clearly

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and a minimum damage of 59 so clearly

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.370 
and a minimum damage of 59 so clearly
with<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:17.010> two<00:02:17.220> times<00:02:17.490> headshot<00:02:18.000> multiplier

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
with the two times headshot multiplier

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.020 
with the two times headshot multiplier
these<00:02:19.380> sniper<00:02:19.800> rifles<00:02:20.250> will<00:02:20.460> all<00:02:20.580> kill<00:02:20.850> with

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
these sniper rifles will all kill with

my<00:03:37.650> thoughts<00:03:37.950> are<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.970> doesn't<00:03:39.210> make

my thoughts are that this doesn't make

my thoughts are that this doesn't make
one<00:03:39.870> eye<00:03:39.900> or<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.470> difference<00:03:40.980> for<00:03:41.310> extreme

one eye or a difference for extreme
long-range<00:03:42.480> sniping<00:03:43.170> but<00:03:43.620> it's<00:03:43.770> certainly<00:03:44.040> a

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
long-range sniping but it's certainly a

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.460 
long-range sniping but it's certainly a
consideration<00:03:44.940> if<00:03:45.750> you're<00:03:45.990> looking<00:03:46.230> for<00:03:46.260> a

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
consideration if you're looking for a

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.250 
consideration if you're looking for a
more<00:03:46.740> flexible<00:03:47.640> bolt<00:03:48.060> action<00:03:48.450> sniper<00:03:48.570> rifle

in<00:03:49.440> conclusion<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:51.030> JMG<00:03:51.420> comes<00:03:51.960> into<00:03:52.290> its<00:03:52.440> own

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
in conclusion the JMG comes into its own

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.190 
in conclusion the JMG comes into its own
at<00:03:52.950> long<00:03:53.310> range<00:03:53.700> when<00:03:54.630> you're<00:03:54.660> looking<00:03:54.990> at

at long range when you're looking at

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.560 
at long range when you're looking at
ranges<00:03:55.710> i'll<00:03:55.920> say<00:03:56.160> 200<00:03:56.910> meters<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.360> beyond

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
ranges i'll say 200 meters and beyond

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.540 
ranges i'll say 200 meters and beyond
that's<00:03:57.960> probably<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.920> time<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.430> would

really<00:04:35.310> so<00:04:35.970> I<00:04:36.000> guess<00:04:36.150> sort<00:04:36.600> of
