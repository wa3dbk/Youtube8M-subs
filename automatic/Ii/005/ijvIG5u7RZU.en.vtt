00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.190
 fishing towns of Veracruz preserve and restore the mangroves 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.469
 a group of people work to protect preserve 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.469
 and restore the mangroves that are highly valued 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.020
 for being one of the most productive ecosystems on the planet 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.800
 in this region of the gulf of mexico inhabitants of the sontecomapan lagoon 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.149
 of the moral community and mosquito nets and the ejido the karachi 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.390
 They made the decision to restore the mangroves of the region 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.589
 in order to maintain its environmental and productive functions 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:40.589
 and as an alternative income and employment for the population 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.390
 with the creation of community nurseries, reforestation and cleaning works 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.809
 the hydrological channels 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.760
 these men and women of the entity 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.610
 every day to conserve the habitat of various species of animals 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.530
 natural incubators of important marine species with commercial value 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.100
 like the shrimp 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.810
 position 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.810
 mule leg smooth and wet among others 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.140
 with financing schemes such as the payment for services program 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.830
 environmental programs and the environmental compensation program for 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.950
 use of land on forest land the national forest commission has been 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.530
 responsible for getting funds and technical advice to the communities 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.160
 most remote of the entity where one is possible to restore 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.530
 and conserve these ecosystems 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.710
 In this way, truly exceptional projects such as the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.520
 case of the ejido el karachi 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.230
 where despite having only his initiative the desire to recover 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.890
 this natural capital 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.970
 families decided to start what is today a true testimony in the 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.010
 mangrove restoration 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.240
 we all continue in this turn 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.620
 with all my colleagues trying to 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.960
 to reverse and do reforestation work 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.060
 so that our future generations our children our grandchildren 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.320
 know if you want to send and if they attended 93% system 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.900
 the mangroves and wetlands 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.189
 the lagoon system of alvarado is the most extensive in the entire Gulf of Mexico 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.369
 which contains about 12 different ecosystems and a biodiversity 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.700
 exceptional 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.669
 that may be applied by future generations 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.309
 ohio with r the challenge that we have had 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:17.639
 has been to achieve 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.049
 the production of from one thousand to 600 thousand plants per year 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.069
 in two versions 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.580
 whether it be mangle prieto or manuel jan mangle red 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:29.979
 we have been learning 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:33.979
 that we can live from the mangrove borghi team community another example 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.990
 significant in the conservation of mangrove ecosystems 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.200
 it is the work developed by a group of seven women and one man belonging 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.029
 to the moral ejido and mosquito nets 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:46.499
 we go to a group of women committed to the mangrove 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.790
 we participate from the ditch the production 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:54.189
 Care until the exit of the field plant 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.729
 its interest in recovering the ecosystem that previously offered a source of 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:58.950
 income to his family 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.099
 it was defined a few years ago 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.489
 when they decided to conserve the natural vegetation and the animals of the 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.319
 mountain 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.319
 produce mangrove plant rivero 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.339
 reforest and maintain water channels unsoiled and without contamination 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.849
 all this helped to increase the forest area of â€‹â€‹this community 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.939
 At the time of production our group there is no employment to people of the same 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:21.849
 community 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.909
 which previously did not trust us we were labeled as crazy 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.639
 group of trends women delay the mosquito net 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.739
 he never gave up 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:33.930
 and in this way 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.470
 a small backyard project became a large semi nursery 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.240
 technology that represents a source of employment for several families of the 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.040
 also in the region of the tuxtlas place of great ceremonial tradition by 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.480
 its enigmatic groups 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.859
 is the sontecomapan lagoon 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.819
 part of the biosphere reserve 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.819
 where mangrove restoration has been carried out since 2004 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.340
 the change occurred as a result of the fishing activity 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.340
 the office of his whole life can not be carried out due to the shortage of 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.309
 commercial fish and crustaceans 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:08.919
 caused by deforestation, previously demanded by the 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.919
 although he was already a little further away from his bow 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:15.539
 In our world 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.150
 Boston the explosion happened in a statement thank you 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.639
 against having a new reconstruction in this sense 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.870
 they repeat because you can not have everything come out 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.320
 all this allows to return to the forest its original natural function 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:36.409
 the conservation and restoration of our elders is possible thanks to 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.960
 the programs issued by the federal government 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.080
 but more for the determination of the communities that have found in them 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.229
 an economic support 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.139
 a way of life and a better environment for all of us 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.270
 live better 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.419
 federal government
