Let’s see the trailer of Melancholia,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
today’s news is coming up.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
For the first time in his career,

highly anticipated Melancholia, which will be premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
But there are still few information about the movie,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the story focuses on the relationship of two sisters,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
played by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
who face a dramatic event,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
the end of the world caused by the collision of a planet with Earth.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
