teacher<00:00:34.609> I<00:00:34.820> suppose<00:00:35.239> my<00:00:35.570> job<00:00:35.809> is<00:00:35.989> to<00:00:36.199> set<00:00:36.469> the

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
teacher I suppose my job is to set the

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:38.799 
teacher I suppose my job is to set the
standards<00:00:37.460> that<00:00:37.550> we<00:00:37.789> require<00:00:38.210> as<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:38.449> school

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
standards that we require as a school

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.349 
standards that we require as a school
that's<00:00:39.019> about<00:00:39.320> high<00:00:39.500> expectations<00:00:40.149> so<00:00:41.149> I<00:00:41.179> have

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:41.359 
that's about high expectations so I have

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.330 
that's about high expectations so I have
very<00:00:41.390> high<00:00:41.750> expectations<00:00:42.109> of<00:00:42.710> myself

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
very high expectations of myself

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.669 
very high expectations of myself
high<00:00:43.879> expectations<00:00:44.239> of<00:00:44.809> my<00:00:45.019> staff<00:00:45.379> that

00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:45.679 
high expectations of my staff that

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.549 
high expectations of my staff that
they're<00:00:45.890> all<00:00:46.070> working<00:00:46.190> hard<00:00:46.489> as<00:00:47.359> a<00:00:47.420> team<00:00:47.570> to

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
they're all working hard as a team to

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.650 
they're all working hard as a team to
create<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:49.070> environment<00:00:49.280> and<00:00:50.030> therefore

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
create that environment and therefore

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.389 
create that environment and therefore
high<00:00:50.870> standards<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:51.589> expectations<00:00:51.859> of

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
high standards and expectations of

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.790 
high standards and expectations of
students<00:00:53.059> also<00:00:54.050> I<00:00:54.230> suppose<00:00:54.440> as<00:00:54.589> a<00:00:54.620> head

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
importantly the colleges because our

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.210 
importantly the colleges because our
children<00:01:11.840> will<00:01:12.140> then<00:01:12.260> move<00:01:12.410> on<00:01:12.620> and<00:01:12.800> transfer

children will then move on and transfer

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.260 
children will then move on and transfer
to<00:01:13.400> six<00:01:13.880> forms<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.540> local<00:01:14.870> colleges<00:01:16.270> okay

to six forms and local colleges okay

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.970 
to six forms and local colleges okay
Ruby<00:01:17.480> I<00:01:17.600> think<00:01:17.660> another<00:01:18.260> question<00:01:18.710> has<00:01:18.860> been

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
Ruby I think another question has been

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.390 
Ruby I think another question has been
yeah

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
yeah

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.270 
yeah
in<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.700> past<00:01:21.940> few<00:01:22.210> years<00:01:22.720> oh<00:01:22.900> so<00:01:23.830> many<00:01:23.950> changes

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
in the past few years oh so many changes

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.520 
in the past few years oh so many changes
it's<00:01:24.700> hard<00:01:24.910> to<00:01:25.090> remember<00:01:25.210> them<00:01:25.600> all<00:01:25.720> I<00:01:25.990> suppose

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
it's hard to remember them all I suppose

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.110 
it's hard to remember them all I suppose
the<00:01:26.740> first<00:01:26.920> thing<00:01:27.130> is<00:01:27.400> about<00:01:27.430> raising

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
the first thing is about raising

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.510 
the first thing is about raising
standards<00:01:28.420> in<00:01:28.810> teaching<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.320> learning<00:01:29.800> so

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
standards in teaching and learning so

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.580 
standards in teaching and learning so
you<00:01:30.850> probably<00:01:31.420> won't<00:01:31.690> know<00:01:31.840> as<00:01:31.960> students<00:01:32.440> but

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
you probably won't know as students but

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.020 
you probably won't know as students but
we<00:01:32.710> have<00:01:32.860> all<00:01:33.070> our<00:01:33.250> teachers<00:01:33.460> belong<00:01:33.880> to

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
we have all our teachers belong to

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.060 
we have all our teachers belong to
working<00:01:34.450> parties<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:35.410> they're<00:01:35.650> looking<00:01:35.950> at

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
working parties and they're looking at

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.580 
working parties and they're looking at
how<00:01:36.250> they<00:01:36.430> teach<00:01:36.490> how<00:01:37.090> children<00:01:37.390> learn<00:01:37.600> how<00:01:38.530> to

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
how they teach how children learn how to

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.160 
how they teach how children learn how to
assess<00:01:39.040> children's<00:01:39.580> progress<00:01:39.880> how<00:01:40.690> to<00:01:40.750> track

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
assess children's progress how to track

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.170 
assess children's progress how to track
that<00:01:41.380> they're<00:01:41.530> on<00:01:41.650> target<00:01:41.980> there's<00:01:42.850> a<00:01:42.910> lot<00:01:43.060> of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
that they're on target there's a lot of

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.060 
that they're on target there's a lot of
work<00:01:43.420> been<00:01:43.780> going<00:01:44.110> on<00:01:44.230> in<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.470> range<00:01:44.890> of

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
work been going on in a range of

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.530 
work been going on in a range of
subjects<00:01:45.550> in<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:45.730> area

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
subjects in that area

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.480 
subjects in that area
I<00:01:46.570> suppose<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.560> children<00:01:47.740> will<00:01:48.040> see<00:01:48.220> some<00:01:48.460> of

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
I suppose the children will see some of

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.220 
I suppose the children will see some of
the<00:01:48.670> changes<00:01:49.030> like<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.330> vertical<00:01:49.750> tutoring

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
the changes like the vertical tutoring

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.220 
the changes like the vertical tutoring
see<00:01:50.650> we're<00:01:50.830> all<00:01:50.920> in<00:01:51.100> da<00:01:51.820> Vinci<00:01:52.210> house<00:01:52.390> so<00:01:53.140> I've

and<00:02:29.080> what<00:02:29.440> are<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.709> school's<00:02:30.010> targets<00:02:30.840> well

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
and what are the school's targets well

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.259 
and what are the school's targets well
the<00:02:31.959> first<00:02:32.200> target<00:02:32.830> is<00:02:32.980> about<00:02:33.280> achieving<00:02:33.820> the

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
the first target is about achieving the

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.630 
the first target is about achieving the
best<00:02:34.450> we<00:02:34.630> can<00:02:34.840> for<00:02:35.050> students<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.220> it's<00:02:36.400> about

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
best we can for students so it's about

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.550 
best we can for students so it's about
looking<00:02:37.300> at<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.540> donor<00:02:37.750> because<00:02:38.320> when<00:02:38.470> you

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
looking at the donor because when you

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.990 
looking at the donor because when you
all<00:02:38.709> come<00:02:38.890> in<00:02:39.040> you've<00:02:39.190> all<00:02:39.310> got<00:02:39.489> results<00:02:39.880> from

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
all come in you've all got results from

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.759 
all come in you've all got results from
the<00:02:40.180> primary<00:02:40.540> schools<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.140> looking<00:02:41.530> at<00:02:41.620> how

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
the primary schools and looking at how

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.580 
the primary schools and looking at how
we<00:02:41.830> can<00:02:42.160> maximize<00:02:42.340> your<00:02:42.940> potential<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:44.440> we

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
we can maximize your potential so we

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.290 
we can maximize your potential so we
have<00:02:44.739> targets<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.580> terms<00:02:45.610> of<00:02:46.060> how<00:02:46.239> many

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
have targets in terms of how many

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.979 
have targets in terms of how many
children<00:02:46.989> get<00:02:47.790> GCSEs<00:02:48.790> grades<00:02:49.209> A<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.450> C<00:02:49.720> and

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
children get GCSEs grades A to C and

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.130 
children get GCSEs grades A to C and
we're<00:02:50.320> doing<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:50.830> well<00:02:51.160> on<00:02:51.400> our

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
we're doing so well on our

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.290 
we're doing so well on our
the<00:02:52.230> moment<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.580> then<00:02:53.819> I<00:02:53.850> suppose<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.270> other

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
the moment and then I suppose the other

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.930 
the moment and then I suppose the other
target<00:02:54.900> as<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.080> school<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.980> be<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.640> school

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
target as a school is to be the school

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.270 
target as a school is to be the school
of<00:02:56.970> choice<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.840> community<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.590> want<00:02:59.069> people

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
of choice in the community I want people

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.250 
of choice in the community I want people
who<00:02:59.459> live<00:02:59.730> around<00:02:59.850> here<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.390> think<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:01.080> isn't

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
who live around here to think that isn't

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.809 
who live around here to think that isn't
school<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:01.830> want<00:03:02.010> my<00:03:02.130> child<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.550> go<00:03:02.760> to

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
school that I want my child to go to

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.970 
school that I want my child to go to
that's<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.690> big<00:03:03.870> target<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.590> takes<00:03:04.860> time

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
that's a big target and that takes time

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.030 
that's a big target and that takes time
and<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:06.150> suppose<00:03:06.360> it's<00:03:06.540> about<00:03:06.660> sharing<00:03:07.500> what<00:03:07.860> we

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
and I suppose it's about sharing what we

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.130 
and I suppose it's about sharing what we
do<00:03:08.220> in<00:03:08.430> school<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:09.330> priority<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:09.900> getting

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
do in school but the priority is getting

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.010 
do in school but the priority is getting
it<00:03:10.230> right<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.560> school<00:03:10.920> first<00:03:14.360> yes<00:03:15.360> how<00:03:15.720> do<00:03:15.780> my

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
it right in school first yes how do my

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.870 
it right in school first yes how do my
parents<00:03:16.440> know<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.770> I'm<00:03:16.920> safe<00:03:17.400> in<00:03:17.550> school

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
parents know that I'm safe in school

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.420 
parents know that I'm safe in school
that's<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.810> really<00:03:19.110> good<00:03:19.260> question<00:03:19.500> and

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
that's a really good question and

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.300 
that's a really good question and
obviously<00:03:21.150> safety<00:03:21.510> is<00:03:21.870> absolutely<00:03:22.200> key<00:03:23.010> in

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
obviously safety is absolutely key in

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.460 
obviously safety is absolutely key in
schools<00:03:23.850> it's<00:03:24.209> paramount<00:03:24.600> there's<00:03:25.170> obviously

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
schools it's paramount there's obviously
