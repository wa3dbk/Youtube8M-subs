do is pause and either write this down

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.100 
do is pause and either write this down
or<00:00:41.370> write<00:00:41.579> down<00:00:41.760> your<00:00:41.910> answer<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.809> why<00:00:43.050> you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
or write down your answer and why you

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.139 
or write down your answer and why you
think<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.710> before<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.430> move<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.000> next

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
think so before you move on to the next

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.990 
think so before you move on to the next
slide<00:00:45.420> where<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.690> explain<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.200> answer<00:00:50.000> okay

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
slide where I explain the answer okay

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.670 
slide where I explain the answer okay
and<00:00:51.239> make<00:00:51.420> sure<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.809> notice<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.440> says

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
and make sure you notice that it says

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.639 
and make sure you notice that it says
not<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.670> I've<00:00:54.360> included<00:00:54.570> those<00:00:55.170> because

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
not and I've included those because

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.500 
not and I've included those because
they're<00:00:55.949> very<00:00:56.160> frequently<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.820> M<00:00:56.940> cast<00:00:57.239> so

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
they're very frequently on M cast so

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.479 
they're very frequently on M cast so
it's<00:00:57.690> used<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.770> worth<00:00:58.949> getting<00:00:59.160> used<00:00:59.550> to

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
it's used it's worth getting used to

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.479 
it's used it's worth getting used to
okay<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> answer<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.210> DNA<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:04.769> living<00:01:05.250> things

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
okay the answer is DNA so living things

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280 
okay the answer is DNA so living things
respond<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.210> significant<00:01:06.780> things<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.140> their

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
respond to significant things in their

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.830 
respond to significant things in their
environment<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.760> examples<00:01:09.360> we've<00:01:09.540> talked

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
environment and so examples we've talked

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.719 
environment and so examples we've talked
about<00:01:10.140> or<00:01:10.320> how<00:01:10.439> planets<00:01:10.950> been<00:01:11.159> towards<00:01:11.490> light

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
about or how planets been towards light

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.000 
about or how planets been towards light
we've<00:01:12.450> talked<00:01:12.720> about<00:01:12.869> how<00:01:13.140> our<00:01:13.290> mouth<00:01:13.500> waters

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
we've talked about how our mouth waters

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.429 
we've talked about how our mouth waters
when<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.369> see<00:01:14.549> food<00:01:14.850> or<00:01:15.150> about<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.540> eat<00:01:15.689> we've

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
when we see food or about to eat we've

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.649 
when we see food or about to eat we've
talked<00:01:16.710> about<00:01:16.830> homeostasis<00:01:17.430> how<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.299> body

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
talked about homeostasis how the body

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.080 
talked about homeostasis how the body
maintains<00:01:19.470> balance<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:20.430> example<00:01:20.880> when

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
maintains balance for example when

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.870 
maintains balance for example when
you're<00:01:21.240> cold<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.869> shiver<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:23.189> part<00:01:23.759> of

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
you're cold you shiver that's part of

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.550 
you're cold you shiver that's part of
how<00:01:24.060> living<00:01:24.360> things<00:01:24.479> respond<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.439> their

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
how living things respond to their

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.020 
how living things respond to their
environment<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:26.490> how<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:26.700> maintain

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
environment and it's how we maintain

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.510 
environment and it's how we maintain
homeostasis<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:28.320> how<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.590> grow<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.310> how<00:01:29.460> we

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
homeostasis is how we grow it's how we

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.870 
homeostasis is how we grow it's how we
metabolize<00:01:32.810> question<00:01:33.810> two<00:01:34.340> what<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.490> true<00:01:35.850> of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
metabolize question two what is true of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.850 
metabolize question two what is true of
all<00:01:36.390> organisms<00:01:37.729> organisms<00:01:38.729> grow<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.180> develop

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
all organisms organisms grow and develop

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.990 
all organisms organisms grow and develop
organisms<00:01:40.860> grow<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.340> never<00:01:41.549> develop

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
organisms grow but never develop

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.649 
organisms grow but never develop
organisms<00:01:42.990> always<00:01:43.350> remain<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> same<00:01:44.009> size

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
organisms always remain the same size

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.539 
organisms always remain the same size
organisms<00:01:45.659> always<00:01:46.079> shrink<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.590> divide<00:01:46.860> so

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
organisms always shrink and divide so

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.020 
organisms always shrink and divide so
pause<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.329> come<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:48.659> your<00:01:48.720> answer<00:01:53.030> okay

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
pause and come up with your answer okay

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.819 
pause and come up with your answer okay
the<00:01:54.210> answer<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.600> all<00:01:54.840> living<00:01:55.229> things<00:01:55.259> grow<00:01:55.560> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the answer is all living things grow and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.649 
the answer is all living things grow and
develop<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.250> that's<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> things<00:01:57.329> in

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
develop so that's one of the things in

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.539 
develop so that's one of the things in
the<00:01:57.840> Misses<00:01:58.380> nog<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.340> things

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the Misses nog and one of the things

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.069 
the Misses nog and one of the things
we've<00:01:59.729> talked<00:01:59.969> about<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.210> lot<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:00.780> living

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
we've talked about a lot but living

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.069 
we've talked about a lot but living
things<00:02:01.409> need<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.710> grow<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.340> develop<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:03.869> go

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
things need to grow and develop so we go

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.410 
things need to grow and develop so we go
from<00:02:04.380> being<00:02:04.560> one<00:02:04.950> cell<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.700> many<00:02:05.939> many<00:02:06.210> many

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
from being one cell to many many many

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.630 
from being one cell to many many many
cells<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.170> individual<00:02:07.920> cells<00:02:08.220> like

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
cells and individual cells like

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.699 
cells and individual cells like
prokaryotes<00:02:09.450> bacteria<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:10.410> we're<00:02:10.530> going<00:02:10.649> to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
prokaryotes bacteria that we're going to

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.340 
prokaryotes bacteria that we're going to
talk<00:02:10.890> about<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.700> couple<00:02:11.970> days<00:02:12.120> also<00:02:12.870> grow

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
talk about in a couple days also grow

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.450 
talk about in a couple days also grow
so<00:02:16.350> they'll<00:02:16.500> go<00:02:16.680> through<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.920> growth<00:02:17.220> phase

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
so they'll go through a growth phase

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.630 
so they'll go through a growth phase
before<00:02:18.030> they<00:02:18.180> divide<00:02:21.590> question<00:02:22.590> 3<00:02:22.860> what<00:02:23.490> is

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
before they divide question 3 what is

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.550 
before they divide question 3 what is
the<00:02:23.820> smallest<00:02:24.240> functional<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.260> structural

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
the smallest functional and structural

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.300 
the smallest functional and structural
unit<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.370> life<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:27.270> membrane<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.200> cell<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
unit of life the membrane the cell the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.720 
unit of life the membrane the cell the
stimulus<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.180> metabolism<00:02:31.100> okay<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:32.580> have

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
stimulus the metabolism okay so you have

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.160 
stimulus the metabolism okay so you have
some<00:02:32.940> typos<00:02:33.330> here<00:02:33.570> sorry<00:02:33.870> about<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:36.170> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
some typos here sorry about that and the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.740 
some typos here sorry about that and the
answer<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.770> cell<00:02:38.070> okay<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:38.910> all<00:02:39.330> living

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
answer is the cell okay so all living

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.190 
answer is the cell okay so all living
things<00:02:40.020> are<00:02:40.380> made<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:41.250> at<00:02:41.400> least<00:02:41.640> one<00:02:42.240> cell<00:02:42.900> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
things are made of at least one cell and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.200 
things are made of at least one cell and
the<00:02:43.620> cell<00:02:43.800> carries<00:02:44.190> out<00:02:44.370> metabolism

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
the cell carries out metabolism

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.940 
the cell carries out metabolism
respiration<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.020> growth<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.680> cell<00:02:46.920> is

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
respiration and growth so the cell is

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.760 
respiration and growth so the cell is
like<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.580> little<00:02:48.210> organism<00:02:48.840> onto<00:02:49.110> itself<00:02:49.470> and

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
like a little organism onto itself and

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.560 
like a little organism onto itself and
of<00:02:49.860> course<00:02:50.130> there<00:02:50.370> are<00:02:50.580> unicellular

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
of course there are unicellular

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.470 
of course there are unicellular
organisms<00:02:52.560> one<00:02:52.890> celled<00:02:53.220> organisms<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.240> one

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
organisms one celled organisms and one

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.480 
organisms one celled organisms and one
of<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.660> examples<00:02:54.780> we<00:02:55.380> saw<00:02:55.620> was<00:02:56.460> a

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
of the examples we saw was a

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.090 
of the examples we saw was a
single-celled<00:02:57.180> fungus<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.170> yeast<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.950> we

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
single-celled fungus the yeast that we

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.080 
single-celled fungus the yeast that we
looked<00:02:59.310> at<00:02:59.660> we<00:03:00.660> also<00:03:00.870> saw<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.800> single<00:03:02.760> celled

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
looked at we also saw a single celled

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.050 
looked at we also saw a single celled
protists<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:04.620> carried<00:03:05.100> out<00:03:05.220> metabolism

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
protists that carried out metabolism

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.570 
protists that carried out metabolism
respiration<00:03:06.660> growth<00:03:06.960> and<00:03:07.470> by<00:03:07.650> metabolism<00:03:08.460> we

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
respiration growth and by metabolism we

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.930 
respiration growth and by metabolism we
mean<00:03:08.990> eating<00:03:09.990> and<00:03:10.260> digestion<00:03:11.120> or<00:03:12.320> for<00:03:13.320> plants

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
mean eating and digestion or for plants

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.550 
mean eating and digestion or for plants
they<00:03:14.940> also<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.750> know<00:03:15.780> eat<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.200> sugars<00:03:16.530> that

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
they also you know eat the sugars that

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.710 
they also you know eat the sugars that
they<00:03:16.860> make<00:03:17.040> but<00:03:17.310> they<00:03:17.460> also<00:03:17.610> make<00:03:18.000> sugars

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
they make but they also make sugars

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.620 
they make but they also make sugars

humans<00:05:04.120> what<00:05:04.600> are<00:05:04.720> some<00:05:04.930> of<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.139> symptoms<00:05:05.470> how

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
humans what are some of the symptoms how

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.830 
humans what are some of the symptoms how
does<00:05:06.340> it<00:05:06.520> pass<00:05:06.729> from<00:05:07.030> organism<00:05:07.690> to<00:05:07.810> organism

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
does it pass from organism to organism

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.430 
does it pass from organism to organism
what<00:05:08.740> is<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:08.979> structure<00:05:09.550> I<00:05:09.729> think<00:05:10.570> another

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
what is the structure I think another

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.680 
what is the structure I think another
sample<00:05:12.010> open<00:05:12.310> response<00:05:12.729> I<00:05:12.970> could<00:05:13.150> have<00:05:13.300> put

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
sample open response I could have put

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.040 
sample open response I could have put
here<00:05:13.990> would<00:05:14.200> be<00:05:14.910> how<00:05:15.910> could<00:05:16.150> you<00:05:16.300> prove<00:05:16.660> that<00:05:16.990> a

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
here would be how could you prove that a

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.409 
here would be how could you prove that a
virus<00:05:17.530> is<00:05:17.770> nonliving<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:18.880> ask<00:05:19.030> you<00:05:19.270> to

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
virus is nonliving and ask you to

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.170 
virus is nonliving and ask you to
describe<00:05:19.840> two<00:05:20.680> of<00:05:21.040> the<00:05:21.190> features<00:05:21.610> that<00:05:21.639> make<00:05:22.150> a

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
describe two of the features that make a

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.560 
describe two of the features that make a
virus<00:05:22.630> nonliving<00:05:24.060> but<00:05:25.060> this<00:05:25.210> one<00:05:25.389> of<00:05:25.419> course

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
virus nonliving but this one of course

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.750 
virus nonliving but this one of course
would<00:05:25.930> refer<00:05:26.229> exactly<00:05:26.740> to<00:05:26.950> what<00:05:27.100> ever<00:05:27.280> virus

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
would refer exactly to what ever virus

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.130 
would refer exactly to what ever virus
you<00:05:28.270> researched<00:05:28.930> and<00:05:29.650> I'd<00:05:29.860> be<00:05:30.070> looking<00:05:30.250> for

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
you researched and I'd be looking for

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.600 
you researched and I'd be looking for
some<00:05:32.140> of<00:05:32.289> the<00:05:32.380> things<00:05:32.410> that<00:05:32.860> you<00:05:33.039> had<00:05:33.310> to<00:05:33.580> know

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
some of the things that you had to know

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.159 
some of the things that you had to know
about<00:05:34.090> your<00:05:34.630> virus<00:05:36.419> so<00:05:37.419> the<00:05:37.630> answer<00:05:37.990> of<00:05:38.140> course

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
about your virus so the answer of course

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:39.990 
about your virus so the answer of course
is<00:05:38.560> to<00:05:38.800> review<00:05:39.100> the<00:05:39.250> virus<00:05:39.610> that<00:05:39.880> you

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
is to review the virus that you

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.670 
is to review the virus that you
researched<00:05:40.510> and<00:05:40.900> if<00:05:41.020> there<00:05:41.200> was<00:05:41.320> something

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
researched and if there was something

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.250 
researched and if there was something
missing<00:05:42.280> review<00:05:43.270> it<00:05:43.390> now<00:05:45.120> so<00:05:46.120> some<00:05:46.990> of<00:05:47.020> you

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
missing review it now so some of you

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.680 
missing review it now so some of you
were<00:05:47.410> missing<00:05:47.800> a<00:05:48.010> picture<00:05:48.850> of<00:05:49.000> your<00:05:49.150> virus<00:05:49.510> so

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
were missing a picture of your virus so

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.870 
were missing a picture of your virus so
you<00:05:49.810> couldn't<00:05:50.140> comment<00:05:50.530> on<00:05:50.770> structure<00:05:51.460> some

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
you couldn't comment on structure some

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.510 
you couldn't comment on structure some
of<00:05:51.910> you<00:05:52.150> are<00:05:52.330> missing<00:05:52.750> how<00:05:53.560> it<00:05:53.860> moved<00:05:54.250> from

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
of you are missing how it moved from

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.180 
of you are missing how it moved from
person<00:05:55.450> to<00:05:55.570> person<00:05:55.750> or<00:05:56.320> from<00:05:56.530> mosquito<00:05:57.130> to

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
person to person or from mosquito to

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.070 
person to person or from mosquito to
person<00:05:57.729> so<00:05:57.940> you<00:05:58.030> might<00:05:58.210> want<00:05:58.419> to<00:05:58.510> review<00:05:58.900> that

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
person so you might want to review that

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.469 
person so you might want to review that
or<00:05:59.530> you<00:06:00.100> might<00:06:00.250> want<00:06:00.280> to<00:06:00.490> pick<00:06:00.639> a<00:06:00.669> simple<00:06:01.000> virus

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
or you might want to pick a simple virus

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.659 
or you might want to pick a simple virus
like<00:06:01.690> influenza<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:02.680> flu<00:06:03.010> that<00:06:03.310> we<00:06:03.430> talked

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
like influenza the flu that we talked

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.779 
like influenza the flu that we talked
about<00:06:03.760> a<00:06:03.910> lot<00:06:04.150> which<00:06:04.539> you<00:06:04.960> already<00:06:05.229> know

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
about a lot which you already know

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.550 
about a lot which you already know
pretty<00:06:06.789> much<00:06:06.910> how<00:06:07.270> it<00:06:07.450> passes<00:06:07.840> from<00:06:07.990> person<00:06:08.410> to

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
pretty much how it passes from person to

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.600 
pretty much how it passes from person to
person<00:06:12.389> okay<00:06:13.419> so<00:06:13.930> my<00:06:14.530> other<00:06:14.770> advice<00:06:15.190> is<00:06:15.430> to

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
person okay so my other advice is to

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.460 
person okay so my other advice is to
study<00:06:15.850> the<00:06:15.970> questions<00:06:16.450> that<00:06:16.630> run<00:06:16.840> the<00:06:17.020> sample

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
study the questions that run the sample

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.890 
study the questions that run the sample
virus<00:06:18.340> questions<00:06:18.940> that<00:06:19.270> I<00:06:19.300> gave<00:06:19.539> you<00:06:19.690> for

and<00:06:26.400> I<00:06:27.400> will<00:06:27.880> reuse<00:06:28.300> those<00:06:28.570> questions<00:06:29.020> but<00:06:29.229> I

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.289 
and I will reuse those questions but I

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:33.180 
and I will reuse those questions but I
might<00:06:29.530> reorder<00:06:30.340> them<00:06:30.610> I<00:06:31.200> may<00:06:32.200> reward<00:06:32.710> them<00:06:33.160> a

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
might reorder them I may reward them a

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.760 
might reorder them I may reward them a
little<00:06:33.490> bit<00:06:33.669> so<00:06:34.479> I<00:06:34.960> would<00:06:35.320> make<00:06:35.470> sure<00:06:35.650> you

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
little bit so I would make sure you

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.440 
little bit so I would make sure you
understand<00:06:36.310> the<00:06:36.430> content<00:06:37.000> of<00:06:37.180> what<00:06:37.330> I'm

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450 
understand the content of what I'm

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.230 
understand the content of what I'm
driving<00:06:37.659> at<00:06:37.990> and<00:06:38.440> when<00:06:38.650> you<00:06:38.740> review<00:06:39.099> viruses

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
driving at and when you review viruses

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.760 
driving at and when you review viruses
remember<00:06:40.630> that<00:06:40.810> you're<00:06:40.960> thinking<00:06:41.139> about<00:06:41.410> what

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
remember that you're thinking about what

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.529 
remember that you're thinking about what
makes<00:06:41.919> virus<00:06:42.520> is<00:06:43.919> living<00:06:44.919> or<00:06:45.280> nonliving<00:06:45.880> now

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:46.539 
makes virus is living or nonliving now

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.210 
makes virus is living or nonliving now
biologists<00:06:47.289> are<00:06:47.380> considering<00:06:48.039> them

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
biologists are considering them

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.999 
biologists are considering them
nonliving<00:06:48.819> but<00:06:49.810> why<00:06:49.960> might<00:06:50.229> you<00:06:50.259> argue<00:06:50.830> them

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:51.009 
nonliving but why might you argue them

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:54.059 
nonliving but why might you argue them
living<00:06:51.280> so<00:06:52.150> they're<00:06:52.389> not<00:06:52.569> made<00:06:52.870> of<00:06:52.900> cells<00:06:53.380> they

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:54.069 
living so they're not made of cells they

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:56.850 
living so they're not made of cells they
do<00:06:54.130> have<00:06:54.580> DNA<00:06:55.000> or<00:06:55.150> RNA<00:06:55.180> they<00:06:56.080> don't<00:06:56.349> have<00:06:56.590> any

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:56.860 
do have DNA or RNA they don't have any

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.040 
do have DNA or RNA they don't have any
organelles<00:06:57.490> so<00:06:58.180> think<00:06:58.449> of<00:06:58.569> those<00:06:58.720> key

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050 
organelles so think of those key

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.010 
organelles so think of those key
features<00:06:59.289> of<00:06:59.830> viruses<00:07:00.400> as<00:07:00.669> you<00:07:00.970> review<00:07:01.330> if<00:07:01.870> you

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
features of viruses as you review if you

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.200 
features of viruses as you review if you
have<00:07:02.169> any<00:07:02.319> questions<00:07:02.889> you<00:07:03.669> can<00:07:03.699> certainly

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
have any questions you can certainly

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.650 
have any questions you can certainly
email<00:07:04.539> me<00:07:04.990> or<00:07:05.740> you<00:07:06.610> can<00:07:06.639> contact<00:07:07.120> me<00:07:07.419> through

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.660 
email me or you can contact me through

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.980 
email me or you can contact me through
Schoology<00:07:08.289> and<00:07:09.039> that's<00:07:09.940> the<00:07:10.180> end<00:07:10.330> I<00:07:10.660> hope<00:07:10.810> you

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
Schoology and that's the end I hope you

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.479 
Schoology and that's the end I hope you
have<00:07:11.139> a<00:07:11.849> quality<00:07:12.849> study<00:07:13.180> time
