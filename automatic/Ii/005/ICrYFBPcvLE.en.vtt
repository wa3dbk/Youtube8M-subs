00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.360
 as we can see in the video 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.040
 since the inks are already installed in their 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.280
 respective containers with the 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.370
 hoses the number 2 is the number 8 the 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.810
 number 6 we will proceed to the 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.810
 installation of the cartridges 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.560
 you can in the video that the key to 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.510
 three ways to avoid the ink spill 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.860
 then we can work quietly 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.320
 and assemble the system for this printer 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.920
 which in this case is the 42 80 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.370
 all hp have the same system 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.160
 installation 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.500
 next I will do the 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.570
 installation of the cartridges so that 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.440
 everyone realizes how it is done 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.440
 how it is installed 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.440
 proceed to the installation of the cartridge 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:26.220
 the yellow hose goes to the container 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.220
 yellow 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.150
 I like the one that arrives until the 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.150
 the papillas to be absorbed 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.140
 the blue hose 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.810
 to its respective blue 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.610
 the red hose goes to the difficult red 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.700
 already hoses are embedded 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.420
 we proceed to open the three keys 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.180
 for 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.950
 that the cartridge 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.950
 suction in the necessary ink 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.709
 and immediately 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.500
 as we see the blue ink is running 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.280
 the red ones also the yellow one also 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.130
 is running correctly 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.940
 after it is correctly 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.940
 installed 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.230
 we cover the two buildings that are left 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.780
 to the cartridge 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.940
 with a 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.069
 two plastic plugs that already 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.069
 previously I had conditioned it 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.569
 this the stopper cited plastic for 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.590
 cover 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.180
 in the building 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.549
 and the other stopper cited plastic 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.620
 we use the same procedure for the 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.250
 black cartridge black cartridge other 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.760
 once five holes and that to cover four 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.189
 leave him only in the center 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.760
 in the center we proceed to install 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.760
 the hose 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:33.060
 that is correctly installed already 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.700
 then we put it in this base 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.480
 for 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.480
 sin 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.370
 that to follow goes of support only for 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.240
 proceed to seal the two cartridges 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.820
 completely 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.280
 with this we proceed to do with drop 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.480
 Magic with super drop bowl brand 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:58.090
 as you call and each part 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:02.129
 to the root of the hose we throw 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.129
 what do we throw at the root of the hose 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.439
 what is enough 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.439
 we cover you both 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.159
 and the other two that send sealed 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.500
 and the same with the one in black 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.479
 we catch 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.260
 completely all around the 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:36.260
 hose 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.260
 and we cover the five holes brings you 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.510
 after this we only have left 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.480
 wait for approximately one 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.180
 half an hour and we will proceed to install you 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.770
 the system to the printer 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.440
 then proceed to the 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.390
 final installation we clean the cartridge 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.990
 to remove excess ink 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.150
 we have already installed the black one 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.990
 then we are going to clean the 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.090
 color cartridge 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.490
 but you have to submit 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.490
 that is completely clean before 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.520
 the installation 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.120
 that does not have to drain ink like 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.580
 can see 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.030
 it's perfect 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.729
 we look is marking their respective 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.710
 colors perfectly we have already installed 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:35.390
 the adhesives 1 and 2 for the 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.390
 selection of hoses 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.559
 but 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.559
 and then 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:51.100
 manually with results 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:55.080
 to measure the hoses 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.080
 what part of your card 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.560
 finally we perform the test of 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.560
 Print 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:10.380
 We are looking for a photocopy because 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.380
 we have the computer installed 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.030
 how can you see the perfect copies 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:34.150
 and so we can enjoy the 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.480
 4280 printer with continuous system 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.480
 thrips
