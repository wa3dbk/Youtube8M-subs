 we stop the music that we do not want 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.480
 listen and well we chose the destination 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.880
 where we want to install the game 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.560

 We give it to next and install as 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.030
 You see it installs pretty fast 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.030
 we wait a little while to install 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.320
 very well and we already have it done so 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.480
 we give it to finish and we leave the 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.370
 installer that we do now you see that the 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.650
 icon this is weird not because I have a 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.390
 Windows window strange what 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.510

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.829
 copy the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.930
 and replace them in the folder where we have 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:17.780
 will be the game that in my case is 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.060
 program file 86 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.989
 and we search on TV 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.190
 titan soul is worth and we open and let go 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.680
 right here we paste and we give to realize 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.150

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.000
 continue 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.560
 ready this icon that we have in the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.190
 we have to throw it to the 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.750
 trash because it does not work anymore and we have to 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.690
 in this one here that weighs 3 megabytes with 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.360
 188 kb of which puts titan 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.520
 we have to give him direct access to 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.910
 desk we already have it here this here 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.620
 we can close perfectly and we are going to 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.989
 see if it works 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.319
 and as you can see we can play 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.870
 perfectly to titan soul opens up well 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.480
 in short there is no there has to be any 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.010
