with a bad back you're trying to save
your<00:00:45.329> back<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:46.170> longer<00:00:46.559> handles<00:00:47.160> are<00:00:47.309> much

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
your back but longer handles are much

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.650 
your back but longer handles are much
better<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.879> think<00:00:47.910> about<00:00:48.120> raking<00:00:48.629> your

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
better if you think about raking your

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.779 
better if you think about raking your
leaves<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.410> don't<00:00:49.590> get<00:00:49.710> down<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.950> our<00:00:50.489> hands

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
leaves we don't get down on our hands

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.100 
leaves we don't get down on our hands
and<00:00:50.940> knees<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.239> start<00:00:51.449> raking<00:00:51.600> leaves<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
and knees to start raking leaves in the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.680 
and knees to start raking leaves in the
fall<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.649> long<00:00:52.980> handled<00:00:53.550> rakes<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.420> if

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
fall we have long handled rakes so if

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.170 
fall we have long handled rakes so if
you<00:00:54.840> use<00:00:55.050> long<00:00:55.410> handled<00:00:55.980> garden<00:00:56.460> tools<00:00:56.730> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
you use long handled garden tools to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.360 
you use long handled garden tools to
weed<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.289> aerate<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.920> soil

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
weed and to aerate the soil

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:32.109 
weed and to aerate the soil
it's<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.120> herb<00:01:00.359> anomoly<00:01:01.050> much<00:01:01.410> better

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.060 

so<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.840> great<00:01:33.020> thing<00:01:33.049> about<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.500> long<00:01:33.649> handed

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
so the great thing about the long handed

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.950 
so the great thing about the long handed
garden<00:01:34.549> tools<00:01:34.820> is<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.149> you<00:01:35.210> can<00:01:35.360> really<00:01:35.600> get

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
garden tools is that you can really get

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.770 
garden tools is that you can really get
in<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:36.619> do<00:01:37.610> what<00:01:37.759> you<00:01:37.880> need<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.210> do<00:01:38.390> in<00:01:38.720> your

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
in and do what you need to do in your

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.789 
in and do what you need to do in your
garden<00:01:39.110> in<00:01:39.799> small<00:01:40.700> spaces<00:01:41.049> so<00:01:42.049> for<00:01:42.259> example<00:01:42.680> if

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
garden in small spaces so for example if

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.859 
garden in small spaces so for example if
I<00:01:42.890> need<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.189> get<00:01:43.280> in<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.549> garden<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.750> know<00:01:44.840> I

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
I need to get in the garden you know I

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.840 
I need to get in the garden you know I
don't<00:01:45.140> have<00:01:45.289> to<00:01:45.470> bend<00:01:45.740> down<00:01:46.009> it's<00:01:46.640> very

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
don't have to bend down it's very

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.969 
don't have to bend down it's very
similar<00:01:47.180> motion<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:47.750> what<00:01:47.899> you'd<00:01:48.049> use<00:01:48.080> put<00:01:48.890> up

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
similar motion to what you'd use put up

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.880 
similar motion to what you'd use put up
with<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.159> rake<00:01:50.229> look<00:01:51.229> how<00:01:51.350> I<00:01:51.380> can<00:01:51.500> get<00:01:51.710> right

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
with a rake look how I can get right

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.090 
with a rake look how I can get right
around<00:01:52.039> right<00:01:52.610> in<00:01:53.270> there<00:01:53.679> with<00:01:54.679> these<00:01:54.829> long

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
around right in there with these long

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.179 
around right in there with these long
handed<00:01:55.549> tools<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.740> depending<00:01:57.740> on<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:57.979> type

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
handed tools and depending on the type

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.100 
handed tools and depending on the type
of<00:01:58.399> tool<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:58.850> use<00:01:59.119> so<00:01:59.299> this<00:01:59.450> is<00:01:59.570> a<00:01:59.600> collinear

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
of tool you use so this is a collinear

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.230 
of tool you use so this is a collinear
hoe<00:02:03.220> it's<00:02:04.220> great<00:02:04.549> because<00:02:04.729> you<00:02:04.819> don't<00:02:04.909> have<00:02:05.090> to

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
hoe it's great because you don't have to

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.400 
hoe it's great because you don't have to
bend<00:02:05.479> down<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.909> that's<00:02:08.060> just<00:02:08.269> such<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.479> it's

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
bend down and that's just such a it's

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.759 
bend down and that's just such a it's
such<00:02:09.649> an<00:02:09.830> advantage<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.789> be<00:02:10.910> able<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.360> use

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
such an advantage to be able to use

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.140 
such an advantage to be able to use
tools<00:02:12.769> where<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.100> don't<00:02:13.400> have<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.640> get<00:02:13.970> down

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
tools where you don't have to get down

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.559 
tools where you don't have to get down
on<00:02:14.390> your<00:02:14.480> hands<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.900> knees<00:02:16.180> get<00:02:17.180> right<00:02:17.390> in

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
on your hands and knees get right in

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.759 
on your hands and knees get right in
around<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.950> F<00:02:19.130> scroll<00:02:20.290> just<00:02:21.290> really<00:02:21.560> get

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
around the F scroll just really get

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.330 
around the F scroll just really get
those<00:02:21.950> reeds<00:02:22.340> out<00:02:22.900> sort<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:23.959> a<00:02:24.340> push-pull

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
those reeds out sort of a push-pull

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.390 
those reeds out sort of a push-pull
motion<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.260> other<00:02:27.410> type<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.709> hoe<00:02:28.010> that's

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
motion so the other type of hoe that's

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.670 
motion so the other type of hoe that's
really<00:02:28.700> cool<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.120> stirrup<00:02:29.599> hoe<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:30.530> what

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
really cool is the stirrup hoe and what

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.380 
really cool is the stirrup hoe and what
this<00:02:30.830> does<00:02:31.099> is<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.459> basically<00:02:31.610> just<00:02:31.910> touch

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
this does is it basically just touch

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.470 
this does is it basically just touch
these<00:02:32.690> weeds<00:02:32.959> right<00:02:33.319> down<00:02:34.000> so<00:02:35.000> here<00:02:35.239> you<00:02:35.360> can

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
these weeds right down so here you can

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.800 
these weeds right down so here you can
just<00:02:35.660> cut<00:02:35.930> those<00:02:36.140> weeds<00:02:37.329> right<00:02:38.329> and<00:02:38.570> the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
just cut those weeds right and the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.160 
just cut those weeds right and the
throat

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.710 

so<00:02:46.680> we<00:02:47.100> were<00:02:47.220> in<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.430> garden<00:02:47.610> earlier<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.450> now

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
so we were in the garden earlier and now

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.610 
so we were in the garden earlier and now
this<00:02:48.930> area

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
this area

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.559 
this area
I<00:02:49.650> call<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.130> my<00:02:50.280> Zen<00:02:50.520> garden<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.060> what<00:02:51.150> happens

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
I call it my Zen garden and what happens

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.090 
I call it my Zen garden and what happens
to<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.140> weeds<00:02:52.410> start<00:02:52.740> coming

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
to this is the weeds start coming

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.770 
to this is the weeds start coming
through<00:02:53.130> actually<00:02:54.090> some<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.390> plants

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
through actually some of the plants

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.780 
through actually some of the plants
start<00:02:55.020> growing<00:02:55.290> back<00:02:55.319> through<00:02:55.740> so<00:02:56.370> if<00:02:56.610> you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
start growing back through so if you

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.910 
start growing back through so if you
take<00:02:57.060> something<00:02:57.450> like<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.600> stirrup<00:02:58.080> hoe<00:02:58.110> you

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
take something like a stirrup hoe you

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.949 
take something like a stirrup hoe you
can<00:02:59.130> actually<00:02:59.790> on<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.180> push<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.780> pull

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
can actually on the push and the pull

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.500 
can actually on the push and the pull
motion<00:03:01.800> it's<00:03:02.010> really<00:03:02.400> fast<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:02.880> look<00:03:03.300> at<00:03:03.390> this

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
motion it's really fast so look at this

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.660 
motion it's really fast so look at this
little<00:03:03.750> area<00:03:03.990> here<00:03:04.140> see<00:03:04.530> how<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.650> weeds<00:03:05.310> and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
little area here see how the weeds and

little area here see how the weeds and
the<00:03:05.820> this<00:03:06.209> is<00:03:06.330> actually<00:03:06.480> sweet<00:03:06.930> woodruff<00:03:07.140> see

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
the this is actually sweet woodruff see

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
different tools that can get into tight

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.310 
different tools that can get into tight
spaces<00:04:42.770> now<00:04:43.580> this<00:04:43.820> is<00:04:44.030> you<00:04:44.570> know<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.720> perennial

I'll show you here in the vegetable
garden<00:04:51.010> how<00:04:52.010> easy<00:04:52.400> this<00:04:52.850> is<00:04:52.910> so<00:04:53.300> here's<00:04:53.570> a

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
garden how easy this is so here's a

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.629 
garden how easy this is so here's a
couple<00:04:53.870> of<00:04:54.050> rows<00:04:54.260> of<00:04:54.440> onions<00:04:54.919> and<00:04:55.250> this<00:04:55.490> is

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
couple of rows of onions and this is

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.129 
couple of rows of onions and this is
tight<00:04:55.880> so<00:04:56.150> this<00:04:56.510> would<00:04:56.630> be<00:04:56.690> very<00:04:56.870> difficult

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
tight so this would be very difficult

couple of different shapes for different

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.700 
couple of different shapes for different
uses<00:05:55.540> if<00:05:56.540> you<00:05:56.660> have<00:05:56.780> a<00:05:56.810> really<00:05:57.170> tight<00:05:57.380> space

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
uses if you have a really tight space

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.710 
uses if you have a really tight space
than<00:05:58.040> a<00:05:58.070> smaller<00:05:58.460> blade<00:05:58.850> would<00:05:59.180> be<00:05:59.330> better<00:05:59.510> if

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
than a smaller blade would be better if

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.910 
than a smaller blade would be better if
you<00:05:59.780> have<00:05:59.930> a<00:05:59.990> bigger<00:06:00.230> garden<00:06:00.470> perhaps<00:06:00.800> you

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:00.920 
you have a bigger garden perhaps you

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.160 
you have a bigger garden perhaps you
want<00:06:01.070> a<00:06:01.100> little<00:06:01.280> bigger<00:06:01.490> blade<00:06:01.790> so<00:06:02.750> I<00:06:02.780> got

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170 
want a little bigger blade so I got

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.600
