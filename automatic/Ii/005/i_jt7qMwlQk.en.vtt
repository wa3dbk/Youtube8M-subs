00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
time he tried a different tactic but it

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.630 
time he tried a different tactic but it
still<00:01:55.390> wasn't<00:01:55.659> successful<00:01:56.409> DS<00:01:56.920> lyst<00:01:57.250> student

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
still wasn't successful DS lyst student

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.700 
still wasn't successful DS lyst student
right<00:01:57.820> there<00:01:58.119> at<00:01:58.299> Georgia<00:01:58.750> Tech<00:01:58.780> which<00:01:59.560> he

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
right there at Georgia Tech which he

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.710 
right there at Georgia Tech which he
graduated<00:01:59.830> from<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.909> mechanical

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
graduated from and mechanical

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.510 
graduated from and mechanical
engineering<00:02:02.200> he<00:02:02.590> used<00:02:02.830> his<00:02:02.950> mechanical

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
engineering he used his mechanical

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.100 
engineering he used his mechanical
engineering<00:02:03.909> degree<00:02:04.090> said<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.659> study<00:02:04.899> his

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
engineering degree said to study his

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.840 
engineering degree said to study his
efficiency<00:02:05.560> on<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.920> hurdles<00:02:06.250> was<00:02:06.670> one

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
efficiency on the hurdles was one

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.090 
efficiency on the hurdles was one
project<00:02:07.330> he<00:02:07.420> took<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.750> class

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.730 

look<00:02:11.700> at<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.940> margin<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.480> victory

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
look at that margin of victory

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.310 
look at that margin of victory
approximately<00:02:13.740> six<00:02:14.310> inches<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:15.180> victory<00:02:16.110> by

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
approximately six inches a victory by

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.900 
approximately six inches a victory by
Adkins<00:02:16.940> over<00:02:17.940> sanitation<00:02:18.780> or<00:02:19.070> mortgage<00:02:20.070> it

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
Adkins over sanitation or mortgage it

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.000 
Adkins over sanitation or mortgage it
translates<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.840> four<00:02:22.140> one-hundredths<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.830> a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
translates to four one-hundredths of a

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.670 
translates to four one-hundredths of a
second<00:02:23.430> Derrick<00:02:23.970> dad<00:02:24.150> can<00:02:24.390> takes<00:02:24.690> fellow<00:02:25.350> work

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
second Derrick dad can takes fellow work

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.160 
second Derrick dad can takes fellow work
last<00:02:26.010> are<00:02:26.280> sama<00:02:26.700> Tay<00:02:26.940> Tay

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
last are sama Tay Tay

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.720 
last are sama Tay Tay
well<00:02:28.770> Derek<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:29.160> got<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.370> be<00:02:29.430> happy<00:02:29.550> about

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
well Derek you got to be happy about

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.060 
well Derek you got to be happy about
