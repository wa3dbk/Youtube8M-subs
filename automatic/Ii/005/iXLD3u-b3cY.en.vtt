00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:17.279
 March 24 or poplar 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:22.769
 a few days ago took shelter 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.859
 from fig bushes like this, they are now 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.060
 look 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.340
 after after opening by the way now you 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.440
 you see 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:40.230
 fragment from last year's video 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.950
 here you see how I prepared the bushes for 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.780
 shelter 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:51.829
 see jumping lil their metal 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:55.620
 hooks hooks bushes opened 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:59.640
 hooks pulled out of the ground that is freed 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.000
 victory and naturally forced 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.909
 more they will not align in what 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.670
 they are in the floor right now 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:16.820
 bowed like that i will leave them to 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.820
 they have already grown shoots 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.560
 I planted these bushes vertically not like 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.179
 some advise 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:31.649
 tilted but as you can see after 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:34.929
 preparing and sheltering their bushes 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.960
 remained semi tilted position 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:40.390
 after the shelters removed that is practically 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.469
 I came to the same version 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.119
 end up 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:46.710
 as when landing under the slope and there and 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.689
 there 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:59.259
 achieve inclined shoots 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:02:03.549
 for let's say for more for more 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.880
 convenience during the shelter but still this is not 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.119
 run upright 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.700
 allows more convenient 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.610
 cover the bushes that she want this year 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.959
 do that is cover them with spunbond 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.209
 for some time to happen 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:28.170
 large cumulation 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:32.170
 heat and shoots began to grow faster 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.850
 so that the kidneys wake up quicker that is 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.420
 speed up 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.420
 the end result is ripening 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.599
 but the process of shelter with spanbond or 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:51.260
 lutrasil as it is also called 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.260
 results 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:00.049
 I will publish in the next video happy 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.049
 good luck and good yields
