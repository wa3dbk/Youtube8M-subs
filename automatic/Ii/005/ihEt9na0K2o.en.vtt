00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:10.829
 how about friends or are we wrong 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.739
 and well I bring this video to teach them 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:17.159
 the how to know if our ram memory is damaged 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:21.089
 there are some symptoms when this happens is when we have in your system 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.599
 blue screenshots 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.360
 in it not remission the system does not start 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.949
 or it reboots itself 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.430
 the are some symptoms when we think that our ram memory can be 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.360
 the store is eroding this problem and good a very simple way 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.990
 to know if this is 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.010
 I'm making a gesture and well let's download 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.830
 what is the memory test program four points and this is the newest version 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.620
 for this we are not was the description of the video 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.260
 He explained that leaving the indre of downloads will be by MarÃ­a pallier 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.080
 and less simply we are going to click to download them 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.110
 once done this will not stay a weird like this 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.340
 you know right click will extract kick and breasts will download an image 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.660
 guy did 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.540
 with which we are going to 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.450
 when closing in uci 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.170
 because this one will be guti speak 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.420
 what we are going to do once we have recorded it to people who do not 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.450
 know how you click on it 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.300
 quevedo that explained how to do it and well let's put in our unit 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.170
 citi 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.350
 the disc that we just learned to record with the iso image and we're going to 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.939
 program the bios to start it is to say as if we were 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.800
 The operating system 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.020
 once you start this month you will open a window how are you 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.320
 where your identity will start here is not unknown the percentage they carry 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.230
 same as what is the text here will indicate us the 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.340
 memory competition that we have in this case that seems 128 megs of ram 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.120
 obviously it is not 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.120
 it's not my computer's just an example for what 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.870
 here we have the time it takes to scan other states and good 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.160
 that was the number of afp processes and is that if I saw you 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.639
 two parties two lives the number of spectators you may have 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:18.369
 once they conclude in this part of activists for what happened 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:22.439
 will not leave the detailed report of the errors that showed true that the 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.409
 faithful 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.620
 following this afternoon the Iraqis the process been completed by percent the 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.189
 number of errors we have 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.549
 we do not have mistakes 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.599
 and possibly we're going to present the stubborn escape key to get out of 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.549
 what is the program 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.429
 of the text though 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:43.059
 and good in this simple way 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:47.699
 let's know yes and no if our ram memory is the one that is damaged and if 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.660
 It is not like that and well, well, you can discard it 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.590
 i the reverends this Monday the problem of the bonds we are having our 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.879
 current system 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.499
 is a very good tool that will be very useful and well, that's 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:06.010
 it would be all toms subtraction more to say is that they stay long comment their 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.290
 vivaces any doubt or comment at least to see here the channel tyc raffle 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.590
 uasd we are in touch until the next video
