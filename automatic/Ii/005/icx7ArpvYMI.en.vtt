Hi, I'm a photojournalist for the "Sipa Press" agency.

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:21.609
I cover news and politics.

00:00:22.484 --> 00:00:26.899
Many social photos too, street protests...

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.801
...and I work for magazines.

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:35.537
I have realised that when you start shooting people with a professional camera,

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:40.238
there is a kind of aggression because of the size of the equipment.

00:00:40.568 --> 00:00:44.054
I realised that with the X20 it was a lot better. 

00:00:44.752 --> 00:00:47.676
People are much more accepting of the fact that they are being photographed. 

00:00:49.723 --> 00:00:52.470
The X30 is slightly larger than the X20

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:55.427
Big changes have occurred,

00:00:56.202 --> 00:00:58.751
I think it is ergonomically better than the X20.

00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:02.635
the buttons are better positioned to change the camera settings.

00:01:03.454 --> 00:01:08.073
 With the same sensor, the JPG image processing is a lot better

00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:12.391
Better definition, better image sharpness with the X30.

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.640
You can easily work at ISO 1600 without noise.

00:01:17.206 --> 00:01:23.092
The speed of the camera is very good.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.761
I use RAW + JPG which requires huge resource for the camera.

00:01:29.894 --> 00:01:33.838
The battery life has been improved over the X20, 

00:01:34.224 --> 00:01:38.796
you can take 350 pictures without worrying about the battery...

00:01:39.234 --> 00:01:45.475
There are also some nice new features, like the EVF.

00:01:46.082 --> 00:01:53.764
This means that, when you look through the viewfinder,
you can now see 100% of the picture.

00:01:54.393 --> 00:02:00.480
You see the final composition, and this is a big improvement.  

00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:05.967
The rear screen is larger and has an interesting feature :

00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:13.188
you can unfold it and put it in  90 degrees position,

00:02:13.885 --> 00:02:17.320
which allows you to work in an unobtrusive way.

00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:24.080
Plus, it is really good for taking low-angle shots with the camera on the floor.

00:02:25.704 --> 00:02:32.163
Regarding the new function of the ring, there are two rings : the existing one,
already featured on X20 : ON / OFF and to use the zoom.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.138
  Closer to the camera, there is a new ring : by turning it,
it changes the aperture for example

00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:43.551
And, when reviewing your pictures on the rear screen, you can enlarge
pictures  with the ring.

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:45.624
It's very convenient.

00:02:47.802 --> 00:02:50.740
What I like in the WiFi feature, is that I am able to transfer my pictures very quickly.

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:54.438
If I'm in the street and an event is happening right in front of me,

00:02:54.372 --> 00:02:58.639
I can transfer images to my smartphone and send them directly to the agency.

00:02:59.202 --> 00:03:03.720
I have not tested the "Time Lapse" feature yet but it is very interesting,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.840
I still have in mind to idea of shooting a building or a landscape with a drone,

00:03:09.377 --> 00:03:12.877
it is a very nice feature.

00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:17.179
Keep shooting with the X30 ? With great pleasure ! It would be a joy! 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:19.578
Cheers, thank you.
