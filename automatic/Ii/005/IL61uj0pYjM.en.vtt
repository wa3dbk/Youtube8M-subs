00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.869
 very good the time is not the same as always 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:15.399
 we always are 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:16.990
 talking about health 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.710
 glances 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.390
 many extreme cases 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.220
 we trust coasts 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.220
 what do we do a lot like that 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.449
 and come have virginia 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.180
 these artists and people who want 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.330
 its part of the time of the discs that desired success 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.470
 It was me 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.470
 and it has been growing in your body 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.640
 the truth I feel 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.340
 in April 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.340
 maybe we do not arrive 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.350
 I think there are many things physically 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.350
 we look a lot like each other 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.650
 same 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.549
 ee 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.420
 the performance 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.420
 many things as it seems you have to have different personality 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.570
 but if we are always 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.080
 the same style that we have seen to see things 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.420
 we like the same things and we go shopping separately 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.600
 almost always others have to do with each other 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.710
 we get along very well in general with people 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.130
 we started doing it 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.640
 as a very sociable person we are takeoff 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.480
 -moderator makes use 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.720
 I would like to see with people in general 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.350
 she has 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.900
 whether it's a stronger character 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.330
 that maybe it is also related to her 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.620
 I am a little softer maybe more 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.630
 the inter 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.630
 it gets stronger than before but still 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
 but not for two-legged rats 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.710
 as an artist 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.130
 in force because they have filizzola would be affected of this race 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.200
 because the Chiquitaje decided it and wanted to be an artist 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:12.829
 and until he succeeded 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.549
 and the truth 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.839
 if there is a destination website 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.419
 after 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.119
 many people do not realize the Andes and 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:24.469
 the artist 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.940
 you really care a lot more very difficult schedules 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.969
 cold 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.969
 juncal loor 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.969
 without eating because football is like that 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:39.949
 or any kind of decent work and it's not like that 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:41.879
 is that it is enough 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.139
 in order as 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.509
 very close 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.139
 the science magazine 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.319
 this 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.369
 vincent has said I liked them good or as an artist and as the Japanese 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:59.029
 the meeting 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.099
 she is very attentive always 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.699
 what happens to me that by the way we do not have so close the tasks 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.109
 the province 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.329
 last June 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.789
 it was a party 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:13.109
 I wanted to say four days after act 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.950
 it seems to me very surely it will be then the swans 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.049
 he has said a lot of nonsense 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.089
 On the other hand, if you can 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:29.839
 a very complicated moment very difficult because 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:32.029
 for the theme of the decline 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:33.399
 for the theme of 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.139
 for the population in a worse situation 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.680
 how are we in the freezer 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.680
 reported that current levels 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.499
 but when there was nobody 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:47.499
 with lots of love 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:51.429
 we think 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:52.799
 17 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.179
 for this Saturday is far from the landscaped areas and 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:58.609
 Russia and Venezuela 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.540
 no more no less 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.359
 factors that are 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.029
 indicated that in this regard
