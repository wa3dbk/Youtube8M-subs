00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello good to all, how is it? 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.810
 today I bring you the most aunts and runes of the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.250
 costal and as requested by a subscriber 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.050
 as you can see we are going to talk 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.639
 a little bit of the last champion that has 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.280
 taken river from the last champion who has 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.480
 come to the fields of justice and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.520
 well let's talk a little bit about him 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.140
 a character that is vi I have seen it not 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.640
 game the player only once with him what 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.439
 I've seen a lot and I think it has 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.529
 potential to be used competitively 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.930
 because it has a lot much cc a lot 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.789
 pretty hurt i like to read is very good 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.619
 well used you are very good and it is the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.809
 Real year is going to be very much 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.149
 a lot of play with this character so 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.710
 nothing I comment more trias as you see 21 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.480
 attack 9 in defense and the runes are 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.219
 pretty pretty standard for a mid 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.989
 so we started with the attack we're going to 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.120
 put double-edged sword because to be 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.180
 a distance champion let's make a 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.160
 group plus 51 5% additional damage added 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.170
 this to the real damage and everything else goes 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.640
 to do we are going to make havoc and attack 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 to the weak point because it attacks the point 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.289
 weak because it's really based a lot on 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.670
 throw spells when we hit 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.020
 someone with a success for example with the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.030
 study with the ball of this pulling and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.280
 goes to different sides when we have 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.510
 to someone the following attacks on this 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.130
 enemy will increase 1% 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.710
 our whole group therefore goes very 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.600
 very very well let's put three points 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.610
 in witchcraft three in fundamental 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.580
 one closest to have more or less 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.200
 gives in to have that cooling strength 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.740
 mental and arcane beast to have more 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.240
 hurt 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.160
 together with archi magician that is also for 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.750
 have more damage executor and play 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.790
 dangerous to do more damage underneath 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.560
 50% of life this will go very well 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.060
 with we have the last one apart game 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.060
 dangerous to kill an enemy that does not 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.560
 he reverted garden life and they're going to listen 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.940
 what anna to do harm with the others 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.970
 basic costumes of power open to that 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.250
 we have devastating blows and ravages 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.350
 to do more damage too and for part 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.360
 of defense we have the following 12 in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.400
 block an unbreakable to deny damage 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.500
 recovery for life regeneration 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.240
 a 3 of veteran's sad physics for 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.280
 More life and 1 onslaught of arrival for 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.020
 more video also for the part of the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.670
 more grandstands that we have down here 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.340
 we have red magic penetration 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.380
 yellow is the blue armor of 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.600
 magical resistance and fifth essences of 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.400
 ability power with this is pretty 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.710
 standard and we will do we will get a lot 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.420
 added damage attacks these of 21 attack 9 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.649
 defense we are also going to wreak havoc and 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.280
 put more people 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.569
 you are the masters and queens of baby 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.319
 but that you liked the video already 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.319
 until next time
