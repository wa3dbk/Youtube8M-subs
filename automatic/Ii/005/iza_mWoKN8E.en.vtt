00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.819
 Hello everyone, today we are again visiting 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.919
 company back to back 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.110
 I again want to tell Asher on verification 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.920
 this time it will be the firm's screwdriver 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.610
 grammy 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.610
 The model is quite famous gsr 10.8 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:26.640
 complete sets this complete set 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.890
 is the maximum such box 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.540
 plastic let's open let's see 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:40.070
 that here we have well firstly it 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:43.050
 screwdriver itself two batteries 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:50.160
 batteries in this configuration by 2 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:54.140
 amp hour charger still 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.070
 such a nice addition here holster with 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.070
 fastening on the belt 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.450
 let's take a little look myself 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.939
 Screwdriver Screwdriver very light very 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.630
 cool in the hand 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.610
 has a balance tell me how in model 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.960
 1440 there is no such thing that he is ahead 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.790
 fails here not so more like 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.530
 whole tone with less than a kilogram something 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.780
 about 900 50 grams in my opinion 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.780
 Modelka documents all rubberized as 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.590
 see the handle also me from soft 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.450
 rubber very comfortable start 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.120
 what are you doing out of it here 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.950
 such is the battery indicator 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.400
 charge battery backlight diode working 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.190
 zones 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.590
 very light batteries are enough 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.850
 Now nice little bit of himself at 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.630
 characteristics of this screwdriver 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.270
 has 2 speeds 1 speed up to 400 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.759
 turns 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.759
 2 to 1300 I think that's enough 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.570
 standard power solution 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.160
 power of this screwdrivers 30 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.540
 newton meters it's the same as on 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.500
 model 1440 that is, I, too, on her 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.120
 did a review can watch it 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:33.830
 Well, here the weight certainly makes itself felt 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:36.220
 screwdriver made in malaysia thought 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.220
 it is seen 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.030
 what else from the good let's say so from 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.190
 working this keyless chuck i 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.970
 I find it quite comfortable here with us 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.970
 no backlash 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.989
 i.e. nothing backlash 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.580
 very nice that on such kids all 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:09.390
 very high quality made holster i 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.370
 I think it will be very useful because 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.950
 With such a weight, the screw driver is not a 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:22.829
 pulls you pants into it so my personal 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:24.849
 view also has two speeds and 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:29.920
 ratchet for tightening 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:33.489
 brushing screws with 3 brush has 20 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.450
 provisions and a separate provision for 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:40.540
 drilling will be very convenient such that 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.920
 do you power there assemble furniture work by 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.950
 house in some let's say not execute 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.139
 especially large amounts of work due to 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.880
 such from weight all the same convenient even 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:55.540
 will use it 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:59.130
 let's say woman because shepard 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.359
 it is not enough that it is comfortable enough and 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.510
 manufacturer but he is also quite so 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:07.540
 cute after all we know what 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.630
 cute is not always a good well, it's time for 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.599
 the parameters are very even 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.040
 impressive by the way i want to say let's say 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.220
 contact the owner of this 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.840
 screwdriver would love to hear 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:27.750
 your comments about his work 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.750
 its reliability 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.540
 would still like to show you one more 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:41.410
 complete set of this 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:46.590
 This screwdriver is inserted it is not 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.590
 less cute such a suitcase 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.440
 it's packed so that's enough 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.680
 interesting 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.169
 stuck on such stickies 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.080
 fixed very securely has a very 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.120
 low weight very small volume 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.120
 occupies that is to eat that is very 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.710
 so useful 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.810
 let's say so for useful properties because 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.480
 what for example if you constantly 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.870
 carry a screwdriver no matter in the car 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.220
 or somewhere else on his 8th cottage 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.110
 drying it would be nicer to have here 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:25.030
 such a small bag than this 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:29.740
 a large small suitcase still from pleasant to 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:34.660
 this in this set we have such here 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.620
 sets is a set of all kinds of bits and 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.130
 set verified 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:46.960
 wood drill bit there is a cretin set 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:52.120
 right now I will show it to you 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:54.970
 metal checked the only significant 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.919
 the difference of this set I consider it 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.860
 battery capacity is not one and a half 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:02.020
 ampere hours in general, too, such 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.180
 battery and a half ampere hour you 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:10.570
 I think that's enough for such 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:14.169
 long-term operation in general, I have 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:18.690
 According to the model Kim I really want 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:22.950
 hear exactly the opinion of the owners 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:26.950
 would tell what he represents himself 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:29.380
 how good they are in general 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.940
 all all happily subscribe to my 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.940
