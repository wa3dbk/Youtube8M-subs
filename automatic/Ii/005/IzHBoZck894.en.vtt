any ground planting it now one way you
can<00:02:52.690> help<00:02:52.900> protect<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.800> is<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.970> plant<00:02:55.390> it

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
can help protect it is to plant it

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.550 
can help protect it is to plant it
correct<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.130> then<00:02:57.610> surround<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:59.080> and<00:02:59.200> how<00:02:59.500> you

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
correct and then surround it and how you

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.050 
correct and then surround it and how you
can<00:02:59.709> surround<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.580> is<00:03:00.730> with<00:03:01.180> these<00:03:03.060> now

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
can surround it is with these now

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.900 
can surround it is with these now
originally<00:03:04.840> called<00:03:05.380> wells<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.340> water<00:03:06.580> and

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
originally called wells of water and

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.790 
originally called wells of water and
there's<00:03:07.209> companies<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:08.050> think<00:03:08.080> a<00:03:08.350> company<00:03:08.590> that

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
there's companies I think a company that

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.570 
there's companies I think a company that
still<00:03:09.040> does

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
still does

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.520 
still does
I<00:03:09.760> mean<00:03:10.150> actually<00:03:10.570> makes<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.989> walls<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.410> water

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
I mean actually makes the walls of water

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.740 
I mean actually makes the walls of water
now<00:03:11.950> they're<00:03:12.280> called<00:03:12.640> what<00:03:13.390> was<00:03:13.570> this<00:03:13.690> called

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
now they're called what was this called

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.370 
now they're called what was this called
again<00:03:14.110> Mission<00:03:14.709> Bay<00:03:15.840> yeah<00:03:16.840> I've<00:03:17.140> always

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
again Mission Bay yeah I've always

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.250 
again Mission Bay yeah I've always
called<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:18.070> wall<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.459> water<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:18.820> keep<00:03:19.260> it's

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
called it wall of water I keep it's

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.410 
called it wall of water I keep it's
called<00:03:20.530> it's<00:03:20.890> called<00:03:21.150> garden<00:03:23.910> tuck<00:03:24.910> it<00:03:25.060> in<00:03:25.209> or

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
called it's called garden tuck it in or

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.479 
called it's called garden tuck it in or
something<00:03:25.480> like<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.590> forgot<00:03:27.010> what<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.340> is

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
something like that I forgot what it is

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.090 
something like that I forgot what it is
essentially<00:03:28.420> it's<00:03:28.570> a<00:03:28.660> wall<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:29.140> water<00:03:29.320> it<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.860> a

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
essentially it's a wall of water it is a

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.000 
essentially it's a wall of water it is a
plastic<00:03:30.910> material<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:31.450> goes<00:03:31.750> around<00:03:32.140> there

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
plastic material that goes around there

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.820 
plastic material that goes around there
they're<00:03:33.459> made<00:03:33.820> out<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:34.030> these<00:03:34.269> columns<00:03:35.110> that

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
they're made out of these columns that

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.180 
they're made out of these columns that
are<00:03:36.130> glued<00:03:36.670> together<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:38.350> fill<00:03:38.739> these<00:03:39.130> up

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
are glued together and you fill these up

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.030 
are glued together and you fill these up
with<00:03:39.970> water<00:03:40.420> let<00:03:41.019> me<00:03:41.200> show<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.530> very<00:03:41.950> quickly

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
with water let me show you very quickly

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.960 
with water let me show you very quickly
how<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.610> do<00:03:42.910> that<00:03:43.829> that<00:03:44.829> fills<00:03:45.100> up<00:03:45.280> with<00:03:45.340> water

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
how to do that that fills up with water

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.180 
how to do that that fills up with water
and<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.870> whole<00:03:47.110> reason<00:03:47.860> is<00:03:48.070> is<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:50.190> when

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
and the whole reason is is that when

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.670 
and the whole reason is is that when
these<00:03:51.370> during<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.209> daylight<00:03:52.660> hours<00:03:53.230> the

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
these during the daylight hours the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
these during the daylight hours the
water<00:03:53.980> actually<00:03:54.340> warms<00:03:55.150> up<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:57.220> keeps

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
water actually warms up and it keeps

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.250 
water actually warms up and it keeps
your<00:03:57.940> tomato<00:03:58.420> plant<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:59.049> tad<00:03:59.560> bit<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.630> bit<00:04:01.630> warmer

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
your tomato plant a tad bit a bit warmer

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.210 
your tomato plant a tad bit a bit warmer
during<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.400> nighttime<00:04:04.350> also<00:04:05.350> it<00:04:05.560> protects<00:04:06.010> it

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
during the nighttime also it protects it

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.350 
during the nighttime also it protects it
from<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:07.720> cold<00:04:08.019> winds

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
from the cold winds

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.480 
from the cold winds
and<00:04:09.870> just<00:04:10.440> keeps<00:04:10.710> it<00:04:10.860> kind<00:04:11.070> of<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.370> a

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
and just keeps it kind of in a

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.420 
and just keeps it kind of in a
greenhouse<00:04:12.180> effect<00:04:12.710> type<00:04:13.710> of<00:04:14.240> environment<00:04:15.240> so

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
greenhouse effect type of environment so

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.759 
greenhouse effect type of environment so
so<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.640> cooks<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.209> want<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.570> say<00:04:18.780> your<00:04:19.200> tomatoes

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
so it cooks I want to say your tomatoes

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.780 
so it cooks I want to say your tomatoes
get<00:04:20.160> cooked<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:21.000> with<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:21.900> warmth<00:04:22.500> it

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
get cooked and with that warmth it

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.510 
get cooked and with that warmth it
really<00:04:23.790> starts<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.450> grow<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:24.990> this<00:04:25.740> does<00:04:26.220> I

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
really starts to grow and this does I

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.630 
really starts to grow and this does I
must<00:04:27.000> say<00:04:27.240> really<00:04:27.930> makes<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.890> difference<00:04:28.920> if

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
must say really makes a difference if

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.130 
must say really makes a difference if
you<00:04:29.880> want<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.330> thick<00:04:31.230> tomato<00:04:32.360> so<00:04:33.360> it<00:04:33.930> goes

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
you want a thick tomato so it goes

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.750 
you want a thick tomato so it goes
something<00:04:34.410> like<00:04:34.560> this<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:35.100> trick<00:04:35.400> on<00:04:35.580> these

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
something like this the trick on these

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.500 
something like this the trick on these
by<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.030> way<00:04:36.180> is<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:38.220> make<00:04:38.400> sure<00:04:38.430> that<00:04:38.910> all<00:04:39.210> the

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
by the way is to make sure that all the

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.170 
by the way is to make sure that all the
cells<00:04:39.840> get<00:04:40.140> filled<00:04:40.470> up<00:04:40.770> sometimes<00:04:41.730> it's<00:04:42.030> easy

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
cells get filled up sometimes it's easy

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.010 
cells get filled up sometimes it's easy
to<00:04:42.300> miss<00:04:42.660> it<00:04:42.840> sell<00:04:43.880> let<00:04:44.880> me<00:04:45.060> show<00:04:45.330> you<00:04:45.390> -<00:04:45.810> also

to miss it sell let me show you - also

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.650 
to miss it sell let me show you - also
what<00:04:46.410> happens<00:04:46.920> and<00:04:47.400> when<00:04:47.670> you<00:04:47.850> get<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.090> threat
