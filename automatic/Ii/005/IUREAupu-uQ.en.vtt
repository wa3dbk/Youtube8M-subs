two<00:02:47.030> pairs<00:02:47.360> like<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:47.780> said<00:02:48.080> where<00:02:49.090> they<00:02:50.090> look

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
two pairs like I said where they look

two pairs like I said where they look
like<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.690> same<00:02:50.930> from<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.410> company<00:02:51.860> from<00:02:52.280> one

like the same from the company from one
company<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.210> next<00:02:53.600> but<00:02:53.750> when<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:53.960> get

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
company to the next but when you get

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.370 
company to the next but when you get
them<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:55.220> can<00:02:55.400> see<00:02:55.640> that<00:02:55.670> these<00:02:56.030> ones<00:02:56.390> the

them you can see that these ones the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.320 
them you can see that these ones the
curvature<00:02:58.070> is<00:02:58.400> pretty<00:02:58.790> good

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
curvature is pretty good

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.900 
curvature is pretty good
I've<00:02:59.420> seen<00:02:59.810> some<00:03:00.320> pairs<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:01.100> look<00:03:01.310> just<00:03:01.610> like

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
I've seen some pairs that look just like

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.500 
I've seen some pairs that look just like
this<00:03:02.300> that<00:03:03.080> come<00:03:03.410> out<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.950> go<00:03:04.550> 90<00:03:05.000> degree<00:03:05.330> in

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
this that come out and go 90 degree in

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.840 
this that come out and go 90 degree in
the<00:03:05.660> spice<00:03:06.020> instead<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.650> angling<00:03:07.010> down<00:03:07.310> in

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
the spice instead of angling down in

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.320 
the spice instead of angling down in
this<00:03:08.840> angle<00:03:09.380> they're<00:03:09.980> angling<00:03:10.490> straight<00:03:11.030> down

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
this angle they're angling straight down

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.360 
this angle they're angling straight down
and<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:11.900> makes<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.290> really<00:03:12.440> hard<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:13.130> they're

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
and it makes it really hard and they're

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.979 
and it makes it really hard and they're
just<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.640> little<00:03:13.880> cheap<00:03:14.060> made<00:03:14.330> they<00:03:14.600> look<00:03:14.840> about

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
just a little cheap made they look about

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.890 
just a little cheap made they look about
the<00:03:15.140> same<00:03:15.590> but<00:03:15.800> I<00:03:15.890> found<00:03:16.160> that<00:03:16.370> these<00:03:16.580> ones<00:03:16.970> the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
the same but I found that these ones the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.560 
the same but I found that these ones the
claws<00:03:18.170> are<00:03:18.410> in<00:03:18.560> pretty<00:03:18.830> securely<00:03:19.310> I've<00:03:20.270> never

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570

had them come out or any problems with
them<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:23.540> angle<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.230> points<00:03:24.560> which

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
them in the angle and the points which

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.050 
them in the angle and the points which
they<00:03:24.860> are<00:03:25.040> I've<00:03:25.220> actually<00:03:25.400> been<00:03:25.730> able<00:03:25.910> to

that are short and they don't tie and

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.650 
that are short and they don't tie and
you<00:04:40.370> just<00:04:40.550> time<00:04:40.850> around<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.240> top<00:04:41.479> of<00:04:41.510> your

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
you just time around the top of your

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.930 
you just time around the top of your
foot<00:04:41.930> they<00:04:42.110> slide<00:04:42.440> off<00:04:42.470> so<00:04:43.010> I've<00:04:43.550> gotten

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
foot they slide off so I've gotten

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.540 
foot they slide off so I've gotten
longer<00:04:44.210> boot<00:04:44.600> laces<00:04:45.100> you<00:04:46.100> can<00:04:46.310> use<00:04:46.520> a

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
longer boot laces you can use a

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.210 
longer boot laces you can use a
parachute<00:04:47.240> cord<00:04:47.810> something<00:04:48.440> longer<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:49.039> much

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
parachute cord something longer and much

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.969 
parachute cord something longer and much
stronger<00:04:49.870> so<00:04:50.870> basically<00:04:51.260> when<00:04:51.440> you<00:04:51.470> put<00:04:51.560> it<00:04:51.830> on

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
stronger so basically when you put it on

stronger so basically when you put it on
you<00:04:54.979> put<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.340> on<00:04:55.639> a<00:04:56.080> little<00:04:57.080> path<00:04:57.289> the<00:04:57.560> ball<00:04:57.770> of

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
you put it on a little path the ball of

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.600 
you put it on a little path the ball of
your<00:04:58.039> foot<00:05:00.310> to<00:05:01.310> get<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.639> slack<00:05:01.940> out<00:05:03.550> now<00:05:04.550> you

can see the top of my foot where I'm
crossing<00:05:07.460> this<00:05:07.639> I<00:05:08.000> cross<00:05:08.960> it<00:05:09.199> right<00:05:09.229> where<00:05:09.650> it

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
crossing this I cross it right where it

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.850 
crossing this I cross it right where it
splits<00:05:10.010> with<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.460> tabhi<00:05:10.760> and<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:11.840> twist<00:05:12.260> it

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.129 

then<00:05:15.860> bring<00:05:16.190> both<00:05:16.520> of<00:05:16.550> them<00:05:16.910> between<00:05:17.900> the

then bring both of them between the
table<00:05:18.970> e-bill<00:05:19.970> the<00:05:20.240> bottom<00:05:21.280> it<00:05:22.280> goes<00:05:22.520> in

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
table e-bill the bottom it goes in

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.800 
table e-bill the bottom it goes in
between<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.240> two<00:05:23.599> spikes<00:05:24.260> and<00:05:25.389> back<00:05:26.389> around

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
between the two spikes and back around

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.460 
between the two spikes and back around
the<00:05:26.960> top<00:05:27.200> of<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.500> foot<00:05:28.479> now<00:05:29.479> to<00:05:29.539> keep<00:05:30.020> it<00:05:30.200> from

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
the top of the foot now to keep it from

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.190 
the top of the foot now to keep it from
sliding<00:05:30.800> just<00:05:31.310> forward<00:05:31.820> you<00:05:32.660> take<00:05:32.960> the

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
sliding just forward you take the

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:40.300 
sliding just forward you take the
strings<00:05:36.580> and<00:05:37.580> go<00:05:37.849> through<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:39.740> one<00:05:39.979> that<00:05:40.160> goes

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
strings and go through the one that goes

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.890 
strings and go through the one that goes
directly<00:05:40.550> across<00:05:41.180> the<00:05:41.419> top<00:05:41.660> of<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:41.960> foot<00:05:43.900> pull

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
directly across the top of the foot pull

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.230 
directly across the top of the foot pull
the<00:05:45.020> slack<00:05:45.289> out<00:05:45.560> then<00:05:46.490> you<00:05:46.639> go<00:05:46.789> around<00:05:46.910> the

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
the slack out then you go around the

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:57.740 
the slack out then you go around the
back<00:05:47.270> of<00:05:47.479> the<00:05:47.720> ankle<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:51.160> tie<00:05:52.160> it<00:05:52.220> like<00:05:52.760> this

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.800 

so<00:05:58.750> you<00:05:58.870> can<00:05:59.050> see<00:05:59.730> it<00:06:00.730> goes<00:06:01.000> through<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:01.510> toddy

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
so you can see it goes through the toddy

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:11.130 
so you can see it goes through the toddy
and<00:06:03.450> around<00:06:04.450> the<00:06:04.630> ankle<00:06:05.140> and<00:06:09.060> now<00:06:10.060> that<00:06:10.870> thing

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
and around the ankle and now that thing

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.010 
and around the ankle and now that thing
ain't<00:06:11.320> going<00:06:11.500> anywhere<00:06:12.330> it<00:06:13.330> doesn't<00:06:13.600> slide

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
ain't going anywhere it doesn't slide

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.950 
ain't going anywhere it doesn't slide
back<00:06:14.080> it<00:06:14.710> doesn't<00:06:15.280> slide<00:06:15.550> forward<00:06:16.180> it's

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
back it doesn't slide forward it's

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:26.280 
back it doesn't slide forward it's
really<00:06:17.500> secure<00:06:23.130> lacing<00:06:24.130> through<00:06:25.020> twist<00:06:26.020> it

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
really secure lacing through twist it

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.780 
really secure lacing through twist it
through<00:06:26.590> the<00:06:26.680> tabhi<00:06:27.450> around<00:06:28.450> the<00:06:28.630> bottom<00:06:29.790> when

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
through the tabhi around the bottom when

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.930 
through the tabhi around the bottom when
it<00:06:30.820> comes<00:06:31.180> back<00:06:31.450> up<00:06:31.690> through<00:06:32.050> this<00:06:32.290> piece<00:06:32.940> and

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
it comes back up through this piece and

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.000 
it comes back up through this piece and
around<00:06:34.330> the<00:06:34.510> ankle<00:06:34.960> and<00:06:35.350> it<00:06:35.500> will<00:06:35.620> pull<00:06:35.890> it

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
around the ankle and it will pull it

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.990 
around the ankle and it will pull it
back<00:06:36.310> and<00:06:37.300> it's<00:06:37.480> solid<00:06:38.550> so<00:06:39.550> if<00:06:39.610> you<00:06:39.730> get<00:06:39.880> the

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
back and it's solid so if you get the

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.210 
back and it's solid so if you get the
right<00:06:40.210> claws<00:06:40.600> and<00:06:41.050> you<00:06:41.290> put<00:06:41.530> them<00:06:41.650> on<00:06:41.740> top<00:06:41.980> like

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
right claws and you put them on top like

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.950 
right claws and you put them on top like
this<00:06:42.430> it's<00:06:42.640> not<00:06:42.790> that<00:06:42.850> hard<00:06:43.240> to<00:06:43.390> climb<00:06:43.600> a<00:06:43.660> tree

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
this it's not that hard to climb a tree

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.320 
this it's not that hard to climb a tree
and<00:06:44.290> I<00:06:44.740> can't<00:06:45.010> wait<00:06:45.160> to<00:06:45.190> demonstrate<00:06:45.850> for<00:06:46.150> you

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
and I can't wait to demonstrate for you
