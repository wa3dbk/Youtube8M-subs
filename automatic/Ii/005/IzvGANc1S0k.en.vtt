 the leadership had reported that no 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.199
 he had still received the uniforms and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.750
 that's why they could use this 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.039
 between turquoise blue jonathan polanco was 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.180

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.210
 late the stadium was clogged 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.190

 diego estrada the possibility of gym 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.540
 jonathan marquez the touch back the pass 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.790
 deep good the warrior entrance 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.160
 to more than a couple of feints touch of 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.870
 right leg and the first goal of the 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.270
 Uruguayan in the tournament was debuting 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.190
 with goal marcelo the red one says in 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.989
 warrior and here was his letter of 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.600
 18 minute presentation were already 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.729
 winning the whites 1 to 0 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.189
 one of the newly promoted youth 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.990
 escuintleca remember that it is 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.869
 basically the same franchise of 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.530
 sporty escuintla that disappeared does 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.970
 ten years and I was again celebrating 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.420
 a game of senior soccer league 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.280
 Guatemalan fact since 2002 was 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.020
 the last game and spin telecos 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.880
 they were trying to reverse things 12 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.200
 years and interestingly for example between 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.479
 other things there is no regret or if there was 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.700
 played there you feel that you descended and 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.560
 ability is not there and there was not 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.630
 they are scored we believe five goals 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.210
 which is a general thrust is not criminal is 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.140
 threw was not thrown we observe the repetition 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.140
 It was difficult 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:58.580
 and I think I do think that touch on 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.130
 left instep and if there is contact but 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.830
 nor the arbitrators but the brand 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.020
 they have to sanction them so they 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.420
 they make two mistakes according to the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.650
 same play English youths that 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.030
 they lived their best moments in the 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.710
 second time at startup since 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.170
 was HernÃ¡n Sandoval to convert the 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.420
 first so much before the great joy of 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.650
 everyone present that annotation 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.270
 important at that time was the 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.290
 tie to one and celebrate with all 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.730
 spin telecos 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.770
 if someone told me why celebrate 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.090
 throwing waltz and so much that little 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.980
 we believe and now defend 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.830
 professionally it's an account because I do not 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.780
 I was going to celebrate 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.360
 I do not understand is celebrating it with your 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.700
 hobby aside although it will play with the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.830
 same communications equipment what 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.140
 never have to do is go to celebrate and 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.600
 put yourself in the face of pressure from 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.600
 rival and there he did not with the fans 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.240
 bryant to achieve that existed but that's 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:57.000
 the celebration some players do not 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:57.000
 they usually celebrate when they never 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.430
 well there was a good head warrior 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.950
 of heavy and rising above all and 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.230
 this one that has not been such a scorer in 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.569
 league tournaments but of course it has 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.230
 fact 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.389
 the national team there are not so many 44 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.109
 goals with communications and many, many 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.170
 plus 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.840
 the same mirrors that we said and outside 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.840
 of our borders also 44 goals and 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.269
 colorado of the day the warrior the Uruguayan 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.730
 because in the absence of the fair I still 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.650
 they said what bad polanco not but for 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.170
 course you have to take it yellow 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.209
 and if I had another red tide observe how 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.310
 he pulls her chemise but how can 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.169
 do that before here means yes 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.909
 I would criticize Polanco if he had been 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:50.159
 direct red but in this case it was Maria 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:51.840
 time irresponsible and good and very 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.819
 responsible many amateurs just like 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.430
 also I saw the twitter they talked about 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.939
 that the decision was wrong but there was not 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:04.400
 seen but not very well a very correct 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.400
 there I could not mark anything else
