00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.910 
my memory so it really isn't much to go
on<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.869> sounds<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.080> he's<00:01:22.290> still<00:01:22.530> open<00:01:22.830> to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
on but it sounds like he's still open to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.950 
on but it sounds like he's still open to
the<00:01:23.009> idea<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.549> 3ds<00:01:23.909> remake<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.479> Majora's

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the idea of a 3ds remake for Majora's

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.749 
the idea of a 3ds remake for Majora's
Mask<00:01:24.990> maybe<00:01:25.560> they<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.799> get<00:01:25.920> grezzo<00:01:26.430> whoever

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
Mask maybe they can get grezzo whoever

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.880

did<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> ocarina<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.479> time<00:01:27.540> 3d<00:01:28.080> remake<00:01:28.350> so

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
did the ocarina of time 3d remake so

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.410 
did the ocarina of time 3d remake so
maybe<00:01:29.040> once<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.400> link<00:01:29.640> between<00:01:29.759> worlds<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
maybe once a link between worlds is

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.300 
maybe once a link between worlds is
finished<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:30.960> done<00:01:31.170> they<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.860> move<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.159> to
