 is the name of the mountain battle that 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.600
 facing tip and vrac elect the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.059
 first question and the answer is the 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.010
 purple test does not go into details of 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.510
 What is aesthetically purple? 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.510
 ethical mind bragman 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.740
 student like I want everything but it's 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.869
 very long so I explain it to me 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.590
 I would throw two hours and good let's continue 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.590
 question number 2 in the game 250 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.909
 click on question 3 to become 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.390
 primary 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.270
 here are two doubts there is the bone doubt 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.579
 of mangana that they give it to us before 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.299
 celebrate a mission that fights against 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:49.210
 you have to give the militiaman 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.399
 should animate and good because this gives for its 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.670
 access to the hangar but not 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:59.979
 converts access to blank 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:04.509
 become black are not the most 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:07.030
 You buy it basically fight and 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.360
 that there were two doubts but effect 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.299
 ballistic insurance 100% and the last 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.130
 question is in 2005 this new opening 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.900
 from the first international Serbian to key 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.700
 community is addressed this question is 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.670
 very funny because one of them is 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.420
 trap because we start Spanish speaking 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:29.069
 it can not be because Spain can do 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.230
 what came out in 2005 came out with 260 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.000
 scopes in 2006 came out the Serbian 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.880
 international that we will now say the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.739
 question and in 2003 the server came out 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.200
 because 2006 2008 Hispanic is worth the German 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.599
 we went down here 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.940
 my brother quiet but in 2008 also 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.769
 out there and the Klingon this is the question 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.500
 cheat this is not any server is 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.569
 basically a language of star wars to 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.790
 people who give the shakhtar wars since 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.400
