00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.920 
marriage was not that great at the time
and<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.730> was<00:02:14.850> really<00:02:15.000> depressed<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.600> really

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and I was really depressed and really

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.960 
and I was really depressed and really
lonely<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:18.020> ate<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.290> comfort<00:02:19.620> myself<00:02:19.970> I'm

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
lonely and I ate to comfort myself I'm

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.330 
lonely and I ate to comfort myself I'm

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
an emotional eater and I guess that's

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.040
