00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.440
 really liked the truth it looks very nice

 very well here watching the presentation of the 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.870
 great water dragon look at the entrance very 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.020
 chula very imposing as it is presented 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.020
 really beautiful here we have the roar 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.310
 and what's coming the dragon jet 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.310
 of water 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.760
 and well with these updates we can 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.070
 interact with the dragons in this in 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.860
 this dragon game of atlantis for 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.460
 Android we can interact we have to 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.700
 we touch it 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.150
 we touch it and it moves we touch it 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.810
 overcoming the fins 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.729
 sorry he touched the tail the fins 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.580
 I'm careful when looking mouth as 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.830
 it's a bit aggressive 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.750
 Waters waters with fingers all told 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.600
 since it is a bit of the earthquake very well 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.790
 we show the attributes 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.409
 the attributes of the armor the 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.570
 attributes of the rough dragon and the 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.520
 attributes together here we see that 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.710
 we have the four pieces of the armor 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.289
 is the pcs of the masses are the 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.230
 superior armor very well 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.980
 but two with the skills skills 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.750
 of the great dragon's battle of forgiveness the 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.909
 Water dragon power usually happens 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.349
 unnoticed thank you in your domain in 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.760
 the healing magic 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.200
 the water dragon can heal his 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.840
 allies this means that when 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.030
 fights in the photo the water dragon goes to 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.159
 to provide healing to the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.470
 the dragons this for is still the same 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:37.189
 from this part the only thing that comes is 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.829
 this this if you use it you will not be able to attack 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:42.439
 for three consecutive days or 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.720
 we can attack is also not and it serves as 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.860
 for 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.720
 well being like this 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.250
 because they do not rob you to cite your 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.700
 protection dome again and you do not 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.470
 they can attack the dragon very well now 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.620
 of water brings his troops 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.690
 'this your special troops your troops 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.110
 of the corpse against and special troops 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.550
 or troops of the least the one of the great dragon 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.200
 very well let's see the other part of the 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.090
 Water dragon 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.959
 let's train we look for troops 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.959
 down 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.460
 here are the water dragon tropes 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.310
 in this area 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.050
 It's trans I loaded the tritons very well 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.120
 from the dark depths of the 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.400
 oceans of atlantis come the ferocious 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.800
 poisoned tritons here we can 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.300
 see life 3000 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.500
 I have also 82 since I have it 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:38.700
 level 1 3000 life 300 defense 800 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:44.120
 of 500 distance attack 500 range 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:47.850
 of speed with 40 load 125 of 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.960
 maintenance and 1600 with combat 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.480
 melee here are the 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.880
 requirements to be able to train the 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.790
 very well an excellent troop combined 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.250
 with giants are excellent 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.290
 very well we went out now how to get the 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.109
 armor to move we can get it 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.310
 same as in episode 2 where he explained 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.709
 about the great dragon we can 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.250
 get in the missions I already put the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.409
 troops that are occupied to occupy is for 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.380
 get the dragon armors of 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.090
 water now how to get the new one from 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.100
 water dragon let's find what is going 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.250
 saying long level 9 to level 10 for 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.650
 safer first of all we hope 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.040
 with how many spies the most 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.400
 possible 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.600
 with 80,000 I have I have more forming 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.350
 these first we spy the drink why 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.260
 and then we send the attack 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.690
 the attack 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.030
 in general x does not count does not matter 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.500
 we will use the dragon 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.500
 we sent a spy very well 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.800
 a spy and then we're going to send all 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.470
 the fast- attack dragons that are 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.360
 possible 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.130
 it does not matter the level of the dragons of 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.110
 Attack while I do not have at level 5 but 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:06.969
 it does not matter they are the same results very 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:10.520
 well we hope that the spy arrives in 42 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:13.190
 the activity arrived we see the report 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.950
 here is the report very well 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.160
 Y 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:20.170
 espionage very well here I can see that 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.050
 no spy was wounded or killed in 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:26.680
 battle is important and good here is 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.120
 see the troops that the lake has is 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.090
 important to wait first because a 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.420
 Once you spy you kill the stage that 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.640
 they are being student savage spies 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.380
 the anthropos there are 5000 today we are going to see 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.270
 how in fact if they died here there 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.350
 it shows that they died but that we're going to 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.600
 see that they died 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:49.120
 let's hope the attack arrives had 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.949
 the attack has already arrived to see and in the battle 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.900
 also here nothing worked 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.630
 because I already have it here we can see 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.639
 the stage before there were 5,000 when 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.979
 we attacked already the most there was 1 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.860
 the spies killed all stage so 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:06.540
 reduce the level of troops in the lakes 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.540
 and increase the chances of winning 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.570
 dead I only had a spy death 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.510
 and the dragons came out unharmed very well 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.280
 once he attacked 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.800
 if you do not get to the first one, follow 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.740
 attacking you have to insist is a bit 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.520
 this delay must be joined today I 'm going to 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.520
 show that you have to put together 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.660
 we go to work 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.660
 until you work you work 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:36.179
 more a little more you have to put 100 together 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:38.219
 parts of the water dragon so that we 

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:39.619
 give the egg and now I have 5 own 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:42.360
 they no longer serve me because I already have it 

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:43.919
 we occupy 100 as it says here if in 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.160
 part is to exchange it for the egg very 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.530
 all right 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.660
 so until here we conclude that what 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.840
 What is the presentation of 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.570
