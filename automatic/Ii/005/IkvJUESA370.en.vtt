00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.930
 kelheim 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.069
 Everyone is looking forward to the landing exactly 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.710
 So we do it in the we now times 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.630
 look what a land is to do 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.580
 solid ground is assassin's creed 4 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.050
 his predecessor damned similarly much 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.430
 a lot of animation-recycling like you here 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.060
 from climbing over the tree you see and 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.919
 very similar mission structures 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.659
 that means also here these new ones 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.060
 sneak assassin's creed game and 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:29.029
 the eavesdropping on unsuspecting adversaries 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.789
 a huge role that many of 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.440
 you may cry out now 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.030
 but it is not that bad 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.800
 development very many systems a bit 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.480
 changed a bit what's up 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.790
 Sneak offers you more now 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.440
 possibilities and it is quite so 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.760
 as frustrating as before but you have to 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.010
 quite a bit too 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.630
 intellectually doing business wobbly 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.700
 gÃ¶rgl the leaves of roche the whole 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.940
 time yes they are a bit china 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.410
 it's nextgen man on the ps3 g10 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.700
 not all clear 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.520
 There was no quick teen leaves 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.930
 now you have it but you see 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:08.480
 a movement of bushes became a 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:11.000
 free game but for the rule 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.440
 Effects, for example, are great for everyone 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.790
 single drops is really animated 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.260
 also bounces off surfaces and 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.729
 Overall ps4 graphics can really work 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.600
 let see you can tell the game though 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.700
 that between generations 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.470
 somewhere is currently hanging animations 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.870
 and and faces are still working 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.590
 a little stale au texture quality 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.590
 a stable frame rate 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.549
 yes and i had the feeling in ybbstal 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.649
 I often have to sneak very often 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.170
 the checkpoints are mostly fair 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.750
 The opponents are unfortunately not always very 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.640
 Well predictable you have to get one 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.530
 get used to it a bit 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.030
 maybe also use blowpipe around the 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.350
 But I'll tell you in a while 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.729
 I will give you some more articles 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.049
 it motivates best solves and tips 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.799
 that is also a thing quite typical 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.390
 Assassin's creed climbing and puzzle 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.670
 is comparable to the fantastic ones 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.869
 dig from the second part or it is 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.849
 but rather less like the last 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.979
 both play 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:10.149
 well there is just these optional objectives 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.920
 here too it is a story in the case 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.209
 missions that point you out and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.810
 there you have the possibility yourself 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.220
 maya ruins to explore or oil and 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.970
 those are already here these climbing 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.790
 mission and puzzle deposits that you can 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.510
 already compare with it 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.620
 although I do not think so much about it 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.209
 I did not know which 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.209
 quality to reach these emissions 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.610
 but the riddle is in the case too 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.320
 very simple here we move a plate 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.850
 Use jannis mussum to lift blocks 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.890
 and lower and can with it 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:47.670
 ultimately the very simple color 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.920
 solve puzzles and it plays 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.970
 I have all that bit tough so 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.200
 let fix together 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.670
 we have no time but that is 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.920
 now been part of a general mission 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.810
 but there is still a lot of that 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.580
 more generally until the second third 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.440
 The game will always be with new ones 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.980
 features faced repeatedly says 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.140
 the game for you 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.280
 this is also possible, for example 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.870
 diving bell with the man under water 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.670
 The one finds only against middle 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.900
 of the game and then you become one 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.550
 That's what animates it 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.800
 Use future and I think so 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.600
 before yes and that sneak 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.709
 that would have to be here again and again 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.080
 just a lot of possibilities this 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.280
 stalking zones so these people the 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.850
 There is much more than in the 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.680
 predecessors 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.780
 And also the alarm system is easy 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.400
 changed in the case for six degrees and 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.150
 the people and the lock and the alarm 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.739
 trigger 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.420
 and here i can even fight 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.890
 stop it and if then all the opponents 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.030
 Round off is also off 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.510
 rest and the mission is not yet 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.690
 failed 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.250
 So you have facts in the big one 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.799
 But I think the better all year 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.989
 system and even if a watch the 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.459
 you can usually see a character 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.299
 still fast enough in a bush 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.910
 rescue 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.959
 that she just might suspect 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.790
 but does not strike immediately 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.810
 So it all became a bit 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.790
 defused and they really have 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.290
 trying to reduce the frustration factor 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.700
 there are still such people inside 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.170
 those who are high up the protect 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.820
 they can cause a lot of damage 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.799
 and we also see a lot and how 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.640
 You do not necessarily get it though 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.959
 All in all, it has gotten better 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.220
 and there are covers with many 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.570
 Side tasks all in the video too 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.040
 show would be madness and again 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.370
 for example, treasure maps 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.830
 find and then just on any 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.570
 islands treasures lift or animus 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.970
 collecting fragments or sheets of music 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.680
 collect or are doing orders 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.750
 or viewpoints search for it 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.950
 so much to do 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.630
 That sounds like a right one again 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.760
 immense playing time when you do everything 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.590
 I would like for the story you need 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.599
 your 20 hours and I think you can 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.280
 easy to spend just as much time in that 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.280
 of 100% of the secondary tasks
