00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
really had it that easy it took them a

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.059 
really had it that easy it took them a
long<00:02:34.239> time<00:02:34.299> before<00:02:34.690> they<00:02:35.019> became<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.620> band<00:02:35.920> who

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
long time before they became a band who

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.640 
long time before they became a band who
could<00:02:36.220> start<00:02:36.489> filling<00:02:36.700> stadiums<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.650> they've

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
could start filling stadiums and they've

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.809 
could start filling stadiums and they've
just<00:02:38.799> really<00:02:39.069> worked<00:02:39.280> at<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.519> they're<00:02:39.700> not

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
just really worked at it they're not
