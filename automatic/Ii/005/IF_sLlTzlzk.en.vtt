00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
has been move on we're looking here at

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.920 
has been move on we're looking here at
Bravo<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.239> main<00:00:51.449> features<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
Bravo and one of the main features of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.380 
Bravo and one of the main features of
Bravo<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.430> makes<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.820> de<00:00:53.969> mini-map

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
Bravo and it makes this de mini-map

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.090 
Bravo and it makes this de mini-map
differ<00:00:54.629> from<00:00:55.050> some<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> default<00:00:55.800> layouts

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
differ from some of the default layouts

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.880 
differ from some of the default layouts
is<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.629> very<00:00:57.960> far<00:00:58.350> extended

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
is that it's a it's very far extended

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.979 
is that it's a it's very far extended
its<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.910> very<00:01:00.660> neutral<00:01:01.230> yeah<00:01:01.890> moving<00:01:02.989> alpha

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
its it's very neutral yeah moving alpha

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.420 
its it's very neutral yeah moving alpha
and<00:01:04.080> Charlie<00:01:04.110> are<00:01:04.439> far<00:01:04.739> more<00:01:04.769> connected<00:01:05.400> than

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
and Charlie are far more connected than

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.120 
and Charlie are far more connected than
alpha<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.540> Bravo<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.350> Charlie<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.799> Bravo

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
alpha and Bravo and Charlie and Bravo

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.730 
alpha and Bravo and Charlie and Bravo
which<00:01:08.939> ends<00:01:09.210> up<00:01:09.299> having<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:10.110> lot<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.409> more

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
which ends up having a lot of more

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.250 
which ends up having a lot of more
dynamic<00:01:11.250> gameplay<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.939> players<00:01:12.260> really

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
dynamic gameplay you have players really

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.719 
dynamic gameplay you have players really
trying<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.590> push<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.040> grab<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> high<00:01:14.549> ground

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
trying to push and grab the high ground

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.160 
trying to push and grab the high ground
graph<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.180> Banshee<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:15.780> they<00:01:15.930> ended<00:01:16.080> up

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
graph the Banshee but they ended up

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.780 
graph the Banshee but they ended up
leaving<00:01:16.380> alpha<00:01:16.920> or<00:01:17.070> Charlie<00:01:17.430> far<00:01:17.610> too

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
leaving alpha or Charlie far too

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.429 
leaving alpha or Charlie far too
vulnerable<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:18.990> allows<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> other

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
vulnerable and that allows the other

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.609 
vulnerable and that allows the other
team<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.920> kind<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.220> traps<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:20.820> Bravo<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
team to kind of traps on my Bravo and

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.080 
team to kind of traps on my Bravo and
then<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.950> know<00:01:23.070> once<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.610> other<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.060> other

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
then you know once the other the other

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.670 
then you know once the other the other
team<00:01:24.420> gets<00:01:24.540> too<00:01:24.750> aggressive<00:01:25.170> towards<00:01:25.439> Bravo

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
team gets too aggressive towards Bravo

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.130 
team gets too aggressive towards Bravo
then<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.490> bravo<00:01:26.880> team<00:01:27.090> shifts<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.720> alpha<00:01:28.020> or

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
then the bravo team shifts for alpha or

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.690 
then the bravo team shifts for alpha or
Charlie<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.740> teams<00:01:29.130> are<00:01:29.280> always<00:01:29.520> moving

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
Charlie so teams are always moving

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.440 
Charlie so teams are always moving
around<00:01:29.939> spawning<00:01:30.509> anywhere<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.790> right<00:01:32.790> and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
around spawning anywhere it is right and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.710 
around spawning anywhere it is right and
it<00:01:33.990> comes<00:01:34.290> down<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.950> more<00:01:35.159> than<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.720> holding

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
it comes down to more than just holding

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.460 
it comes down to more than just holding
Bravo<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.490> since<00:01:38.850> Bravo<00:01:39.329> isn't<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.930> between

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
Bravo so it since Bravo isn't in between

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.800 
Bravo so it since Bravo isn't in between
alpha<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.100> Charlie<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.090> most<00:01:42.720> of

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
alpha and Charlie like it is on most of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.770 
alpha and Charlie like it is on most of
the<00:01:42.930> default<00:01:43.320> maps<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:44.909> really<00:01:45.360> does<00:01:45.540> get<00:01:45.720> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the default maps it really does get a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.179 
the default maps it really does get a
lot<00:01:45.899> more<00:01:45.960> interesting<00:01:46.439> because<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.920> can

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
lot more interesting because you can

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.670 
lot more interesting because you can
take<00:01:47.549> any<00:01:47.850> base<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.479> not<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.930> alpha

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
take any base it's not like alpha

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.800 
take any base it's not like alpha
belongs<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.310> team<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.880> Charlie<00:01:51.540> belongs

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
belongs to one team and Charlie belongs

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.069 
belongs to one team and Charlie belongs
to<00:01:52.049> another<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:53.090> Bravo<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.420> only<00:01:54.720> one

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
to another and Bravo is the only one

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.100 
to another and Bravo is the only one
that<00:01:55.110> gets<00:01:55.259> fought<00:01:56.040> over<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.850> that's<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.780> lot<00:01:58.079> of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that gets fought over so that's a lot of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.850 
that gets fought over so that's a lot of
fun<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:59.009> interesting<00:01:59.310> um<00:01:59.750> and

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
fun and it's really interesting um and

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.440 
fun and it's really interesting um and
there<00:02:01.860> are<00:02:02.070> some<00:02:02.310> pretty<00:02:02.579> cool<00:02:02.790> vehicles<00:02:03.270> on

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
there are some pretty cool vehicles on

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.109 
there are some pretty cool vehicles on
here<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.049> lend<00:02:04.920> themselves<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.460> attacking

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
here that lend themselves to attacking

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.630 
here that lend themselves to attacking
and<00:02:06.360> defending<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.810> different<00:02:07.049> bases<00:02:07.640> yeah

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
and defending the different bases yeah

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.240 
and defending the different bases yeah
the<00:02:08.970> Alfa<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:09.929> Charlie<00:02:10.050> both<00:02:10.530> get<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.770> mantis

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
the Alfa and Charlie both get a mantis

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.910 
the Alfa and Charlie both get a mantis
but<00:02:11.730> Charlie<00:02:12.150> has<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.629> warthog<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.230> alpha

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
but Charlie has a warthog and alpha

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.220 
but Charlie has a warthog and alpha
so<00:02:14.099> has<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.280> ghost<00:02:14.630> which<00:02:15.630> lend<00:02:16.080> themselves

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
so has a ghost which lend themselves

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.790 
so has a ghost which lend themselves
better<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.950> their<00:02:17.160> respective<00:02:18.060> sides<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.800> you

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
better to their respective sides and you

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.770 
better to their respective sides and you
know<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.010> course<00:02:20.069> that<00:02:20.310> maangchi<00:02:20.670> up<00:02:21.239> at<00:02:21.420> Bravo

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
know of course that maangchi up at Bravo

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.100 
know of course that maangchi up at Bravo
you<00:02:21.840> got<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.140> get<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.319> nan<00:02:22.440> Chi<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.099> much<00:02:23.250> right

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
you got to get to nan Chi so much right

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.290 
you got to get to nan Chi so much right
so<00:02:25.110> holding<00:02:26.099> any<00:02:26.340> base<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.819> going<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.030> give<00:02:27.180> you

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
so holding any base is going to give you

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.660 
so holding any base is going to give you
access<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:28.010> something<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.220> little<00:02:29.370> different

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
access to something a little different

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.000 
access to something a little different
and<00:02:30.030> some<00:02:30.959> pretty<00:02:31.140> cool<00:02:31.290> firepower<00:02:31.830> and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
and some pretty cool firepower and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.240 
and some pretty cool firepower and
vehicles<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.580> such<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:34.230> it's<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.980> lot<00:02:35.130> of

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
vehicles and such and it's just a lot of

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.120 
vehicles and such and it's just a lot of
fun<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.790> map<00:02:35.970> uses<00:02:36.420> terrain<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.650> terrain<00:02:37.950> of

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
fun the map uses terrain the terrain of

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.410 
fun the map uses terrain the terrain of
erosion<00:02:38.489> really<00:02:38.940> well<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.120> think<00:02:39.300> it's<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:40.370> as

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
erosion really well I think it's a as

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.180 
erosion really well I think it's a as
you<00:02:42.420> know<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.870> travel<00:02:43.200> times<00:02:43.560> between<00:02:43.950> the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
you know the travel times between the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.120 
you know the travel times between the
bases<00:02:44.670> aren't<00:02:44.940> too<00:02:45.510> long<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.590> there's<00:02:46.890> plenty

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
bases aren't too long but there's plenty

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.820 
bases aren't too long but there's plenty
of<00:02:47.340> just<00:02:47.670> space<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.720> kind<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.350> like<00:02:49.530> safe

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
of just space and kind of like safe

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.530 
of just space and kind of like safe
areas<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.640> can<00:02:50.790> spawn<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.450> are

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
areas that you can spawn and that are

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.410 
areas that you can spawn and that are
more<00:02:51.830> backfield<00:02:52.830> but<00:02:53.760> everything<00:02:54.150> feels

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
more backfield but everything feels

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.390 
more backfield but everything feels
pretty<00:02:54.690> close<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.350> whether<00:02:55.769> you're<00:02:56.040> on<00:02:56.130> foot

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
pretty close so whether you're on foot

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.340 
pretty close so whether you're on foot
or<00:02:56.610> in<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.880> vehicle<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.330> can<00:02:57.390> kind<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.840> get

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
or in a vehicle you can kind of get

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.650 
or in a vehicle you can kind of get
where<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.680> need<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:58.920> go<00:02:59.090> without<00:03:00.090> too<00:03:00.390> much

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
where you need to go without too much

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.259 
where you need to go without too much
difficulty<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.519> it<00:03:02.519> just<00:03:02.730> works<00:03:02.940> really<00:03:03.150> well

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
difficulty and it just works really well

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.650 
difficulty and it just works really well
for<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:04.980> think<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.790> atmosphere<00:03:06.540> the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
for that and I think the atmosphere the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.350 
for that and I think the atmosphere the
map<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:07.019> helped<00:03:07.200> along<00:03:07.440> by<00:03:07.670> erosion<00:03:08.670> as<00:03:08.970> well

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
map is helped along by erosion as well

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.039 
map is helped along by erosion as well
with<00:03:09.959> all<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.170> poop<00:03:10.830> pipes<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.810> rust

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
with all the poop pipes and the the rust

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.740 
with all the poop pipes and the the rust
and<00:03:13.380> such<00:03:13.650> but<00:03:14.640> here<00:03:15.299> we're<00:03:15.420> getting<00:03:15.600> in<00:03:15.660> the

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
and such but here we're getting in the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.520 
and such but here we're getting in the
banshee<00:03:16.340> so<00:03:17.810> it's<00:03:18.810> obviously<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.350> pretty

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
banshee so it's obviously a pretty

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.020 
banshee so it's obviously a pretty
powerful<00:03:19.709> vehicle<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:20.549> of<00:03:20.640> course<00:03:20.850> there's

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
powerful vehicle but of course there's

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.660 
powerful vehicle but of course there's
ways<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.420> counter<00:03:22.100> yeah<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.130> think<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.489> two

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
ways to counter yeah I think the two

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.449 
ways to counter yeah I think the two
pipes<00:03:23.970> helped<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.329> lot<00:03:24.709> alright<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.890> poop

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
pipes helped a lot alright the poop

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.849 
pipes helped a lot alright the poop
pipes<00:03:26.790> provide<00:03:27.630> quite<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:28.019> bit<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.410> aerial

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
pipes provide quite a bit of aerial

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.520 
pipes provide quite a bit of aerial
cover<00:03:29.120> for<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.209> Banshee<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.079> divan<00:03:31.350> t

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
cover for the Banshee so the divan t

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.160 
cover for the Banshee so the divan t
can't<00:03:31.739> just<00:03:31.950> rain<00:03:32.190> death<00:03:32.459> down<00:03:32.780> upon<00:03:33.780> everyone

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
can't just rain death down upon everyone

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.699 
can't just rain death down upon everyone
and<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.680> course<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.820> mantises<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.709> the

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
and of course the the mantises and the

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.780 
and of course the the mantises and the
coordinates<00:03:38.190> are<00:03:38.310> pretty<00:03:38.519> good<00:03:38.670> at

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
coordinates are pretty good at

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.910 
coordinates are pretty good at
countering<00:03:39.150> don't<00:03:39.720> banter<00:03:39.900> turns<00:03:40.290> everybody

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
countering don't banter turns everybody

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.440 
countering don't banter turns everybody
forgets<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.609> turret<00:03:41.910> oh<00:03:42.000> I<00:03:42.030> know<00:03:42.239> very

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
forgets the turret oh I know very

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.370 
forgets the turret oh I know very
emptied<00:03:43.109> and<00:03:43.799> right<00:03:44.040> yeah<00:03:44.400> right<00:03:45.049> yeah<00:03:46.049> the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
emptied and right yeah right yeah the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.840 
emptied and right yeah right yeah the
Dominion<00:03:46.799> turrets<00:03:47.040> are<00:03:47.130> pretty<00:03:47.340> good<00:03:47.549> and

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
Dominion turrets are pretty good and

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.270 
Dominion turrets are pretty good and
that<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.390> follows<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:49.109> you<00:03:49.650> know<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.769> pretty

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
that this follows the you know a pretty

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.289 
that this follows the you know a pretty
standard<00:03:50.670> Dominion<00:03:51.500> rules<00:03:52.500> as<00:03:52.769> far<00:03:52.950> as<00:03:53.070> having

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
standard Dominion rules as far as having

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.120 
standard Dominion rules as far as having
two<00:03:54.299> turrets<00:03:54.510> on<00:03:54.780> each<00:03:54.900> base<00:03:55.140> correct<00:03:55.590> yeah

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
two turrets on each base correct yeah

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.470 
two turrets on each base correct yeah
and<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.900> shield<00:03:58.170> doors<00:03:58.260> um<00:03:58.859> but<00:03:59.430> anyways<00:03:59.910> this

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480
