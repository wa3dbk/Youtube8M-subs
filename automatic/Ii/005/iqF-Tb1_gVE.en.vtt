00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.760
 hello and welcome to geek newspaper 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.270
 those years i'm at lg for 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.400
 discover with you this new lg flex 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.640
 of which only the first smartphone with a 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.260
 curved screen in the direction of the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.880
 length is ready in the direction of the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.320
 width harrouard the inverted I do not know 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.180
 too much but good at samsung he is 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.380
 curved in this sense there is the one 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.969
 to include in this sense when 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.770
 why simply because it's 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.120
 Screen technology and maggot 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.379
 ugly 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.629
 they are all an intel is one of 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.950
 first flexible batteries so that's 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.570
 to say that potentially he can 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.920
 to be really stupid between the 105 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.530
 I show you a little trick there 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.360
 you can see it is curved 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.949
 simply and is asked 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.480
 the device and I'm going on foot or so 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.010
 that he's really flexible so he's 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.359
 good in flexi which we do not know either 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.100
 the spirit thing totally but it's up to 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.720
 to say potentially he can cash 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.610
 a lot of shock it's not bad it's 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.580
 really more resistant it is enough 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.450
 impressive 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.090
 to see it like that otherwise just for 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.490
 give you an idea of ​​the east coast 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.460
 curved what his confession there I you 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.360
 ask excuse nexus to the new excuse 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.680
 5 at the new nexus 5 and you can see 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.760
 it's pretty flat and that's 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.810
 impressive so I'm the opposite 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.690
 of the seal surface is still below 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.890
 I put the small focus 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.170
 he could see that it's really 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.090
 flexible and it's not bad at all 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.670
 so after my level of the square of aces 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.140
 you know a 5-inch screen 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.780
 with a hd resolution a processor 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.070
 qualcomm snapdragon of giga of ram and 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.720
 all the good tralala there you know 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.620
 already 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.420
 so now the big question 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.960
 it is to know to whom to address and 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.869
 that's where it's a bit heavy that if 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.550
 you have if you have never considered 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.900
 to buy a sand is there are very few 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.430
 chances that we are considering buying a fact 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.720
 since it's still very big if they 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.300
 even push it into the pocket 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.350
 Well, it's not given 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.500
 on the other hand now it's true that if 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.540
 you intend to buy a fable is the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.400
 flex nor have created a lot since no 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.680
 only it is all plastic and this 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.290
 which allows him to have a problem 167 g 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.239
 and casually it's about 40 or 50 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.890
 grams less than the htc one max by 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.769
 example it is not negligible 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.750
 so it's more sincerely more and more 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.489
 heavy than a 15:03 but it's even more 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.920
 light and especially so we'll see 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.510
 maybe not in the video but basically 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.630
 while we say I 'll see if I can 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:45.520
 start a video simply 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.520
 that's video I'd like iron man or villa 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.180
 there it is not very well we frame and 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.040
 one is basically that I went to 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.710
 the video and we really made a sensation 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.630
 in a loose six-son dress is in 3rd 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:05.030
 rank because we play the curvature of 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.950
 the screen then follows exactly the curvature 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.420
 bike winch late that's what gets me 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.080
 saying that follows eye remedy so 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.100
 that's why we feel 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.570
 to have a bigger screen 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.080
 it's true that I had already done 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.690
 test with 1 55 inches oled and the 50 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.700
 inch oled give me in terms of 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.830
 printing the equivalent of 1 60 or a 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.910
 65 everything fits so it's not enough 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.380
 not negligible it is rather pleasant 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.510
 but it's true that if you are 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.000
 really movie consumers alike 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.110
 game for a laugh china such that 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.620
 can really do it it's a good 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.040
 solution 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.330
 30 the price at it is not announced yet 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.310
 but it must be around 800 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.050
 euros because we find about 700 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.550
 euros excluding taxes in korea and that's saying 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.980
 we probably have 800 euros in France 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.660
 of a risk of driving a lot but we 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.530
 will see by then since it will be in addition 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.540
 exclusive in orange with 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.430
 next february in 2014 or 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.680
 and for a month so he did some 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.459
 offers with subscriptions and all in 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.920
 all cases it is less good 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.740
 surprise and that gives it gives us a 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.510
 idea of ​​what the future of 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.510
 smartphones for me I imagine them 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.770
 always one of the cool things would be the 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.030
 will play to support his screen that's 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.330
 have a three shots in the pocket and a 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.620
 true 6 inches in hand a little trick 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.239
 horizon as a rank to finish on 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.230
 found the famous two buttons we 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.950
 did not know about egg jets and 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.989
 it is true that it is rather 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.180
 convenient 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.400
 the apn with the led flash and will be the top 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.919
 speaker who is right behind and then 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.840
 on the side the spar group forcing 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:31.570
 plug in directly and then so here 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.230
 the jack with Micro SD port 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.250
 down here I think that's pretty much everything 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.760
 so if you have any questions 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.970
 so feel this log quickly 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.970
 geek
