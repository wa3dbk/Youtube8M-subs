00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.340

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.469

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.200
 it was 10 am in you then the crack 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.960
 anchored and lucid and I decide to be a 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.090
 secret friend for them to martÃ­n and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.279

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.130
 on february 14th good today is 15 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.560
 but it does not matter then I decided to make a 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.170
 boxing to be able to share with you 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.630

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.850
 he gave me this book then we do not 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.600

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.600

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.510
 at this time 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.719
 and I think every color of the book 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.640
 I can not open it 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.580

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.060
 no way 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.060
 mother 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.840
 although ok you can open it then 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.290
 so that no one gets hurt was left 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.290
 demonstrated 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.460
 I'm waiting to make more time 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.079
 if you are following me through the 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.929
 already know that the drop must be 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.030
 improve it was my favorite book of 2003 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.909
 then all but not so much 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.479
 can see it is the go 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.479

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:14.209
 although I do not know who gave it to me 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.780
 and well the package does not bring anything then 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:25.690
 if they left me it 's a message I'm sorry 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:30.580
 but we do not see anything but I think it's me 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:35.680
 I think it was April or I do not know if it was clear 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:38.470
 I do not know what it was that I would say was 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.180
 key because I already have a 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.400
 review of finger and I know he likes 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.340
 a lot then I would think it was clear 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.740
 but I do not know in fact it could be any 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.300
 I'll send that message to ask 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.060
 who was the one who gave it to me because I think 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.730

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.800
