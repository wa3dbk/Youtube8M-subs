00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.200
 and 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.480
 We arrived after my work in the park 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.439
 family walk park called hair 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:34.220
 the prince is the keys here the park on the shore 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:37.760
 Ocean Bay is precisely civilized 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.839
 beautiful very well groomed now show 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.290
 playground parking huge for 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.290
 my back 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.000
 machine found arbor is worth 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.589
 but we go there then replenish one toilet in 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.489
 the park of course is 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:05.239
 America still here know that 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.920
 people love to write and how is it necessary to 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.110
 they did not hesitate to come up with them here 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.909
 toilet in the park he is not the only one here 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.460
 I think that today he is the only one 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.890
 open because everyone is open only 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.100
 weekends and holidays the toilet will be 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.289
 open in any park in the most massive 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.190
 well, for example, near the nursery 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.190
 platforms like here 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:41.740
 Immediately it is clear that the Florida plate is 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.740
 squeezed out though the playground doesn't seem 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:12.800
 coating on the site here is very cool 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:16.390
 call it soft asphalt do not know I can be seen 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.390
 but he is being forced 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.670
 suddenly a lump fell 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.700
 i can 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.700
 but 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.290
 as 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.290
 Russian 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:49.920
 although there is such an area under a canopy for 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:53.040
 celebration holiday kebab my and 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.040
 wipe up 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.870
 here are the grill or barbecue here 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.300
 but skewers in our course of course not 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.940
 do as they are open 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:10.160
 Well, you can easily fry the patties 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.160
 homemade sausage hamburger 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.550
 You see all my friends wanted so much 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.840
 to make 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.840
 you can not do 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.599
 in general, it was not always a park 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.099
 was once a private area 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:50.830
 family ownership 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.830
 wolf the honor of which we call fork 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:03.530
 here and so much looked the resort 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:06.950
 until year 26 until 1926 and now they will be 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:11.739
 look at what has evolved from these 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.739
 years on how not cared nothing for him 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.720
 snug fish are introduced into 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.190
 gulf of mexico 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.790
 now she is looking out for someone 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.360
 this predator is this trifle around 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.340
 any 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:46.120
 and he treats as if algae and 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.850
 you can't fish here, and you can't 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.419
 fishing is it fair 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.419
 look at this one 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.840
 imagine most of the park all 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.770
 still closed for renovation i was 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:07.610
 I'm sure that since October Iâ€™m not home 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.289
 everyone will finish but they still work still 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.250
 from the construction site you can not steal 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:15.440
 some kind of horror reconstructs the tower for 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.350
 views of the gulf of mexico and 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.430
 park territory and and 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.669
 some bad man set on fire 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:28.070
 September 11, 2013 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:31.460
 she was burning very badly here and 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.070
 beautifully burned down completely and now 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.889
 they reconstruct in order to 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.669
 again we could enjoy the whole 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.780
 beauty 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:44.130
 this area 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:48.380
 so what should be continued sometime 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.380
 later bye
