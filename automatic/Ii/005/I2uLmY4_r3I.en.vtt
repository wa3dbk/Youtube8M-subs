 why he ended up recognizing that a 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.200
 Unlike other unpresentable 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.120

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.250
 television and its future 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.879
 Florence is a person who is not 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.730

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.329

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:34.580

 Regarding if it is contributing as they have 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.300

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.390
 Endeavors to affirm their experiences that 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.310

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.260
 search the files to leave the 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.300

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.780
 files 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.270
 a lot to see three other programs like 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.560
 I do not understand I have been invited for another 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.330
 thing 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.000

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.400
 it's a personal challenge of mine that has not 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.930
 fact I think that none evident in the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.300
 world because it 's a very big risk 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.940

 poor thing she thinks it's like that but 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.670

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:24.190
 right no no no 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.660
 the self-esteem che at the time of his 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.540
 erotic fantasy does not go with 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.160
 chiquitas half feel that both you 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.310
 can move the floor to the male sex 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.350
 like the feminine to the extreme of throwing a 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.139
 enigmatic that involves a panelist 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.460
 that we hope we pray to lyon do not have 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.820
 nothing to do with any of our 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.820
 girls 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:05:04.120
 He told me that if you think I can 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.500
 wait for someone in the republic 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.500
 argentina take me seriously 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:16.050
 and on the list but for now because such 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.050
 thing in what sense 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.010
 has a history 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.870
 The truth is that it is pure 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.550
 strain has been born in a psychiatric 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.320
 safe and to myself and place from which 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.539
 it seems that they let her out to do her 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.250
 sporadic visits in front or once 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.410
 more did not make it clear that the media 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.000
 has a lot to give that to those who 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.830
 they think it's just a pretty face 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.759
 there is not a part that I do not understand about that 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:48.500
 history of marilyn and kennedy as 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:48.500
 attend missions as you fell mission 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:06:02.490
 I spontaneous generation as I do not 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:05.300
 typical in california I'm already in chat and 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.300
