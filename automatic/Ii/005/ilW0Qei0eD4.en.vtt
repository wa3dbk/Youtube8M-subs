00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 Hey guys, how are you? I 'm doing a 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.919
 video now the end of the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.190
 drying 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.730
 ships is that the personal lg question 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:20.279
 enough the drought leaves much threatened in the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.960
 end of the cycle too much kill can not 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.119
 pass can not manage can not 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.010
 can not do anything with the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.859
 clothes two main points 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.489
 you have to use the right cycle of 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.829
 drying for each type of clothing or for 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:46.050
 This cycle of clothes that I have for these 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:48.360
 clothes that I'm coming because on the day 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.860
 by day for the intimate piece for shirt 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.320
 T-shirt 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:58.829
 This is the reality of the cycle drying the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.260
 other high drying cycles to have been 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.670
 heavier by time for each outfit 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.310
 low temperature protection is 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.979
 delicate iron drying she leaves clothes 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.780
 in a vapor state to remove from the 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:19.049
 of the player and pass and another also has 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.420
 respect the limit of clothing that goes 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.960
 inside the washer to be able to perform 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.290
 This type of drying receives the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 even she really gets threatened 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.420
 not even this model here she has the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.690
 capacity of 10 kilograms and 200 kilograms 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:43.430
 wash and six pounds of drying now 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.430
 the end of the drying cycle in it 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:55.120
 finished now she will appear a serum 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.970
 the following messages if it would be the 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.250
 cd code of the cooling system of the 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.030
 washing machine she keeps making small 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.109
 internal movements in the sixth generating the 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.219
 sixth as if it were a centrifugation 6 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.889
 Quick, my letter and make a 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:14.620
 means fast moving faster than the 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.329
 Wash movement to whom 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.650

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.049
 inside the washer 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.419

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:26.290
