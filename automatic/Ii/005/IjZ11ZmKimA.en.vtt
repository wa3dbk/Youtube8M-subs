so now let's go into the details first

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.810 
so now let's go into the details first
let<00:01:01.570> them<00:01:01.750> close<00:01:02.559> you<00:01:02.920> to<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.370> nuclear

cooling system the chocolate was

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.280 
cooling system the chocolate was
developed<00:01:06.189> to<00:01:06.310> fulfill<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.180> French<00:01:07.570> half<00:01:07.960> nor

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
developed to fulfill the French half nor

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.389 
developed to fulfill the French half nor
norm<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:10.570> means<00:01:10.869> that<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.560> release<00:01:11.830> forces

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
norm this means that the release forces

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.960 
norm this means that the release forces
must<00:01:12.729> below<00:01:13.270> 10<00:01:13.600> kilograms<00:01:14.140> at<00:01:14.409> two<00:01:15.310> times<00:01:15.580> the

must below 10 kilograms at two times the
maximum<00:01:16.570> riders<00:01:17.229> weight<00:01:17.500> so<00:01:18.130> we<00:01:18.460> recommend<00:01:18.820> a

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
maximum riders weight so we recommend a

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.230 
maximum riders weight so we recommend a
maximum<00:01:19.600> riders<00:01:20.200> weight<00:01:20.409> of<00:01:20.590> 120<00:01:21.340> kilograms

maximum riders weight of 120 kilograms

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.270 
maximum riders weight of 120 kilograms
this<00:01:22.720> means<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.259> quick<00:01:23.649> release<00:01:23.799> must

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
this means the quick release must

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.730 
this means the quick release must
release<00:01:24.640> under<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.000> load<00:01:25.299> of<00:01:25.500> 240<00:01:26.500> kilograms

kilograms<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.550> this<00:01:31.270> is<00:01:31.420> tested<00:01:31.899> in

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
kilograms and this is tested in

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.529 
kilograms and this is tested in
different<00:01:32.220> environments<00:01:33.250> first<00:01:34.000> of<00:01:34.179> all<00:01:34.300> in

that<00:01:42.670> you<00:01:42.880> have<00:01:43.060> it<00:01:43.179> close<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.750> beach<00:01:43.959> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that you have it close to the beach and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.090 
that you have it close to the beach and
also<00:01:45.280> in<00:01:45.459> frozen<00:01:46.209> conditions<00:01:46.590> below<00:01:47.590> zero

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
also in frozen conditions below zero

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.490 
also in frozen conditions below zero
degrees<00:01:48.220> that's<00:01:48.789> also<00:01:49.240> important<00:01:49.659> for<00:01:50.020> snow

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
degrees that's also important for snow

range that's why we designed the chicken

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.190 
range that's why we designed the chicken
loop<00:05:15.770> to<00:05:15.980> be<00:05:16.010> modular<00:05:16.669> you<00:05:17.570> can

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.170 
loop to be modular you can
change<00:05:18.440> it<00:05:18.680> and<00:05:18.860> make<00:05:18.920> a<00:05:19.280> bigger<00:05:19.580> one<00:05:19.670> there

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180

inside<00:05:20.570> and<00:05:20.840> smaller<00:05:21.380> one<00:05:22.060> do<00:05:23.060> this<00:05:23.270> you<00:05:23.900> just

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
inside and smaller one do this you just

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.320 
inside and smaller one do this you just
have<00:05:24.350> to<00:05:24.500> open<00:05:24.530> there<00:05:25.460> a<00:05:25.490> little<00:05:25.790> securing

have to open there a little securing

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.230 
have to open there a little securing
ring<00:05:26.540> and<00:05:27.320> then<00:05:27.500> you<00:05:27.530> can<00:05:27.980> directly<00:05:28.490> mount<00:05:28.790> the

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
ring and then you can directly mount the

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.350 
ring and then you can directly mount the

bar is designed double V shape inside

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.260 
bar is designed double V shape inside
this<00:05:36.200> means<00:05:36.440> the<00:05:36.800> deeper<00:05:37.250> ropes<00:05:37.550> run<00:05:38.030> through

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
this means the deeper ropes run through

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.570 
this means the deeper ropes run through
the<00:05:38.390> bar<00:05:38.630> behind<00:05:38.840> each<00:05:39.200> other<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:40.130> reason<00:05:40.460> for

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
the bar behind each other the reason for

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.060 
the bar behind each other the reason for
this<00:05:40.730> is<00:05:40.970> that<00:05:41.000> you<00:05:41.300> can<00:05:41.450> easily<00:05:41.600> grab<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.410> bar

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
this is that you can easily grab the bar

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.020 
this is that you can easily grab the bar
in<00:05:43.340> the<00:05:43.520> middle<00:05:43.640> and<00:05:44.950> the<00:05:45.950> v-shape<00:05:46.580> is<00:05:46.820> there

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
in the middle and the v-shape is there

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.070 
in the middle and the v-shape is there
that<00:05:47.300> you<00:05:47.450> can<00:05:48.760> move<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.970> bar<00:05:50.180> very<00:05:50.420> easy<00:05:50.690> with

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
that you can move the bar very easy with

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.000 
that you can move the bar very easy with
low<00:05:51.290> friction<00:05:51.590> also<00:05:52.370> with<00:05:52.790> steering<00:05:53.240> input

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
low friction also with steering input

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.100 
low friction also with steering input
the<00:05:55.010> new<00:05:55.190> bar<00:05:55.430> has<00:05:55.700> a<00:05:55.730> long<00:05:56.150> a<00:05:56.180> deep<00:05:56.450> our<00:05:56.660> travel

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
the new bar has a long a deep our travel

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.470 
the new bar has a long a deep our travel
that's<00:05:57.770> why<00:05:57.980> we<00:05:58.280> also<00:05:58.460> improved<00:05:58.880> the<00:05:59.090> trimmer

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
that's why we also improved the trimmer

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.680 
that's why we also improved the trimmer
it<00:06:00.200> has<00:06:00.380> both<00:06:00.710> handles<00:06:01.220> guided<00:06:01.640> to<00:06:01.790> the<00:06:01.940> lower

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
it has both handles guided to the lower

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.960 
it has both handles guided to the lower
end<00:06:02.960> that<00:06:03.770> you<00:06:03.860> can<00:06:04.040> merely<00:06:04.220> grab<00:06:04.580> them<00:06:04.760> like

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
end that you can merely grab them like
