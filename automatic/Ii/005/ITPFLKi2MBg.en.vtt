00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
 one 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.769
 We can talk about a topic that not many years ago we would have thought of 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:30.919
 Science fiction 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.409
 we will talk about smart homes here in the administrator at home 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.170
 which suggests to our respondents the subject of smart homes or if 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.010
 he prefers domotic 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.059
 quesada matica 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.950
 because home automation is a technology that allows to make a series of 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.100
 automatic intelligent services lara manifested to change your home so that 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.869
 be a bit smarter than it is now to be able to function 

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:59.199
 some of these things from your house possible firmly obsolete by a 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.660
 small computer or something like that you world united 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.480
 this the set of elements that grab a bit the smart house 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.430
 they help aa 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.720
 to improve what is 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.140
 functions on a floor 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.310
 can plant some of the possible functions offered by a house 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.550
 smart 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.540
 if for example program the time you want is that you will have to 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.130
 action be father turn on or off lights may be that can be programmed 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.140
 the Mexican state is for example 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.350
 within the scheduled dates valued around whatever 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.359
 the functions 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.679
 hooker la she saving energy for example that has cells 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.140
 photoelectric and as happens people defend themselves do not go off 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.860
 that kind of thing does not 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.130
 homer look at it from the fridge there's a lot the fridge the television that 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.270
 they pay badly you do not touch that you go to work 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.410
 and you can put the work washer that controls everything 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.590
 because we are going to touch everyone who wants to believe that the house 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.390
 it occurs to me in ee 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.940
 that you understand those that leave the blinds or disengage them before 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.440
 television 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.010
 when you think it may cost a kit that allows you to transform your house into a 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.490
 smart bar 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.770
 this year to the tri 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.970
 one of them 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.869
 is that if it fits now it does not do very well 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.869
 but 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:13.719
 supported moms 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.899
 Do not fear the price but it will not be cheap 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:17.119
 there is a great idea 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.429
 the truth that I do not know but that the perception that is close 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.120
 it is evident that the question of intelligent housing 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.040
 although a few years ago it is within reach of the consumer still arouses 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.859
 important doubts because of their relative novelty 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.549
 doubts that on the other hand can also clarify the administrators of estates 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:34.909
 collegiate 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.949
 we just need to arrange a day and time with them so that they can explain to us in depth 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:40.399
 what is this question 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.399
 we now offer some brushstrokes on it 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:49.789
 the home automation or smart home takes advantage of the new technologies of 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:54.749
 communication to set up a safe and sustainable comfortable healthy home 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:59.349
 there are for all pockets according to the level of demand that you have because 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.669
 can be found - equipment from 700 euros and reach 20 thousand euros on 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.079
 digital home away from comfort has a very important aspect what 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.139
 refers to saving and optimizing energy resources at home 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.729
 familiar the figure may be symbolic but for a large office block 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:20.459
 operates the company is an amount to take into account an automated house 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.439
 allows to rationalize the consumption of energy and increase well-being and 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.459
 safety of its residents technically this result is achieved 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.509
 through the devil network connection of your devices and systems 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.370
 The services that are most commonly covered by home automation are the 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.689
 switched on and has paid for lights operated remotely as per detection of 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.760
 Proximity to the start-up of appliances 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.340
 the activation of heating and air conditioning 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.120
 the control of alarms and detection of faults 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.940
 and water leak or you go with the presence of fire and smoke inside the 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.619
 home 

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:57.829
 the phone of the internet connection are necessary elements to be able 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.109
 make reality 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.159
 this kind of fantastic house 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.209
 you can still do more things and the human physical presence simply if 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.769
 it has been programmed previously the automatic watering of the garden the reading 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.340
 Remote Counters 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.079
 and the automation of blinds and all 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.400
 the future is present in the home although the number of users 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.400
 particular is still relatively small 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.670
 as you know the purpose of this program 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.460
 is to do pedagogy about housing based on the will of the council 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.760
 of colleges of farm managers to achieve this goal 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.199
 so in line with that we now turn to answer the questions 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.949
 what have you done to us? 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.949
 1 little 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.710
 I live in a floor affected by aluminosis I have to leave the apartment in eight or 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.469
 nine months I have some right to be compensated 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:50.610
 these rehabilitation works are grounds for contract termination 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.689
 So he has no right to compensation 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:57.259
 What is guaranteed is the return to the floor until the expiration of the 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.459
 contract, discounting this period in which you have been absent from 

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:03.289
 same previous conditions 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.689
 who corresponds to the cleaning of the facade of the house of the graf and that 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:09.990
 it will be the graffiti 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.439
 the maintenance of the facade 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.439
 given its character as a common element corresponds to the community 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.669
 however we must distinguish an assumption from the premises because when 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.599
 have a faÃ§ade of a private nature, they will be responsible for the 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:24.409
 maintenance of it 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.409
 1 little 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.569
 one more day our space comes to an end 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.879
 We hope that it has served to expand knowledge on the subject of 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:35.710
 the House 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.490
 and we wait for you in a new issue until then have a good day 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:47.800
 one
