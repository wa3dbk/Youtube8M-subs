00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.939
 Hello and welcome v3 changeable and cool days later 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:08.760
 could go down and down the weekend in part breaks 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.320
 1500 meters the snow line and this is of course something from the sky 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.050
 down 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.099
 and the Arton Solar sunshine forecast shows worry 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.230
 Daimler has been banned 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.800
 by the nature of our sunshine prediction already shows 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.609
 the then not much sun left over Team Luv the low mountain range or from 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.040
 Alpenrand almost nothing is nothing in the lee of the low mountain range that is the wind 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.650
 away side there are still some on Friday a few hours out 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.320
 but it is so that classic April weather is what may lie in the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.710
 next days 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.430
 If you're looking for a bit of relaxation, Friday's thunderstorm is the best time 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.310
 over extreme northeast and east 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.440
 In the early morning in the early morning otherwise it is already largely so 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.780
 heavy rain also southeast otherwise April weather and partly the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.050
 Downpours and thunderstorms that come in more and more that the heights cold air and 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.460
 that means big vertical temperature difference between and and 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.440
 Above that, do not be surprised that just in this April weather not only strong 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.100
 shower 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.830
 but sometimes lightning and thunder can occur with it 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.400
 that does not remember the whole day at the beginning in the extreme northeast yet 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.320
 less shudder but the loosening will gradually and always 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.230
 less through the afternoon and evening 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.570
 are you no I then everywhere the same April weather with many clouds 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.740
 to see a few gaps in between 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.030
 and even single thunderstorms 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.680
 where the temperature is the blue numbers above as we are over 20 degrees 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.270
 nothing more going on, however, Friday will be a relative but still day 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.410
 then Saturday and Sunday to share still cold 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.540
 and that's the look on the nature and solar 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.820
 Sunshine predictions for the Saturday where you can actually see 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.900
 significant hours of sunshine and not too many between two and four 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.220
 Hours four hours on the arm 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.120
 probably on Saturday or just in the 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.020
 Northeast and East and this almost mixed zone is even on Sunday 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.120
 bigger with really just a few hours of sunshine is also bad looks 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.789
 in the far northeast and east more details continue on Facebook 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:20.679
 Keyword Kachelmann continues on Twitter with loud underscore Kachelmann as well 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.159
 Erfurt knows tile man point come 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:23.769
 All the best
