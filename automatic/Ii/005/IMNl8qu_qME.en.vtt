00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 in the library of rwe the studio 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.259
 her photos are her 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.790
 music pieces and their videos 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.010
 I have some photos from the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.960
 sample project from the hard disk 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.240
 in the library of rwe studium 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.279
 are financed 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.199
 So it can happen that if you 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.840
 these files on the hard disk 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.269
 move another place 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.539
 delete one of these files 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.939
 or rename or change the folder 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.859
 by having this photo is that 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.469
 then these photos are not in the library 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.450
 more are displayed 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.440
 there just studio studio whose origin 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.750
 can not find anymore 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.110
 I make a small one for you 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.270
 demonstration these photos are located 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.660
 on the hard disk de in the folder 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.020
 test photos These are the photos 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.989
 of the sample project I conclude once 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.539
 really study and open the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.539
 hard disk d and c mr gib is in 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.879
 order test photos in there are these 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.870
 photos 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.890
 Now if you have one of these photos 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.330
 rename 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.330
 for example, this one 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:19.119
 on for example bike tour and now 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.490
 actually open the studio again 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.860
 then you will see the studio this photo 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.390
 on the hard disk no longer finds there 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.390
 the file name has been changed 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.000
 they see this on this red 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.009
 exclamation mark 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.479
 besides they have one among all media 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.420
 received another folder 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.670
 that means missing media will be here 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.690
 all media listed their origin 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.100
 can not find studio anymore 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.780
 it's basically just this 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.570
 restore linkage 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.710
 but it is a prerequisite for that 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.060
 know which file zivi renamed 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.190
 if you put the link again 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.830
 then just double-click it 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.890
 with the left mouse button and say then 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.899
 yes you want the missing link 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.190
 restore 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:14.480
 I now see this foto bike tour jpg 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.700
 it is very easy the link 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.440
 Restore by simply using 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.870
 the left mouse button on this photo 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.760
 click picture 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.650
 you see that the picture is correct again 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.110
 is displayed and also your participation 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.470
 has been changed in the library of 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.470
 avid studio 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.160
 if you now rename the folder so 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.870
 eg this folder test photos the little order 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.870
 in the picture 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.720
 and if I'm back studio again 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.370
 then it will be like this 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.680
 not all photos in this folder 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.870
 more differentiated are so that is 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.329
 All photos become an exclamation point 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.640
 receive 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.650
 they can do the linking exactly 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.609
 Equally produce with a double-click 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.450
 then you put on one of these photos 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.450
 The link 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.920
 And in principle it is enough if you 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.530
 just open the folder 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.420
 Below is the filename of the 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.270
 current photos that you double 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.520
 clicked on the link again 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.980
 you can either add the photo 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.959
 Double click or just open 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.060
 Click me this photon in 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:34.970
 this folder is located as you see 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.560
 all photos were taken automatically 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.280
 same folder linked again 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.380
 that means they do not have to be each 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.760
 link individual photons but 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.180
 all in the same folder 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.560
 automatically accepted 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.810
 So it's hugely important that you 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.480
 have order on your hard drive and 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.459
 know exactly where the photos are 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.350
 saved videos and music files 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.060
 are 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.519
 the same procedure applies to 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.330
 all photos videos and audio files 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.590
 There is basically no difference 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.450
 However, when a file-supply 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.010
 call and do not know more like that 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.940
 was previously called or was 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.090
 is stored 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.019
 then the big search begins I wish 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.019
 have fun while doing so 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.669
 you will find more tips and tricks 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.700
