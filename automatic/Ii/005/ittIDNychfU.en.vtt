the city recreate itself I will compare

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.380 
the city recreate itself I will compare
Atlanta<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.340> where<00:02:23.519> we<00:02:23.670> were<00:02:23.850> ten<00:02:24.120> years<00:02:24.150> ago

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
Atlanta to where we were ten years ago

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.110 
Atlanta to where we were ten years ago
we've<00:02:24.900> come<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> long<00:02:25.260> way<00:02:25.680> have<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> long<00:02:26.880> way<00:02:27.060> to

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
we've come a long way have a long way to

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.250 
we've come a long way have a long way to
go<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:27.569> I<00:02:27.630> think<00:02:27.900> there<00:02:28.019> are<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.110> lot<00:02:28.230> of

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
go but I think there are a lot of

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.410 
go but I think there are a lot of
lessons<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:29.430> we<00:02:29.640> are<00:02:29.730> learning<00:02:29.940> from<00:02:30.239> each

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
lessons that we are learning from each

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.090 
lessons that we are learning from each
other<00:02:30.600> here<00:02:31.050> but<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.290> think<00:02:31.380> we<00:02:31.680> can<00:02:31.800> share<00:02:32.069> with

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
other here but I think we can share with

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:54.180 
other here but I think we can share with
people<00:02:32.640> elsewhere

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.250
