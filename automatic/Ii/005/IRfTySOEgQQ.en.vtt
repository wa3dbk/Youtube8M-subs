possibility the possibility that

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.859 
possibility the possibility that

protracted extended lockout could very

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.539 
protracted extended lockout could very
well<00:01:14.960> damage<00:01:15.500> our<00:01:15.650> game<00:01:15.890> damaged<00:01:16.400> the

business<00:01:16.909> we<00:01:17.869> could<00:01:18.020> have<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:18.170> very<00:01:18.439> different

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
business we could have a very different

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.940 
business we could have a very different
outlook<00:01:19.250> on<00:01:19.280> where<00:01:20.119> this<00:01:20.299> game<00:01:20.570> is<00:01:20.750> going<00:01:20.950> if

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
outlook on where this game is going if

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.640 
outlook on where this game is going if
this<00:01:22.130> lockout<00:01:22.520> extends<00:01:22.939> too<00:01:23.090> long<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:24.320> we<00:01:24.470> have

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
this lockout extends too long so we have

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.480 
this lockout extends too long so we have
to<00:01:24.800> balance<00:01:24.980> that<00:01:25.420> but<00:01:26.420> at<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.570> same<00:01:26.870> time<00:01:27.490> you

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
to balance that but at the same time you

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.310 
to balance that but at the same time you
know<00:01:28.610> as<00:01:28.820> an<00:01:29.330> association<00:01:30.020> we<00:01:30.170> have<00:01:30.290> a

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320
