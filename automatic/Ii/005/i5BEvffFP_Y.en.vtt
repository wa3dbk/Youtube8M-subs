can't<00:03:02.460> put<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.940> ruler<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.690> my<00:03:03.870> teeth<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.290> not

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
can't put a ruler on my teeth in not

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.980 
can't put a ruler on my teeth in not
that<00:03:05.160> straight<00:03:05.610> but<00:03:06.060> I'm<00:03:06.180> glad<00:03:06.510> because<00:03:06.780> I

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
that straight but I'm glad because I

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.330 
that straight but I'm glad because I
think<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:07.470> could<00:03:07.680> look<00:03:07.830> almost<00:03:08.040> like

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
think that that could look almost like

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.800 
think that that could look almost like
I've<00:03:08.490> got<00:03:08.670> false<00:03:08.940> teeth<00:03:09.270> if<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.570> know<00:03:09.660> what<00:03:09.780> I

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
I've got false teeth if you know what I

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.130 
I've got false teeth if you know what I
mean

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
mean

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.960 
mean
there's<00:03:10.590> one<00:03:10.860> tooth<00:03:11.130> at<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.430> top<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.910> does

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
there's one tooth at the top that does

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.000 
there's one tooth at the top that does
slightly<00:03:12.780> still<00:03:13.200> fold<00:03:13.440> over<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.800> other<00:03:13.830> one

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
slightly still fold over the other one

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.110 
slightly still fold over the other one
but<00:03:14.160> like<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.340> said<00:03:14.490> those<00:03:14.730> kind<00:03:15.060> of

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
but like I said those kind of

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.550 
but like I said those kind of
imperfections<00:03:15.450> don't<00:03:15.930> bother<00:03:16.080> me<00:03:16.290> at<00:03:16.380> all

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
imperfections don't bother me at all

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.500 
imperfections don't bother me at all
because<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.920> was<00:03:17.070> never<00:03:17.370> looking<00:03:17.580> for<00:03:18.270> perfect

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510

already I'm getting used to that for the
first<00:04:11.520> couple<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.820> days<00:04:12.030> my<00:04:12.239> tongue<00:04:12.480> was

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
first couple of days my tongue was

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.270 
first couple of days my tongue was
catching<00:04:13.140> on<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.380> underside<00:04:13.830> it's<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.100> wire

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
catching on the underside it's a wire

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.949 
catching on the underside it's a wire
and<00:04:15.640> it<00:04:15.910> was<00:04:16.030> captured<00:04:16.209> on<00:04:16.450> that<00:04:16.630> I'm<00:04:16.720> making

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
and it was captured on that I'm making

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.360 
and it was captured on that I'm making
my<00:04:17.050> tumbly<00:04:17.470> but<00:04:17.680> that's<00:04:17.920> just<00:04:18.040> because<00:04:18.160> your

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
my tumbly but that's just because your

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.890 
my tumbly but that's just because your
tongue<00:04:18.519> is<00:04:18.700> drawn<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.120> something<00:04:19.330> foreign<00:04:19.720> in

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
tongue is drawn to something foreign in

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.570 
tongue is drawn to something foreign in
your<00:04:19.930> mouth<00:04:20.170> and<00:04:20.380> once<00:04:20.560> it<00:04:20.709> gets<00:04:20.860> used<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.310> I

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
your mouth and once it gets used to it I

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.410 
your mouth and once it gets used to it I
think<00:04:21.820> it<00:04:22.090> will<00:04:22.150> be<00:04:22.300> fine<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:23.100> I<00:04:24.100> have<00:04:24.420> had

really<00:04:28.720> eat<00:04:28.930> would<00:04:29.080> had<00:04:29.230> the<00:04:29.350> braces<00:04:29.680> on<00:04:29.860> and

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
really eat would had the braces on and

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.770 
really eat would had the braces on and
the<00:04:30.580> food<00:04:30.790> kind<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.180> does<00:04:31.300> feel<00:04:31.510> like<00:04:31.540> it's

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
the food kind of does feel like it's

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.540 
the food kind of does feel like it's
getting<00:04:31.960> stuck<00:04:32.230> it<00:04:32.380> into<00:04:32.650> that<00:04:33.160> piece<00:04:33.400> of

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
getting stuck it into that piece of

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.980 
getting stuck it into that piece of
metal<00:04:33.790> at<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:33.940> back<00:04:34.120> but<00:04:34.360> it's<00:04:34.510> totally<00:04:34.690> my

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
metal at the back but it's totally my

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.330 
metal at the back but it's totally my
imagination<00:04:35.650> because<00:04:35.830> when<00:04:35.950> I<00:04:36.010> look<00:04:36.160> in<00:04:36.250> the

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
imagination because when I look in the

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.520 
imagination because when I look in the
mirror<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:37.000> check<00:04:37.270> it's<00:04:37.540> not<00:04:37.750> there<00:04:37.960> at<00:04:38.080> all<00:04:38.260> so

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
mirror to check it's not there at all so

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.380 
mirror to check it's not there at all so
again<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:38.830> think<00:04:38.950> I'll<00:04:39.190> get<00:04:39.340> used<00:04:39.520> to<00:04:39.700> that<00:04:39.850> so

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
again I think I'll get used to that so

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.480 
again I think I'll get used to that so
I'll<00:04:40.570> show<00:04:40.750> you<00:04:40.780> an<00:04:41.050> up<00:04:41.260> close<00:04:41.710> picture<00:04:42.070> of<00:04:42.340> my

just kind of a celebration of my new

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.160 
just kind of a celebration of my new
teeth<00:04:48.060> hard<00:04:49.060> to<00:04:49.180> talk<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.540> show<00:04:49.840> you<00:04:49.930> them<00:04:50.080> at

the same time but you can see what I

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.730

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740

that angle you can see what I mean about
the<00:05:12.850> tooth<00:05:13.060> it<00:05:13.210> won't<00:05:13.390> show<00:05:13.660> that<00:05:14.650> on<00:05:14.830> there<00:05:15.160> it
