00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920 

Oh

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:02.930 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.930 

you

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:07.940 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.380 

okay<00:00:08.940> so

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:09.390 
okay so

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.020 
okay so
this<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.690> my<00:00:09.840> latest<00:00:10.080> project<00:00:10.560> it<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.250> going<00:00:11.850> to

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
this is my latest project it is going to

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.930 
this is my latest project it is going to
be<00:00:12.060> an<00:00:12.270> underwater<00:00:12.690> sound<00:00:13.140> system<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:14.430> this

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
be an underwater sound system that this

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.570 
be an underwater sound system that this
waterproof<00:00:15.660> fits<00:00:16.200> inside<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.860> this<00:00:16.950> toolbox

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
waterproof fits inside of this toolbox

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.170 
waterproof fits inside of this toolbox
and<00:00:18.500> so<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.619> first<00:00:19.860> step<00:00:20.010> was<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.640> took<00:00:20.760> this

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
and so the first step was I took this

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.070 
and so the first step was I took this
sheet<00:00:22.130> Plexiglas<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.670> cut<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.390> piece

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
sheet Plexiglas and I cut out a piece

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.019 
sheet Plexiglas and I cut out a piece
that<00:00:25.800> fits<00:00:26.300> into<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.689> tool<00:00:27.900> box<00:00:28.140> like<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.029> it's

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
that fits into the tool box like so it's

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.429 
that fits into the tool box like so it's
hard<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> hold<00:00:30.419> a<00:00:30.540> camera<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.960> put<00:00:31.169> it<00:00:31.290> in<00:00:31.380> at

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
hard to hold a camera and put it in at

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.490 
hard to hold a camera and put it in at
the<00:00:31.500> same<00:00:31.680> time<00:00:32.660> second<00:00:33.660> step<00:00:33.870> was<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.410> took

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the same time second step was I took

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.560 
the same time second step was I took
apart<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.870> miniature<00:00:36.870> amplifier<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.570> I'm

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
apart this miniature amplifier and I'm

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.389 
apart this miniature amplifier and I'm
going<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:39.989> put<00:00:40.380> it<00:00:40.530> into<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.789> Plexiglas<00:00:43.399> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
going to put it into the Plexiglas the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.650 
going to put it into the Plexiglas the
third<00:00:44.670> step<00:00:45.230> was<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.559> made<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.340> 12<00:00:47.820> volt<00:00:48.149> power

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
third step was I made a 12 volt power

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.290 
third step was I made a 12 volt power
supply<00:00:49.609> for<00:00:50.609> the<00:00:51.320> amplifier<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.120> I've<00:00:54.120> got

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
supply for the amplifier and I've got

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.700 
supply for the amplifier and I've got
the<00:00:54.329> speakers<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:56.390> I've<00:00:57.390> got<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.050> mineral

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the speakers and I've got the mineral

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.209 
the speakers and I've got the mineral
oil<00:00:58.949> which<00:00:59.550> will<00:00:59.820> be<00:01:00.710> everything<00:01:01.710> under<00:01:02.100> this

stage 2 of the sound system I pulled out

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.850 
stage 2 of the sound system I pulled out
some<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.159> useless<00:01:52.640> hardware<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.860> I

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
some of the useless hardware and I

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.070 
some of the useless hardware and I
direct<00:01:55.280> line<00:01:55.579> din<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.560> audio<00:01:57.560> cable<00:01:58.479> stage<00:01:59.479> 3

direct line din and audio cable stage 3

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.389 
direct line din and audio cable stage 3
i'm<00:02:00.439> putting<00:02:01.070> in<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.580> power<00:02:02.409> doohickey<00:02:03.409> into

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
i'm putting in a power doohickey into

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.359 
i'm putting in a power doohickey into
the<00:02:04.640> board

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.729 

okay<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:11.209> here's<00:02:11.720> what<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:11.959> looks<00:02:12.140> like<00:02:12.290> mostly

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
okay so here's what it looks like mostly

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.690 
okay so here's what it looks like mostly
put<00:02:13.040> together<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:14.769> I<00:02:15.769> should<00:02:16.099> probably<00:02:16.220> plug

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
put together and I should probably plug

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:31.390 
put together and I should probably plug
it<00:02:16.849> in<00:02:17.620> show<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.680> how<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.159> works<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:30.370> then<00:02:31.370> I

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
it in show you how it works and then I

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.430 
it in show you how it works and then I
also<00:02:31.579> have<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.209> lights<00:02:32.510> on<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:36.650> switch<00:02:38.319> get<00:02:39.319> my

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
also have the lights on a switch get my

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.280 
also have the lights on a switch get my
external<00:02:39.920> power<00:02:40.190> plug<00:02:40.629> the<00:02:41.629> hole<00:02:41.840> control

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
external power plug the hole control

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.640 
external power plug the hole control
panel<00:02:42.709> is<00:02:42.799> built<00:02:43.040> into<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.430> plexiglass<00:02:44.060> and

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
panel is built into the plexiglass and

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.099 
panel is built into the plexiglass and
then<00:02:45.650> I'm<00:02:45.769> just<00:02:45.920> going<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:46.160> glue<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:47.450> light

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
then I'm just going to glue in the light

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.150 
then I'm just going to glue in the light
and<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:49.510> speakers<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.930> fill<00:02:51.620> this<00:02:51.769> bottom

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
and the speakers and fill this bottom

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.910 
and the speakers and fill this bottom
area<00:02:52.340> up<00:02:52.519> now<00:02:53.420> when<00:02:53.900> soldering<00:02:54.170> together<00:02:54.709> the

area up now when soldering together the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.539 
area up now when soldering together the
entire<00:02:55.040> bottom<00:02:55.730> area<00:02:56.510> like<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:58.370> is

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
entire bottom area like so it is

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.530 
entire bottom area like so it is
important<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.569> check<00:03:00.349> every<00:03:01.310> time<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.390> make

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
important to check every time to make

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.360 
important to check every time to make
sure<00:03:02.569> that<00:03:02.870> your<00:03:02.989> connections<00:03:03.470> are<00:03:03.680> good<00:03:04.010> and

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
sure that your connections are good and
