and if it's a horse that I have never

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.270 
and if it's a horse that I have never
driven<00:01:12.689> before<00:01:12.930> he's<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.010> give<00:01:14.189> me

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
driven before he's going to give me

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.929 
driven before he's going to give me
information<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:15.030> how<00:01:15.869> he<00:01:15.930> races<00:01:16.470> best<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.100> how

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
information on how he races best and how

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.149 
information on how he races best and how
he<00:01:18.000> thinks<00:01:18.390> he<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.630> perform<00:01:19.080> at<00:01:19.500> an<00:01:19.680> optimum

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
he thinks he can perform at an optimum

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.940 
he thinks he can perform at an optimum
level<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:22.140> main<00:01:22.470> source<00:01:22.770> of

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
level and but the main source of

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.030 
level and but the main source of
information<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> program<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.540> think

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
information is a program and I think

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.090 
information is a program and I think
program<00:01:26.040> never<00:01:26.280> lies<00:01:27.320> when<00:01:28.320> I'm<00:01:28.470> scoring<00:01:28.890> down

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
program never lies when I'm scoring down

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100 
program never lies when I'm scoring down
I<00:01:29.460> always<00:01:29.939> check<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> tote<00:01:30.570> board<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.990> to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
I always check the tote board just to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.100 
I always check the tote board just to
see<00:01:31.430> what<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> public<00:01:32.729> likes<00:01:33.150> I've<00:01:33.630> always

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
see what the public likes I've always

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.300 
see what the public likes I've always
found<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.470> public<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> great

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
found the public to be a great

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.870 
found the public to be a great
handicapper<00:01:36.380> many<00:01:37.380> times<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:38.549> know<00:01:38.640> there'll

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
handicapper many times you know there'll

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.020 
handicapper many times you know there'll
be<00:01:38.909> horses<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.540> don't<00:01:39.840> think<00:01:40.880> have<00:01:41.880> as

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
be horses that I don't think have as

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.550 
be horses that I don't think have as
good<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.270> chance<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.720> what<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.020> public<00:01:43.380> does

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
good a chance as what the public does

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.700 
good a chance as what the public does
and<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.670> lot<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.850> times<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.360> public<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.840> right<00:01:46.110> I

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
and a lot of times the public is right I

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.670 
and a lot of times the public is right I
just<00:01:47.310> think<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.850> another<00:01:48.329> tool<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.229> me

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
just think it's a another tool for me

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.440 
just think it's a another tool for me
for<00:01:50.009> information<00:01:50.299> to<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.899> plan<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> strategy

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
for information to to plan a strategy

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.410 
for information to to plan a strategy
sometimes<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:54.689> or<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.860> I've<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.939> thought

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
sometimes I think or that I've I thought

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.789 
sometimes I think or that I've I thought
was<00:01:57.600> going<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.930> be<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> factor<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> race

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
was going to be a factor in the race

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.950 
was going to be a factor in the race
will<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.100> twenty<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.520> one<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.960> that's

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
will be twenty to one and that's

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.020 
will be twenty to one and that's
certainly<00:02:01.259> plays<00:02:01.890> into<00:02:02.159> my<00:02:02.189> thinking<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.820> not

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
certainly plays into my thinking is not

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.700 
certainly plays into my thinking is not
as<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.420> strategy<00:02:03.659> develops<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.530> race

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
as the strategy develops in a race

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.590 
as the strategy develops in a race
because<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.040> believe<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:06.060> public<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.570> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
because I believe that the public is a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.020 
because I believe that the public is a
very<00:02:06.869> good<00:02:07.049> handicapper<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.979> horses<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.489> a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
very good handicapper of the horses in a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.440 
very good handicapper of the horses in a
particular<00:02:09.690> race<00:02:10.009> my<00:02:11.009> strategy<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:12.180> every

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
particular race my strategy in every

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.440 
particular race my strategy in every
race<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.140> draw

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
race that I draw

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.690 
race that I draw
I<00:02:13.480> was<00:02:13.690> having<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.080> horse<00:02:14.290> in<00:02:14.980> position<00:02:15.580> that

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
I was having a horse in position that

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.850 
I was having a horse in position that
had<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:15.940> stretch<00:02:16.300> without<00:02:16.510> using<00:02:17.110> him<00:02:17.410> too<00:02:17.650> much

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
had a stretch without using him too much

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.759 
had a stretch without using him too much
that<00:02:18.640> he<00:02:18.790> can<00:02:18.940> deliver<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.569> strong<00:02:20.050> last

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
that he can deliver a strong last

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.100 
that he can deliver a strong last
quarter<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.370> me<00:02:21.519> and<00:02:21.849> that's<00:02:22.209> really<00:02:22.629> the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
quarter to me and that's really the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.110 
quarter to me and that's really the
essence<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.620> driving<00:02:24.310> putting<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.730> horse<00:02:24.940> in

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
essence of driving putting that horse in

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.660 
essence of driving putting that horse in
position<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:25.690> might<00:02:25.870> be<00:02:26.019> racing<00:02:26.800> him<00:02:26.950> on<00:02:27.430> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
position it might be racing him on the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.400 
position it might be racing him on the
lead<00:02:27.879> it<00:02:28.150> might<00:02:28.330> be<00:02:28.480> racing<00:02:28.840> him<00:02:28.959> from<00:02:29.170> far

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
lead it might be racing him from far

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.900 
lead it might be racing him from far
back<00:02:29.650> or<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.069> middle<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.459> pack<00:02:30.670> but

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
back or the middle of the pack but

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.000 
back or the middle of the pack but
having<00:02:31.630> him<00:02:31.780> in<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.930> position<00:02:32.290> where<00:02:32.620> if<00:02:32.830> he

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
having him in a position where if he

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.920 
having him in a position where if he
gives<00:02:33.250> neither<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.239> last<00:02:34.420> quarter<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:34.810> I

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
gives neither the last quarter that I

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.809 
gives neither the last quarter that I
expect<00:02:35.410> from<00:02:35.530> them<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:36.190> he<00:02:36.340> will<00:02:36.670> have<00:02:36.790> a

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
expect from them that he will have a

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.309 
expect from them that he will have a
chance<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.390> win<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.690> race<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.200> that's

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
chance to win that race and that's

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.680 
chance to win that race and that's
that's<00:02:39.099> the<00:02:39.280> strategy<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.790> most<00:02:40.120> drivers<00:02:40.299> so

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
that's the strategy of most drivers so

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.660 
that's the strategy of most drivers so
it's<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.930> cat-and-mouse<00:02:41.170> game<00:02:41.769> trying<00:02:42.069> to<00:02:42.250> put

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
it's a cat-and-mouse game trying to put

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.039 
it's a cat-and-mouse game trying to put
your<00:02:42.760> horse<00:02:43.030> in<00:02:43.209> that<00:02:43.330> position<00:02:43.540> put<00:02:44.019> your

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
your horse in that position put your

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.199 
your horse in that position put your
opposition<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.010> position<00:02:45.790> where<00:02:46.090> they

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
opposition in a position where they

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.190 
opposition in a position where they
don't<00:02:46.360> want<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.720> be<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:48.269> horses<00:02:49.269> are<00:02:49.870> much

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
don't want to be but horses are much

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.140 
don't want to be but horses are much
like<00:02:50.440> an<00:02:50.590> elastic<00:02:50.860> when<00:02:51.489> you're<00:02:51.640> going<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.970> mile

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
like an elastic when you're going a mile

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.180 
like an elastic when you're going a mile
you<00:02:52.390> can<00:02:52.690> stretch<00:02:53.079> them<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.470> much<00:02:53.680> but<00:02:53.950> if<00:02:54.040> you

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
you can stretch them so much but if you

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.559 
you can stretch them so much but if you
use<00:02:54.400> them<00:02:54.610> too<00:02:54.819> hard<00:02:55.060> before<00:02:55.269> that's

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
use them too hard before that's

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.080 
use them too hard before that's
recordable<00:02:56.079> they're<00:02:56.739> gonna<00:02:56.920> tire<00:02:57.220> much<00:02:57.610> like

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
recordable they're gonna tire much like

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.850 
recordable they're gonna tire much like
an<00:02:58.239> elastic<00:02:58.510> if<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:58.900> put<00:02:59.319> too<00:02:59.440> much<00:02:59.590> pressure

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
an elastic if you put too much pressure

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.400 
an elastic if you put too much pressure
on<00:03:00.099> it<00:03:00.310> it's<00:03:00.519> gonna<00:03:00.730> break<00:03:01.140> whipping<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.349> horse

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
on it it's gonna break whipping a horse

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.250 
on it it's gonna break whipping a horse
is<00:03:03.040> something<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:03.970> is<00:03:04.360> certainly<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:05.079> whip

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
is something that is certainly the whip

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.390 
is something that is certainly the whip
is<00:03:05.410> overused<00:03:05.739> I<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:07.299> really<00:03:07.660> believe<00:03:08.079> that<00:03:08.400> not

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
is overused I I really believe that not

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.910 
is overused I I really believe that not
too<00:03:09.760> many<00:03:09.970> horses<00:03:10.329> go<00:03:11.170> away<00:03:11.440> when<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:11.739> hit

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
too many horses go away when you hit

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.530 
too many horses go away when you hit
them<00:03:12.069> hard<00:03:12.310> with<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.640> whip<00:03:12.819> but<00:03:13.360> it's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
them hard with the whip but it's

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.970 
them hard with the whip but it's
certainly<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.870> tool<00:03:14.110> that<00:03:14.230> we<00:03:14.380> have<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.769> have

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
certainly a tool that we have to have

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.809 
certainly a tool that we have to have
the<00:03:16.079> betting<00:03:17.079> public<00:03:17.260> in<00:03:17.650> North<00:03:18.069> America<00:03:18.489> is

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
the betting public in North America is

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.879 
the betting public in North America is
used<00:03:19.329> to<00:03:19.569> seeing<00:03:19.810> drivers<00:03:20.290> whip<00:03:20.470> their<00:03:20.650> horses

used to seeing drivers whip their horses

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.710

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
and they expect them to so that's

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.930 
and they expect them to so that's
something<00:03:23.019> that<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.769> know<00:03:24.459> we<00:03:24.639> have<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.910> be

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.890 
as as I said will will actually slow
down<00:03:42.609> if<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:42.910> hit<00:03:43.060> them<00:03:43.239> too<00:03:43.420> hard<00:03:43.660> and

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
down if you hit them too hard and

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.660 
down if you hit them too hard and
especially<00:03:44.650> horses<00:03:44.799> that<00:03:45.100> have<00:03:45.220> race<00:03:45.400> for<00:03:45.639> a

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
especially horses that have race for a

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.520 
especially horses that have race for a
number<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:45.970> years<00:03:46.239> they're<00:03:46.450> just<00:03:46.720> too<00:03:47.170> smart

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
number of years they're just too smart

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.430 
number of years they're just too smart
and<00:03:47.829> they<00:03:48.069> resent<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.940> whip<00:03:49.120> when<00:03:49.900> people<00:03:50.290> see

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
and they resent the whip when people see

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.289 
and they resent the whip when people see
drivers<00:03:50.739> leaning<00:03:51.190> back<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.609> hit<00:03:51.760> they<00:03:51.910> assume

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
drivers leaning back to hit they assume

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.240 
drivers leaning back to hit they assume
that<00:03:52.540> we're<00:03:53.200> holding<00:03:53.590> them<00:03:53.709> back<00:03:53.889> and<00:03:53.950> that's

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
that we're holding them back and that's

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.430 
that we're holding them back and that's
not<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.609> case<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:55.540> way<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.900> Salty's<00:03:56.260> of

not the case the way the Salty's of

today are set up that's the way you're

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.750 
today are set up that's the way you're
most<00:03:58.810> comfortable<00:03:59.019> that's<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.310> way<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.489> can

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
most comfortable that's the way you can

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.690 
most comfortable that's the way you can
make<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.120> most<00:04:01.359> speed<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.049> I<00:04:03.040> always<00:04:03.430> tell

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
make the most speed and I always tell

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.160 
make the most speed and I always tell
people<00:04:03.880> if<00:04:04.120> you<00:04:04.209> think<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.569> guy<00:04:04.720> is<00:04:04.780> leaning

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
people if you think a guy is leaning

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.650 
people if you think a guy is leaning
back<00:04:05.380> you're<00:04:05.859> wrong<00:04:06.130> because<00:04:06.400> if<00:04:06.819> it<00:04:07.209> was<00:04:07.329> true

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
back you're wrong because if it was true

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.409 
back you're wrong because if it was true
the<00:04:07.930> judges<00:04:08.349> would<00:04:08.530> certainly<00:04:09.340> be<00:04:09.669> on<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:10.389> and

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
the judges would certainly be on you and

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.270 
the judges would certainly be on you and
you'd<00:04:10.720> be<00:04:10.870> suspended<00:04:11.440> in<00:04:11.590> no<00:04:11.769> time

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
you'd be suspended in no time

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.699 
you'd be suspended in no time
and<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.910> other<00:04:13.239> part<00:04:13.630> is<00:04:13.810> we<00:04:13.989> race<00:04:14.470> with<00:04:14.680> our

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
and the other part is we race with our

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.370 
and the other part is we race with our
hand<00:04:15.099> holds<00:04:15.370> much<00:04:16.239> farther<00:04:16.539> back<00:04:16.870> than<00:04:16.900> we

hand holds much farther back than we
used<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:17.739> years<00:04:18.310> ago<00:04:18.489> and<00:04:19.109> if<00:04:20.109> you're<00:04:20.349> gonna

used to years ago and if you're gonna

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.230 
used to years ago and if you're gonna
rate<00:04:20.799> them<00:04:21.039> you<00:04:21.280> have<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.579> lean<00:04:21.760> back<00:04:21.970> in<00:04:22.150> the

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
rate them you have to lean back in the

rate them you have to lean back in the
sulky<00:04:22.630> you<00:04:22.900> just<00:04:23.110> can't<00:04:23.349> let<00:04:23.560> them<00:04:23.770> go<00:04:23.979> as<00:04:24.430> fast

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
sulky you just can't let them go as fast

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.430 
sulky you just can't let them go as fast
as<00:04:24.940> they<00:04:25.060> want<00:04:25.240> from<00:04:25.539> gate<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:25.930> finish<00:04:26.229> they'll

as they want from gate to finish they'll

as they want from gate to finish they'll
burn<00:04:26.650> out

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
burn out

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.060 
burn out
least<00:04:27.250> by<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.600> 3/4<00:04:28.600> if<00:04:28.750> not<00:04:28.930> sooner<00:04:29.230> so<00:04:29.560> you

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
least by the 3/4 if not sooner so you

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.280 
least by the 3/4 if not sooner so you
know<00:04:30.160> rating<00:04:30.610> them<00:04:30.790> and<00:04:31.510> with<00:04:31.810> their<00:04:32.020> hand

holds back back where they are it
appears<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:35.680> we're<00:04:35.890> holding<00:04:36.250> them<00:04:36.370> back<00:04:36.520> but

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
appears that we're holding them back but

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.150 
appears that we're holding them back but
we're<00:04:37.330> not<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:37.840> many<00:04:38.170> times<00:04:38.470> when<00:04:38.980> you're

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
we're not and many times when you're

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.470 
we're not and many times when you're
leaning<00:04:39.340> them<00:04:39.610> back<00:04:39.850> like<00:04:40.030> that<00:04:40.240> you're

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
leaning them back like that you're

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.210 
leaning them back like that you're
trying<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.840> get<00:04:40.960> out<00:04:41.110> of<00:04:41.140> the<00:04:41.260> wind<00:04:41.500> you're

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
trying to get out of the wind you're

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.380 
trying to get out of the wind you're
trying<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.520> keep<00:04:42.670> the<00:04:42.730> bit<00:04:43.030> in<00:04:43.120> their<00:04:43.240> mouth

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
trying to keep the bit in their mouth

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.460 
trying to keep the bit in their mouth
and<00:04:43.600> you're<00:04:43.690> trying<00:04:43.930> to<00:04:44.020> get<00:04:44.140> them<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.320> go

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
and you're trying to get them to go

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.340 
and you're trying to get them to go
faster<00:04:45.010> and<00:04:45.280> it's<00:04:45.790> it's<00:04:46.510> not<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:46.990> public

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
faster and it's it's not the public

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.890 
faster and it's it's not the public
perception<00:04:47.710> but<00:04:48.070> that's<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.430> way<00:04:48.580> it<00:04:48.730> is<00:04:48.900> I've

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
perception but that's the way it is I've

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.840 
perception but that's the way it is I've
always<00:04:50.170> found<00:04:50.470> driving<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:51.160> run<00:04:51.310> in<00:04:51.460> cycles

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
always found driving to run in cycles

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.690 
always found driving to run in cycles
when<00:04:52.240> you're<00:04:52.720> going<00:04:53.050> well<00:04:53.400> everything<00:04:54.400> comes

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
when you're going well everything comes

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.520 
when you're going well everything comes
easy<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.570> make<00:04:55.840> all<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.170> right<00:04:56.350> decisions

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
easy you make all the right decisions

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.190 
easy you make all the right decisions
and<00:04:57.100> even<00:04:57.850> if<00:04:57.940> you<00:04:58.030> make<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.210> bad<00:04:58.540> decision<00:04:58.720> in<00:04:59.110> a

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
and even if you make a bad decision in a

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.140 
and even if you make a bad decision in a
race<00:04:59.380> it'll<00:04:59.680> turn<00:04:59.830> out<00:05:00.040> well<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.520> the

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
race it'll turn out well and the

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.610 
race it'll turn out well and the
opposite<00:05:01.660> is<00:05:01.810> true<00:05:01.840> when<00:05:02.200> things<00:05:02.410> aren't

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
opposite is true when things aren't

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.190 
opposite is true when things aren't
going<00:05:02.830> well<00:05:02.950> you<00:05:03.280> just<00:05:03.520> don't<00:05:04.450> make<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.960> right

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
going well you just don't make the right

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.760 
going well you just don't make the right
moves

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
moves

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.760 
moves
and<00:05:05.920> even<00:05:06.580> if<00:05:06.670> they<00:05:06.820> usually<00:05:07.720> look<00:05:08.170> right<00:05:08.380> on

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
and even if they usually look right on

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.200 
and even if they usually look right on
paper<00:05:09.100> and<00:05:09.310> they<00:05:09.430> look<00:05:09.580> like<00:05:09.730> at<00:05:09.910> the<00:05:10.000> time

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
paper and they look like at the time

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.290 
paper and they look like at the time
they<00:05:10.390> don't<00:05:10.600> work<00:05:10.780> out<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:11.430> it's<00:05:12.430> it<00:05:12.880> just

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
they don't work out and it's it just

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.320 
they don't work out and it's it just
runs<00:05:13.540> like<00:05:13.720> that<00:05:13.960> for<00:05:14.680> your<00:05:14.800> confidence<00:05:15.330> it's

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
runs like that for your confidence it's

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.640 
runs like that for your confidence it's
certainly<00:05:16.630> a<00:05:16.720> game<00:05:16.870> of<00:05:17.050> confidence<00:05:17.500> even

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
certainly a game of confidence even
