00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.460
 we are students of 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.680
 baccalaureate and we are currently 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.770
 taking 4th semester in the school of 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.450
 sciences and humanities facing the east 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.430
 We carry out a documentary investigation 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.500
 which corresponds to the workshop material 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.470
 of reading writing and initiation to the 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.180
 documentary research 4 and the process 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.850
 by which we pass to the narrated to 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.410
 continuation before anything else is 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.809
 important to mention how it is that 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.480
 we come to the choice of sale theme 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.700
 legal and illegal of exotic animals in 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.380
 mexico federal district 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.060
 one day we meet in the class of 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.280
 biology studying the subject of 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.260
 density and since then he called us 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.810
 quite the attention the great variety of 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.579
 fauna that exists on our planet and 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.440
 as man has been deteriorating the 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.880
 little by little with their irresponsible 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.160
 Actions 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.410
 we also select this topic because the 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.600
 Most of the time it goes unnoticed 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.760
 despite having a great importance to 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.920
 our life as it brings with it 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.659
 various problems such as 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.240
 extinction of species and an imbalance 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.579
 in the ecosystem of them this 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.530
 directly affects mexico is a 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.250
 extremely rich country finds the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.530
 great fauna that 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.320
 its territory is a cultural heritage 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.630
 only something that makes us stand out in great 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.400
 However, the measure is not given 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.620
 importance due to this problem is 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.290
 say there is no awareness on the part 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.060
 of society is the general objective 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.950
 Within our research is 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.420
 inform people about the causes 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.369
 and consequences that the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.100
 legal and illegal purchase of animals 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.080
 exotic such as fish birds and 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.300
 reptiles in terms of objectives 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.310
 general, you will know in which part 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.830
 of the republic, the index of 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.440
 species traffic learn widely 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.690
 on the selected topic examine the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.580
 care given to these animals 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.500
 and make known the reasons for the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.810
 which is not good to buy animals 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.729
 exotic in order to persuade the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.160
 people through our study to 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.590
 depth also our study 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.420
 will revolve around a hypothesis this 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.550
 affirms that the main cause of 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.679
 legal and illegal sale of 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.810
 animals is the little knowledge that 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.850
 has the population on the subject and the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.800
 few actions that the government carries out 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.960
 to finish with this 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.880
 respect important to be considered in 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.100
 sources of information consulted for 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.930
 to be able to write our chapters and 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.960
 thanks to which our work 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.850
 charges a higher level of credibility the 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.250
 Most of them were obtained 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.510
 through the internet because it was where 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.120
 you find a bigger and better 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.060
 information the pages are from sites 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.480
 officers of the conabio semarnat between 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.820
 others 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.980
 newspaper articles taken from the 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.110
 line day and other pages more than 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.370
 newspapers not so recognized but yes 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.080
 true of blogs etcetera interview 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.760
 basal to its species coordinator 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.770
 invaders of the conabio amis abel 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.390
 gonzález martínez who told us about a 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.520
 consequence of great importance that 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.320
 brings with it the animal traffic is 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.570
 a phenomenon called species 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.880
 invasive the interview served us as 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.710
 a strong tool so times to it 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.020
 we managed to greatly complement the 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.300
 information in some chapters causes 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.130
 and consequences of illegal and illegal sale 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.810
 of exotic animals 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.590
 a series was also made 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.510
 of 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.849
 thanks in which some of 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.709
 our hypotheses were verified at 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.050
 apply the survey to a large amount 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.849
 of people the majority considered that 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.819
 the necessary information is not provided 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.640
 about the sale of exotic animals 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.980
 since they answered little and nothing to the 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.170
 ask how much information do you think 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.940
 gives us about the consequences that 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.040
 it brings with it the acquisition of birds 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.660
 reptiles and fish that are in danger of 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.519
 extinction 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.680
 so we highlight the fact that 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.510
 our research is true because 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.220
 is backed by a large 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.940
 variety of information sources 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.040
 quality interviews and surveys without a doubt 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.900
 some one of the main steps 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.239
 involved in the realization of 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.549
 our project was the development of 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.410
 a draft since from the beginning to 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.930
 do the delimitation of our theme 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.340
 we should be clear about what the 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.920
 topics that would encompass our 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.140
 investigation so we can inform ourselves 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.930
 about it and realize our 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.900
 start until the last chapter said 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.250
 punteo scheme was modified 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.109
 because new ones are emerging 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.330
 important topics 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.460
 and a higher level of work analysis 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.590
 for the realization of the draft 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.409
 we also make summary sheets 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.389
 to leave and comments this we 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:34.159
 allowed to select and analyze the 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.409
 most important information of all 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:38.210
 our sources consult the process 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.789
 of research was quite difficult 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.439
 From the beginning, you did not have any 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.020
 idea of where to start looking 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:47.840
 information was not easy to find 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.460
 True or reliable sources do not 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.340
 However, the experiences obtained 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.319
 during the attempt to access and collect 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.360
 information were pretty good 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.699
 because we develop a sense of 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.490
 analytical enough research 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.069
 besides understanding and recognizing that 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.500
 definitely buying and selling either 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:09.250
 illegal or legal of exotic animals 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.500
 It should be terminated forbidden mind 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.960
 on the other hand as a team we went through 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.610
 many adversities mainly the 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.490
 lack of time and sometimes 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.770
 of communication what caused a great 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.210
 stress on the equipment generating certain 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.150
 little discussions 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.770
 it really was not easy without 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.389
 However, we believe that in the end we 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.370
 we carry the reward of having 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.289
 learned something and the satisfaction of 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.880
 believe that maybe our work can 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.669
 be used for the benefit of the 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.590
 society we finally hope that those 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.300
 objectives that were initially 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.699
 Regarding the subject that we decided 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.560
 address and expand that 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.470
 awareness on the part of society 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.789
 What is missing so much so that 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.400
 Legal and illegal sale of animals 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.750
 Exotic change course and stop 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.750
 affect as it has always done
