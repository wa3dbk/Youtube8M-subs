pretty<00:03:42.060> cool<00:03:42.239> but<00:03:42.599> again<00:03:43.049> it<00:03:43.440> slows<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.099> down

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
pretty cool but again it slows it down

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.280 
pretty cool but again it slows it down
quite<00:03:44.669> a<00:03:44.700> bit<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.599> could<00:03:45.750> crash<00:03:45.989> your

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
quite a bit and it could crash your

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.099 
quite a bit and it could crash your
messages<00:03:47.120> application<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.359> i<00:03:48.540> suggest

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
messages application so i suggest

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.270 
messages application so i suggest
turning<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.380> off<00:03:49.440> its<00:03:49.799> cool<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.130> all<00:03:50.250> but

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
turning that off its cool and all but

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.000 
turning that off its cool and all but
it's<00:03:50.549> not<00:03:50.910> necessary<00:03:51.540> honestly<00:03:52.079> but<00:03:52.859> if<00:03:52.919> you

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
it's not necessary honestly but if you

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.620 
it's not necessary honestly but if you
were<00:03:53.099> into<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.340> kind<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.700> thing<00:03:53.790> then<00:03:54.150> that's

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
were into that kind of thing then that's

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.080 
were into that kind of thing then that's
definitely<00:03:54.900> something<00:03:55.650> cool<00:03:55.950> for<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:56.819> I'm
