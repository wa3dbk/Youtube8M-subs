00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello to all so today we're going 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.299
 introduce you to our amusement park 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.020
 so months away start the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.230
 presentations 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.400
 so we will start with the boat 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.260
 so the boat had to be as if they 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:20.430
 know of rubber bands like that here the city 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.490
 of this boat here the company also see 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.279
 or does not have if elastics 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.670
 I want you to show her 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.929
 share the mother of our action we go 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.950
 try to make a version anyway 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:40.079
 improved boat so here it is 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.020
 will go to the second ride is 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.829
 the elevator of the me then that 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.829
 works like this 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.980
 then we will go to the elevator is 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.259
 an assassin finally naming can not say 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.470
 it's still pretty fucked up 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.119
 unless she gets out of the black 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:20.460
 but I do not advise you to 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:24.250
 take in place of gostai and then 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.070
 we have the chairs that turns then 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.259
 here are the chairs so that's it 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.960
 simple it is necessary to put the number of 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.429
 cults that you want it depends emit 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.340
 something why solidify a 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:43.060
 little plate like that and then another 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.090
 plate also let's quote fine of two on the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.000
 length you chose on the 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.240
 width you chose actually 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.700
 you the clip is like that there 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.830
 imply it makes you a swing or 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.450
 a chair as you call them and 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.310
 then precisely for that falls like that 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.840
 please use a spinning coin 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.810
 like that as you can see there and 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.010
 I 'll tell you to show it to you 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:16.569
 like that here we can also do more 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.879
 but here is the second last 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.239
 it's not an attraction does not know for the 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:25.480
 park center a kif that turns in the 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:31.629
 park during semprun who who travels like 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.430
 that and who who turns this way 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.879
 mixes fear kills her for example 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.489
 and then we turn like that then we have 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.930
 sweeper for even as the park 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.250
 either is clean 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.750
 so that's all that and then 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.760
