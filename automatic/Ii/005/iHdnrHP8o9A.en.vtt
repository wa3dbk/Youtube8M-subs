it so it actually is very good and um i

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.420 
it so it actually is very good and um i
actually<00:00:45.690> use<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.410> myself<00:00:46.559> eating<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.399> I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
actually use it myself eating so I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.040 
actually use it myself eating so I
developed<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> could<00:00:48.570> use<00:00:48.870> it

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
developed it so that I could use it

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.439 
developed it so that I could use it
myself<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.710> all<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.430> idea<00:00:50.789> kind<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.210> was

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
myself and all the idea kind of was

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.200 
myself and all the idea kind of was
inspired<00:00:51.629> by<00:00:52.050> City<00:00:52.829> tweaks<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.879> kind<00:00:54.149> of

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
inspired by City tweaks that do kind of

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.420 
inspired by City tweaks that do kind of
similar<00:00:54.420> things<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:55.020> shows<00:00:55.320> cpu<00:00:56.190> usage

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
similar things like shows cpu usage

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.330 
similar things like shows cpu usage
allow<00:00:57.329> toggling<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.469> off<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.649> things<00:00:59.070> I

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
allow toggling on and off of things I

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.580 
allow toggling on and off of things I
hope<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.879> implement<00:01:00.329> more<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.780> i<00:01:00.960> get<00:01:01.140> reviews

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
hope to implement more as i get reviews

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.709 
hope to implement more as i get reviews

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.890 
on startup so essentially are the the
idea<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:38.329> toggles<00:01:39.329> will<00:01:39.479> always<00:01:39.780> be

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
idea is that the toggles will always be

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.219 
idea is that the toggles will always be
accessible<00:01:40.770> by<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.030> SAS<00:01:42.030> bar<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.810> that's<00:01:43.020> why

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
accessible by the SAS bar so that's why

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.289 
accessible by the SAS bar so that's why
this<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:44.070> nice<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.149> you're

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
this is really nice to have so you're

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.819 
this is really nice to have so you're
going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.540> want<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.780> check<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.680> way

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
going to want to check that on that way

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.649 
going to want to check that on that way
it's<00:01:47.399> always<00:01:47.579> there<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.420> always

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
it's always there so you can always

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.999 
it's always there so you can always
access<00:01:48.840> these<00:01:49.170> things<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.590> don't<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
access these things so you don't have to

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.069 
access these things so you don't have to
open<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.369> application<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.390> access<00:01:51.960> these

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
open the application then access these

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.960 
open the application then access these
things<00:01:52.380> by<00:01:52.619> then<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.040> time<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.579> kind<00:01:53.880> of

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
things by then the time and kind of

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.760 
things by then the time and kind of
difference<00:01:54.360> doesn't<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:54.869> work<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.380> we're

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
difference doesn't really work so we're

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.870 
difference doesn't really work so we're
going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.950> go<00:01:55.979> ahead<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.219> dismiss<00:01:56.460> this

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
going to go ahead and dismiss this

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.700 
going to go ahead and dismiss this
window<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.420> then<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.079> actually<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.590> go

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
window and then we can actually just go

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.179 
window and then we can actually just go
up<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.880> we<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.299> two<00:02:01.189> wrenches

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
up here and see we have the two wrenches

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.760 
up here and see we have the two wrenches
and<00:02:02.579> then<00:02:03.090> we<00:02:03.509> will<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> high<00:02:04.380> doll<00:02:04.560> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
and then we will have the high doll and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.020 
and then we will have the high doll and
show<00:02:04.890> all<00:02:05.070> function<00:02:05.490> which<00:02:05.670> will<00:02:05.820> go<00:02:05.939> ahead

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
show all function which will go ahead

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.119 
show all function which will go ahead
and<00:02:06.210> show<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:07.350> let's<00:02:07.380> go<00:02:07.680> ahead<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.920> open

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
and show you so let's go ahead and open

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.040 
and show you so let's go ahead and open
up<00:02:08.399> let's<00:02:08.879> say<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.330> all<00:02:09.569> these<00:02:09.780> windows

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
up let's say we have all these windows

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.020 
up let's say we have all these windows
scattered<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.340> doesn't<00:02:11.580> have<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.790> be<00:02:11.819> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
scattered and it doesn't have to be the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.910 
scattered and it doesn't have to be the
same<00:02:12.239> application<00:02:12.959> let's<00:02:13.230> just<00:02:13.379> go<00:02:13.470> ahead

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
same application let's just go ahead

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.339 
same application let's just go ahead
and<00:02:14.010> open<00:02:14.130> up<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.459> different<00:02:14.880> browser<00:02:15.450> open

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
and open up the different browser open

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.440 
and open up the different browser open
up<00:02:16.440> ichat<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.819> can<00:02:18.000> see<00:02:18.150> all<00:02:18.180> these

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
up ichat and you can see all these

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.059 
up ichat and you can see all these
things<00:02:18.690> are<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:18.870> stacked<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.709> is<00:02:19.860> just

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
things are just stacked and this is just

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.339 
things are just stacked and this is just
a<00:02:20.220> mess<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.790> my<00:02:20.970> desktop<00:02:21.510> let's<00:02:22.050> say<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.260> just

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.530 
a mess of my desktop let's say I just
need<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.890> go<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.099> finder<00:02:23.760> let's<00:02:24.180> just<00:02:24.300> click

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.080 
these windows just with a simple click
of<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.650> button<00:02:28.709> if<00:02:29.160> we<00:02:29.610> want<00:02:29.819> all<00:02:29.940> those

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090

show all so this will bring up all these
windows<00:02:35.010> which<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.790> pretty<00:02:36.090> annoying<00:02:36.480> but<00:02:37.080> you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
windows which is pretty annoying but you

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.309 
windows which is pretty annoying but you
can<00:02:37.500> do<00:02:37.739> that<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.069> so<00:02:39.030> that's<00:02:39.300> what<00:02:39.840> that's

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
can do that and so that's what that's

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.380 
can do that and so that's what that's
the<00:02:40.500> main<00:02:40.739> idea<00:02:40.980> behind<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:42.030> was<00:02:42.209> one

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
the main idea behind this that was one

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.360 
the main idea behind this that was one
of<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.540> ideas<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.989> had<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.319> long<00:02:43.739> time<00:02:43.950> ago<00:02:44.069> in<00:02:44.280> an

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
of the ideas I had a long time ago in an

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.910 
of the ideas I had a long time ago in an
application<00:02:44.519> but<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.989> uh<00:02:46.260> nuh<00:02:46.319> loan<00:02:46.709> in

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
application but just that uh nuh loan in

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.240 
application but just that uh nuh loan in
an<00:02:47.040> application<00:02:47.190> wouldn't<00:02:47.970> do<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.980> next

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
an application wouldn't do it the next

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.250 
an application wouldn't do it the next
thing<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.819> can<00:02:50.970> clear<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.450> DNS<00:02:51.810> cache<00:02:51.989> a

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
thing is you can clear the DNS cache a

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.809 
thing is you can clear the DNS cache a
this<00:02:52.709> is<00:02:52.890> good<00:02:53.100> if<00:02:53.250> you're<00:02:53.280> having<00:02:53.670> issues

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
this is good if you're having issues

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.180 
this is good if you're having issues
loading<00:02:54.209> websites<00:02:54.810> let's<00:02:55.290> say<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.500> have<00:02:55.950> a

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
loading websites let's say you have a

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.910 
loading websites let's say you have a
bad<00:02:56.730> cachet<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:58.260> just<00:02:58.440> need<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.680> clear

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
bad cachet and you just need to clear

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.860 
bad cachet and you just need to clear
that<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.220> get<00:02:59.340> cash<00:02:59.850> aid<00:03:00.090> that's<00:03:00.269> usually<00:03:00.660> good

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
that to get cash aid that's usually good

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.720 
that to get cash aid that's usually good

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
is free ram which actually frees up a

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.770 
is free ram which actually frees up a
lot<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.250> RAM<00:03:11.459> I'll<00:03:11.640> show<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:11.910> later<00:03:12.390> oh

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
lot of RAM I'll show you that later oh

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.960 
lot of RAM I'll show you that later oh
you<00:03:13.019> can<00:03:13.470> use<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.769> through<00:03:14.069> system<00:03:14.489> info<00:03:14.819> you

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
you can use that through system info you

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.759 
you can use that through system info you
can<00:03:15.030> view<00:03:15.239> your<00:03:15.299> RAM<00:03:15.690> stats<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.290> then<00:03:16.380> after

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
can view your RAM stats and then after

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.920 
can view your RAM stats and then after
using<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.459> free<00:03:17.670> ram<00:03:17.910> toggle<00:03:18.359> you<00:03:18.720> can<00:03:18.840> go

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
using the free ram toggle you can go

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.140 
using the free ram toggle you can go
ahead<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.109> check<00:03:19.440> what's<00:03:20.040> going<00:03:20.310> on<00:03:20.430> there<00:03:20.670> so

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
ahead and check what's going on there so

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.360 
ahead and check what's going on there so
the<00:03:21.269> free<00:03:21.450> ram<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.840> really<00:03:22.320> great<00:03:22.500> thing<00:03:23.010> and

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
the free ram is a really great thing and

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.039 
the free ram is a really great thing and
all<00:03:23.850> these<00:03:24.090> things<00:03:24.150> are<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:24.540> easily

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
just execute that the next part right

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.440 
just execute that the next part right
here<00:03:31.320> is<00:03:31.620> we<00:03:31.769> have<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.160> local<00:03:32.579> IP<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.060> public

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
here is we have the local IP and public

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.870 
here is we have the local IP and public
IP<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:34.260> can<00:03:34.380> see<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.650> my<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.799> public<00:03:35.489> IP<00:03:35.670> is

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
IP you can see that my I public IP is

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.789 
IP you can see that my I public IP is
covered<00:03:36.299> up<00:03:36.450> but<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:36.930> will<00:03:37.079> get<00:03:37.260> your<00:03:37.440> public

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
covered up but it will get your public

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.949 
covered up but it will get your public
IP<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.400> can<00:03:38.519> actually<00:03:38.730> access<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.630> very

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
IP so you can actually access that very

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.170 
IP so you can actually access that very
easily<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.950> next<00:03:41.190> part<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.640> have<00:03:41.760> cpu

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
easily the next part is you have cpu

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.170 
easily the next part is you have cpu
stats<00:03:42.630> so<00:03:43.200> cpu<00:03:43.590> stats<00:03:43.829> is<00:03:44.010> very<00:03:44.220> simple<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.790> it

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
stats so cpu stats is very simple you it

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.960 
stats so cpu stats is very simple you it
shows<00:03:45.510> what<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.320> current<00:03:46.530> usage<00:03:46.980> is<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.370> this

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
shows what the current usage is and this

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.490 
shows what the current usage is and this
is<00:03:48.030> actually<00:03:48.450> taking<00:03:48.750> away<00:03:48.870> from<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.200> shell

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
is actually taking away from the shell

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.890 
is actually taking away from the shell
script<00:03:49.829> so<00:03:50.489> this<00:03:50.640> is<00:03:50.670> exactly<00:03:51.180> what<00:03:51.510> terminal

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
script so this is exactly what terminal

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.199 
script so this is exactly what terminal
outputs<00:03:52.410> when<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:52.650> use<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.130> command<00:03:53.430> top<00:03:53.760> it

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
outputs when you use the command top it

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.199 
outputs when you use the command top it
just<00:03:54.239> parses<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.170> string<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:56.489> that<00:03:56.700> is<00:03:56.970> how

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
just parses that string but that is how

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.670 
just parses that string but that is how
it<00:03:57.239> gets<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.079> complete<00:03:58.500> and

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
it gets that that is complete and

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.740 
it gets that that is complete and
accurate<00:03:59.040> information<00:03:59.640> right<00:04:00.239> from<00:04:00.269> the

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
accurate information right from the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.050 
accurate information right from the
terminal<00:04:01.260> command<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:02.340> next<00:04:02.579> part<00:04:02.760> is<00:04:02.880> we

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
terminal command the next part is we

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.849 
terminal command the next part is we
have<00:04:03.180> ram<00:04:03.420> sets<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:04.319> you<00:04:04.410> can<00:04:04.530> see<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.709> we

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
have ram sets so you can see that we

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.729 
have ram sets so you can see that we
have<00:04:04.890> 590<00:04:05.489> megabytes<00:04:06.209> off<00:04:06.390> free<00:04:06.660> because<00:04:07.500> this

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
have 590 megabytes off free because this

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.470 
have 590 megabytes off free because this
computer<00:04:08.100> only<00:04:08.250> has<00:04:08.430> four<00:04:08.700> gigabytes<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.239> ram

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
computer only has four gigabytes of ram

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.420 
computer only has four gigabytes of ram
so<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.019> is<00:04:10.170> definitely<00:04:10.410> nice<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:10.829> have<00:04:11.220> the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
so it is definitely nice to have the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.039 
so it is definitely nice to have the
free<00:04:11.670> ram<00:04:11.880> toggle<00:04:12.299> when<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:12.540> have<00:04:12.690> a<00:04:12.720> lower

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
free ram toggle when you have a lower

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.140 
free ram toggle when you have a lower
end<00:04:13.350> machine<00:04:13.769> so<00:04:14.310> we're<00:04:14.489> going<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.819> go<00:04:14.850> over

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
end machine so we're going to go over

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.909 
end machine so we're going to go over
here<00:04:15.569> we're<00:04:15.750> going<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:15.930> hit<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.200> free<00:04:16.440> ram<00:04:16.650> and

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
here we're going to hit the free ram and

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.460 
here we're going to hit the free ram and
what<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.789> can<00:04:17.940> tell<00:04:18.180> it's<00:04:18.419> still<00:04:18.660> using<00:04:19.350> the

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
what you can tell it's still using the

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.469 
what you can tell it's still using the
command<00:04:19.829> because<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.519> it<00:04:20.729> is<00:04:20.880> blue<00:04:21.120> up<00:04:21.150> there

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
command because the it is blue up there

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.380 
command because the it is blue up there
once<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.109> blue<00:04:22.380> kind<00:04:23.070> of<00:04:23.130> leaves<00:04:23.430> it<00:04:23.849> like

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
once the blue kind of leaves it like

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.060 
once the blue kind of leaves it like
leaves<00:04:24.659> from<00:04:24.900> there<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.560> know<00:04:25.770> that<00:04:25.919> the

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
leaves from there you know that the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.890 
leaves from there you know that the
command<00:04:26.460> off

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
command off

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.360 
command off
finish<00:04:27.110> so<00:04:27.590> we're<00:04:27.710> just<00:04:27.740> going<00:04:27.979> to<00:04:28.100> go<00:04:28.280> ahead

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
finish so we're just going to go ahead

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.370 
finish so we're just going to go ahead
and<00:04:28.639> open<00:04:28.759> up<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.240> window<00:04:29.750> again<00:04:29.870> we're<00:04:30.229> going

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
and open up the window again we're going

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.310 
and open up the window again we're going
to<00:04:30.440> go<00:04:30.500> back<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:30.680> CP<00:04:31.210> system<00:04:32.210> info<00:04:32.570> then<00:04:33.110> back

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
to go back to CP system info then back

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.570 
to go back to CP system info then back
to<00:04:33.470> ram<00:04:33.680> stats<00:04:33.979> you<00:04:34.190> can<00:04:34.280> see<00:04:34.340> that<00:04:34.370> we<00:04:34.550> have

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
to ram stats you can see that we have

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.210 
to ram stats you can see that we have
780<00:04:35.360> megabyte<00:04:35.960> sorry<00:04:36.199> the<00:04:36.650> reason<00:04:36.919> why<00:04:36.979> is<00:04:37.039> not

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
780 megabyte sorry the reason why is not

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.129 
780 megabyte sorry the reason why is not
clearing<00:04:37.460> up<00:04:37.639> so<00:04:37.910> much<00:04:38.090> is<00:04:38.330> because<00:04:38.570> we<00:04:38.900> still

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
clearing up so much is because we still

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.379 
clearing up so much is because we still
have<00:04:39.350> quite<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:39.919> bit<00:04:39.979> open<00:04:40.430> so<00:04:40.940> if<00:04:41.030> we<00:04:41.090> go<00:04:41.270> ahead

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
have quite a bit open so if we go ahead

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.439 
have quite a bit open so if we go ahead
and<00:04:41.509> close<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.900> few<00:04:42.380> windows<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:43.330> all<00:04:44.330> the

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
and close a few windows and all the

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.540 
and close a few windows and all the
other<00:04:44.630> thing<00:04:44.840> is<00:04:44.870> I'm<00:04:45.110> screen<00:04:45.410> recording<00:04:45.979> by<00:04:46.520> a

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
other thing is I'm screen recording by a

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.670 
other thing is I'm screen recording by a
screen<00:04:47.449> flow<00:04:47.630> that<00:04:47.840> takes<00:04:48.050> up<00:04:48.199> quite<00:04:48.410> a<00:04:48.440> bit<00:04:48.590> of

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
screen flow that takes up quite a bit of

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.560 
screen flow that takes up quite a bit of
memory<00:04:48.949> but<00:04:49.400> if<00:04:49.460> we<00:04:49.520> go<00:04:49.639> ahead<00:04:49.759> and<00:04:49.910> close<00:04:50.300> out

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
memory but if we go ahead and close out

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.450 
memory but if we go ahead and close out
a<00:04:50.630> few<00:04:50.870> these<00:04:51.080> windows<00:04:51.470> obviously<00:04:52.070> this<00:04:52.250> will

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
a few these windows obviously this will

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.999 
a few these windows obviously this will
cut<00:04:52.759> out<00:04:53.000> on<00:04:53.330> some<00:04:53.750> ramp<00:04:54.259> so<00:04:54.710> let's<00:04:54.860> go<00:04:54.979> ahead

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
cut out on some ramp so let's go ahead

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.100 
cut out on some ramp so let's go ahead
and<00:04:55.190> do<00:04:55.370> that<00:04:55.400> will<00:04:55.729> take<00:04:56.030> out<00:04:56.210> Firefox<00:04:56.750> out<00:04:56.960> of

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
and do that will take out Firefox out of

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.230 
and do that will take out Firefox out of
here<00:04:57.289> and<00:04:57.440> let's<00:04:58.220> go<00:04:58.340> ahead<00:04:58.430> and<00:04:58.550> execute<00:04:59.030> that

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
here and let's go ahead and execute that

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.750 
here and let's go ahead and execute that
free<00:04:59.600> ram<00:04:59.870> again<00:05:00.470> so<00:05:01.100> now<00:05:01.190> you<00:05:01.310> can<00:05:01.460> see<00:05:01.610> that

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
free ram again so now you can see that

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.310 
free ram again so now you can see that
we<00:05:01.820> have<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:02.060> blue<00:05:02.240> again<00:05:02.539> and<00:05:02.840> then<00:05:02.960> let's<00:05:03.199> go

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
we have the blue again and then let's go

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.980 
we have the blue again and then let's go
ahead<00:05:03.410> and<00:05:03.530> open<00:05:03.889> it<00:05:03.979> up<00:05:04.130> there<00:05:05.000> is<00:05:05.030> a<00:05:05.180> timer<00:05:05.810> so

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
ahead and open it up there is a timer so

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.590 
ahead and open it up there is a timer so
it<00:05:06.410> updates<00:05:07.010> that<00:05:07.160> info<00:05:07.669> every<00:05:08.030> five<00:05:08.180> seconds

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
it updates that info every five seconds

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.240 
it updates that info every five seconds
so<00:05:08.690> it<00:05:08.750> doesn't<00:05:09.020> use<00:05:09.139> too<00:05:09.289> much<00:05:09.410> memory<00:05:09.770> now

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
so it doesn't use too much memory now

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.790 
so it doesn't use too much memory now
you<00:05:10.310> can<00:05:10.729> see<00:05:10.880> that<00:05:11.000> we<00:05:11.090> have<00:05:11.120> 1478<00:05:12.110> megabytes

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
you can see that we have 1478 megabytes

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.770 
you can see that we have 1478 megabytes
free<00:05:13.039> so<00:05:13.520> that<00:05:13.699> definitely<00:05:13.940> is<00:05:14.240> a<00:05:14.270> really

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
free so that definitely is a really

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.980 
free so that definitely is a really
great<00:05:15.310> deal<00:05:16.310> too<00:05:16.669> we<00:05:17.180> have<00:05:17.270> that<00:05:17.449> ransom

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
great deal too we have that ransom

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.510 
great deal too we have that ransom

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
sometimes when you start up a virtual

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.969 
sometimes when you start up a virtual
machine<00:05:20.090> and<00:05:20.419> you<00:05:20.960> need<00:05:21.169> to<00:05:21.289> clear<00:05:21.680> up<00:05:21.860> that

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
machine and you need to clear up that

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.040 
machine and you need to clear up that
ramp<00:05:22.280> you<00:05:22.789> can<00:05:22.970> go<00:05:23.090> ahead<00:05:23.180> and<00:05:23.300> do<00:05:23.510> that<00:05:23.539> after

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
ramp you can go ahead and do that after

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.990 
ramp you can go ahead and do that after
you<00:05:24.139> shut<00:05:24.320> down<00:05:24.349> your<00:05:24.500> machine<00:05:24.740> so<00:05:25.610> the<00:05:25.849> other

is<00:06:16.880> a<00:06:16.909> blue<00:06:17.270> part<00:06:17.630> right<00:06:17.780> here<00:06:17.810> where<00:06:18.320> the<00:06:18.500> the

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
is a blue part right here where the the

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.100 
is a blue part right here where the the
quick<00:06:19.220> toggles<00:06:19.400> icon<00:06:19.820> is<00:06:20.240> that<00:06:20.750> tells<00:06:20.990> you

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
quick toggles icon is that tells you

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.529 
quick toggles icon is that tells you
that<00:06:21.260> the<00:06:21.409> command<00:06:21.770> is<00:06:21.919> still<00:06:22.220> going<00:06:22.520> so<00:06:23.180> that

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
that the command is still going so that

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.000 
that the command is still going so that
is<00:06:23.720> really<00:06:23.750> cool<00:06:24.169> and<00:06:24.229> then<00:06:24.500> we<00:06:24.620> can<00:06:24.770> pause<00:06:24.979> it

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
is really cool and then we can pause it

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.159 
is really cool and then we can pause it
as<00:06:25.370> well<00:06:27.880> the<00:06:28.880> next<00:06:29.180> part<00:06:29.419> is<00:06:29.599> you<00:06:29.900> can<00:06:29.930> go

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
as well the next part is you can go

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:32.500 
as well the next part is you can go
ahead<00:06:30.289> and<00:06:30.500> use<00:06:30.889> app<00:06:31.490> shortcuts<00:06:32.030> so<00:06:32.389> we're

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
ahead and use app shortcuts so we're

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.149 
ahead and use app shortcuts so we're
just<00:06:32.539> going<00:06:32.750> to<00:06:32.930> hide<00:06:33.080> the<00:06:33.349> iTunes<00:06:33.740> window<00:06:33.949> you

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159 
just going to hide the iTunes window you

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.980 
just going to hide the iTunes window you
can<00:06:34.340> see<00:06:34.400> how<00:06:34.669> that<00:06:34.699> high<00:06:35.150> def<00:06:35.450> function<00:06:35.870> is

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
can see how that high def function is

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.200 
can see how that high def function is
sometimes<00:06:36.409> pretty<00:06:36.680> useful<00:06:36.950> and<00:06:37.370> so<00:06:37.969> we<00:06:38.090> go

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
sometimes pretty useful and so we go

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.820 
sometimes pretty useful and so we go
ahead<00:06:38.419> and<00:06:38.599> do<00:06:38.690> that<00:06:38.719> and<00:06:39.080> we<00:06:39.440> have<00:06:39.560> the<00:06:39.680> app

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
ahead and do that and we have the app

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.830 
ahead and do that and we have the app
shortcuts<00:06:40.340> so<00:06:40.460> we<00:06:40.550> can

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
shortcuts so we can

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.230 
shortcuts so we can
put<00:06:40.930> up<00:06:41.020> system<00:06:41.380> preferences<00:06:41.919> very<00:06:42.520> easily<00:06:42.760> we

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
put up system preferences very easily we

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.090 
put up system preferences very easily we
just<00:06:43.480> open<00:06:43.750> up<00:06:43.810> system<00:06:44.169> preferences<00:06:44.650> it's

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
just open up system preferences it's

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.070 
just open up system preferences it's
fully<00:06:45.370> accessible<00:06:45.820> then<00:06:46.540> we<00:06:46.660> can<00:06:46.810> go<00:06:46.930> back

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
fully accessible then we can go back

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.560 
fully accessible then we can go back
over<00:06:47.470> to<00:06:47.650> our<00:06:47.680> quick<00:06:48.040> toggles<00:06:48.220> menu<00:06:48.790> and<00:06:49.000> we

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
over to our quick toggles menu and we

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.080 
over to our quick toggles menu and we
can<00:06:49.720> go<00:06:49.840> ahead<00:06:49.990> and<00:06:50.199> access<00:06:50.979> the<00:06:51.190> internet<00:06:51.669> so

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
can go ahead and access the internet so

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.820 
can go ahead and access the internet so
this<00:06:52.270> will<00:06:52.479> detect<00:06:53.020> what<00:06:53.260> your<00:06:53.410> native

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
this will detect what your native

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.030 
this will detect what your native
browser<00:06:54.790> is<00:06:55.240> so<00:06:55.600> whatever<00:06:56.199> default<00:06:56.889> browser

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040 
browser is so whatever default browser

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.100 
browser is so whatever default browser
you<00:06:57.370> have<00:06:57.639> it<00:06:58.060> will<00:06:58.300> go<00:06:58.449> ahead<00:06:58.540> and<00:06:58.780> load<00:06:58.930> that

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
you have it will go ahead and load that

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.200 
you have it will go ahead and load that
up<00:06:59.139> next<00:06:59.919> one<00:07:00.040> we<00:07:00.310> have<00:07:00.460> is<00:07:00.610> mail<00:07:00.880> I'm<00:07:01.180> not

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
up next one we have is mail I'm not

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.760 
up next one we have is mail I'm not
going<00:07:01.300> to<00:07:01.479> open<00:07:01.660> up<00:07:01.780> mail<00:07:02.020> because<00:07:02.290> it's<00:07:02.530> on<00:07:02.620> my

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
going to open up mail because it's on my

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.650 
going to open up mail because it's on my
other<00:07:02.889> screen<00:07:03.190> and<00:07:03.580> then<00:07:03.970> we<00:07:04.090> have<00:07:04.240> a<00:07:04.270> text

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:04.660

other screen and then we have a text
edit<00:07:04.900> which<00:07:05.020> will<00:07:05.199> open<00:07:05.380> up<00:07:05.560> a<00:07:05.650> new<00:07:05.680> text<00:07:06.250> edit

document so right there we have text
edit<00:07:09.190> it<00:07:09.310> opens<00:07:09.639> up<00:07:09.699> a<00:07:09.820> new<00:07:09.850> text<00:07:10.300> document<00:07:10.330> and

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 
edit it opens up a new text document and

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.830 
edit it opens up a new text document and
very<00:07:11.530> simple<00:07:11.979> and<00:07:12.490> then<00:07:12.669> the<00:07:12.790> last<00:07:12.970> part<00:07:13.240> is<00:07:13.540> we

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 
very simple and then the last part is we

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.350 
very simple and then the last part is we
have<00:07:13.930> the<00:07:14.050> about<00:07:14.350> application<00:07:15.130> and<00:07:15.340> then<00:07:15.850> this

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 
have the about application and then this

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.570 
have the about application and then this
just<00:07:16.660> shows<00:07:16.870> what<00:07:16.930> the<00:07:17.320> version<00:07:17.740> is<00:07:17.919> and<00:07:18.130> then

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580 
just shows what the version is and then

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.980 
just shows what the version is and then
the<00:07:18.700> last<00:07:18.880> thing<00:07:19.060> is<00:07:19.210> we<00:07:19.540> have<00:07:19.690> the<00:07:19.840> actual

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 
the last thing is we have the actual

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.409 
the last thing is we have the actual
preferences<00:07:20.860> which<00:07:21.310> will<00:07:21.520> add<00:07:21.729> more<00:07:22.030> and<00:07:22.240> that

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:22.419 
preferences which will add more and that

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:24.659 
preferences which will add more and that
brings<00:07:22.570> up<00:07:22.780> the<00:07:22.930> welcome<00:07:23.740> /<00:07:24.010> preferences

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:24.669 
brings up the welcome / preferences

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:27.300 
brings up the welcome / preferences
window<00:07:24.910> so<00:07:25.450> overall<00:07:25.840> this<00:07:26.260> Scott<00:07:26.590> application

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
window so overall this Scott application

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.969 
window so overall this Scott application
actually<00:07:27.460> has<00:07:27.729> a<00:07:27.760> lot<00:07:28.120> into<00:07:28.510> it<00:07:28.540> I<00:07:28.810> spent<00:07:29.410> well

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:29.979 
actually has a lot into it I spent well

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:33.029 
actually has a lot into it I spent well
over<00:07:30.060> 24<00:07:31.060> hours<00:07:31.240> of<00:07:31.510> straight<00:07:32.080> computer

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 
over 24 hours of straight computer

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:35.520 
over 24 hours of straight computer
programming<00:07:33.639> on<00:07:33.760> this<00:07:34.210> I<00:07:34.419> spent<00:07:35.229> a<00:07:35.260> lot<00:07:35.500> of

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:35.530 
programming on this I spent a lot of

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.590 
programming on this I spent a lot of
time<00:07:35.650> and<00:07:35.979> I<00:07:36.039> really<00:07:36.340> hope<00:07:36.520> that<00:07:36.700> a<00:07:36.789> lot<00:07:37.570> of

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:37.600 
time and I really hope that a lot of

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.300 
time and I really hope that a lot of
people<00:07:37.690> start<00:07:38.139> using<00:07:38.200> this<00:07:38.650> I<00:07:38.800> think<00:07:38.889> that<00:07:39.190> is

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.310 
people start using this I think that is

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.950 
people start using this I think that is
definitely<00:07:39.699> an<00:07:39.760> application<00:07:40.300> that<00:07:40.330> is<00:07:40.539> usable

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 
definitely an application that is usable

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.719 
definitely an application that is usable
in<00:07:41.229> both<00:07:42.160> user<00:07:42.639> or<00:07:43.030> advanced<00:07:43.810> users<00:07:44.260> to<00:07:45.160> use

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:45.729 
in both user or advanced users to use

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:47.340 
in both user or advanced users to use
this<00:07:45.970> because<00:07:46.270> you<00:07:46.419> can<00:07:46.570> use<00:07:46.720> it<00:07:46.870> to<00:07:46.960> free<00:07:47.200> up

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:47.350 
this because you can use it to free up

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.020 
this because you can use it to free up
around<00:07:47.470> make<00:07:47.800> your<00:07:47.979> computer<00:07:48.130> faster<00:07:48.460> that's

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.030 
around make your computer faster that's

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.760 
around make your computer faster that's
what<00:07:49.180> that's<00:07:49.360> all<00:07:49.479> RAM<00:07:49.750> freaking<00:07:50.260> gram<00:07:50.500> is

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:50.770 
what that's all RAM freaking gram is

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.400 
what that's all RAM freaking gram is
just<00:07:51.520> freeze<00:07:51.760> up<00:07:51.789> the<00:07:52.000> memory<00:07:52.510> and<00:07:52.750> so<00:07:53.260> that

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:53.410 
just freeze up the memory and so that

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.529 
just freeze up the memory and so that
you<00:07:53.470> can<00:07:53.620> make<00:07:53.860> a<00:07:53.889> computer<00:07:54.400> faster<00:07:54.610> so<00:07:55.510> that

00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:55.539 
you can make a computer faster so that
