00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
announce that I just completed and so I

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.200 
announce that I just completed and so I
will<00:00:13.650> be<00:00:13.830> bringing<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.460> lot<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.639> information

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
will be bringing a lot of information

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.670 
will be bringing a lot of information
that<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.360> learned<00:00:15.570> from<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:15.780> into<00:00:16.529> this

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
that I learned from that into this

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.890 
that I learned from that into this
website<00:00:17.070> because<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.400> think<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.420> is

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
website because I think that it is

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.620 
website because I think that it is
intimately<00:00:19.680> related<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.520> what<00:00:21.210> we're<00:00:21.420> trying

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
intimately related to what we're trying

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.840 
intimately related to what we're trying
to<00:00:21.930> address<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.500> healthy<00:00:22.769> consumer<00:00:23.189> calm<00:00:23.550> which

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
to address a healthy consumer calm which

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.320 
to address a healthy consumer calm which
is<00:00:24.029> integrative<00:00:24.990> health<00:00:26.000> practices<00:00:27.000> and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
is integrative health practices and

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.939 
is integrative health practices and
ideas<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.519> so<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.390> closely<00:00:31.230> relates<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
ideas and so it it closely relates to

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.560

anything like that no it was actually in

anything like that no it was actually in
the<00:01:32.100> wall<00:01:32.460> somebody<00:01:33.390> had<00:01:34.259> sealed<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.890> up<00:01:34.979> in

there<00:01:35.610> somehow<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:37.290> left<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.590> there<00:01:37.619> so

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
there somehow and just left it there so

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.109 
there somehow and just left it there so
it's<00:01:39.299> kind<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:40.130> interesting<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.820> time

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
it's kind of a interesting little time

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.639 
it's kind of a interesting little time
capsule<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.810> itself<00:01:44.210> but<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.540> takes<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.200> look<00:01:46.409> at

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
capsule in itself but it takes a look at

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.300 
capsule in itself but it takes a look at
how<00:01:47.549> powerful<00:01:47.899> these<00:01:48.899> preservatives<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
how powerful these preservatives are and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.639 
how powerful these preservatives are and
I<00:01:51.270> don't<00:01:51.720> even<00:01:52.049> want<00:01:52.380> to

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
I don't even want to

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.649 
I don't even want to
I'll<00:01:54.460> probably<00:01:54.729> write<00:01:55.119> about<00:01:55.329> this<00:01:55.450> in<00:01:55.600> the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
I'll probably write about this in the

Pringles at that time during that time
it<00:02:48.610> was<00:02:48.760> dried<00:02:49.120> potatoes<00:02:50.790> partially

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
it was dried potatoes partially

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
difference but not too much other than

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.210

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.040

and<00:04:09.420> it's<00:04:10.200> kind<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.620> horrifying<00:04:11.780> still<00:04:12.780> even

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
and it's kind of horrifying still even

so<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.579> just<00:04:18.570> thought<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:18.989> was<00:04:19.079> that<00:04:19.350> was<00:04:19.470> a

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
so I just thought that was that was a

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.150 
so I just thought that was that was a
really<00:04:19.709> interesting<00:04:20.070> discovery<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:22.109> see<00:04:22.410> this

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
really interesting discovery to see this

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.260 
really interesting discovery to see this
little<00:04:23.460> time<00:04:23.730> capsule<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.860> I<00:04:25.860> hope<00:04:26.790> it<00:04:27.000> just

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
little time capsule and I hope it just

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.470 
little time capsule and I hope it just
sparks<00:04:28.230> your<00:04:28.950> interest<00:04:29.010> to<00:04:29.580> think<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:30.180> little

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
sparks your interest to think a little

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.020 
sparks your interest to think a little
bit<00:04:30.600> I<00:04:30.990> like<00:04:31.350> to<00:04:31.740> do<00:04:32.190> some<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.460> these<00:04:32.520> shocking

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030

type videos at least I think that's

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.530 
type videos at least I think that's
shocking<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:36.710> see<00:04:37.710> what<00:04:38.400> what<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.000> effects<00:04:39.330> of

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
maybe when this is introduced into the

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.980 
maybe when this is introduced into the
human<00:04:44.370> body<00:04:44.580> maybe<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.390> doesn't<00:04:45.570> have<00:04:45.720> the

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
human body maybe it doesn't have the

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.570

same<00:04:46.169> effect<00:04:46.560> as<00:04:47.780> other<00:04:48.780> foods<00:04:49.140> or<00:04:49.410> maybe<00:04:50.310> it's

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
same effect as other foods or maybe it's

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.850 
same effect as other foods or maybe it's
not<00:04:50.970> as<00:04:51.300> dangerous<00:04:51.870> as<00:04:52.200> we<00:04:52.320> make<00:04:52.470> it<00:04:52.590> out<00:04:52.680> to<00:04:52.830> be
