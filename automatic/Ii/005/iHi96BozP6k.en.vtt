00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.680 
there's just a universe to explore and I
think<00:04:44.289> that<00:04:44.500> our<00:04:44.680> everyday<00:04:45.190> lives<00:04:45.639> in<00:04:46.240> so<00:04:46.539> many

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
think that our everyday lives in so many

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.839 
think that our everyday lives in so many
ways<00:04:46.870> we<00:04:47.169> take<00:04:47.440> so<00:04:47.860> much<00:04:48.099> of<00:04:48.159> our<00:04:48.550> everyday

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
ways we take so much of our everyday

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.240 
ways we take so much of our everyday
lives<00:04:49.180> for<00:04:49.570> granted<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.229> the<00:04:50.349> more<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:50.650> look

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
lives for granted and the more you look

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.760 
lives for granted and the more you look
into<00:04:51.849> how<00:04:52.030> things<00:04:52.449> are<00:04:52.780> made<00:04:52.810> and<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.409> people

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
into how things are made and the people

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.939 
into how things are made and the people
who<00:04:53.919> make<00:04:54.159> them<00:04:54.520> the<00:04:54.940> richer<00:04:55.389> you're<00:04:56.139> at<00:04:56.320> every

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
who make them the richer you're at every

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.270 
who make them the richer you're at every
