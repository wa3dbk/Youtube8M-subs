00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.629
 nothing 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.629
 ah 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.440
 the use of the tripod the first tip for 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.440
 get clear photos starts with the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.760
 tripod there is something very important and in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.390
 that case applies to tripod and lenses 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.010
 do not invent do not want to save money and 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.920
 my grandmother always said that things 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.500
 faces should be for the poor people 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.140
 because only once should they buy them 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 the tripod as you can see here has 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.020
 two basic parts the legs and the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.240
 head 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.740
 in the case of the head I recommend 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.980
 make it one of professional quality 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.780
 preferably a bowl head 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 They are wonderful because they are easy to 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.040
 adjust 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.470
 It can be fixed at any point without 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.150
 So many movements really is like 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.370
 have the camera in the hands 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.430
 As for the legs, the important thing is 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.710
 the firmness for it I recommend you not 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.950
 discuss it and go with the brands 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.440
 manfrotto or stews are really both 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.930
 better than there is the trigger cable 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.460
 the other tip would be to use a cable 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.580
 trigger to prevent movement 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.940
 exaggerated pulse that is sure going to 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.490
 influence when we work from a 125 ago 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.620
 of speed down this is something 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.810
 economic good and can be an accessory 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.440
 very helpful to those who want to do 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.990
 photographs of sunrises and sunsets 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.780
 or also in places with very little light 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.729
 the timer another alternative to 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.430
 achieve sharp photos is to use the 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.820
 timer all dehesas rl what 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.979
 they have this is their symbol and is in 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.710
 different parts of the menu of all the 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.899
 cameras presumes the timer has 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.689
 a function that gives us enough time 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.130
 to stabilize the camera then 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.460
 we have pressed the button of the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.610
 trigger and in this way we will get 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.520
 a clean click 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.100
 mirror lock or in English mirror 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.280
 low cost inside the body of the camera 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.490
 and next to the prism there is a mirror whose 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.610
 function is to reflect the image of the 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.640
 outside towards the viewer which is where 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.470
 we achieved the framing this mirror at 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.480
 trigger the trigger must be removed 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.840
 for the fraction of a second that lasts 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.850
 shot that movement of the mirror generates 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.000
 an internal vibration in the camera that 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.580
 visibly affects the sharpness when 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.280
 that what we want to achieve is to look for 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.050
 perfection well it is possible to block 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.810
 the mirror so that it is during the 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.640
 shot does not move in this way not 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.580
 there will be some vibration during the 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.010
 shot those of that rl of last 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.100
 canon generation and nikon own the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.600
 Live image or live view function 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.670
 that allows to look in the frame to 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.280
 through the lcd screen as if it were 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.170
 a video camera blocking this 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.390
 way the mirror if you are watching 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.550
 this course and they do not have cameras of these 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.030
 two brands I recommend you look in 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.370
 your manuals 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.560
 Mirror or mirror lock function 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.190
 crazy to enjoy this advantage 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.280
 see a lot of art go out to galleries go out 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.260
 to museums do for a month 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.260
 rembrandt do for another month blogger
