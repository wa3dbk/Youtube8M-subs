track<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.280> good<00:00:14.460> structure<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.000> both<00:00:15.210> side<00:00:15.480> is

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
track the good structure of both side is

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.290 
track the good structure of both side is

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
do people that just be a tuning here and

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.620 
do people that just be a tuning here and
there<00:00:26.820> which<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:28.109> work<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.680> conifers<00:00:29.630> but

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
there which you can work on conifers but

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
3 and the chemical dominance so the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.000 
3 and the chemical dominance so the
branches<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.690> not<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.140> line<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.649> left<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
branches is not one line and left and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.880 
branches is not one line and left and
right<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> right<00:00:42.020> but<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.290> trucker<00:00:43.710> for

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
right that is right but for trucker for

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.869 
right that is right but for trucker for
they<00:00:44.010> seriously<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:45.030> are<00:00:45.270> more<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.550> they<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
they seriously they are more a they the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.540 
they seriously they are more a they the
structure<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.719> different<00:00:49.039> they<00:00:50.039> open<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
structure is different they open the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.430 
structure is different they open the
structures<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.480> line<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.320> they

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
structures in one line and then they

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.740 
structures in one line and then they
will<00:00:52.620> break<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.070> f2<00:00:53.579> meaner<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.420> they<00:00:54.600> will

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
will break and f2 meaner so they will

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.599 
will break and f2 meaner so they will
form<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.020> kind<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.350> name<00:00:56.149> rather<00:00:57.149> than<00:00:58.609> apical

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
form a kind of name rather than apical

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.810 
form a kind of name rather than apical
dominance<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:00.930> also<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> same<00:01:01.680> thing<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
dominance so also the same thing on the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
dominance so also the same thing on the
pundits<00:01:03.210> rap<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.140> when<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.470> look<00:01:04.680> at<00:01:04.799> pine

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
pundits rap so when you look at pine

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.480 
pundits rap so when you look at pine
tree<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:06.229> kind<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:08.750> external<00:01:09.750> effect<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.430> you

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
tree a kind of external effect so you

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.929 
tree a kind of external effect so you
see<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.350> genitive<00:01:13.350> form<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.130> initial<00:01:14.670> form

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
see the genitive form the initial form

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.370 
see the genitive form the initial form
of

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.450 

run<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.040> then<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.990> then<00:01:22.439> actually<00:01:23.040> they<00:01:23.189> form

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
run and then and then actually they form

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.200 
run and then and then actually they form
a<00:01:23.549> kind<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:24.560> single<00:01:25.560> weapon

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
a kind of single weapon

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.300 
a kind of single weapon
yeah<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.470> goes<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> sweet

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
yeah so this one goes of the sweet

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.219 
yeah so this one goes of the sweet
actually<00:01:29.520> angle<00:01:30.979> triangle<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.909> trying<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
actually angle triangle so trying the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.550 
actually angle triangle so trying the
three<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.950> mostly<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.790> Khalifa's<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.290> point

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
three is mostly for Khalifa's of a point

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.760 
three is mostly for Khalifa's of a point
but<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:38.909> really<00:01:39.329> for<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.380> city<00:01:40.619> of

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
but it's not really for the city of

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.760 
but it's not really for the city of
sweet<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.689> look<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> tree<00:01:43.350> dinner

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
sweet so if you look at the tree dinner

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.149 
sweet so if you look at the tree dinner
in<00:01:44.040> including<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> tropical<00:01:45.500> weather

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
in including the tropical weather

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.260 
in including the tropical weather
in<00:01:48.520> nature<00:01:49.030> you<00:01:49.450> don't<00:01:49.960> see<00:01:50.469> a<00:01:50.499> single<00:01:51.270> traffic

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
in nature you don't see a single traffic

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.300 
in nature you don't see a single traffic
of<00:01:52.859> cbs3<00:01:53.859> and<00:01:54.640> necessary<00:01:55.359> yeah<00:01:56.069> solid<00:01:57.069> one

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
of cbs3 and necessary yeah solid one

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.520 
of cbs3 and necessary yeah solid one
side<00:01:57.670> we<00:01:58.090> work<00:01:58.299> what<00:01:58.539> its<00:01:58.750> weight<00:01:58.929> is<00:01:59.109> one<00:01:59.409> who

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
side we work what its weight is one who

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.010 
side we work what its weight is one who
played<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.799> major<00:02:00.100> treatment<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:01.780> want<00:02:01.959> to

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
played a major treatment we want to

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.020 
played a major treatment we want to
create<00:02:02.229> something<00:02:02.469> all<00:02:02.799> something<00:02:03.310> major<00:02:03.549> not

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
create something all something major not

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.749 
create something all something major not
a<00:02:04.060> young<00:02:04.329> tree<00:02:04.659> so<00:02:05.319> forth<00:02:05.619> and<00:02:05.799> what<00:02:06.130> FCPS

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
a young tree so forth and what FCPS

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.630 
a young tree so forth and what FCPS
really<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.689> effect<00:02:08.170> is<00:02:08.349> always<00:02:08.799> wider<00:02:09.190> she's

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
really the effect is always wider she's

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.320 
really the effect is always wider she's
always<00:02:09.910> open<00:02:10.479> rather<00:02:11.019> than<00:02:11.519> triangle<00:02:12.519> for<00:02:13.299> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
always open rather than triangle for the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.660 
always open rather than triangle for the
triangle<00:02:13.959> we<00:02:14.049> call<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.379> an<00:02:14.500> ethical<00:02:14.980> self<00:02:15.310> the

moratorium<00:02:21.670> in<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.480> same<00:02:22.780> podium<00:02:23.019> is<00:02:23.560> more

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
moratorium in the same podium is more

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.430 
moratorium in the same podium is more
open<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.910> every<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.599> me<00:02:25.720> not<00:02:25.900> even<00:02:25.930> bread

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
open and every to me not even bread

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.589 
open and every to me not even bread
because<00:02:26.860> there<00:02:27.099> is<00:02:27.280> more<00:02:27.579> sunlight<00:02:27.819> you<00:02:28.450> want

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
because there is more sunlight you want

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.270 
because there is more sunlight you want
to<00:02:28.720> have<00:02:28.840> more<00:02:29.019> sunlight<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.739> structure

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
to have more sunlight so the structure
