00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.230 

Brix<00:00:14.530> is<00:00:14.710> just<00:00:14.950> basically<00:00:15.340> the<00:00:15.490> soluble

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
Brix is just basically the soluble

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.630 
Brix is just basically the soluble
percentage<00:00:16.869> of<00:00:16.960> sugar<00:00:17.140> by<00:00:17.439> volume<00:00:17.860> so<00:00:18.400> it's<00:00:18.550> a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
percentage of sugar by volume so it's a

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.910

too<00:01:39.909> geeky<00:01:40.060> pH<00:01:40.600> is<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:40.810> measure<00:01:40.900> of<00:01:41.170> hydrogen

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
too geeky pH is a measure of hydrogen

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.950 
too geeky pH is a measure of hydrogen
ion<00:01:42.070> activity<00:01:42.250> in<00:01:42.700> solution<00:01:43.210> which<00:01:43.659> just

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
ion activity in solution which just

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.570 
ion activity in solution which just
means<00:01:44.170> how<00:01:44.380> fast<00:01:44.590> are<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:44.980> little<00:01:45.130> hydrogen

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
means how fast are the little hydrogen

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.110 
means how fast are the little hydrogen
ions<00:01:45.970> flying<00:01:46.390> around<00:01:46.690> in<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.020> solution<00:01:47.170> which

ions flying around in the solution which

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.190 
ions flying around in the solution which
it's<00:01:49.120> very<00:01:49.180> important<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:49.810> understand<00:01:50.140> the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
it's very important to understand the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.890 
it's very important to understand the
mouthfeel<00:01:50.650> of<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.890> wine<00:01:51.070> low<00:01:51.730> pH<00:01:52.150> means<00:01:52.540> more

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
mouthfeel of the wine low pH means more

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.770 
mouthfeel of the wine low pH means more
acidity<00:01:53.290> high<00:01:53.860> pH<00:01:54.280> means<00:01:54.580> less<00:01:54.820> acidity<00:01:55.270> but

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
acidity high pH means less acidity but

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.270 
acidity high pH means less acidity but
it<00:01:55.900> actually<00:01:56.290> is<00:01:56.470> more<00:01:56.650> of<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:56.979> measurement

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
it actually is more of a measurement

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.460 
it actually is more of a measurement
that<00:01:57.550> those<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:58.030> activity<00:01:58.570> but<00:01:58.780> it<00:01:58.930> generally

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
that those the activity but it generally

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.100 
that those the activity but it generally
means<00:01:59.740> low<00:02:00.070> acid<00:02:00.280> highest<00:02:00.760> it's<00:02:01.570> an<00:02:01.720> inverse

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
means low acid highest it's an inverse

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.350 
means low acid highest it's an inverse
relationship<00:02:02.650> with<00:02:02.979> acid<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:03.460> lower<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.090> pH

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
relationship with acid so lower the pH

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.500 
relationship with acid so lower the pH
higher<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.870> acid<00:02:05.229> pH<00:02:06.040> in<00:02:06.580> white<00:02:06.880> wine<00:02:07.060> like<00:02:07.360> I

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
higher the acid pH in white wine like I

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.839 
higher the acid pH in white wine like I
said<00:02:07.750> probably<00:02:08.110> like<00:02:08.289> 3<00:02:08.560> 2<00:02:08.769> 2<00:02:08.979> 3<00:02:09.039> 3<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:09.610> what<00:02:09.819> I

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
said probably like 3 2 2 3 3 is what I

more<00:02:21.099> acid<00:02:21.550> should<00:02:22.090> be<00:02:22.209> between<00:02:22.360> three<00:02:22.810> point

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
more acid should be between three point

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.770 
more acid should be between three point

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
three and about three point six so most

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.030 
three and about three point six so most
ones<00:02:26.019> you're<00:02:26.230> tasting<00:02:26.410> if<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.769> think<00:02:26.950> that

and most ones that you're tasting that

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.610 
and most ones that you're tasting that
you<00:02:31.150> think<00:02:31.360> have<00:02:31.510> good<00:02:32.080> structure<00:02:32.590> and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
you think have good structure and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.259 
you think have good structure and
acidity<00:02:33.040> are<00:02:33.190> probably<00:02:33.459> under<00:02:33.670> three<00:02:34.030> point

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
acidity are probably under three point

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.000 
acidity are probably under three point
five<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:35.050> three<00:02:35.230> point<00:02:35.440> five<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.800> kind<00:02:35.980> of

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
five so three point five is kind of

five so three point five is kind of

process<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.430> taking<00:03:57.790> them<00:03:58.120> out

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
process of taking them out

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.930 
process of taking them out
malic<00:03:58.840> acid<00:03:59.139> out<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.500> promoting<00:04:00.220> lactic<00:04:00.609> acid

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
malic acid out and promoting lactic acid

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.879 
malic acid out and promoting lactic acid
in<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.120> wines<00:04:01.269> I<00:04:01.420> make<00:04:01.660> is<00:04:02.079> vital<00:04:02.620> to<00:04:02.650> the

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
in the wines I make is vital to the

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.710 
in the wines I make is vital to the
mouthfeel<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.370> what's<00:04:03.790> happening<00:04:04.209> and<00:04:04.420> it

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
mouthfeel and what's happening and it

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.809 
mouthfeel and what's happening and it
changes<00:04:05.049> the<00:04:05.200> acid<00:04:05.530> structure<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.190> little<00:04:06.579> bit

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
changes the acid structure a little bit

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.270 
changes the acid structure a little bit
as<00:04:06.940> well<00:04:07.090> but<00:04:07.329> acid<00:04:07.870> is<00:04:08.260> measured<00:04:08.769> in<00:04:08.980> the

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
as well but acid is measured in the

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.430 
as well but acid is measured in the
weight<00:04:09.549> of<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:09.970> acidity<00:04:10.239> in<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:10.750> solution<00:04:11.260> as

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
weight of the acidity in the solution as

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.890 
weight of the acidity in the solution as
opposed<00:04:12.099> to<00:04:12.220> pee

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
opposed to pee

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.860 
opposed to pee
which<00:04:13.230> is<00:04:13.409> a<00:04:13.620> measure<00:04:13.829> of<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.549> activity<00:04:15.480> the

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
which is a measure of the activity the

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.770 
which is a measure of the activity the
ion<00:04:16.620> activity<00:04:16.829> within<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.400> solution<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.329> acid

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
ion activity within the solution so acid

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.469 
ion activity within the solution so acid
is<00:04:18.900> fixed<00:04:19.350> pH<00:04:20.009> is<00:04:20.280> actually<00:04:20.729> about<00:04:20.910> activity

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
is fixed pH is actually about activity

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.379 
is fixed pH is actually about activity
and<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:22.560> think<00:04:22.949> it's<00:04:23.490> if<00:04:24.030> you're<00:04:24.210> going<00:04:24.300> to

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
and I think it's if you're going to

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.469 
and I think it's if you're going to
understand<00:04:24.900> as<00:04:25.160> acidity<00:04:26.160> or<00:04:26.370> pH<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.880> Y<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.090> pH

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
understand as acidity or pH and Y and pH

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.090 
understand as acidity or pH and Y and pH
is<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.810> way<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:27.960> go<00:04:28.169> because<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.470> influences

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
is the way to go because it influences

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.469 
is the way to go because it influences
more<00:04:29.310> in<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.490> way<00:04:29.580> that<00:04:29.759> the<00:04:29.850> wine<00:04:30.000> tastes<00:04:30.360> and

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
more in the way that the wine tastes and

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.240 
more in the way that the wine tastes and
the<00:04:30.539> way<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.169> wine<00:04:31.320> reacts<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.949> your<00:04:32.009> taste

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
the way the wine reacts to your taste
