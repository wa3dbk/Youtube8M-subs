00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.900
 I do not think I know many races with this 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.160

 although good chrome is also 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.410

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.850
 well we are not going to take it off we're going to 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.590
 remove he knew that maybe he would later 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.240
 we can put another different color the 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.210

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.729

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.450

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.890

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.510
 calandra series or calanda the sporty 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.340
 let's put in the sports we 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.200
 worry because I'm seeing it pink 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.050
 but it's not going to be pink in not leaving pink 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.280
 so nothing happens carbon cap 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:15.020
 triple air intake 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.920
 my mother does not take individual air 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:22.440
 capo or my mother is more appears a 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.870
 organ musically like the tubes that 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.490
 come out of the organs when good 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.620
 you are understanding, you are understanding me 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.000
 the clan are everyone who sets the horn 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.739
 Give him the real win 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.900
 the lights we are going to put the lights of 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.980
 xenon prevention of loss to theft and 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.510
 I got it 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.640
 the registration we are going to put the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.290
 yellow on black that is the one 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.810
 I always put the paint we leave it for 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.290
 the last thing and let's put an improvement 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.120
 of cage and chassis also and spoiler 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.800
 we have spoiler also in this car 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.830
 my good mother is not a very eave 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.370
 exaggerated but I would put this one that is 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.440
 subtler not this is but I think 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.850
 that this is mola marsÃ© that you know how 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.100
 always comments like the video 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.530
 fardan you've screwed up so much that 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.450
 Whether you screwed it up or you do not put it on me 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.530
 Of course yes, of course we are going to see 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.980
 suspension suppression of competition 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.420
 transmission of races and tuned turbo 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.099
 of course wheels 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.170
 then after we're going to put the color and 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.239
 then we put the wheels to see how 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.459
 sticks like one thing with another 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.170
 let's see we have pure black 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.819
 always pure black as I always say 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.290
 pure black always nobody has to see 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.870
 what we are doing inside the car 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.709
 we can be walking we're going to 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.630
 see paint or know paint painting 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.030
 paint paint paint paint color 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.920
 main let's see how main you 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.200
 we are going to put a metallic one as if in 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.690
 Peru 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.120
 that is sexy the car of this non-mother 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.380
 my mother, I did not know him. 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.709
 say that thanks to you I am 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.239
 knowing a bunch of cars that do not 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.330
 I had not the slightest idea that 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.569
 they could work that could that 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:05.200
 you could like me and this color came with 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.750
 such an interesting tone what if we 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.370
 we go to the yellows to the green hey 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.500
 what if we throw today for the greens 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.840
 that we almost never go for the greens 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.239
 let's see a dark green green 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.530
 dark a dark green a dark green 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.450
 for example this 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.910
 let's put in let's look at the greens 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.889
 dark green and now we test with a 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.670
 Cala do vale to see what happens a face 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.950
 of yellow 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.440
 because be careful with this look this look 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.169
 this beige with yellow because it gives 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.180
 another tone not the autochthonous there we are going to 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.130
 see a more exaggerated tone maybe because 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.720
 with red does not look good with yellow 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.580
 It is quite well with yellow 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.440
 careers well good to see what was left 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.470
 a pretty nice color look 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.660
 Look, look and then decide then to 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.510
 to say to myself my mother every time I'm 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.500
 making an expert thanks to you to 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.540
 the cars we ordered making a 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.680
 tuned expert care care 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.150
 we can put it chromed if we want to 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.850
 see how it is with the chrome because 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.400
 if you notice the green of the car 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.040
 reflects in the chromed fix is to set 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.630
 to fix you I would leave it chromed 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.040
 but good as I know that you at 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.930
 you better tell me to use the 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.669
 mate too much then we're going to 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.040
 put a mate the thing is that color 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.590
 I would stick the yellow I think it is the only 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.229
 color that I would paste right now I think that 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.840
 Follow the yellow so we're not going to 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:26.210
 see is wheels wheels wheels wheels 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.430
 wheels wheels 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.340
 and the wheels are going to put some 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.320
 sports wheels that are what we 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.660
 they come for this and I'm going to put 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.030
 these that come with the screws 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.000
 the rims do not come with the screws 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.740
 yes that we're going to put it like that and then 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.990
 we are going to put him we are going to put the 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.090
 color is worth the color of the tires what 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.060
 color many times you tell me that I know 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.220
 let black I say is that black to see 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.500
 we should give it a bad tone that of 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.810
 another thing you will not have to put a 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.820
 little color even if it is to be ridges 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.470
 or so I'll leave you this yellow 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.820
 here the racing yellow so that 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.260
 go with the other yellow and stay for 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.110
 that goes with the yellow of pearly 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.940
 ok ok let's see 20 ring wheels 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.300
 well then you tell me you also do me 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.139
 a lot of good is that you can not 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.560
 put on these wheels 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.569
 to see this if for her the budget 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.729
 allcamino tutelado baba tuned that if 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:23.449
 this see 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:25.550
 this car could use the eye 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.749
 You can see accessories for the wheels that 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.029
 Then you tell me that I do not put them on 

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:31.819
 custom tires tires 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:33.409
 bulletproof and yellow smoke for this 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:35.240
 car or green that you like 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:36.559
 I always always put the color 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.599
 of smoke in the secondary color of 

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:41.210
 car is worth depending on the secondary 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:43.490
 that it has value and well since it would already be 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.189
 it would be tuned easy simple fast and 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.620
 notice that we have heard 

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:50.779
 truly incredible incredible the 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.759
 organ car I'll call him the 

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:54.860
 organ car because I looked with that in the 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.960
 hood or water water the typical car of 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.939
 careers of these ancients of the of the 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.199
 movies when they made the movies of 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:01.490
 these Americans when they do the 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.559
 young people there are races with their cars 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.849

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:06.080
 I do not have anything yet they do not have a car 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.240

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.169
 look at the car fix the color 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.749
