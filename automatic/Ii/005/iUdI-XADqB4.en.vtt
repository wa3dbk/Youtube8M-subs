I<00:00:03.980> was<00:00:04.980> always<00:00:05.100> passionate<00:00:05.310> about<00:00:05.670> how<00:00:05.790> can<00:00:05.970> we

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
I was always passionate about how can we

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.330 
I was always passionate about how can we
create<00:00:06.359> an<00:00:06.450> environment<00:00:06.569> that<00:00:07.340> really

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
create an environment that really

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.970 
create an environment that really
supports<00:00:08.880> people<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.480> their<00:00:09.900> well-being<00:00:10.050> as

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
supports people and their well-being as

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:24.590 
supports people and their well-being as
well<00:00:11.219> as<00:00:11.309> our<00:00:11.429> planet<00:00:23.029> the<00:00:24.029> most<00:00:24.180> sustainable

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
well as our planet the most sustainable

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.269 
well as our planet the most sustainable
thing<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:25.080> can<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.410> from<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.890> resource

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
thing we can do from a resource

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.740 
thing we can do from a resource
perspective<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.970> use<00:00:27.150> something<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.660> we

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
perspective is use something that we

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.509 
perspective is use something that we
already<00:00:27.960> have<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:28.890> some<00:00:29.039> buildings<00:00:29.340> and

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
already have we have some buildings and

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.400 
already have we have some buildings and
they<00:00:29.789> might<00:00:30.000> not<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.390> spectacular<00:00:30.660> buildings

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
they might not be spectacular buildings

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.659 
they might not be spectacular buildings
but<00:00:31.590> how<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:31.920> make<00:00:32.099> them<00:00:32.189> great<00:00:32.430> places

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
but how can we make them great places

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.520 
but how can we make them great places
for<00:00:32.820> people<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.540> make<00:00:33.660> them<00:00:33.780> as<00:00:33.930> efficient<00:00:34.350> as

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
for people and make them as efficient as

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.190 
for people and make them as efficient as
possible<00:00:34.559> when<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.489> demoed<00:00:36.420> out<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.809> ceiling

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
possible when we demoed out the ceiling

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.740 
possible when we demoed out the ceiling
we<00:00:37.410> found<00:00:37.680> these<00:00:38.250> really<00:00:38.640> really<00:00:39.480> actually

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
we found these really really actually

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.690 
we found these really really actually
beautiful<00:00:40.140> wood<00:00:40.770> beams<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.430> were<00:00:41.550> really

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
hope that with each project making it

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.710 
hope that with each project making it
better<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.520> we<00:02:33.700> can<00:02:33.760> get<00:02:34.030> smarter<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.480> we<00:02:34.569> can

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
better and we can get smarter and we can

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.240 
better and we can get smarter and we can

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
do more and that we can build upon our

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.130 
do more and that we can build upon our
success<00:02:36.610> over<00:02:36.790> time<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.330> just<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.750> think<00:02:38.050> the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
success over time I just I think the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.990 
success over time I just I think the
sky's<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.410> limit<00:02:38.980> in<00:02:39.310> terms<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.610> what<00:02:39.700> we<00:02:39.880> can

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
sky's the limit in terms of what we can

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.950 
sky's the limit in terms of what we can
achieve

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.169
