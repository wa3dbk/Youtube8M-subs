00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.940
 Today we talk about the most massive 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:13.190
 categories of digital cameras inexpensive 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.990
 compact sets namely three available 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:22.940
 models from nikon from a series of coolpix s with 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:26.450
 2800 s3600i with 6700 they have different 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.570
 lenses but in many ways they are similar with 2800 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.450
 and s3600 look very elegant thanks to 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.100
 narrowed face 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.820
 e6700 seems a bit thicker than others due to 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.740
 right angles 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.220
 but in fact their dimensions are almost 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.290
 same any of these cameras 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.360
 fits easily in your jeans pocket 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.770
 without inconvenience mass or 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.079
 the size of the assembly did not let us down squeaks and 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.070
 no backlash at all camera metal 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.620
 front panel 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.350
 the younger ones are 6 different colors 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.739
 including one with abstract ornament and 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.670
 with 6700 is represented only in black and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.220
 red flowers 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.799
 flash is located under the shutter release 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.960
 need to watch that not accidentally closing 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:14.450
 finger as it happens it is pretty 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.930
 Often with 2800 of 3600 received a screen with 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:22.159
 2.7 inches and resolution 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:24.470
 230,000 points have over 6700 screen 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.830
 three-inch with slightly wider 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.390
 viewing angles but same resolution 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.490
 picture quality is low due to 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.770
 pixelation but to watch for 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.869
 the plot of this is rather a finished 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.450
 snapshots anyway look better 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.670
 computer note the first two 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.090
 the camera does not have hard protective glasses 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.770
 which would take care of matrices from damage 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.110
 typical control set 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.270
 joysticks a few buttons we note only 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.590
 that each device has its own 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.100
 video key 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.500
 for quick transition from photo to video 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.490
 Cameras are powered by a 700 capacity battery 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.640
 milliampere hours 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.180
 full charge is about 200 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.340
 250 shots 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.979
 it certainly is not too much but them 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.929
 can be charged from any yusb port that 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.329
 civilization conditions are very convenient 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.310
 it is a pity only non-standard connector all 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.049
 models have a tiny amount of built-in 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.420
 which memory is enough for several 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.879
 test frames as the main 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.010
 sd format memory cards used 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.079
 sdxc 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.129
 unites the hero of our review 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.530
 20 megapixel sensor 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.329
 he gives a large picture with 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.670
 a good margin for framing 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.680
 true it increased to 100 percent 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.500
 fragment small details look 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.170
 fuzzy such a tiny sensor tsa 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.030
 with a huge number of pixels if not y 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.950
 abuse scaling then on 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.650
 computer monitor photos look 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.290
 quite decent with good color rendering 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.519
 sharpness in low light 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.919
 preferably use flash or 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.019
 tripod otherwise manifest 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:56.120
 another disadvantage of a small matrix 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.159
 poor photosensitivity due to 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.109
 which any movement of an object or 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:03.049
 a shake of the photographerâ€™s hand will result in 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.849
 smeared with musma well now move on to 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.090
 lenses that are actually these 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:11.419
 cameras and are distinguished the most inexpensive 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.879
 model test 2800 received a fivefold 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:15.919
 Zoom without stabilization is such an option 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.220
 can not be called universal but it is all 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.810
 equally superior camera 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.799
 average smartphone 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.180
 photos are shown at 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.010
 minimum and maximum approximation 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.840
 The s3600 has an eight-fold lens with 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.299
 integrated optical stabilization 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.669
 which compensates for a little shaking and 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.530
 hand shake in practice at cameras with 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:38.509
 stabilizer percentage of successful frames 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.530
 really higher especially when 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.979
 using zoom 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.470
 with 6700 as the most expensive of the presented 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:46.459
 has a tenfold lens too 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.250
 stabilization 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.750
 not yet superzoom but already enough for 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.639
 order to film remote objects 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.829
 rather large s3600i with 6700 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.840
 supports dynamic paint technology 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.849
 a zoom that doubles 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.829
 maximum software approximation 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.169
 methods without snapshot reduction 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.220
 the quality of course suffers a little but 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.620
 but you do not have to cut 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.250
 image in macro editor 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.870
 copes with the 3600 better because she has 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.510
 shortest minimum distance 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.950
 focusing only two centimeters 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.650
 oops 6700 5 centimeters which is also not bad 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.380
 with 2800 focuses no closer than 10 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.570
 centimeters to the subject but it is not 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.450
 makes it difficult to take beautiful pictures of flowers 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.400
 and other small objects with regard to 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.040
 work speeds first two models 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.230
 proved to be quite slow interface 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.870
 switched slowly after clicking 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.510
 shutter release goes a little delay a 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.880
 the process of writing to the card does cause 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:51.500
 dream and here especially if this series of 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.840
 Sport mode with 6700 is also not lightning but 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.360
 delay after pressing the shutter 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.610
 she has less noticeable serial speed 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.980
 shooting at all devices amounted to a little 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.530
 more than a frame per second you will have time 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.450
 remove playing on the playground baby 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.900
 but something faster to capture 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.900
 complicated 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.110
 all menus are the same and very simple 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.930
 there are five basic shooting modes 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.850
 auto selection of the plot itself selects the desired 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.670
 stage program depending on 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.870
 the fact that you shoot manually selecting one 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.360
 from pre-installed programs 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.760
 you can improve the result yourself 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.470
 shooting for example take a clear portrait 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.600
 pet or capture 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.420
 beautiful view with panorama 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.550
 a set of 12 digital filters will allow 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.950
 decorate boring frames directly in 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.550
 the shooting process has even more effects 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.200
 can be applied to finished photos 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.180
 there is also an intellectual mode 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.040
 portrait with autofocus on the face and 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.070
 shutter release when someone 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.110
 smile and of course the automatic 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.950
 manual setting mode 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.950
 some parameters 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.569
 behind 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.669
 except quick effects in the menu 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.439
 editing is thin mode 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.419
 processing which probability 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:08.699
 interested in girls if suddenly 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.770
 photo shoot caught you without makeup 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.159
 do not be upset after shooting 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.810
 can be applied shadow mascara lipstick 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:19.050
 toned skin and even enlarged eyes 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.210
 of all 12 effects of course the camera is not 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.259
 hollywood makeup artist but on avatar and 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.259
 work looks good 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.090
 all cameras support video recording in 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.630
 hd format with speed up to 30 frames per 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.090
 give me a sec 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.950
 but the possibilities are different younger model 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.530
 allows you to use only digital 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.110
 Zoom greatly worsening the quality of pictures 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.510
 Yes, and hand shake is noticeable in older 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.940
 models with this case better zooming 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.590
 It works fully and the videos are obtained 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.340
 smoother thanks to optical 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.340
 stabilization 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:55.180
 we hope this video has helped you 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.699
 find out what makes these three very different 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.529
 similar to each other camera and for 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:01.330
 more convenience we offer links 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:04.289
 on the photo gallery are obtained using 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.289
 these cameras
