00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
doing is octaves so you don't really

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.940 
doing is octaves so you don't really
need<00:00:41.910> anything<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.510> these<00:00:42.780> two<00:00:43.410> notes<00:00:43.680> which

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
need anything but these two notes which

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.150
