slide the curling iron off you grab one
of<00:02:02.909> your<00:02:03.060> duckbill<00:02:03.570> clips

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
of your duckbill clips

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.820 
of your duckbill clips
you<00:02:05.340> wrap<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.730> curl<00:02:06.510> around<00:02:07.170> your<00:02:07.350> fingers

you wrap the curl around your fingers

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.690 
you wrap the curl around your fingers
and<00:02:09.260> then<00:02:10.260> you<00:02:10.290> roll<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.710> back<00:02:10.890> up<00:02:11.100> into<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
and then you roll it back up into the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.400 
and then you roll it back up into the
curl<00:02:11.880> shape<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.360> if<00:02:12.420> anything<00:02:12.630> drops<00:02:13.020> out<00:02:13.260> it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
curl shape and if anything drops out it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.350 
curl shape and if anything drops out it
happens<00:02:13.800> especially<00:02:14.010> when<00:02:14.340> your<00:02:14.940> hair<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.120> cut

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
happens especially when your hair is cut

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.750 
happens especially when your hair is cut
into<00:02:15.630> layers<00:02:15.840> anything<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.710> falls<00:02:16.920> out<00:02:17.190> just

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
into layers anything that falls out just

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.850 
into layers anything that falls out just
roll<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.270> right<00:02:18.570> back<00:02:18.810> up<00:02:19.020> into<00:02:19.200> place

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
roll it right back up into place

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.850 
roll it right back up into place
it'll<00:02:20.490> be<00:02:20.610> fine<00:02:20.820> trust<00:02:21.030> me<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:25.470> can<00:02:25.560> take<00:02:25.710> the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
it'll be fine trust me you can take the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.530 
it'll be fine trust me you can take the
clip<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.630> slide<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:27.990> right<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.560> there<00:02:28.830> and

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
clip and you slide it right in there and

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.660 
clip and you slide it right in there and
then<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.570> like<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.020> spray<00:02:31.290> again<00:02:31.560> after<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.550> to

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
then I like to spray again after just to

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.060 
then I like to spray again after just to
reinforce<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:34.140> then<00:02:34.350> what<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.680> would<00:02:34.800> do<00:02:34.950> is

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
reinforce so then what you would do is

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.770 
reinforce so then what you would do is
you<00:02:35.190> would<00:02:35.220> repeat<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.820> process<00:02:36.120> throughout

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
you would repeat that process throughout

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.850 
you would repeat that process throughout
your<00:02:36.960> entire<00:02:37.110> head<00:02:37.710> then<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.520> have<00:02:38.730> hair<00:02:39.090> that

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
your entire head then you have hair that

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.830 
your entire head then you have hair that
you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:41.040> actually<00:02:41.220> sleep<00:02:41.850> on<00:02:42.120> at<00:02:42.300> night

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
you can actually sleep on at night

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.200 
you can actually sleep on at night
that's<00:02:43.110> not<00:02:43.380> cumbersome<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.340> really<00:02:44.700> awkward

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
that's not cumbersome and really awkward

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.120 
that's not cumbersome and really awkward
and<00:02:45.480> difficult<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:46.110> sleep<00:02:46.380> in<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.830> you'll
