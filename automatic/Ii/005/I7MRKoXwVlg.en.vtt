00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello and welcome to hardware rat in 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.460
 this video 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.230
 the update is 900 euro gaming computers 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.340
 march 2015 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.230
 as processor an intel xeon e3 1231 v3 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.289
 with four times 3.4 ghz 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.810
 he has a clock of 3 8 ghz 80 watts 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.400
 tdp and hyperthreading which means 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.380
 every one he can start two as one 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.000
 achieved theoretical octopus 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.560
 of course for everyone currently in games low 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.180
 cost out and should be for gamers 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.060
 next three to four years thick 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.140
 suffice as cpu cooler the lc power 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.940
 cosmo cool lcc 120 only with it 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.160
 he cool the processor well and quietly 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.570
 can and as mainboard that means rock b 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.360
 85 m per 3 with the intel b85 chipset sp 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.020
 3 s ata three four ddr3 ram benches up 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.620
 express 3.0 a 5.1 sound chip and nano 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.270
 panel 2 ps2 vga dvi and hdmi 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.800
 this graphics connectors of the mainboard 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.449
 however can not be used 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.930
 because the processor is not integrated 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.320
 Graphics unit has 4 x usb 2 2 x usb 3 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.939
 a lan socket and 3 35 mm latches 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.060
 as well as an exchange klink for the sound chip 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.610
 then as 8gb RAM crucial 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.810
 ballistix board it's a toolkit what 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.080
 means one can in the dual channel mode 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.600
 use ddr3 1600 and count 19 right 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.820
 fast and 8 gb in time for gamers 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.729
 more than enough as ssd a 120gb z 100 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.409
 It is a fast ssd 120 gb 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.270
 is sufficient for the operating system and 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.040
 all programs and one more 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.570
 terabyte disk from toshiba 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.790
 It is above average 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.950
 fast hdd and a terabyte for the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.479
 most of you are more than enough 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.220
 graphics card the 4gb hs nr 9 290 the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.340
 graphics card was slightly overclocked and 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.140
 is thus almost as strong as the gtx 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.670
 970 with it you should then most 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.680
 current games on the highest 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.890
 Settings can play fluently and 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.020
 as a power supply the cooler master g 450 m 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.240
 It is modular what you do not have cable 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.430
 lose weight you do not need and 450 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.710
 Watts are enough for the pc and another one 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.649
 dvd burner from samsung then as 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.599
 housing the sharkoon bd 28 it's a 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.520
 striking red luminous housing with 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.810
 a lot of space for hardware but of course 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.520
 decide by yourself which 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.440
 dossier 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.090
 gold does not become in pc itself 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.910
 can also assemble him for 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.140
 26 euro 90 then make 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.490
 I thank you for watching me 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.990
 hope you liked the video 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.090
 if the video is older than two months 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.740
 ask the description look there
