00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:10.260
 Tell you guys I'm here today in 2011. 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.719
 icv playing beautiful the spirit once the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.109
 then simply after 20 bush 2000 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.460
 so it can simply come from push only 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.210
 huh 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:26.609
 let's call it souvenir moat and 2000 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.880
 ready okay well launched by yen 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.750
 you can in the comments and the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:41.760
 company website super cool game you 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:45.120
 right know is a great series of 16 games 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.820
 very good also have the uribe 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.239
 I think that's the way it's called 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.230
 Brazilian team and games 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.480
 I think it's this or else 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.710
 simply a site created by ihg 100 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.519
 Portuguese 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.440
 I do not know very slow but let's go 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.290
 talk about the game 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.380
 I'll tell you immediately that I'm at the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.460
 professional, so if I happen to be 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.490
 last 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.940
 not cursed in the comments are okay 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:23.780
 nice to walk then 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.560
 It's funny in the year 2000, right? 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:32.720
 that's why it's called bush 2000 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:35.840
 March 24 I think for PC more 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.690
 before you had a version for game boy 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:46.880
 March 15 I think for game advance sp 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:49.940
 boy is more phones 92 thousand very groups 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.830
 good despite the year released the charts 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.610
 They are great 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.660
 so let's try third 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.090
 according to the first text 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.030
 We are going to talk about the game again. 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.490
 has a camera mode in that game as well 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.080
 cool 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.380
 is this the sun stays on a straight man in 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.380
 a curve 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.150
 I can get in the way of this woman. 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.260
 that takes also he hit bastard 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.260
 Who lives to mess with me? 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.700
 the grandpa's program over here 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.500
 then I know the time I was hit by 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.680
 wrong way 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:43.640
 hey turn I also remembered that this game 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.110
 has a disadvantage of stability o 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.600
 car is not so stable 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.490
 sometimes you wind up losing control 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.700
 him or her does not curve as it should. 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.700
 do 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.100
 So 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.710
 op is coming off the curve is a 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.670
 disadvantage will play very good 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:11.170
 after some time of practice some 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:14.500
 time is a few hours, it 's very nice 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:20.350
 then the savior modes that there is a 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:24.460
 another evolution is a test mode that 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:28.990
 you by the brand bosch test were 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:32.550
 you test the cars and if you pass the 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.550
 How long are you going to do other tests? 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.810
 Until I get something I never 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.060
 I managed to pass all the tests too 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.980
 Difficult especially has one here you 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:50.360
 You have to do 1 361 rio360 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.340
 and I'm and I quit 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.690
 avoid first and third but only 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.760
 because I'm making a video that I 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:03.620
 I'm in this place, there's only truth. 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.870
 I usually win in the first second 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.640
 Just because I'm making the video, I'm 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.670
 in sixth 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:18.250
 in a car every Sunday michelle 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:20.790
 will pass the ahata there to pass it not 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.790
 passed on 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:30.650
 we are winning on the final stretch I think 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.650
 do not be interested in the tek that is 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:37.690
 I think it 's the end is the end 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.280
 pronto we are real do not need to knock 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:47.340
 not over yet 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:50.290
 fucking tapir delivered the car and air 27 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.490
 placement arriving in sixth or 4 minutes 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:05:00.760
 and 27 seconds did not hit but hit the 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:03.840
 remember and go there is no eighth here was 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.840
 a record that will have 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.030
 before 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.420
 is here in replay mode 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:18.500
 so the game is very good I advise 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:22.070
 very good it is clear that time 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:30.080
 stability of the car than in other 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:36.380
 versions have not got the taste for 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:39.590
 beat but great graphics gameplay 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.970
 very good and has one has a camera that 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.270
 I do not like you that has shown 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:47.660
 Who are you in the car, I'm going? 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:53.710
 take advantage of that much output in this 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:57.960
 what is to have at the tip of jazz has then 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:00.870
 Let's end this landscape here. 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.400
 it has the field with another speech to the 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.710
 camera inside the car that is well 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.430
 interesting 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:11.789
 switches the camera on the key button if you 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.680
 press the key c is mute camera is a 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:18.259
 magic 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:21.930
 This is a very good game I advise you 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:24.240
 You can speak in the bassaki and the tent of 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.050
 women and can spot and can make a 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.960
 test 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.919
 8 you can buy the same very game 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.599
 good game 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:37.470
 so this is we do not have leaves Dae game 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:41.160
 has other games and other actions edp 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:45.410
 I am not half of the law forbids from others 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.410
 then that's it 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:56.759
 I do not know if I'll leave the game link on 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:07:01.130
 destruction of rs forgetting click and 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:03.990
