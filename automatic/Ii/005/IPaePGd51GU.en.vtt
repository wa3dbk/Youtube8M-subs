00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.210
 hi guys interesting news you will see 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.280
 the European Commission has advised the 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.470
 owners of big game stores 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.720
 and mobile apps like google play 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.490
 app store 'and others to which games that 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.040
 include a yonhap purchasing system 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.919
 cease to be considered and listed in 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.899
 the catalogs as free one step without 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.000
 interesting doubt in the battle for 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.250
 protect consumers 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.440
 misleading advertising today 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.079
 we can suffer in most stores 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.239
 of this type the gaming sector has 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.700
 been changing in recent years for 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.770
 become profitable before we buy you a 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.200
 game and you had the right to enjoy 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.820
 all the content once now from 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.920
 that the purchases and the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.870
 apparently free games about the 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.420
 support of a lucrative business that 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.400
 far from allowing us to increase options or 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.010
 installing extras make it impossible to 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.140
 user playing or advancing under that 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.030
 supposedly gratuitous for this and for the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.340
 complaints from many parents who have had 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.290
 to pay huge shopping bills 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.360
 made by their children in games 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.280
 apparently free google has 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.200
 committed to the free term 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.250
 stop being in any game that 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.650
 use this 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.050
 of purchases in addition the European commission 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.720
 demands to withdraw the practices that try 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.729
 directly convince children to 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.890
 who buy items or that the adult in 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.810
 question is informed at all times 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.880
 of the payment modalities of the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.860
 purchases forcing the seller to 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.229
 notify and obtain consent 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.050
 express of such purchases without 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.119
 payments can be made automatically from 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.820
 This way children are protected and 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.190
 adults of deceptive advertising and 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.360
 purchases without authorization however there 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.820
 to remember that the last 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.550
 responsibility for the actions of the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.290
 children in relapses on parents so 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.270
