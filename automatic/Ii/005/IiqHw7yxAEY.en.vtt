okay<00:00:01.680> let's<00:00:01.979> take<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.190> look<00:00:02.370> at<00:00:02.460> the<00:00:02.550> lumber

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay let's take a look at the lumber

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.760 
okay let's take a look at the lumber
khals<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.300> palmar<00:00:03.720> interossei<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:04.620> the

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
khals the palmar interossei and the

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.930 
khals the palmar interossei and the
dorsal<00:00:05.339> interossei<00:00:05.549> muscles<00:00:07.760> now<00:00:08.760> if<00:00:08.849> you

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
dorsal interossei muscles now if you

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.259 
dorsal interossei muscles now if you
think<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.630> terms<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:10.139> finger<00:00:11.040> at<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.849> B

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
think of this in terms of finger at a B

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.020 
think of this in terms of finger at a B
duction<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.230> deduction<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.670> actually

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
duction in a deduction this is actually

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.269 
duction in a deduction this is actually
quite<00:00:15.150> simple<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.560> index<00:00:16.920> finger<00:00:17.100> is

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
quite simple so the index finger is

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.439 
quite simple so the index finger is
going<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.699> need<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.210> be<00:00:18.750> ducked<00:00:20.330> towards<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
going to need to a be ducked towards the

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.040 
going to need to a be ducked towards the
thumb<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.560> deduct<00:00:23.539> towards<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.840> middle

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
thumb and a deduct towards the middle

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.650 
thumb and a deduct towards the middle
finger<00:00:25.410> what<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.740> going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.279> be<00:00:27.000> ducked<00:00:27.300> this

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
finger what is going to a be ducked this

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.570 
finger what is going to a be ducked this
index<00:00:28.080> finger<00:00:28.380> towards<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.710> thumb<00:00:29.070> it's

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
index finger towards the thumb it's

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.999 
index finger towards the thumb it's
going<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.789> be<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> first<00:00:30.330> dorsal<00:00:31.009> interosseus

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
going to be the first dorsal interosseus

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.060 
going to be the first dorsal interosseus
muscle<00:00:32.219> as<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.360> see<00:00:33.890> since<00:00:34.890> we're

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
muscle as you can see since we're

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.490 
muscle as you can see since we're
abducting<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.120> B<00:00:36.450> ducting<00:00:36.930> towards<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.290> thumb

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
abducting a B ducting towards the thumb

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.290 
abducting a B ducting towards the thumb
it<00:00:37.649> needs<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.890> be<00:00:37.980> on<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> radial<00:00:38.670> side<00:00:38.910> and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
it needs to be on the radial side and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.450 
it needs to be on the radial side and
the<00:00:39.570> first<00:00:39.840> dorsal<00:00:40.110> interosseous<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.070> also

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the first dorsal interosseous is also

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.510 
the first dorsal interosseous is also
located<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> posterior<00:00:42.629> aspect<00:00:43.460> okay<00:00:44.460> so

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
located on the posterior aspect okay so

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.180 
located on the posterior aspect okay so
we<00:00:44.820> need<00:00:44.879> something<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.600> deduct<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.649> index

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
we need something to a deduct the index

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.590 
we need something to a deduct the index
finger<00:00:47.460> towards<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.820> middle<00:00:48.090> finger<00:00:48.450> and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
finger towards the middle finger and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720 
finger towards the middle finger and
what's<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.890> be<00:00:50.010> other<00:00:50.250> than<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
what's that going to be other than the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.229 
what's that going to be other than the
first<00:00:51.079> palma<00:00:52.079> interosseus<00:00:52.920> muscle<00:00:53.239> that's

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
first palma interosseus muscle that's

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.299 
first palma interosseus muscle that's
going<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.600> attach<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> owner<00:00:55.320> side<00:00:55.770> it's

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
going to attach to the owner side it's

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.029 
going to attach to the owner side it's
going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.699> draw<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.090> index<00:00:57.989> finger<00:00:58.079> towards

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
going to draw that index finger towards

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.700 
going to draw that index finger towards
the middle<00:00:59.399> finger<00:01:00.020> now<00:01:01.020> once<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.469> get<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the middle finger now once we get to the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.979 
the middle finger now once we get to the
middle<00:01:01.920> finger<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.520> cannot<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.600> deduction

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
middle finger it cannot do a deduction

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.929 
middle finger it cannot do a deduction
because<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.619> already<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> midline<00:01:05.610> so

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
because it is already on the midline so

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.969 
because it is already on the midline so
we<00:01:06.060> need<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:07.049> ducked<00:01:07.350> towards<00:01:07.860> the

whether<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.659> going<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:31.079> other<00:01:31.259> than

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
whether that is going to be other than

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
because it cannot a deduct fourth finger

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.760 
because it cannot a deduct fourth finger
just<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.909> second<00:01:45.299> finger<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.049> deduct
