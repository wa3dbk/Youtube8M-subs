can't say again not very likely in

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.639 
can't say again not very likely in
England<00:00:35.050> there<00:00:36.050> is<00:00:36.250> 1965<00:00:37.480> this<00:00:38.480> is<00:00:38.690> a<00:00:38.840> half

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
England there is 1965 this is a half

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.790 
England there is 1965 this is a half
dollar<00:00:41.079> counterfeit<00:00:42.079> silver<00:00:42.320> or<00:00:42.500> not<00:00:42.620> in<00:00:42.739> the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
dollar counterfeit silver or not in the

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.299 
dollar counterfeit silver or not in the
basic<00:00:43.100> Kennedy<00:00:43.520> half<00:00:44.300> dollar<00:00:45.070> this<00:00:46.070> might

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
basic Kennedy half dollar this might

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:47.590 
basic Kennedy half dollar this might
read<00:00:46.520> a<00:00:46.550> little<00:00:46.940> bit<00:00:47.059> funny<00:00:47.270> because<00:00:47.450> the

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
read a little bit funny because the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.720 
read a little bit funny because the
three<00:00:47.840> state<00:00:48.219> staples<00:00:49.219> but<00:00:49.399> I<00:00:49.460> think<00:00:49.640> the

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
three state staples but I think the

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.229 
three state staples but I think the
overall<00:00:50.120> effect<00:00:50.450> to<00:00:51.050> be<00:00:51.140> there<00:00:51.910> and<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.059> last

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
overall effect to be there and the last

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.970 
overall effect to be there and the last
coin<00:00:53.539> is<00:00:54.370> especially<00:00:56.739> significant<00:00:57.739> for<00:00:57.800> the

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
coin is especially significant for the

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.600 
coin is especially significant for the
UK<00:00:58.430> is<00:00:58.760> a<00:00:59.140> Gold<00:01:00.140> Sovereign<00:01:02.110> okay<00:01:03.430> this<00:01:04.430> is<00:01:04.579> a
