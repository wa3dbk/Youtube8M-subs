00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:11.380
 Motorola has brand new third 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.960
 generation of their engine and the 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.250
 presented and thanks to sparhandy de 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.540
 I'm with you today 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.439
 unpack and of course one 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.690
 bit my first impressions 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:24.699
 We open the pack 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.260
 welcome as first of all that 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.580
 device itself and on the 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.650
 screen protector we can even 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.420
 already the most important feature read 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.920
 but of course we have more in there 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.600
 the pack even if it is not much 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.729
 a micro usb cable and a few 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.379
 Unfortunately, no headphones or headphones 

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:40.659
 a power plug or something like that 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.040
 but the motogp costs only for that 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:43.629
 230 euros 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.280
 according to the current state and that is 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.839
 Of course not much money and that's why 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.610
 Let's take a closer look 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.780
 after we remove the display from the foil 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.339
 have freed 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.049
 The device also has on the 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.670
 back a slide because of the 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:56.379
 back can decrease 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.570
 behind this back hides 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.629
 a slot for a micro SIM card and 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.010
 a micro sd card the back of her 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.080
 Seems maybe already looks a bit 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.640
 different from the predecessor 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.740
 and we have one here too 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.630
 a real metal strip of me one me 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.670
 really like it and the whole device 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.469
 again a good piece of high quality 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.960
 also works with this double 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.950
 lightning that I like really good but it 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.929
 Actually there is something else this year 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.619
 Cooler and that is the whole device 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:24.310
 waterproof px 7 is called the whole 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.679
 means you can actually do that 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.840
 even go swimming, well , at least 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.969
 for a shorter time and not really 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.670
 dive but it survives smaller 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:36.070
 Water adventure in any case on the 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.229
 device itself runs android 5.1 point 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.359
 One and that goes very well more 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.799
 in the front review we also have two 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:43.390
 speakers like last year 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.549
 but now it is the same 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.869
 lower upper is unfortunately not stereo 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.819
 speakers more 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.039
 The display is 5 inches tall 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.569
 stayed and the hd resolution also the 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.189
 camera on the back has become but 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.049
 significantly improved with 3 10 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.179
 megapixel she should even be the the 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.439
 we from the nexus 6 know the 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.179
 Backs can also be this year 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.780
 remove again and through more colorful 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.520
 replace 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.049
 but I really want all that in the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.420
 review more accurately and therefore 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.950
 I finish the video here say my name 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.000
 is kilian and see you soon 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.000
 is doing well until then
