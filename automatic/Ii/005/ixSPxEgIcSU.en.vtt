punching my fishing rod but welcome to
my<00:00:04.710> automatic<00:00:05.549> fish<00:00:05.580> farm<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.420> this<00:00:06.930> video<00:00:07.200> is

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
my automatic fish farm and this video is

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.450 
my automatic fish farm and this video is
going<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.529> be<00:00:07.589> sort<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.130> combination

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
going to be sort of a combination

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.660 
going to be sort of a combination
between<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.269> mod<00:00:09.630> review<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.670> contraption

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
between a mod review and a contraption

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.299 
between a mod review and a contraption
showcase<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.719> sorts<00:00:12.990> but<00:00:13.139> basically<00:00:13.500> we<00:00:14.099> now

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
showcase of sorts but basically we now

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.550 
showcase of sorts but basically we now
have<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.820> new<00:00:14.849> type<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.750> flock<00:00:16.109> that's<00:00:16.379> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
have a new type of flock that's the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.910 
have a new type of flock that's the
fishing<00:00:16.920> block<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.369> basically<00:00:17.789> allows<00:00:18.150> us<00:00:18.420> to

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
fishing block and basically allows us to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.529 
fishing block and basically allows us to
automatically<00:00:19.920> fish<00:00:20.400> which<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.970> pretty

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
automatically fish which is pretty

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.140 
automatically fish which is pretty
convenient<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.320> how<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.189> craft<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.820> by

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
convenient and how you craft it is by

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.589 
convenient and how you craft it is by
making<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.960> chest<00:00:25.470> around<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.609> fishing<00:00:27.210> rod<00:00:27.359> if

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
making a chest around a fishing rod if

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.220 
making a chest around a fishing rod if
you<00:00:27.750> get<00:00:28.080> what<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.320> mean<00:00:28.439> cuz<00:00:28.920> i<00:00:29.099> really<00:00:29.130> don't

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
you get what I mean cuz i really don't

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.049 
you get what I mean cuz i really don't
but<00:00:31.230> yes<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.980> will<00:00:32.130> give<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> fishing

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
but yes so that will give you a fishing

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.270 
but yes so that will give you a fishing
block<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.600> can<00:00:33.750> collect<00:00:34.350> these<00:00:34.829> i<00:00:35.100> guess

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
block and you can collect these i guess

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.810 
block and you can collect these i guess
if<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.550> want<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.510> anyway<00:00:36.809> um<00:00:37.050> what<00:00:38.040> these<00:00:38.489> do

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
if you want but anyway um what these do

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.910 
if you want but anyway um what these do
is<00:00:38.850> basically<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.750> place<00:00:40.020> them<00:00:40.320> over<00:00:40.530> any

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
is basically you can place them over any

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.250 
is basically you can place them over any
type<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.280> water<00:00:41.850> block<00:00:42.210> whether<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.020> still

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
type of water block whether it's still

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.500 
type of water block whether it's still
water<00:00:43.559> or<00:00:43.829> running<00:00:44.250> water<00:00:44.280> cuz<00:00:45.149> fishing

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
water or running water cuz fishing

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.540 
water or running water cuz fishing
blocks<00:00:45.719> don't<00:00:46.020> discriminate<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.950> they<00:00:47.399> can

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
blocks don't discriminate and they can

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.970 
blocks don't discriminate and they can
be<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.700> one-block<00:00:48.329> deep<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:49.050> i<00:00:49.289> don't<00:00:49.680> know<00:00:49.739> like

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
be a one-block deep or i don't know like

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.520 
be a one-block deep or i don't know like
a<00:00:50.280> steep<00:00:50.700> as<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.030> grand<00:00:51.329> canyon<00:00:51.629> except<00:00:52.260> that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
a steep as to grand canyon except that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.830 
a steep as to grand canyon except that
doesn't<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:52.949> any<00:00:53.100> water<00:00:53.370> bad<00:00:54.059> metaphor<00:00:54.329> bets

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
doesn't have any water bad metaphor bets

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.830 
doesn't have any water bad metaphor bets
anyway<00:00:55.320> um<00:00:55.879> basically<00:00:56.879> these<00:00:57.390> guys<00:00:57.660> will

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
anyway um basically these guys will

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.080 
anyway um basically these guys will
start<00:00:58.109> popping<00:00:58.590> out<00:00:58.710> Brandon<00:00:59.070> flying<00:00:59.399> fish<00:00:59.820> at

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
start popping out Brandon flying fish at

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.650 
start popping out Brandon flying fish at
the<00:01:00.390> rate<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:01.129> about<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.399> think<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:02.789> dog<00:01:03.030> pops<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the rate of about I think one dog pops a

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.679 
the rate of about I think one dog pops a
fish<00:01:04.439> around<00:01:04.710> every<00:01:05.400> hundred<00:01:05.850> seconds<00:01:06.299> or<00:01:06.479> so

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
fish around every hundred seconds or so

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.620 
fish around every hundred seconds or so
so<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.680> may<00:01:07.890> seem<00:01:07.950> kind<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.939> slow<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.450> if<00:01:09.540> you

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
so that may seem kind of slow but if you

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.940 
so that may seem kind of slow but if you
think<00:01:09.659> about<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.290> pretty

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
think about it it's pretty

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.570 
think about it it's pretty
overpowered<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.920> something<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.040> note<00:01:14.340> is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
overpowered and something to note is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.649 
overpowered and something to note is
that<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:15.270> may<00:01:15.780> occasionally<00:01:16.290> pop<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:18.060> top

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
that it may occasionally pop out on top

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.630 
that it may occasionally pop out on top
of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> block<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.500> fact<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:19.979> pop<00:01:20.189> out<00:01:20.369> in

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
of the block in fact it can pop out in

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.910 
of the block in fact it can pop out in
any<00:01:20.880> direction<00:01:21.090> most<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> time<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.590> ends

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
any direction most of the time it ends

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.859 
any direction most of the time it ends
up<00:01:23.040> going<00:01:23.250> into<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.880> water<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.420> going<00:01:24.750> how

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
up going into the water and going how

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.109 
up going into the water and going how
you<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:26.009> sometimes<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.700> ends<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:27.000> on

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
you like it but sometimes it ends up on

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.539 
you like it but sometimes it ends up on
the<00:01:27.240> block<00:01:27.450> or<00:01:27.750> around<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> best<00:01:29.400> way

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
the block or around it so the best way

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.969 
the block or around it so the best way
to<00:01:29.610> solve<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.840> basically<00:01:31.290> place<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
to solve this is just basically place a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.940 
to solve this is just basically place a
block<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.790> top<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:34.409> will<00:01:34.650> sort<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
block on top of it and this will sort of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.770 
block on top of it and this will sort of
stop<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.460> from<00:01:35.700> popping<00:01:35.939> everywhere<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.750> just

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
stop it from popping everywhere and just

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.590 
stop it from popping everywhere and just
go<00:01:37.380> directly<00:01:37.619> down<00:01:38.189> into<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.939> water<00:01:39.210> very

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
go directly down into the water very

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.679 
go directly down into the water very
useful<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.920> leave<00:01:41.369> me<00:01:41.400> wondering<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.450> could

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
useful so leave me wondering I could

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.830 
useful so leave me wondering I could
pretty<00:01:43.200> much<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.439> fish<00:01:43.920> for<00:01:44.130> days<00:01:44.509> what<00:01:45.509> if<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
pretty much a fish for days what if I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.050 
pretty much a fish for days what if I
just<00:01:46.170> want<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.409> stop<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.920> cuz<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.520> enough

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
just want to stop it cuz I have enough

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.210 
just want to stop it cuz I have enough
fish<00:01:48.420> store<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> way<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> last<00:01:49.680> me<00:01:49.890> five

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
fish store the way to last me five

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.210 
fish store the way to last me five
 ice<00:01:50.880> ages<00:01:51.360> well<00:01:51.960> due<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> recent

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
new update you can now have a on off

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.550 
new update you can now have a on off
switch<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.290> don't

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
switch for this and you know you don't

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.230 
switch for this and you know you don't
have<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.799> hear<00:01:59.070> annoying<00:01:59.430> splashes<00:01:59.969> all<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
have to hear annoying splashes all the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.469 
have to hear annoying splashes all the
time<00:02:00.420> because<00:02:01.020> when<00:02:01.920> redstone<00:02:02.790> power<00:02:03.090> is

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
time because when redstone power is

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.020 
time because when redstone power is
applied<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:04.020> these<00:02:04.680> flashing<00:02:05.159> blocks<00:02:05.399> they

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
applied to these flashing blocks they

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.760 
applied to these flashing blocks they
store<00:02:06.360> producing<00:02:06.869> they<00:02:07.170> start<00:02:07.500> producing

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
store producing they start producing

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.430 
store producing they start producing
fish<00:02:08.280> anymore<00:02:08.550> um<00:02:08.989> however<00:02:09.989> if<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.259> don't

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
fish anymore um however if you don't

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.960 
fish anymore um however if you don't
have<00:02:10.619> any<00:02:10.800> redstone<00:02:11.250> power<00:02:11.430> applied<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.819> it

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
have any redstone power applied to it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.309 
have any redstone power applied to it
just<00:02:12.209> works<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.569> same<00:02:12.599> so

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
just works the same so

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.110 
just works the same so
need<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.650> worry<00:02:13.920> about<00:02:14.099> that<00:02:14.489> if<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.849> don't

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
need to worry about that if you don't

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.770 
need to worry about that if you don't
want<00:02:15.480> an<00:02:15.689> on/off<00:02:16.019> switch<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:17.389> living<00:02:18.389> to<00:02:18.569> my

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
want an on/off switch and living to my

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.309 
want an on/off switch and living to my
sort<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.260> next<00:02:19.650> thing<00:02:20.280> he<00:02:20.519> right<00:02:20.730> here<00:02:20.760> um<00:02:21.329> you

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
sort of next thing he right here um you

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.690 
sort of next thing he right here um you
may<00:02:22.620> want<00:02:22.859> enough<00:02:23.159> on<00:02:24.739> blablablabla<00:02:25.739> okay<00:02:26.219> you

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
may want enough on blablablabla okay you

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.449 
may want enough on blablablabla okay you
may<00:02:26.939> want<00:02:27.299> an<00:02:27.540> on<00:02:27.810> off<00:02:28.200> switch<00:02:28.260> for<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:29.219> and<00:02:29.400> I

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
may want an on off switch for that and I

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.869 
may want an on off switch for that and I
kind<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.730> got<00:02:29.969> mad<00:02:30.180> there<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:30.750> um<00:02:31.639> this<00:02:32.639> is<00:02:32.849> the

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
kind of got mad there but um this is the

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.440 
kind of got mad there but um this is the
most<00:02:33.299> efficient<00:02:34.049> sort<00:02:34.349> of<00:02:35.090> setup<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.420> can

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
most efficient sort of setup you can

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.030 
most efficient sort of setup you can
have<00:02:36.810> basically<00:02:37.709> have<00:02:38.599> fishing<00:02:39.599> blogs<00:02:40.040> water

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
have basically have fishing blogs water

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.250 
have basically have fishing blogs water
and<00:02:41.459> then<00:02:41.579> fishing<00:02:41.849> blocks<00:02:42.180> again<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.840> this

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
and then fishing blocks again and this

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.949 
and then fishing blocks again and this
will<00:02:43.499> sort<00:02:44.189> of<00:02:45.079> not<00:02:46.079> need<00:02:46.469> the<00:02:47.069> need<00:02:47.909> to<00:02:48.629> have

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
will sort of not need the need to have

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.809 
will sort of not need the need to have
to<00:02:49.169> place<00:02:49.439> blocks<00:02:49.769> on<00:02:50.040> top<00:02:50.069> of<00:02:50.370> your<00:02:50.519> fishing

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
to place blocks on top of your fishing

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.149 
to place blocks on top of your fishing
box<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.719> prevent<00:02:52.079> it<00:02:52.260> from<00:02:52.469> getting<00:02:52.739> trapped

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
box to prevent it from getting trapped

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.970 
box to prevent it from getting trapped
because<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:54.150> water<00:02:54.419> just<00:02:54.810> sort<00:02:55.439> of<00:02:55.500> flushes

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
because the water just sort of flushes

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.640 
because the water just sort of flushes
it<00:02:56.129> away<00:02:56.400> directly<00:02:57.030> down<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.780> do<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.199> collect

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
it away directly down to do the collect

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.009 
it away directly down to do the collect
drain<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.609> that's<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.239> go<00:03:00.419> block<00:03:00.719> right<00:03:00.989> there

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
drain and that's a go block right there

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.599 
drain and that's a go block right there
because<00:03:01.379> that's<00:03:01.590> where<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.949> collect<00:03:02.189> your

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
because that's where you collect your

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.209 
because that's where you collect your
items<00:03:03.569> I<00:03:03.750> guess<00:03:03.959> but<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.739> may<00:03:04.859> be<00:03:04.919> wondering

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:05.219 
items I guess but you may be wondering

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.449 
items I guess but you may be wondering
why<00:03:05.549> he<00:03:05.579> is<00:03:06.000> there's<00:03:06.299> a<00:03:06.419> ball<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.650> random<00:03:08.219> fish

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
why he is there's a ball of random fish

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.189 
why he is there's a ball of random fish
right<00:03:08.699> here<00:03:08.730> it's<00:03:09.120> because<00:03:09.419> when<00:03:09.689> the

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:10.199 
right here it's because when the

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.899 
right here it's because when the
official<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:10.859> pop<00:03:11.069> out<00:03:11.250> from<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.519> outermost

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
official to pop out from the outermost

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.720 
official to pop out from the outermost
block<00:03:12.359> right<00:03:12.840> here<00:03:12.889> it<00:03:13.889> has<00:03:14.189> a<00:03:14.219> chance<00:03:14.609> of

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
block right here it has a chance of

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.339 
block right here it has a chance of
coming<00:03:15.030> in<00:03:15.209> this<00:03:15.389> direction<00:03:15.449> and<00:03:16.019> when<00:03:16.230> it

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
coming in this direction and when it

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.740 
coming in this direction and when it
does<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.799> sort<00:03:17.099> of<00:03:17.159> flies<00:03:17.370> out<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.120> basically

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
does it sort of flies out and basically

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.129 
does it sort of flies out and basically
fish<00:03:19.139> jump<00:03:19.650> up<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.099> no<00:03:20.340> they<00:03:21.000> crash<00:03:21.419> and<00:03:21.449> die

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
fish jump up and no they crash and die

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.729 
fish jump up and no they crash and die
miserably<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.159> haha<00:03:23.459> take<00:03:23.759> that<00:03:24.439> but<00:03:25.439> yeah<00:03:25.680> you

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
might want to have an on off switch for

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.469 
might want to have an on off switch for
that<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.669> that's<00:03:29.669> that's<00:03:30.030> pretty<00:03:30.150> much<00:03:30.419> the

whole thing I mean it kind of makes
minecraft<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.459> whole<00:03:32.669> lot<00:03:32.819> easier<00:03:33.030> fishing<00:03:33.959> in

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
minecraft a whole lot easier fishing in

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.259 
minecraft a whole lot easier fishing in
Minecraft<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.739> way<00:03:34.979> too<00:03:35.040> boring<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.790> mean<00:03:35.970> you

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
Minecraft is way too boring I mean you

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.749 
Minecraft is way too boring I mean you
they<00:03:36.810> have<00:03:36.989> absolutely<00:03:37.199> no<00:03:37.859> animation<00:03:38.310> for<00:03:38.639> it

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:38.759 
they have absolutely no animation for it

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.179 
they have absolutely no animation for it
it<00:03:38.849> may<00:03:39.060> be<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.840> whale<00:03:40.470> munching<00:03:41.069> on

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
it may be a whale munching on

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.949 
it may be a whale munching on
your<00:03:41.340> worm<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.879> wouldn't<00:03:42.150> know<00:03:42.389> because

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
your worm and you wouldn't know because

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.229 
your worm and you wouldn't know because
you<00:03:43.259> can't<00:03:43.530> tell<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:43.949> so<00:03:44.129> you<00:03:44.189> try<00:03:44.669> and<00:03:44.790> reel<00:03:45.060> it

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
you can't tell it so you try and reel it

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.839 
you can't tell it so you try and reel it
in<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.540> then<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:46.680> pulls<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.280> back<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.819> you
