those<00:00:11.980> logs<00:00:12.250> to<00:00:12.580> a<00:00:12.610> minimum<00:00:12.879> so<00:00:13.180> that<00:00:13.209> you

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
those logs to a minimum so that you

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.439 
those logs to a minimum so that you
don't<00:00:13.930> get<00:00:13.990> too<00:00:14.170> bored<00:00:14.410> going<00:00:14.709> through<00:00:14.920> them

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
but there is a progression as you do now

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.700 
but there is a progression as you do now
when<00:00:18.460> you're<00:00:18.670> doing<00:00:19.089> answers<00:00:19.750> in<00:00:19.869> that<00:00:20.019> make

you go through the working as you'll see
I'm<00:00:33.640> going<00:00:33.879> to<00:00:33.910> have<00:00:34.000> questions<00:00:34.390> on<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.570> board

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
I'm going to have questions on the board

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.110 
I'm going to have questions on the board
I<00:00:34.930> write<00:00:35.140> down<00:00:35.260> everything<00:00:35.710> I<00:00:35.949> do<00:00:36.010> every<00:00:36.879> piece

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
I write down everything I do every piece

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.610 
I write down everything I do every piece
of<00:00:37.149> working<00:00:37.690> you'll<00:00:38.170> see<00:00:38.320> in<00:00:38.379> the<00:00:38.440> work

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
of working you'll see in the work

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.010 
of working you'll see in the work
solutions<00:00:39.190> there's<00:00:39.969> every<00:00:40.539> single<00:00:40.840> piece<00:00:40.989> of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
solutions there's every single piece of

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.139 
solutions there's every single piece of
work<00:00:41.260> and<00:00:41.410> I<00:00:41.469> do<00:00:41.530> done<00:00:41.859> sometimes<00:00:42.730> you<00:00:43.000> can

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
work and I do done sometimes you can

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.389 
work and I do done sometimes you can
make<00:00:43.210> little<00:00:43.510> shortcuts<00:00:43.960> but<00:00:44.590> try<00:00:44.980> and<00:00:45.250> write

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
make little shortcuts but try and write

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.700 
make little shortcuts but try and write
down<00:00:45.609> all<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:46.329> steps<00:00:46.359> that<00:00:46.719> you're<00:00:46.870> doing<00:00:47.079> in

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
down all the steps that you're doing in

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.410 
down all the steps that you're doing in
the<00:00:47.859> exactly<00:00:48.340> becomes<00:00:48.670> especially<00:00:49.180> helpful

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
the exactly becomes especially helpful

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.540 
the exactly becomes especially helpful
because<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:50.079> examiner<00:00:50.440> can<00:00:50.769> see<00:00:50.980> exactly

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
because the examiner can see exactly

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.130 
because the examiner can see exactly
what<00:00:51.879> you've<00:00:52.030> done<00:00:52.180> to<00:00:52.570> get<00:00:52.719> to<00:00:52.780> that<00:00:52.960> answer

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
what you've done to get to that answer

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.889 
what you've done to get to that answer
and<00:00:53.739> even<00:00:53.859> if<00:00:54.250> you<00:00:54.879> somehow<00:00:55.090> make<00:00:55.480> a<00:00:55.510> mistake

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
and even if you somehow make a mistake

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.540 
and even if you somehow make a mistake
going<00:00:56.170> through<00:00:56.469> it<00:00:56.590> and<00:00:56.949> type<00:00:57.190> of<00:00:57.309> button

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
going through it and type of button

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.490 
going through it and type of button
wrong<00:00:57.670> into<00:00:57.910> a<00:00:57.940> calculator<00:00:58.179> you'll<00:00:58.960> still<00:00:59.320> get

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
wrong into a calculator you'll still get

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.380 
wrong into a calculator you'll still get
a<00:00:59.559> lot<00:00:59.739> of<00:00:59.829> remarks<00:01:00.250> for<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.730> word<00:01:00.879> and<00:01:01.149> being

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
a lot of remarks for the word and being

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.180 
a lot of remarks for the word and being
correct<00:01:01.780> even<00:01:02.260> though<00:01:02.469> your<00:01:02.620> final<00:01:02.920> answer

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
correct even though your final answer

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.250 
correct even though your final answer
might<00:01:03.339> not<00:01:03.519> be<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:04.420> also<00:01:04.780> helps<00:01:05.019> at<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.170> end

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
might not be and also helps at the end

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.870 
might not be and also helps at the end
of<00:01:05.350> an<00:01:05.440> exam<00:01:05.680> when<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:05.830> go<00:01:05.920> back<00:01:06.220> through<00:01:06.250> you

down without working okay so now I'll

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.520 
down without working okay so now I'll
just<00:01:16.030> get<00:01:16.240> on<00:01:16.420> with<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.810> first<00:01:16.960> lesson<00:01:17.200> which

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
just get on with the first lesson which

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.170 
just get on with the first lesson which
is<00:01:17.560> negative<00:01:18.010> numbers<00:01:18.310> obviously<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:19.030> lot<00:01:19.150> of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
is negative numbers obviously a lot of

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.240 
is negative numbers obviously a lot of
people<00:01:19.300> might<00:01:19.510> find<00:01:19.750> this<00:01:19.840> very<00:01:20.350> simple<00:01:20.710> but

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
people might find this very simple but

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.620 
people might find this very simple but
there<00:01:21.580> are<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.700> few<00:01:21.730> little<00:01:22.060> tricks<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.510> I<00:01:22.540> use

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
there are a few little tricks that I use

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.720 
there are a few little tricks that I use
because<00:01:23.380> sometimes<00:01:24.010> there<00:01:24.250> can<00:01:24.400> be<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.580> little

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
because sometimes there can be a little

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.430 
because sometimes there can be a little
bit<00:01:24.880> tricky<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.480> what<00:01:25.840> I<00:01:25.870> do<00:01:25.960> with<00:01:26.110> negative

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
bit tricky so what I do with negative

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.590 
bit tricky so what I do with negative
numbers<00:01:26.710> is<00:01:26.890> I'm<00:01:27.550> adding<00:01:27.700> or<00:01:28.120> taking<00:01:28.180> them

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
numbers is I'm adding or taking them

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.120 
numbers is I'm adding or taking them
away<00:01:28.690> I<00:01:29.020> use<00:01:29.350> this<00:01:29.440> thing<00:01:29.500> called<00:01:29.650> a<00:01:29.860> number

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
away I use this thing called a number

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.510 
away I use this thing called a number
line

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
line

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.250 
line
what's<00:01:31.150> another<00:01:31.360> line<00:01:31.600> it's<00:01:31.870> literally<00:01:32.200> just

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
what's another line it's literally just

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.560 
what's another line it's literally just
write<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.220> numbers<00:01:33.460> down<00:01:33.490> so<00:01:33.940> one<00:01:34.470> two<00:01:35.520> three

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
write the numbers down so one two three

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.140 
write the numbers down so one two three
four<00:01:38.010> five<00:01:39.010> in<00:01:39.400> that<00:01:39.700> direction

you sell but we're having taking away

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.780 
you sell but we're having taking away
it<00:01:52.600> helps<00:01:52.990> see<00:01:53.590> what<00:01:53.740> adding<00:01:54.130> we<00:01:54.520> know<00:01:54.670> we're

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
it helps see what adding we know we're

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.280 
it helps see what adding we know we're
moving<00:01:54.880> in<00:01:55.120> this<00:01:55.210> direction<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.260> right

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
moving in this direction to the right

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.210 
moving in this direction to the right
moving<00:01:57.070> in<00:01:57.160> a<00:01:57.190> positive<00:01:57.400> direction<00:01:58.950> okay<00:01:59.950> we

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
moving in a positive direction okay we

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.200 
moving in a positive direction okay we
were<00:02:00.340> taken<00:02:00.700> away<00:02:00.790> we're<00:02:01.540> not<00:02:01.570> moving<00:02:02.080> in<00:02:02.260> the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
were taken away we're not moving in the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.130 
were taken away we're not moving in the
negative<00:02:04.710> direction

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
negative direction

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.280 
negative direction
we<00:02:07.410> get<00:02:07.710> more<00:02:08.160> negative<00:02:08.790> so<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.330> left<00:02:09.540> so

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
we get more negative so to the left so

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.450 
we get more negative so to the left so
how<00:02:10.350> does<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.530> help<00:02:10.680> us<00:02:10.860> let's<00:02:11.040> I'm<00:02:11.190> looking

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
how does this help us let's I'm looking

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.950 
how does this help us let's I'm looking
example<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.780> we've<00:02:12.960> got<00:02:13.170> say<00:02:13.890> three<00:02:15.410> take<00:02:16.410> away

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
example so we've got say three take away

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.920 
example so we've got say three take away
seven<00:02:19.100> okay<00:02:20.100> we<00:02:20.580> know<00:02:20.700> we're<00:02:20.820> taking<00:02:21.000> away<00:02:21.240> so

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
seven okay we know we're taking away so

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.320 
seven okay we know we're taking away so
we're<00:02:22.050> moving<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:23.040> negative<00:02:23.370> direction

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
we're moving in the negative direction

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.420 
we're moving in the negative direction
so<00:02:24.750> we<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:24.960> go<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> three<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.160> we<00:02:26.250> move

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
so we just go to the three and we move

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.510 
so we just go to the three and we move
seven<00:02:26.730> places<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.240> your<00:02:27.390> one<00:02:27.540> two<00:02:28.200> three<00:02:28.920> four

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
seven places of your one two three four

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.680 
seven places of your one two three four
five<00:02:30.270> six<00:02:30.870> seven<00:02:31.860> wind<00:02:32.670> up<00:02:32.790> at<00:02:35.360> minus-4

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
five six seven wind up at minus-4

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.420 
five six seven wind up at minus-4
okay<00:02:37.350> what<00:02:37.920> about<00:02:37.980> if<00:02:38.250> we've<00:02:38.400> got<00:02:38.690> minus<00:02:41.330> 203

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
okay what about if we've got minus 203

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.970 
okay what about if we've got minus 203
what<00:02:44.430> does<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:44.550> give<00:02:44.820> us<00:02:45.000> well<00:02:45.920> what's<00:02:46.920> that

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
what does that give us well what's that

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.580 
what does that give us well what's that
guess<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.430> gives<00:02:47.550> us<00:02:47.790> we<00:02:48.060> start<00:02:48.360> one<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.810> go<00:02:49.320> one

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
guess it gives us we start one to go one

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.070 
guess it gives us we start one to go one
two<00:02:50.340> three<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:52.470> really<00:02:53.130> what<00:02:53.940> that's<00:02:54.810> how<00:02:55.020> we

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
two three that really what that's how we

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.780 
two three that really what that's how we
use<00:02:55.260> oh<00:02:55.380> another<00:02:55.560> one<00:02:55.800> which<00:02:56.250> we<00:02:56.370> got<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.700> end

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
use oh another one which we got the end

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.850 
use oh another one which we got the end
of<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.000> number<00:02:57.270> line<00:02:57.620> somewhere<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:58.709> we've

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
of the number line somewhere if we've

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.390 
of the number line somewhere if we've
got<00:02:59.010> something<00:02:59.340> like<00:02:59.730> minus<00:03:00.630> one<00:03:01.280> minus<00:03:02.930> 12

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
got something like minus one minus 12

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.980 
got something like minus one minus 12
what's<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.520> can<00:03:05.700> we<00:03:05.850> cool<00:03:06.120> we're<00:03:06.720> gonna<00:03:06.840> go

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
what's that can we cool we're gonna go

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.480 
what's that can we cool we're gonna go
with<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.140> end<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.410> number<00:03:07.650> line<00:03:07.680> up<00:03:07.950> we

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
with the end of the number line up we

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.790 
with the end of the number line up we
know<00:03:08.610> we're<00:03:08.760> just<00:03:08.820> going<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.150> move<00:03:09.270> 12<00:03:09.930> 2.8

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
know we're just going to move 12 2.8

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.500 
know we're just going to move 12 2.8
addresses<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.340> stop<00:03:11.550> -<00:03:11.910> why<00:03:12.090> don't<00:03:12.150> we<00:03:12.330> go<00:03:12.450> to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
addresses and stop - why don't we go to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.800 
addresses and stop - why don't we go to
12<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.650> what<00:03:13.769> does<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:13.920> going<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.250> take<00:03:14.370> us<00:03:14.519> to

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
12 so what does that going to take us to

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.570 
12 so what does that going to take us to
now<00:03:15.810> we<00:03:15.870> know<00:03:16.050> we're<00:03:16.200> moving<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.590> direction

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
now we know we're moving this direction

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.790 
now we know we're moving this direction
12<00:03:18.000> right<00:03:18.330> here<00:03:18.570> it's<00:03:19.080> gonna<00:03:19.230> take<00:03:19.470> us<00:03:19.620> to

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
12 right here it's gonna take us to

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.920 
12 right here it's gonna take us to
minus<00:03:20.760> 13<00:03:22.040> isn't<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.100> okay<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:24.150> that's<00:03:24.390> how<00:03:24.540> the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
minus 13 isn't it okay so that's how the

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.150 
minus 13 isn't it okay so that's how the
number<00:03:25.140> line<00:03:25.290> can<00:03:25.320> be<00:03:25.530> useful<00:03:25.830> don't<00:03:25.980> be

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
number line can be useful don't be

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.280 
number line can be useful don't be

about<00:03:45.360> if<00:03:45.600> I've<00:03:45.750> got<00:03:47.450> five<00:03:48.950> take<00:03:49.950> away<00:03:51.050> -<00:03:52.820> sorry

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
about if I've got five take away - sorry

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.170 
about if I've got five take away - sorry
okay<00:03:54.660> what<00:03:54.810> do<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.930> do<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:55.980> by<00:03:56.310> taking

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
okay what do I do that to a by taking

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.100 
okay what do I do that to a by taking
away<00:03:57.269> -<00:03:57.750> right<00:03:58.110> now<00:03:58.820> so<00:03:59.820> it's<00:04:00.000> Bakke<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:00.690> they

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
away - right now so it's Bakke and they

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.420 
away - right now so it's Bakke and they
take<00:04:01.350> away<00:04:01.440> which<00:04:01.590> means<00:04:01.709> in<00:04:01.860> with<00:04:01.950> that<00:04:02.100> one

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
take away which means in with that one

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.050 
take away which means in with that one
thing<00:04:02.610> like<00:04:02.760> -<00:04:03.170> so<00:04:04.170> how's<00:04:04.320> that<00:04:04.440> well<00:04:04.950> I'm<00:04:05.940> just

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
thing like - so how's that well I'm just

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.259 
thing like - so how's that well I'm just
attracting<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:07.019> negative<00:04:07.709> so<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.060> negative

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
attracting a negative so it's a negative

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.780 
attracting a negative so it's a negative
of<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.900> negative<00:04:09.930> which<00:04:10.769> gives<00:04:11.040> us<00:04:11.130> a<00:04:11.250> positive

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
of a negative which gives us a positive

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.180 
of a negative which gives us a positive
so<00:04:12.510> let's<00:04:12.690> write<00:04:12.810> these<00:04:13.019> down<00:04:13.320> we've<00:04:13.980> gotta

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
so let's write these down we've gotta

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.720 
so let's write these down we've gotta
remember<00:04:14.430> these<00:04:15.320> so<00:04:16.320> -<00:04:16.910> Adam<00:04:17.910> -

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
remember these so - Adam -

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.780 
remember these so - Adam -
and<00:04:19.240> give<00:04:19.420> us<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.870> plus<00:04:21.930> but<00:04:22.930> anything<00:04:23.350> X<00:04:23.790> minus

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
and give us a plus but anything X minus

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.010 
and give us a plus but anything X minus
and<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.390> plus

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
and a plus

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.700 
and a plus
give<00:04:26.710> us<00:04:26.800> a<00:04:26.830> minus<00:04:27.250> or<00:04:27.820> plus<00:04:28.110> otherwise<00:04:29.110> we

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
give us a minus or plus otherwise we

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.110 
give us a minus or plus otherwise we
would<00:04:29.890> give<00:04:30.010> us<00:04:30.100> a<00:04:30.190> -<00:04:30.460> which<00:04:30.580> we<00:04:30.700> can<00:04:30.850> see

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
would give us a - which we can see

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.310 
would give us a - which we can see
because<00:04:31.750> we<00:04:31.870> know<00:04:32.140> if<00:04:32.440> we've<00:04:32.590> got<00:04:35.310> five<00:04:36.310> plus

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
because we know if we've got five plus

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.380 
because we know if we've got five plus
minus<00:04:38.320> 3<00:04:38.350> but<00:04:39.100> actually<00:04:39.580> you<00:04:39.970> just<00:04:40.000> find

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
minus 3 but actually you just find

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.190 
minus 3 but actually you just find
takeaway

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
takeaway

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.470 
takeaway
-<00:04:42.040> true<00:04:42.280> just<00:04:43.000> becomes<00:04:43.300> takeaway<00:04:44.700> ok<00:04:45.700> and<00:04:46.270> then

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
- true just becomes takeaway ok and then

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.400 
- true just becomes takeaway ok and then
it<00:04:46.720> will<00:04:46.810> proceed<00:04:47.110> we've<00:04:47.230> got<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:47.410> plus<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.680> plus

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
it will proceed we've got a plus a plus

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.350 
it will proceed we've got a plus a plus

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
that's given equal applause obviously

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.600 
that's given equal applause obviously
plus<00:04:55.690> in<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:55.930> plus<00:04:55.960> we<00:04:56.320> got<00:04:56.410> five<00:04:56.740> plus<00:04:57.580> three

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
plus in the plus we got five plus three

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.910 
plus in the plus we got five plus three
we<00:04:58.360> don't<00:04:58.540> bother<00:04:58.600> running<00:04:58.870> there<00:04:59.170> the<00:04:59.590> pluses

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
we don't bother running there the pluses

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.370 
we don't bother running there the pluses
are<00:05:00.040> just<00:05:00.340> really<00:05:00.670> so<00:05:01.510> five<00:05:01.750> minus<00:05:01.930> minus

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
are just really so five minus minus

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.440 
are just really so five minus minus
three<00:05:02.530> becomes<00:05:02.920> five<00:05:05.910> plus<00:05:06.910> three

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
three becomes five plus three

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.200 
three becomes five plus three
now<00:05:08.020> when<00:05:08.200> you're<00:05:08.350> adding<00:05:08.790> and<00:05:09.790> take<00:05:10.030> more

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
table make a positive so that's going to

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.980 
table make a positive so that's going to
equal<00:06:00.160> plus<00:06:01.800> 15<00:06:02.800> which<00:06:03.190> we<00:06:03.340> just<00:06:03.520> like<00:06:03.760> this<00:06:04.570> 50

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.840 
it this 15 but again I've got minus 3
times<00:06:11.860> 5<00:06:12.630> and<00:06:13.630> everyone<00:06:13.960> -<00:06:14.200> it's<00:06:15.070> good<00:06:15.280> 3<00:06:15.610> lots

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
times 5 and everyone - it's good 3 lots

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.960 
times 5 and everyone - it's good 3 lots
of<00:06:17.460> so<00:06:18.460> 5<00:06:18.700> lots<00:06:18.940> of<00:06:19.120> minus<00:06:19.720> 3

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.500 

-<00:06:22.970> 50<00:06:23.900> and<00:06:24.530> again<00:06:24.800> we<00:06:25.220> divide<00:06:25.400> it<00:06:25.790> is<00:06:26.120> the<00:06:26.270> same

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
- 50 and again we divide it is the same

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:32.140 
- 50 and again we divide it is the same
as<00:06:26.660> over<00:06:26.780> adding<00:06:27.200> so<00:06:27.770> we<00:06:27.950> have<00:06:28.130> say<00:06:29.650> 15<00:06:31.150> divided

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
as over adding so we have say 15 divided

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.050 
as over adding so we have say 15 divided
by<00:06:32.650> minus<00:06:33.650> 15<00:06:33.920> divided<00:06:34.250> by<00:06:34.460> twice<00:06:34.670> through

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
by minus 15 divided by twice through

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.940 
by minus 15 divided by twice through
that's<00:06:35.750> gonna<00:06:35.900> give<00:06:36.110> us<00:06:36.670> five<00:06:37.690> masses

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
that's gonna give us five masses

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.520 
that's gonna give us five masses
canceller<00:06:40.540> so<00:06:41.540> what<00:06:42.020> we<00:06:42.140> need<00:06:42.290> to<00:06:42.320> remember

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
canceller so what we need to remember

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.270 
canceller so what we need to remember
but<00:06:43.400> we're<00:06:43.520> taking<00:06:44.030> away<00:06:44.090> off<00:06:44.330> adding<00:06:44.890> or<00:06:45.890> -<00:06:46.190> oh

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
but we're taking away off adding or - oh

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.660 
but we're taking away off adding or - oh
no<00:06:46.340> mods<00:06:46.550> only<00:06:47.020> makes<00:06:48.020> a<00:06:48.200> plus<00:06:48.470> so<00:06:49.280> once<00:06:49.490> the

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:49.670 
no mods only makes a plus so once the

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.570 
no mods only makes a plus so once the
ones<00:06:49.880> are<00:06:50.120> next<00:06:50.420> to<00:06:50.720> each<00:06:50.960> other<00:06:51.560> only<00:06:52.310> if

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
ones are next to each other only if

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.860 
ones are next to each other only if
they're<00:06:52.730> next<00:06:52.970> to<00:06:53.090> each<00:06:53.180> other<00:06:53.420> this<00:06:53.810> is

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
they're next to each other this is

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.730 
they're next to each other this is
important<00:06:54.410> when<00:06:54.860> it<00:06:55.040> times<00:06:55.310> it<00:06:55.520> or<00:06:55.790> dividing

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
important when it times it or dividing

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.530 
important when it times it or dividing
this<00:06:57.740> is<00:06:57.950> we've<00:06:58.130> got<00:06:58.310> two<00:06:58.580> minuses<00:06:59.000> at<00:06:59.330> all

00:06:59.530 --> 00:06:59.540 
this is we've got two minuses at all

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.530 
this is we've got two minuses at all
like<00:07:00.500> that<00:07:00.530> they're<00:07:01.370> gonna<00:07:01.460> give<00:07:01.670> us<00:07:01.820> applause

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:02.540 
like that they're gonna give us applause

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.630 
like that they're gonna give us applause
