00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
doesn't sit a hundred percent perfect

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.050 
doesn't sit a hundred percent perfect
along<00:02:19.280> top<00:02:19.879> really<00:02:20.810> really<00:02:21.140> small<00:02:21.590> my<00:02:21.830> new

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
along top really really small my new

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.460 
along top really really small my new
thing<00:02:23.060> here<00:02:23.360> it's<00:02:23.629> just<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:24.019> can<00:02:24.260> see<00:02:24.290> a

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
thing here it's just you can see a

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.890 
thing here it's just you can see a
little<00:02:24.709> bit<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.010> gap<00:02:25.269> that's<00:02:26.269> mostly<00:02:26.690> caused

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
little bit of a gap that's mostly caused

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.009 
little bit of a gap that's mostly caused
by<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.230> Flex<00:02:27.650> in<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.129> pillar<00:02:28.370> when<00:02:28.989> when<00:02:29.989> I

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
by the Flex in the pillar when when I

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.990 
by the Flex in the pillar when when I
bond<00:02:30.890> everything<00:02:31.370> together

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
bond everything together

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.809 
bond everything together
um<00:02:32.260> I<00:02:33.260> really<00:02:33.739> try<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:33.920> get<00:02:34.129> these<00:02:34.220> as<00:02:34.400> perfect

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
um I really try to get these as perfect

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.539 
um I really try to get these as perfect
as<00:02:34.940> possible<00:02:35.260> you'll<00:02:36.260> notice<00:02:36.739> sometimes<00:02:37.250> or

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
as possible you'll notice sometimes or

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.580 
as possible you'll notice sometimes or
so<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:37.879> can<00:02:38.060> see<00:02:38.239> a<00:02:38.269> little<00:02:38.510> slight<00:02:38.989> line<00:02:39.290> the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
so you can see a little slight line the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.860 
so you can see a little slight line the
bondo<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.280> kind<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.670> dips<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.150> where<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:41.390> where

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
bondo just kind of dips in where I where

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.860 
bondo just kind of dips in where I where
I<00:02:41.900> infuse<00:02:42.739> it<00:02:42.860> all<00:02:42.980> together<00:02:43.190> that's<00:02:44.120> normal

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
I infuse it all together that's normal

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.670 
I infuse it all together that's normal
um<00:02:45.049> I<00:02:45.700> really<00:02:46.700> get<00:02:46.970> them<00:02:47.120> as<00:02:47.239> best<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.629> can

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
um I really get them as best I can

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.280 
um I really get them as best I can
I<00:02:48.739> try<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.340> make<00:02:49.549> it<00:02:49.609> look<00:02:49.849> as<00:02:50.170> factory<00:02:51.170> as

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
I try to make it look as factory as

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.199 
I try to make it look as factory as
possible<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.160> one<00:02:52.340> isn't<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.879> hundred

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
possible this one isn't a hundred

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.729 
possible this one isn't a hundred
percent<00:02:53.329> you<00:02:53.660> can<00:02:53.810> see<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.019> little<00:02:54.290> more<00:02:54.440> here<00:02:54.680> I

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
percent you can see a little more here I

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.160 
percent you can see a little more here I
just<00:02:54.829> got<00:02:55.099> to<00:02:55.220> sand<00:02:55.430> that<00:02:55.579> down<00:02:56.140> respray<00:02:57.140> it

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
just got to sand that down respray it

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.530 
just got to sand that down respray it
but<00:02:57.650> for<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.430> most<00:02:58.609> part<00:02:58.700> this<00:02:59.000> one's<00:02:59.239> done

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
but for the most part this one's done

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.170 
but for the most part this one's done
almost<00:02:59.810> ready<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.349> ship<00:03:00.609> of<00:03:01.609> course<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.030> last

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
almost ready to ship of course the last

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.520 
almost ready to ship of course the last
step<00:03:02.450> you're<00:03:02.629> going<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.840> want<00:03:02.989> to<00:03:03.019> do<00:03:03.200> is

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
step you're going to want to do is

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.930 
step you're going to want to do is
carefully<00:03:04.190> put<00:03:04.579> the<00:03:04.609> screw<00:03:05.000> back<00:03:05.180> in<00:03:06.040> um<00:03:07.040> and

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
then you're going to tighten it down

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.059 
then you're going to tighten it down
one<00:03:09.859> other<00:03:10.040> thing<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:10.370> want<00:03:10.549> to<00:03:10.609> mention<00:03:10.730> uh

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
flex it it anyway the bondo is really

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.080 
flex it it anyway the bondo is really
brittle<00:03:21.319> and<00:03:21.530> if<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:21.829> is<00:03:22.040> twisted<00:03:22.489> it<00:03:22.910> could

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
brittle and if it is twisted it could

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.319 
brittle and if it is twisted it could
crack<00:03:23.359> so<00:03:23.840> just<00:03:24.049> be<00:03:24.200> real<00:03:24.530> careful<00:03:25.329> especially

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
when pulling it back off like this

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.589 
when pulling it back off like this
because<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.459> really<00:03:28.489> don't<00:03:28.790> wanna<00:03:29.030> I'm

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
actually gonna use two hands to put this

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.360 
actually gonna use two hands to put this
down<00:03:31.250> real<00:03:31.549> quick<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:33.590> really<00:03:33.889> don't<00:03:34.069> want

down real quick you really don't want
any<00:03:34.549> flex<00:03:35.120> in<00:03:35.419> the<00:03:35.450> bondo<00:03:35.900> it<00:03:36.049> can<00:03:36.260> crack<00:03:36.620> so

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
any flex in the bondo it can crack so

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.039

did pop that out I was able to slide it
out<00:03:41.329> I<00:03:42.400> slid<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:43.519> out<00:03:43.669> with<00:03:44.019> that<00:03:45.019> little<00:03:45.290> pin

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
out I slid it out with that little pin

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.930 
out I slid it out with that little pin
got<00:03:45.680> stuck<00:03:46.040> in<00:03:46.190> there<00:03:46.370> but<00:03:46.489> that's<00:03:46.639> okay<00:03:46.910> you

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
got stuck in there but that's okay you

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.220 
got stuck in there but that's okay you
can<00:03:47.239> pry<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.750> back<00:03:47.900> out<00:03:48.079> with<00:03:48.200> the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
can pry that back out with the

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.890 
can pry that back out with the
screwdriver<00:03:48.680> um<00:03:49.609> you<00:03:50.150> definitely<00:03:50.329> don't<00:03:50.720> want

screwdriver um you definitely don't want

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.890 
screwdriver um you definitely don't want
to<00:03:50.930> flex<00:03:51.319> it<00:03:51.500> side<00:03:51.859> to<00:03:52.040> side<00:03:52.280> at<00:03:52.489> all<00:03:52.609> like<00:03:53.510> like

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
to flex it side to side at all like like

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.379 
to flex it side to side at all like like
rotate<00:03:54.319> it<00:03:54.470> like<00:03:54.590> that<00:03:54.799> any<00:03:55.700> kind<00:03:55.910> of<00:03:56.000> twisting
