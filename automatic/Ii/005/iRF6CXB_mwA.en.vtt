weird music video it just didn't make

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.550 
weird music video it just didn't make
any<00:02:23.230> sense<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:24.520> it<00:02:25.270> was<00:02:25.450> like<00:02:25.720> they<00:02:26.530> were

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
any sense and it was like they were

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.610 
any sense and it was like they were
given<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.220> set<00:02:27.490> full<00:02:27.850> of<00:02:27.970> just<00:02:28.620> electronic

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
given a set full of just electronic

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.990 
given a set full of just electronic
equipment<00:02:30.250> oh<00:02:30.400> also<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.150> product<00:02:31.750> placement

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
equipment oh also the product placement

equipment oh also the product placement
was<00:02:34.000> really<00:02:34.630> bad<00:02:35.880> like<00:02:37.020> it's<00:02:38.400> clever<00:02:39.400> when<00:02:39.880> it

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
was really bad like it's clever when it

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.810 
was really bad like it's clever when it

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
makes sense to the music video such as

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.480 
makes sense to the music video such as
the<00:02:43.030> lady<00:02:43.210> gaga<00:02:43.600> telephone<00:02:43.780> when<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:45.190> guard
