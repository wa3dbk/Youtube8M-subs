00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.890
 hor 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:14.549
 but one may 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.430
 I'm just not wanted to have the nati-captain pinwheel 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.179
 I am a fan remember 17 years old for the PDS 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.759
 wanted to live the people born 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.609
 yes and at the moment life still nice pictures after that maybe the bag 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.609
 become 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.890
 and in the election 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.739
 to express oneself thus to escape 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.190
 the stop the hat as the people inside 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.080
 8 are 19 400 surrounding so Wiesmann sense old film still looks 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.620
 and on that then everything has built up then for example the CEAG SDI sturem in 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.350
 March is still a bit over the years, how long to storm 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.960
 At least the ISS, at least every detail has some 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.960
 meaning 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.840
 so 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.880
 which are less important for the typical ads that I make the bang 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.010
 heard speak in the air Munich is important that people look at me there 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.010
 i am a person i quite needs attention and 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.299
 of course I want to be happy if people look after me 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.250
 questionable to a twelfth they are shocked 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.250
 Insiders fear something beautiful 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.260
 in this sense 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.430
 next year is the most beautiful in my novel "The wrath has in the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.570
 Buy in the Netherlands 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.500
 Berlin 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.140
 a benefit 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.220
 even if a virus in the journal the Lancet Online still 18 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.220
 yes Oh and therefore belong to the black scene 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.950
 is trying to demarcate a bit of the society is around 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.360
 not so on these 2 steals it is certain that Einstein's interesting 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.029
 over eleven percent 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:22.199

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.389
 noted the reactions to the measure and to 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.240
 There are a lot of creative people in the scene 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.260
 I think it's just about time that everyone should actually be detailed 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.189
 these around ten percent 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.379
 there are comic cases of the Roma 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.379
 the situation can be put off 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:54.950

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:15.979
 Follow a feed 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.229

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:19.509
