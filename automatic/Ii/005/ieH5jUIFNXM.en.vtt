00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.649
 ah 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.600
 hi friends of intermediate tv friends of 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.820
 intermediate point mx as they are I am 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.850
 Luis I said and we are here before the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.770
 samsung galaxy s 4 a device that 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.350
 they have sent us and that already runs on 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.039
 networks lte has a capacity of 16 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.949
 gigabytes a rear camera of 13 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.679
 megapixels the time it's a team the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.289
 which has been talked about a lot and already 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.390
 we have here in intermediate so that you 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.000
 you can know what is inside 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.810
 of this device the time it gives us 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.980
 very much pleasure to have it let's meet 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.980
 What is inside 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.510
 Well, we removed the seals and 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.829
 let's look inside of him 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.350
 samsung galaxy s 4 here they have it 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.140
 you can see it the truth is that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.379
 samsung has changed the way in which 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.369
 pack your products now with this box 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.909
 that simulates wood makes me remember a lot 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.899
 the presentation event of this team 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.320
 in which this party or this we say 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:22.440
 showing of the 4 s was given in the middle of 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.690
 one of a broadway presence 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.670
 in which there were different as 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.430
 elements and I do not know why 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.850
 it's like a call to what served in 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.630
 that moment we can see how it looks here 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.720
 the label that covers the team we're going 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.520
 to remove it does not have an aroma 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.810
 particular and you will say why are you 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.660
 speaking of aromas but the truth is that 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.220
 it's a fact that firms like apple put 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.710
 an aroma within the products for 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.660
 that for you to feel with a 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.420
 complete experience when you perform 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.840
 this type of zinc fungus and the truth is 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.860
 that in this case not here we see the team 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.780
 that does look much much lighter 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.440
 feel lighter does not have the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.410
 internal battery 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.569
 and here you can see it what can 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.739
 have also here 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.770
 the truth is that it is very similar to s 3 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.590
 In design 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.960
 but I want to show you something else I want 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.960
 see what's in here is not so 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.380
 easy to remove the protector but good 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:34.460
 we are trying to do it the most 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.000
 easy for you but good here 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.000
 we have 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.220
 here it is whether it is 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.220
 angle 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.980
 every time it comes very well packed 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.110
 I think they are the best products 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.110
 packed here comes the protector 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.510
 you can include in the team 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.430
 now it comes for free here is 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.700
 a product that is sold with telcel well 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.760
 that all the elements the paper 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:14.050
 recycled to present the menu of everything 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.970
 a series of elements adoc to all the 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.120
 way in which it is presenting itself 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.420
 this this team the time it calls a lot 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.420
 attention 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.650
 let's see what else there is there inside here 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.810
 we can see the cables and connectors 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:36.340
 now in white 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.319
 hearing aids that look good similar 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.170
 to those who have presented at another time 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.640
 it 's nothing different the truth is that 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:49.290
 like a hearing aids 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.040
 normal we see here the battery is a 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.040
 drums 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.480
 let's say there is no specification 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.360
 beyond that we can mention in this 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:05.810
 in this battery 2600 milian pÃ©rez 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.030
 here you can see it and well we see 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.860
 here the cable the hearing aids and the 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.500
 connector 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.330
 the extra protectors for the audinos 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.330
 some insert hearing aids 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.229
 and well let's go now to 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.800
 as a detail we can say that this 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.509
 box is printed with soy ink here 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.139
 let's say I did not know it by heart he 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:38.050
 says here to the space the detail at cost 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.150
 let's open the team to do the 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.550
 initial setup 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.319
 every time I feel like this is this 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.860
 chef who drew things not this painter 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:51.000
 not that I drew things there and this is a 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:55.130
 a tree what a beautiful tree 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.130
 let's get this out 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.780
 you can see 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.770
 and now I do not know how 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.470
 much more metallic but this is plastic 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.840
 and I want to emphasize this is plastic 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.340
 because they have been the main criticisms 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.480
 as to the way in which samsung 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.370
 Is developing 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.010
 let's say that the industrial engineering of 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.870
 its products the truth is that the 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.760
 concept of samsung is that these are 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.490
 materials because this prevents that during 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.920
 some fall of the equipment is damaged and is a 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.780
 fact checked however the truth 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.170
 is that this has not convinced a 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.300
 important way to the user here we see 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.420
 how can a sim card be included 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:50.620
 card here we have how can they include 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.690
 micro sd but the important point are 16 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.810
 gb and can be extended can be placed 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.660
 a micro sd memory of up to 64 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.500
 gigabytes we are going at this moment to 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.870
 place the sim card and we will do 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.870
 later a direct comparative 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.180
 with another telephone a telephone of which 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.150
 we will be using as reference 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.860
 so you can compare the details 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:20.889
 of this product 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.889
 let's place our sim of telcel 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.330
 let's now place the battery 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.260
 and we already have the battery in place and 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:39.600
 we will also place this case here 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:43.630
 practically identical 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.970
 you can see can notice 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:50.320
 and this will be the one that we will place 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:54.360
 be able to use it and give more wave to this 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.360
 Samsung Galaxy s4 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.050
 we have it 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:09.310
 let's do the initial configuration 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.260
 of this team 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.690
 the truth is that something of what to me 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.910
 I really liked this product when I had 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:19.000
 the opportunity to see new york was 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:22.000
 the screen I hope you can 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.590
 I also appreciate like me but 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.300
 good if you have the opportunity to see it 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.970
 and compare it with the products and the 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.370
 screen looks great here we are already 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:33.960
 watching how he turns on the samsung galaxy s 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.960
 4 you are seeing it here 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:43.710
 from telcel the samsung logo is a 

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.390
 product that will be sold exclusively 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.860
 for three months with teleseries after 

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.860
 will be with other operators
