00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 God 

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:08.149
 what 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.149
 what I just saw 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.640
 it's not because a hero out of water is 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.470
 a movie for gold you're one of the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.840
 children 'spongebob' and also the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.489
 brothers not so kids movie box 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.869
 an adult man that his friends tell him 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:32.160
 you know it's funnier with 24-25 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.019
 references in this second great 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.489
 adaptation on the big screen of 'bob 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.989
 sponge ' we will see our hero 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.089
 Yellow join forces with enemies 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.800
 because that way and only then you can 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.629
 discover the mystery of who stole the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.390
 secret formula of the cangreburguer is 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.690
 find the formula stop the 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.430
 apocalypse and set off bikini bottom 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.980
 let's start with the good everybody 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.510
 he knows spongebob and that's also not 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.489
 everything everyone knows that you can put 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.379
 one of the best series of all 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.969
 times are his first seasons but 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.460
 also everyone knows that 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.739
 currently 'spongebob' if it is no longer 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.929
 it seems nothing to what before it has become 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.360
 in a very childish program a humor 

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:10.830
 quite absurd and simply in the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.539
 caricature that you put to your little brother 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.160
 to stop you from bothering this 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.810
 movie is not a 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.190
 similar to this if you thought that this 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.750
 was going to be the classic movie where the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.550
 characters from a television series 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.120
 interact with the real world as the 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.490
 smurf garfield gamer yes that's how 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.930
 for 15 or 20 minutes of the movie already 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.880
 that the majority of the movie is in 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.320
 animated reality the trailers where 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.030
 we saw the characters out of the water 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.560
 they are the part that lasts less in the 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.560
 movie so if you're afraid they're going to 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.760
 ruin even more his grace called 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.900
 absolutely wrong in fact ago 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.210
 I go sponge again be the 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.700
 character that we knew the great 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.950
 franchise that we love without giving 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.890
 visit because old playing this 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.330
 movie is incredibly good they were 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.860
 more than a lot of times where I and 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.710
 all the people with whom I went to see 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.940
 this movie we were laughing not 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.410
 it's that kind of movies where you 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.330
 you want to sink in the seat by the 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.920
 shame it feels like episodes of 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.840
 Spongebob not as if Hollywood had 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.010
 taken a character that makes money and you 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.750
 they would have made a movie so that 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.369
 I made more money because friends 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.160
 mine 'spongebob' a hero outside of 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.870
 water really has heart and soul it 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.270
 note that they put a lot of creativity and 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.280
 effort in it that if they cared 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.020
 make a good movie thing that 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.160
 the plot is nothing we've seen in 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.270
 another world and neither is it like 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.280
 they were telling the story more 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.540
 deep and important story 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.120
 but it is an entertaining film 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.560
 It is a very entertaining film and also 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.180
 that exceeds all expectations with 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.310
 the ones that I went to see her and also the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.930
 transition that they make to the real world is 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.690
 very well designed his designs as 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.090
 superheroes his powers how they look in 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.920
 screen is good I would even say that 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.140
 they look a lot better than what 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.660
 Smurfs looked and also something very 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.120
 important are loyal to the show and their 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.280
 characters is like I already said watch episodes 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.450
 of spongebob on the big screen are 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.670
 faithful to the current form of their 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.440
 characters and their patrician essence is the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.269
 adorable idiot we know we call 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.100
 Well, nun can be quite annoying 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.080
 but they know how to use it well 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.610
 arenita to the white genius in his search 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.140
 to steal the formula from the big 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.640
 bourgeois squid that is what 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.319
 probably many of us end up being 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.600
 when we get our first job 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.550
 and gift crab he loves money money 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.989
 money money and also the movie knows 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.459
 what are your standards is not the 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.170
 classic children's movie that deals with 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.850
 put a lot of issues at the same 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.890
 time trying to give you messages 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.840
 generic but the basis for this 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.340
 film is teamwork and it is a 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.319
 pretty recurring theme 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.060
 and I bet if a child or person saw 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.040
 this movie would understand very well what 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.920
 the film tries to present old 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.280
 when they refer to the mask the 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.099
 Time Machine Escape New York- 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.959
 the illuminati and when I listen to don 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.629
 crab say welcome to the apocalypse 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.760
 Mr. Squid, I do not expect you to enjoy the 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.730
 game surprises you what a simple 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.709
 movie for kids can do but 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.209
 clarified that the coin has two sides 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.980
 also this movie has some 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.720
 how many big problems for example is 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.700
 how the story tells they feel 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.370
 comfortable different episodes of 'bob 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.470
 sponge 'lengthened and put together two 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.090
 episodes that have nothing to do anymore 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.190
 that a few small references 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.170
 the whole first part and a little bit more 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.910
 of the film is animated and in background of 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.200
 bikini and maybe some 20 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.489
 minutes are out of the water but the 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.049
 point is that they are two stories 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.880
 different or at least it's the same 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.720
 story but they feel like two routes 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.280
 different 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.380
 in the first half we will see a background 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.850
 of post-apocalyptic bikini we were going to 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.620
 record sponge and plankton try to 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.419
 work together to be able to decipher what 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.520
 is happening and in the other story 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.930
 that focus a little less do everything 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.910
 our cast fight against antonio 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.680
 flags but 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.120
 is that it does not feel like a movie in 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.950
 yes but as if they were two movies 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.630
 different short or two episodes very 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.940
 long I also think that humor could 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.460
 considered some disadvantage are 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.610
 very smart jokes some very 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.370
 complicated some very very bizarre and 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.320
 adults which is excellent for 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.000
 people who grew up watching bob sponja 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.310
 I went to see this movie with a girl from 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.470
 4 years and more people do not believe that it is 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.330
 something with girls of 4 years old only and 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.250
 I can assure that we old people 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.840
 we were laughing even more than the 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.640
 children in the room because maybe it 's a 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.800
 wall that they will not understand and laugh 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.720
 more when there are strong colors hits and 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.070
 falls and humor that we maybe 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.510
 we do not find funny but I 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.070
 I consider that humor is key 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.750
 well especially in this movie because 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.940
 there are several jokes for the two worlds 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.650
 children and us old but I think it's 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.450
 more a very nostalgic movie for 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.160
 us and you definitely have to 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.560
 have been a fan of spongebob to be able to 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.510
 understand it 100% because it is not we have 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.520
 one without our characters are already 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.930
 pre-established more than 12 years of 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.850
 television is what helped us 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.170
 establish these characters there is no 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.850
 reason why they will take the 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.380
 time to explain to us who are each 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.270
 who in the movie because in addition 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.910
 if they do it but in such a subtle way 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.340
 that works very well but we did not get to 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.370
 know 100% of all the characters 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.240
 as patricio calamardo arenita 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.460
 characters that have very little 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.710
 participation in the visual effects not 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.690
 they are the best if bob sponja your group 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.950
 of friends are not incredible but I think 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.930
 that the effects come to that point 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.550
 specials the bsn we must interact to 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.470
 antonio flags with the characters of 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.350
 bikini bottom and I think visually 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.940
 it was not the best thing ends sight class 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.380
 of seagulls that accompanied Antonio 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.030
 flags that tried to be like in 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.920
 relief as a doctor thing that I already said 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.660
 before a comedy movie does not 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.400
 you need a relief co doctor because this one 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.070
 he had it and I think it was the worst part of 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.750
 the movie as a final conclusion if you 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.910
 you come in thinking that this movie is going to 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.740
 to lend completely and to bore such 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.880
 In some cases, it may happen like this 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.650
 there are times where you feel 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.180
 ridiculous and you want to sink into the 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.730
 seat but for each one of those 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.280
 moments there are 40 moments and jokes more 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.900
 great fun and smart 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.790
 jokes enjoyable yes that goes back to 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.560
 set your hope on what used to 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.300
 be 'spongebob' I went with my friends 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.520
 and a very beautiful girl to see this 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.290
 movie is not going the 4-year-old girl and 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.370
 I said give me your criticism of the movie and 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.770
 we get enough 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.240
 but also she told me again this 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.590
 movie is not for all children 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.990
 small if you want to see a good 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.850
 child movie or are you looking for 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.620
 something nostalgic this movie is 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.389
 exactly what you were looking for but 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.150
 I assure something there is visual is a bit 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:01.070
 dark bizarre and terrifying that not 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.540
 I think that in young children they should 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.040
 see I have to mention to you again that 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.810
 There is a small reference to 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.050
 illuminati but in spite of all those 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.970
 things I in my full youth enjoyed 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.630
 immensely from 'spongebob' a hero 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.060
 out of the water 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:19.100
 my final grade for bob sponja a 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:21.560
 hero out of the water is a 7.2 and as 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.840
 exxon I would like to emphasize that there is a 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.180
 reference to the epic rap battles 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.919
 of the story in this movie alone 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.870
 to see the kind of material that 

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:32.270
 contains and now I have a question for 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.250
 you are the whole world sometime in your 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.560

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.580
 sponge that are so ugly the biggest 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.280
 its an instrument 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.240
 I do not have a soul I'm ready I love the 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.240
 money listen 

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:48.889

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.900

00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:52.550
