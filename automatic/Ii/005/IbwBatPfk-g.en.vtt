00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
hard right now to do both at the same

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.059 
hard right now to do both at the same
time<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.230> also<00:02:13.410> hope

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069

the background either but saw no anyway
I<00:02:20.790> thought<00:02:20.939> it<00:02:21.060> would<00:02:21.150> be<00:02:21.239> fun<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.689> know<00:02:22.560> that

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920
