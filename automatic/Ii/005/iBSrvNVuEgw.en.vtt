00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.010
 This week is going to be really cool because it's 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.470
 a doubt that several students of 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.320
 veterinary medicine has and many 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.239
 many, many owners of pets have in 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.070

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.230
 lick the paws and licks licks licks in 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.329
 desperately a lot of people this is already 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.450
 popular culture, this is what people are saying 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.469
 You're new to you. 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.230
 not only stress survives if the animal 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.500
 despite many people submitting and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.289
 humanize such a point that also leads to 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.149
 animal to a stressful situation or lack of 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.899
 care also takes the animal almost 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.360
 stress 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.250
 but that's not all that makes your dog 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.909
 licks the paws mainly when 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.090
 It is associated with otitis that zinha 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.180
 itchy ears that scratch the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.700
 butt on the carpet, the madam does not 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.180
 crazy when you see the dog 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.759
 rubbing the butt on the carpet 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.340
 this you all have to stay tuned until 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.590
 if only because many people care about 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.220
 The veterinary clinic speaks 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.229
 dog is with an itch that is if I 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.900
 were francisco de assis 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.960
 Jesus Christ could have discovered more 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.420
 yes see the veterinarian animal no 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.899
 can close a diagnosis because at last 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.490
 can be numerous different problems 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:57.450
 I'm here to talk about fungus that 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.460
 causes all of this and is very common in 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.050
 of veterinary medical practice 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.470
 this fungus 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.860
 madrid mallas eszio that's the ugly name 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.660
 cause a darker secretion leaves the 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.660
 very reddish ear 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.480
 usually gives the little fingers 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.090
 dog in the butt also when 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.880
 it scraping and on the ears 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.890
 this fungus it is secondary some other 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.300
 pathology any other dysfunction that 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.190
 this means 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.560
 this fungus it is linked to immunity 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.200
 of the individual animal and world oppressed 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.600
 or with other problems with the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.440
 low immunity they may present 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.140
 so this type of fungus because it is a 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.300
 Ascesis is part of the microbiota either 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.820
 say it is already born in the organism of the 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.740
 animal is present every time it lowers 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.530
 immunity or have any problems and if 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.460
 they are encouraged and subject to this 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.460
 infection and bags and treatment is 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.440
