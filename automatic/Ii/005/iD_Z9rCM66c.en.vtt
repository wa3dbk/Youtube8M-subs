Dwight thrips how come you keep your

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.740 
Dwight thrips how come you keep your
gold<00:01:34.860> tech<00:01:35.100> decks<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.820> packages<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.509> guess

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
gold tech decks in the packages I guess

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.630 
gold tech decks in the packages I guess
just<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.229> they'll<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.560> brand<00:01:37.799> new<00:01:37.920> maybe<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.460> 30

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
just so they'll be brand new maybe in 30

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.920 
just so they'll be brand new maybe in 30
years<00:01:38.880> someone<00:01:39.329> will<00:01:39.420> think<00:01:39.450> they're<00:01:39.750> cool

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
years someone will think they're cool

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.480 
years someone will think they're cool
because<00:01:40.170> they're<00:01:40.439> still<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.770> packages<00:01:41.280> but

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
because they're still in packages but

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.039 
because they're still in packages but
i'm<00:01:41.610> probably<00:01:41.820> not<00:01:42.000> behind<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.509> next<00:01:42.810> one<00:01:42.930> is

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
i'm probably not behind the next one is
