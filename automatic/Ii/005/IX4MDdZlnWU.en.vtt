right<00:01:54.070> there<00:01:54.250> into<00:01:55.060> then<00:01:55.300> that's<00:01:55.510> good<00:01:55.720> hose<00:01:55.900> I

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
right there into then that's good hose I

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.570 
right there into then that's good hose I
put<00:01:56.290> that<00:01:56.380> on<00:01:56.530> 20<00:01:56.770> years<00:01:56.920> ago<00:01:56.980> just<00:01:57.250> old<00:01:57.550> enough

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
put that on 20 years ago just old enough

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.540 
put that on 20 years ago just old enough
but<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:59.140> that<00:01:59.230> motor<00:01:59.500> running<00:01:59.620> with<00:02:00.520> that

but with that motor running with that

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.910 
but with that motor running with that
pump<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:01.030> get<00:02:01.180> a<00:02:01.210> set<00:02:01.420> around<00:02:01.600> 23<00:02:02.229> 24<00:02:02.650> hundred

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920

I<00:02:03.580> think<00:02:04.240> I'm<00:02:04.330> around<00:02:04.570> 14<00:02:04.990> 15<00:02:05.200> tons<00:02:05.710> on<00:02:05.860> that

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
I think I'm around 14 15 tons on that

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.890 
I think I'm around 14 15 tons on that
with<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.159> 4-inch<00:02:06.520> cylinder<00:02:06.850> so<00:02:07.510> we're<00:02:07.659> in<00:02:07.750> their

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
with a 4-inch cylinder so we're in their

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.680 
with a 4-inch cylinder so we're in their
fair<00:02:08.440> better<00:02:08.679> pressure<00:02:08.920> anyway<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:10.239> axles

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
fair better pressure anyway the axles

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.949 
fair better pressure anyway the axles
well<00:02:11.290> that's<00:02:11.409> actually<00:02:11.620> me<00:02:12.340> doing<00:02:12.599> axles<00:02:13.599> just

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
well that's actually me doing axles just

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.080 
well that's actually me doing axles just
a<00:02:14.019> spindle<00:02:14.379> I<00:02:14.469> cut<00:02:14.680> off<00:02:14.769> I<00:02:14.889> think<00:02:14.950> was<00:02:15.189> a<00:02:15.280> GMC

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
a spindle I cut off I think was a GMC

this exhaust solidly monitor right here

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.410 
this exhaust solidly monitor right here
been<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.370> same<00:02:21.580> for<00:02:21.760> 20<00:02:21.850> years<00:02:22.210> I've<00:02:22.330> got

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
been the same for 20 years I've got

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.940 
been the same for 20 years I've got
quite<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.660> few<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:22.960> these<00:02:23.080> now<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:25.950> that's

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
quite a few of these now and that's

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.390 
quite a few of these now and that's
about<00:02:27.100> it

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
about it

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.820 
about it
I<00:02:27.640> got<00:02:28.090> another<00:02:28.270> one<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.660> side<00:02:28.960> wheels

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
I got another one that side wheels

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.710 
I got another one that side wheels
anyway<00:02:30.280> stalls<00:02:30.610> are<00:02:30.820> quite<00:02:31.030> nicely<00:02:31.240> there

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
anyway stalls are quite nicely there

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.870 
anyway stalls are quite nicely there
I<00:02:31.860> pick<00:02:32.860> up<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.010> tractor<00:02:33.370> get<00:02:33.460> a<00:02:33.490> little<00:02:33.670> jack

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
I pick up a tractor get a little jack

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.160 
I pick up a tractor get a little jack
stand<00:02:34.120> on<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.270> front<00:02:34.450> door<00:02:34.600> holder<00:02:34.870> up<00:02:34.960> there

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
stand on the front door holder up there

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.470 
stand on the front door holder up there
but<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:35.890> know<00:02:35.980> what<00:02:36.010> we<00:02:36.640> split<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.940> lot<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.360> wood

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
but you know what we split a lot of wood

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.410 
but you know what we split a lot of wood
here<00:02:38.340> yeah<00:02:39.340> what<00:02:39.550> here<00:02:39.820> you're<00:02:40.030> not<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.210> roll

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
here yeah what here you're not a roll

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.140 
here yeah what here you're not a roll
over<00:02:40.450> there<00:02:40.780> we<00:02:41.170> burn<00:02:41.380> wood<00:02:41.680> get<00:02:42.670> tons<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:43.030> wood

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
over there we burn wood get tons of wood

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.850 
over there we burn wood get tons of wood
and<00:02:43.600> this<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:43.870> how<00:02:43.960> we<00:02:44.020> split<00:02:44.320> every<00:02:44.590> little

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
and this is how we split every little

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.920 
and this is how we split every little
bit<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.190> might<00:02:45.880> take<00:02:46.060> an<00:02:46.180> axe<00:02:46.390> not<00:02:46.600> one<00:02:46.810> of

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
bit of it might take an axe not one of

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.270 
bit of it might take an axe not one of
them<00:02:47.280> but<00:02:48.280> anyway<00:02:48.880> that's<00:02:49.420> all<00:02:50.100> makes<00:02:51.100> my

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
them but anyway that's all makes my

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.190 
them but anyway that's all makes my
splitter<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.510> think<00:02:52.690> what<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.840> made<00:02:53.050> this

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
splitter and I think what I made this

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.570 
splitter and I think what I made this
thing<00:02:53.440> which<00:02:53.620> probably<00:02:53.770> cost<00:02:54.220> around<00:02:54.400> a

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
thing which probably cost around a

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.420 
thing which probably cost around a
thousand<00:02:55.030> bucks<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:56.260> build<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.590> now<00:02:57.070> Christ

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
thousand bucks to build it now Christ

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.160 
thousand bucks to build it now Christ
you<00:02:57.610> can<00:02:57.730> buy<00:02:57.880> them<00:02:58.060> four<00:02:58.210> thousand<00:02:58.870> bucks<00:02:58.990> all

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
you can buy them four thousand bucks all

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.230 
you can buy them four thousand bucks all
complete<00:02:59.500> now<00:02:59.710> but<00:03:00.490> a<00:03:00.520> lot<00:03:00.580> of<00:03:00.760> stuff<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.000> buy

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
complete now but a lot of stuff you buy

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.820 
complete now but a lot of stuff you buy
now<00:03:01.420> is<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.630> cheap<00:03:01.840> Chinese<00:03:02.230> junking<00:03:02.740> I

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
now is that cheap Chinese junking I

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.340 
now is that cheap Chinese junking I
don't<00:03:03.010> know<00:03:03.070> how<00:03:03.190> well<00:03:03.430> all<00:03:03.580> that<00:03:03.760> stuff<00:03:04.000> is

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
don't know how well all that stuff is

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.200 
don't know how well all that stuff is
