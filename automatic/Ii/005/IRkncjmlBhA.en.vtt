00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.990
 it's not like that was presented 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.090
 a fee for a fee 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.270
 supposes a counterpart of these indices 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.140
 so it's a tax then it's a 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.670
 tax disproportionate 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.609
 since there is in return only the 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.999
 right in quotation marks to lose 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.710
 natural spaces it was an anti 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.409
 economic which was gradually 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.960
 destroy part of the economy of the 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:33.880
 pleasure and some of the savings of 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.280
 coastline we decided to 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.890
 oppose this measure 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.050
 so we did a lot of things on 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.670
 first approached the whole 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.700
 organizations that by our side live 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.020
 with boating and that was there so 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:56.740
 for this call today 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.270
 obviously the federations the federation 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.100
 marinas the federation of 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.110
 browser associations the federation 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.520
 recreational fishermen but also the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.100
 French federation of sailing the 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.000
 motorboat federation all one his 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.729
 federations to dive everything everything 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.140
 association who with whom we have a 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.040
 long life together 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.320
 today those who present this 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.479
 this provision 10 but do you 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.930
 do not worry she has a very 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.610
 limited good she would touch two small 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.009
 areas in Corsica and then eventually 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.460
 an area with banyuls in the Pyrenees 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.410
 Eastern 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.960
 the truth is that the article of law 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.690
 is not written like that the article of 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.729
 law says that a mooring fee can 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.550
 be perceived by any community 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.259
 public or public institutions that 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.440
 contributes to the management of a marine area 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.899
 protected today 25% of the coastline 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.340
 French tomorrow probably a lot 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.430
 even more since we are talking about the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.800
 creation by 2020 of 10 natural parks 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.110
 extra sailors so that's 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.270
 obviously most of the areas of 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.959
 boating we call to 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.459
 sign a call because we want 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.170
 actually you have to be 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.330
 many to be heard 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.050
 but we also want to create through this 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.120
 site a dialogue site exchanges with 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.010
 all those who defend and share the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.510
 values ​​of this splint and who I think 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.700
 are millions in France 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.590
 so in this sense this call is some 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.840
 very important thing because at the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.970
 times the beginning of a specific contract 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.590
 decide and we do not want this 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.050
 tax and we will do everything that is in 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.720
 our ability to avoid it and 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.410
 on the other hand it is the birth of a 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.390
 of a community of associations and 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.880
 professional federations for 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.240
 express and make the voice of 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.240
 boating
