00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.620
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.110
 my channel and another video 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.170
 on a canal 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.910
 Today it is about the transaction is the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.510
 second step in the protein 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.279
 biosynthesis last time was about the 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.949
 Transcription today about the transaction 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:28.460
 what exactly is and how exactly 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.869
 expires we come now the 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.270
 constellation takes place at the ribosomes 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.850
 instead of 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.860
 there will be contained in the mrn 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.579
 bases sequence in the family acid 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.620
 sequence of a protein translated for the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.780
 transport of amino acids to the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.110
 ribosomes will be the transfer rna course 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.559
 needs the structure of DNA molecules 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.460
 because there are two specific region on one 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:03.379
 of which is responsible for the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.479
 binding of tna an gm 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.439
 these are three free ones 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.299
 nucleotides for each tna 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.400
 are characteristic 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.259
 they are called anti-koran because here 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.670
 the bond to the complementary 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.820
 triplex korans of mrn the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.560
 other region of the tna is used for education 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:35.850
 a specific amino acid amino acid 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:38.100
 accept the initiation at the beginning 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.979
 the transaction is the smaller one 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.860
 Subunit of a ribosome at one 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.500
 specific binding site in the 50th 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.270
 close to the sea 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.180
 then it moves to five 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.219
 stroked 3 strich direction to the mhh 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:02.960
 Along is a start cologne mostly 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:04.640
 reached here is the subunit 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.159
 and 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.159
 this is probably going to be this 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.459
 being arrogant 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.000
 adem y 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:27.770
 and that had just here then this 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:30.050
 Amino acid packed the Tsa molecules are 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.020
 present in large numbers move 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.489
 free in the surrounding cell fluid 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:39.610
 they accidentally store themselves in the 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:41.540
 run only the dna molecules with the 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.950
 complementary anti cures can 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.840
 bind according to the base pairing 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.050
 the city ​​turn up takes place with her 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:56.290
 corresponding antique to the m rna 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:59.390
 start co.don ag here 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.440
 the mails to the genetic code is this 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:07.250
 DNA with amino acid methionine short 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:11.000
 Met laden after the state complex 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.180
 from m rna small ribosomes subunit 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.760
 un mission was formed in rna 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:25.319
 This larger subunit of the 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:27.599
 ribosoms add to that just here 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.290
 Composite the visum has two 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.780
 Bonds for trs directly over 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:40.349
 neighboring bases triplex the m rna 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:45.049
 lie here the city tna possession too 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:54.470
 beginning of the output ppt 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:56.810
 Binding this here this 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.640
 following friday sheet is in the entrance 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:06.260
 so arminia to binding this 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:09.440
 Here's the new one that's stored here 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.560
 Now one of the mrsa complementary 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.440
 perpetrators with an appropriate 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:21.470
 amino acid is loaded 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:24.680
 they can the two amino acids, the 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.770
 at the trs a position b and a 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:33.890
 are bound by a peptide 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:36.050
 bond with each other here 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.440
 bond between the amino acid 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.470
 methionine web and the state tera 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.220
 dissolved and the free tna leaves the 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.620
 exit area of the ribosome she can in 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.090
 cytoplasm again with the associated 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.130
 amino acid are loaded 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.790
 the ribosome moves around a base 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.910
 continue along the m5 line 3 direction 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.970
 the second tna is now in 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.430
 exit region of the ribosome and the 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:14.780
 Entrance area a is for the next one 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:15.480
 tna free to the mrn pictures that 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.730
 ribosome 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.400
 lies down on to the m RNA along 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.730
 being continuously new amino acids 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.490
 to be added by the tff 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:32.550
 amino acid chain grows up the ribosome 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:06:03.360
 one of the stop course ag or uw h 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:06:09.719
 achieved for the city 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:11.539
 co.don ag or usa there is no t rna 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:14.639
 molecules with a complementary 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.889
 Anticor is one of the 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.069
 Stop course in the entrance area of ​​the 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.840
 So ribosoms can not be tna attached 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:23.520
 tie 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.810
 instead has a specific one 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:31.110
 enzyme of the so-called release store 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.409
 all english release fekter the input 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.199
 a 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:36.110
 here is this release fekter now on 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:40.139
 the bound 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:44.270
 The bound release store splits 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:47.490
 the finished policy of the last tna 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:50.129
 In addition, the volume separates from the 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.710
 read m rna and falls into his 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:55.199
 both subdivisions sooner or later 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:59.419
 the energy is in their individual 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:59.419
 individual motives decomposed 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.449
 2 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:06.249
 a polyp active its specific 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:08.259
 a spatial structure through the 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:10.869
 interaction between side chains 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:16.210
 single amino acids are determined and 

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:20.289
 stabilized and ultimately have 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:25.419
 we use our product our our protein 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:28.360
 our amino acid chains are so easy 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:31.240
 goes all in soft bit of an 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.539
 little bit and helped 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:37.389
 illustrates 

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:42.240
 yes you say how you know that 

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:47.550
 also found the holiday was not good 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.550
 Thanks for listening and see you soon
