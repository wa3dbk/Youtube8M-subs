00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
showing you guys two of the folding

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.619 
showing you guys two of the folding
systems<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.009> have<00:00:05.220> for<00:00:05.730> which<00:00:06.000> I'm<00:00:06.150> holding<00:00:06.480> on

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
systems I have for which I'm holding on

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.810 
systems I have for which I'm holding on
the<00:00:06.810> linus<00:00:07.109> tech<00:00:07.290> tip<00:00:07.470> team<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.610> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
the linus tech tip team this is the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.660 
the linus tech tip team this is the
first<00:00:09.059> one<00:00:09.210> it's<00:00:09.929> not<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.889> best<00:00:11.070> folding

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
first one it's not the best folding

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.339 
first one it's not the best folding
system<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.240> world<00:00:12.300> but<00:00:12.540> it's<00:00:12.690> something<00:00:12.870> i

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
system in the world but it's something i

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.870 
system in the world but it's something i
could<00:00:13.710> turn<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.130> little<00:00:14.400> light<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.670> show<00:00:14.790> you

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
could turn on a little light to show you

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.460 
could turn on a little light to show you
guys<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.059> little<00:00:15.150> bit<00:00:15.299> better<00:00:15.480> it's<00:00:16.379> actually

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
guys a little bit better it's actually

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.640 
guys a little bit better it's actually
really<00:00:16.830> bad<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.310> it's<00:00:17.789> really<00:00:18.000> ghetto<00:00:18.300> but<00:00:18.650> um

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
really bad and it's really ghetto but um

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.500 
really bad and it's really ghetto but um
this<00:00:20.039> was<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> really<00:00:20.699> really<00:00:20.939> old<00:00:21.029> computer

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
this was a really really old computer

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.630 
this was a really really old computer
that<00:00:21.630> i<00:00:21.660> salvaged<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.380> i<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.070> open<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.340> up<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
that i salvaged and i can open it up the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.070 
that i salvaged and i can open it up the
side<00:00:23.789> panel<00:00:24.060> doesn't<00:00:24.210> close<00:00:24.420> anymore<00:00:24.720> sadly

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
side panel doesn't close anymore sadly

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
what I have inside here is a 600 watt

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.290 
what I have inside here is a 600 watt
psu<00:00:35.219> because<00:00:35.700> eventually<00:00:35.940> I'm<00:00:36.120> gonna<00:00:36.210> add

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
psu because eventually I'm gonna add

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.299 
psu because eventually I'm gonna add
another<00:00:36.450> graphics<00:00:36.960> card<00:00:37.140> onto<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.160> that

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
another graphics card onto here so that

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.830 
another graphics card onto here so that
I<00:00:38.340> could<00:00:38.460> fold<00:00:38.700> with<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.540> currently

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
I could fold with but it's currently

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.580 
I could fold with but it's currently
folding<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.530> with<00:00:41.280> an<00:00:41.460> 8800<00:00:42.149> GT<00:00:42.590> from

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
folding with a with an 8800 GT from

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.970 
folding with a with an 8800 GT from
nvidia<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.969> gets<00:00:45.120> around<00:00:45.420> 400<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.410> 500

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
nvidia and it gets around 400 to 500

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.610 
nvidia and it gets around 400 to 500
points<00:00:47.160> per<00:00:47.399> day<00:00:48.140> it's<00:00:49.140> not<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> best<00:00:49.530> but

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
points per day it's not the best but

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.930 
points per day it's not the best but
it's<00:00:49.920> something<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.340> i<00:00:50.399> got<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.760> 30

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it's something that i got for like 30

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.610 
it's something that i got for like 30
bucks<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.329> i'm<00:00:51.420> happy<00:00:51.629> that's<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.559> right

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
bucks so i'm happy that's this one right

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.069 
bucks so i'm happy that's this one right
here<00:00:52.770> ah<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:54.030> cpu<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.570> too<00:00:54.780> weak<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
here ah and the cpu it's too weak to

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.600 
here ah and the cpu it's too weak to
actually<00:00:55.440> folds<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:55.920> i<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.190> kind<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.430> let<00:00:56.579> it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
actually folds so i just kind of let it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.220 
actually folds so i just kind of let it
run<00:00:56.879> run<00:00:57.239> its<00:00:57.390> own<00:00:57.510> thing<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.780> that's<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.020> 1

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
run run its own thing and that's like 1

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.939 
run run its own thing and that's like 1
gig<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.469> ram<00:00:58.640> so<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.780> 120<00:01:01.590> gigabyte

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
gig of ram so and like a 120 gigabyte

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.399 
gig of ram so and like a 120 gigabyte
hard<00:01:02.070> drive<00:01:02.160> but<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.809> kind<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.170> saved

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
hard drive but it just I kind of saved

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.679 
hard drive but it just I kind of saved
it<00:01:04.619> from<00:01:04.890> death<00:01:05.820> where<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.330> wasn't<00:01:06.600> doing

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
it from death where it wasn't doing

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.149 
it from death where it wasn't doing
anything<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.260> now<00:01:07.350> its<00:01:07.530> folding<00:01:07.920> getting

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
anything and now its folding getting

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.300 
anything and now its folding getting
around<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.570> 400<00:01:09.570> point<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.350> 4,000

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
around like 400 point or for 4,000

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.510 
around like 400 point or for 4,000
points<00:01:11.460> per<00:01:11.700> day<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.830> it's<00:01:13.830> actually<00:01:14.040> served

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
points per day and it's actually served

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.230 
points per day and it's actually served
me<00:01:14.670> well<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:16.250> super<00:01:17.250> weird<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.119> way

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
me well but the it's super weird the way

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.550 
me well but the it's super weird the way
that<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.509> case<00:01:18.750> was<00:01:18.930> set<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.170> when<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.350> first

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
that this case was set up when I first

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.859 
that this case was set up when I first
got<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> because<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> bottom<00:01:21.659> of

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
got it because it this is the bottom of

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.390 
got it because it this is the bottom of
the<00:01:21.930> case<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.439> up<00:01:22.590> here<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> bottom

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the case like up here this is the bottom

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.440 
the case like up here this is the bottom
like<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:25.049> rubber<00:01:25.320> stands

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
like this is a little like rubber stands

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.109 
like this is a little like rubber stands
so<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.600> was<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:27.780> flipped<00:01:28.140> over<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:29.119> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
so it was like flipped over and the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.880 
so it was like flipped over and the
motherboard<00:01:30.479> wasn't<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> weird<00:01:30.990> like

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
motherboard wasn't a weird like

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.920 
motherboard wasn't a weird like
everything<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:32.970> kind<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.240> weird<00:01:33.450> right<00:01:33.720> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
everything was kind of weird right and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.960 
everything was kind of weird right and
it<00:01:34.890> didn't<00:01:35.100> come<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.280> his<00:01:35.490> power<00:01:35.670> supply

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
it didn't come with his power supply

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.550 
it didn't come with his power supply
actually<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.720> one<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:36.930> canvas<00:01:37.140> like

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
actually this is the one at canvas like

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.340 
actually this is the one at canvas like
this<00:01:37.799> one<00:01:37.950> right<00:01:38.189> here<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.659> ripped<00:01:40.229> that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
this one right here but I ripped that

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.270 
this one right here but I ripped that
one<00:01:40.409> out<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.770> put<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.009> new<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:43.280> it's

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
one out and put in a new one and it's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.179 
one out and put in a new one and it's
just<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.970> all<00:01:45.149> out<00:01:45.270> weird<00:01:45.680> because<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:47.100> was

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
just just all out weird because it was

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.770 
just just all out weird because it was
flipped<00:01:47.430> over<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.759> then<00:01:48.000> eventually<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.479> had

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
flipped over and then eventually I had

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.990 
flipped over and then eventually I had
the<00:01:48.899> smart<00:01:49.200> idea<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> that's<00:01:50.430> why<00:01:50.640> there's<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the smart idea to that's why there's a

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.569 
the smart idea to that's why there's a
hole<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.909> side<00:01:53.909> panel<00:01:54.240> I'd<00:01:54.360> cut<00:01:54.689> out<00:01:54.780> um<00:01:55.649> I

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
hole in this side panel I'd cut out um I

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.719 
hole in this side panel I'd cut out um I
had<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.180> smart<00:01:57.479> idea<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:58.110> hey<00:01:58.829> let<00:01:59.490> me<00:01:59.579> just

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
had the smart idea to hey let me just

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.560 
had the smart idea to hey let me just
put<00:01:59.969> two<00:02:00.420> um<00:02:01.310> let<00:02:02.310> me<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.490> put<00:02:02.939> two<00:02:03.270> power

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
put two um let me just put two power

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.060 
put two um let me just put two power
supplies<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:04.140> there<00:02:04.259> because<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.680> couldn't<00:02:04.920> get

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
supplies in there because I couldn't get

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.069 
supplies in there because I couldn't get
the<00:02:05.159> 24<00:02:05.610> pin<00:02:05.790> cable<00:02:05.969> off<00:02:06.210> right<00:02:06.600> there<00:02:06.840> I

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the 24 pin cable off right there I

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.050 
the 24 pin cable off right there I
couldn't<00:02:07.590> get<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.770> off<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.520> said<00:02:08.789> oh<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:08.940> just

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
couldn't get it off so I said oh I just

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.380 
couldn't get it off so I said oh I just
screw<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.899> out<00:02:10.020> put<00:02:10.229> into<00:02:10.470> power<00:02:10.649> supplies<00:02:11.039> and

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
screw it out put into power supplies and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.590 
screw it out put into power supplies and
it<00:02:12.390> works<00:02:12.629> for<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> while<00:02:13.080> and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
it works for a while and

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.510 
it works for a while and
I had<00:02:13.780> this<00:02:14.020> thing<00:02:14.320> soldered<00:02:15.280> on<00:02:15.400> the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
I had this thing soldered on the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.100 
I had this thing soldered on the
opposite<00:02:15.850> side<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.060> here<00:02:16.300> if<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.420> could<00:02:16.660> oh<00:02:16.900> I

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
opposite side of here if you could oh I

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.870 
opposite side of here if you could oh I
kind<00:02:17.350> of<00:02:17.440> bumped<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.800> carbon<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.400> mean<00:02:18.730> imagine

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
kind of bumped the carbon I mean imagine

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.930 
kind of bumped the carbon I mean imagine
like<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.330> there<00:02:19.570> I'm<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.950> there<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.340> then<00:02:21.460> the

like in there I'm in there and then the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.640 
like in there I'm in there and then the
little<00:02:22.090> power<00:02:22.360> cord<00:02:22.750> that's<00:02:22.870> where<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.230> hole

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
little power cord that's where the hole

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.160 
little power cord that's where the hole
was<00:02:23.680> cut<00:02:24.070> out<00:02:24.130> for<00:02:24.460> it<00:02:24.810> worked<00:02:25.810> out<00:02:25.930> for<00:02:26.080> a

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
was cut out for it worked out for a

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.870 
was cut out for it worked out for a
while<00:02:26.260> but<00:02:26.470> then<00:02:26.620> kindest<00:02:27.310> didn't<00:02:27.550> work<00:02:27.700> one

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
while but then kindest didn't work one

what it does it's not meant to be flashy
it's<00:02:43.180> supposed<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.660> sit<00:02:43.930> here<00:02:43.960> it's<00:02:44.200> been

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
it's supposed to sit here it's been

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.100 
it's supposed to sit here it's been
folding<00:02:44.680> for<00:02:44.860> like<00:02:45.010> two<00:02:45.190> months<00:02:45.480> non-stop<00:02:46.480> and

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
folding for like two months non-stop and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.710 
folding for like two months non-stop and
i'm<00:02:47.980> glad<00:02:48.550> like<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:49.000> hasn't<00:02:49.180> broken<00:02:49.450> down<00:02:49.690> so

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
i'm glad like it hasn't broken down so

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.210 
i'm glad like it hasn't broken down so
it's<00:02:50.050> just<00:02:50.170> been<00:02:50.320> folding<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:50.830> folding<00:02:50.890> and

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
it's just been folding and folding and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.830 
it's just been folding and folding and
folding<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.610> that's<00:02:52.120> what<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.360> will<00:02:52.420> continue

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
folding and that's what it will continue

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.690 
folding and that's what it will continue
to<00:02:52.990> do<00:02:53.110> until<00:02:53.380> i<00:02:53.440> can<00:02:53.560> add<00:02:53.740> another<00:02:54.040> eventually

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
to do until i can add another eventually

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.950 
to do until i can add another eventually
if<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.880> could<00:02:55.030> find<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.240> graphics<00:02:55.570> card<00:02:55.630> for

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
if I could find a graphics card for

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.440 
if I could find a graphics card for
cheap<00:02:56.550> I'll<00:02:57.550> just<00:02:57.790> stick<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.120> in<00:02:58.180> there<00:02:58.360> and

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
cheap I'll just stick it in there and

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.540 
cheap I'll just stick it in there and
it'll<00:02:59.260> keep<00:02:59.470> holding<00:02:59.800> that<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.130> not<00:03:00.190> now<00:03:00.400> I'll

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
it'll keep holding that and not now I'll

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.970 
it'll keep holding that and not now I'll
take<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:00.970> my<00:03:01.060> other<00:03:01.240> system<00:03:01.750> which<00:03:02.020> I<00:03:02.200> put

link to it if you guys want to see it
and<00:03:21.930> its<00:03:22.930> folding<00:03:23.410> on<00:03:23.530> in<00:03:23.680> ice<00:03:23.890> 3<00:03:24.160> 30<00:03:24.460> to<00:03:24.670> 20<00:03:25.000> cpu

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
and its folding on in ice 3 30 to 20 cpu

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.120 
and its folding on in ice 3 30 to 20 cpu
and<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.290> GT<00:03:26.620> 640<00:03:27.190> from<00:03:27.820> nvidia<00:03:28.920> this<00:03:29.920> one's

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
and a GT 640 from nvidia this one's

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.950 
and a GT 640 from nvidia this one's
really<00:03:30.250> cool<00:03:30.490> like<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:31.000> only<00:03:31.210> folds<00:03:31.600> when<00:03:31.690> idle

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
really cool like it only folds when idle

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.350 
really cool like it only folds when idle
oh<00:03:32.140> like<00:03:32.920> yeah<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:33.790> only<00:03:33.940> full<00:03:34.090> toronado

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
oh like yeah and only full toronado

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.950 
oh like yeah and only full toronado
because<00:03:34.660> people<00:03:34.930> still<00:03:35.080> use<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.440> but<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:37.390> it

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
because people still use it but it it

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.330 
because people still use it but it it
gets<00:03:38.110> like<00:03:38.320> nine<00:03:38.530> thousand<00:03:38.920> points<00:03:39.040> per<00:03:39.250> day

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
gets like nine thousand points per day

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.700 
gets like nine thousand points per day
minimum<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:39.970> i<00:03:40.510> like<00:03:40.660> that<00:03:40.870> but<00:03:41.560> then<00:03:41.680> again

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
minimum and i like that but then again

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.660 
minimum and i like that but then again
on<00:03:42.100> good<00:03:42.430> days<00:03:42.580> it'll<00:03:42.790> hit<00:03:43.020> 20,000<00:03:44.020> and<00:03:44.670> it's

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
on good days it'll hit 20,000 and it's

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.790 
on good days it'll hit 20,000 and it's
kind<00:03:46.180> of<00:03:46.240> like<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.660> varies<00:03:47.050> intensely<00:03:47.560> but

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
kind of like it varies intensely but

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.420 
kind of like it varies intensely but
it's<00:03:47.950> it's<00:03:48.520> really<00:03:48.760> nice<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:51.250> one's

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
it's it's really nice and this one's

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.240 
it's it's really nice and this one's
only<00:03:51.580> been<00:03:51.760> folding<00:03:52.090> for<00:03:52.300> about<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.480> month<00:03:52.690> and

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
only been folding for about a month and

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.070 
only been folding for about a month and
both<00:03:54.250> systems<00:03:54.700> combined<00:03:55.120> they've<00:03:55.450> well

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
both systems combined they've well

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.610 
both systems combined they've well
actually<00:03:56.770> three<00:03:57.190> systems<00:03:57.520> because<00:03:57.850> I've<00:03:58.090> been

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
actually three systems because I've been

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.370 
actually three systems because I've been
folding<00:03:59.620> on<00:03:59.950> I<00:04:00.820> used<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.870> fold<00:04:02.050> on<00:04:02.140> my<00:04:02.200> laptop

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
folding on I used to fold on my laptop

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.500 
folding on I used to fold on my laptop
and<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:02.770> one<00:04:02.860> used<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.070> get<00:04:03.220> like<00:04:03.340> 17,000<00:04:04.210> points

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
and I one used to get like 17,000 points

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.110 
and I one used to get like 17,000 points
per<00:04:04.630> day<00:04:04.750> plus<00:04:05.230> or<00:04:05.440> minus<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.770> couple<00:04:06.120> but

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
per day plus or minus a couple but

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.600 
per day plus or minus a couple but
because<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:07.930> was<00:04:08.050> like<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.230> gaming<00:04:08.590> laptop<00:04:08.710> but

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
because it was like a gaming laptop but

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.160 
because it was like a gaming laptop but
then<00:04:09.820> it<00:04:09.910> started<00:04:10.000> blue<00:04:10.300> screening<00:04:10.600> really

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
then it started blue screening really

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.800 
then it started blue screening really
bad<00:04:11.350> so<00:04:11.860> I<00:04:12.160> had<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.400> stop<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:13.000> that's<00:04:13.570> when<00:04:13.780> I

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
bad so I had to stop and that's when I

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.979 
bad so I had to stop and that's when I
started<00:04:14.170> using<00:04:14.710> these<00:04:15.390> s<00:04:16.390> one's<00:04:16.630> been<00:04:16.810> going

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
started using these s one's been going

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.390 
started using these s one's been going
for<00:04:17.109> about<00:04:17.140> a<00:04:17.260> month<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:17.650> all<00:04:17.859> of<00:04:17.980> those<00:04:18.100> three

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
for about a month and all of those three

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.950
