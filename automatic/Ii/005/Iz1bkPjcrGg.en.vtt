card<00:00:07.939> unwrapped<00:00:08.650> because<00:00:09.650> once<00:00:09.830> I<00:00:09.920> start

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
card unwrapped because once I start

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.190 
card unwrapped because once I start
assembling<00:00:10.280> the<00:00:11.150> graphics<00:00:11.540> kind<00:00:11.780> of<00:00:11.900> realize

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
assembling the graphics kind of realize

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.669 
assembling the graphics kind of realize
they'll<00:00:12.380> run<00:00:12.469> into<00:00:12.559> a<00:00:12.679> few<00:00:12.920> problems<00:00:12.980> so<00:00:13.790> um

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:14.679 
they'll run into a few problems so um

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.040 
they'll run into a few problems so um
this<00:00:15.679> is<00:00:16.010> the<00:00:16.189> best<00:00:16.609> footage<00:00:17.119> I<00:00:17.510> can<00:00:17.750> get<00:00:17.960> at

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
this is the best footage I can get at

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.470 
this is the best footage I can get at
the<00:00:18.140> moment<00:00:18.199> of<00:00:18.500> the<00:00:18.619> graphics<00:00:19.039> card<00:00:19.340> and<00:00:19.760> it

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
the moment of the graphics card and it

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.250 
the moment of the graphics card and it
sucks

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
sucks

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.320 
sucks
or<00:00:21.740> not<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:22.279> graphics<00:00:22.519> got<00:00:22.820> the<00:00:22.939> footage

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
or not the graphics got the footage

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.470 
or not the graphics got the footage
there's<00:00:23.720> um<00:00:24.460> I<00:00:25.460> think<00:00:25.789> the<00:00:25.939> cards<00:00:26.240> about

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
there's um I think the cards about

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.550 
there's um I think the cards about
eleven<00:00:26.810> inches<00:00:26.869> long<00:00:28.840> and<00:00:29.840> basically<00:00:30.410> what

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
eleven inches long and basically what

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.689 
eleven inches long and basically what
happened<00:00:30.800> was<00:00:30.830> first<00:00:31.160> of<00:00:31.250> all<00:00:31.340> when<00:00:31.429> I<00:00:31.490> tried

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
happened was first of all when I tried

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.040 
happened was first of all when I tried
to<00:00:31.820> fit<00:00:32.029> it<00:00:32.150> up<00:00:32.360> my<00:00:33.080> top<00:00:33.320> PCI<00:00:33.740> slot<00:00:35.050> straight

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
to fit it up my top PCI slot straight

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.170 
to fit it up my top PCI slot straight
away<00:00:36.200> it<00:00:36.410> just<00:00:36.620> run<00:00:36.860> right<00:00:37.190> into<00:00:37.460> those<00:00:37.610> cables

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
away it just run right into those cables

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.060 
away it just run right into those cables
and<00:00:38.330> I<00:00:38.420> can't<00:00:38.690> fly<00:00:38.930> for<00:00:39.050> me<00:00:39.320> Bend<00:00:39.530> those<00:00:39.620> cables

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
and I can't fly for me Bend those cables

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.960 
and I can't fly for me Bend those cables
far<00:00:40.220> enough<00:00:40.370> to<00:00:40.490> get<00:00:40.580> it<00:00:40.670> in

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
far enough to get it in

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.820 
far enough to get it in
I'm<00:00:41.600> sure<00:00:41.810> I'm<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:41.990> bit<00:00:42.140> too<00:00:42.260> weak<00:00:42.380> and<00:00:42.590> I<00:00:42.620> could

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
I'm sure I'm a bit too weak and I could

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.650 
I'm sure I'm a bit too weak and I could
have<00:00:42.950> burned<00:00:43.430> a<00:00:43.490> bit<00:00:43.640> of<00:00:43.700> a<00:00:43.760> rush<00:00:43.940> I've<00:00:44.270> left<00:00:44.450> it

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
have burned a bit of a rush I've left it

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.550 
have burned a bit of a rush I've left it
so<00:00:45.430> we've<00:00:46.430> put<00:00:46.670> it<00:00:46.760> into<00:00:47.030> our<00:00:47.060> second<00:00:47.600> PCI<00:00:48.170> slot

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
so we've put it into our second PCI slot

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.790 
so we've put it into our second PCI slot
and<00:00:49.330> as<00:00:50.330> you<00:00:50.450> can<00:00:50.540> see<00:00:50.600> this<00:00:51.050> is<00:00:51.200> just<00:00:51.230> a<00:00:51.440> micro

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.950 

the<00:01:15.710> system's<00:01:16.159> ready<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:16.549> go<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:16.790> I<00:01:17.150> think<00:01:17.330> now

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
the system's ready to go so I think now

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.550 
the system's ready to go so I think now
just<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.409> case<00:01:18.590> of<00:01:19.270> get<00:01:20.270> it<00:01:20.390> fired<00:01:20.689> up<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.020> see

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
just the case of get it fired up and see

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.760 
just the case of get it fired up and see
what<00:01:21.650> we<00:01:21.710> can<00:01:21.830> do<00:01:25.869> okay<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:27.080> we<00:01:27.380> have<00:01:27.590> the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
what we can do okay so we have the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.440 
what we can do okay so we have the
system<00:01:27.950> fired<00:01:28.430> up<00:01:28.549> ready<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:28.909> go

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
system fired up ready to go

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.639 
system fired up ready to go
we're<00:01:30.020> just<00:01:30.140> turns<00:01:30.380> back<00:01:30.590> power<00:01:30.890> switch<00:01:31.159> on

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
we're just turns back power switch on

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.440 
we're just turns back power switch on
which<00:01:33.649> should<00:01:34.039> if<00:01:34.430> I<00:01:34.549> just<00:01:34.729> check<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.240> oh

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
which should if I just check the oh

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.570 
which should if I just check the oh
there<00:01:35.630> we<00:01:35.690> go<00:01:35.720> I've<00:01:36.080> got<00:01:36.350> green<00:01:36.950> power<00:01:37.460> light

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
there we go I've got green power light

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.880 
there we go I've got green power light
which<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:38.030> Kalani<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.539> seen<00:01:39.110> was<00:01:39.229> good<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:39.740> I'm

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
which I Kalani I seen was good and I'm

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.190 
which I Kalani I seen was good and I'm
blocking<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.460> light<00:01:40.640> now<00:01:40.939> I<00:01:41.210> try<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.020> stand

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
blocking the light now I try to stand

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.520 
blocking the light now I try to stand
out<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.500> way<00:01:45.159> there's<00:01:46.159> these<00:01:46.399> 650<00:01:47.090> Ti<00:01:47.530> ready

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
out the way there's these 650 Ti ready

00:01:48.530 --> 00:02:02.570 
out the way there's these 650 Ti ready
to<00:01:48.649> go<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.039> simply<00:01:49.490> first<00:01:50.140> launch

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.310 

as<00:02:02.970> long<00:02:03.180> as<00:02:03.330> that<00:02:03.420> goes<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.810> anyone<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.229> think

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
as long as that goes to anyone I think

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.880 
as long as that goes to anyone I think
it's<00:02:04.710> good<00:02:04.950> there's<00:02:05.729> some<00:02:05.790> numbers<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.390> that

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
it's good there's some numbers of that

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.070 
it's good there's some numbers of that
as<00:02:07.890> fire<00:02:08.250> stricken<00:02:08.729> itself<00:02:09.090> things<00:02:09.330> got<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.690> -<00:02:09.750> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
as fire stricken itself things got a - I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.709 
as fire stricken itself things got a - I
think<00:02:10.350> that's<00:02:10.530> good
