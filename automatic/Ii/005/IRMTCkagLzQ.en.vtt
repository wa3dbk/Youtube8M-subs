00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.350
 good 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.350
 Map 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.210
 good as we are in sowing time of flowering plants 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.439
 of spring 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.439
 or we're going to show you how to make a tiny nursery 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.339
 It is important 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.180
 that the seedbed in ojuelos is very important because we always need 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:38.080
 the substrate this terrain 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.080
 rye water accumulations 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.010
 let's take a curve and fill the seedbed 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.090
 with the extension 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.870
 this peat then 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.810
 when we throw a little water 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.810
 go down a bit then you have to fill it well 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.090
 because the group will already lower itself 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.130
 time in this case we are going to plant the box as Indian carnation 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.729
 through them that a pretty stretched seed knew how luminous 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.420
 seeds between the index and seeds 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.719
 many that is usually like dust is instead it is very easy to read 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.770
 it's a matter of taking nothing 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.320
 insulting her 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.730
 little by little without roofing too much together 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.590
 if we enter from maceo together and a lot of plant is born 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.120
 then you have to do a before here of plants for what 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.850
 do not isolate aguilar means 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.850
 that stretch and stay very finite 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.490
 after 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.490
 We are planting like this 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.270
 once planted 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.890
 you have to cover the seed always with a capita 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.580
 very thin ground 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.540
 the capital has to be always 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.450
 we calculate twice the thickness of the seed 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.220
 despite the fact that very finite ground 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.190
 for what 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.210
 the seed does not suffocate us and can 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.909
 born perfectly 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.909
 we're covering it, we're covering it 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.889
 very well that's the way it is then now what we have to do is 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.889
 caking the earth a little 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.529
 the seed stays 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.529
 inside the hawks we go between land and also have a 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:32.479
 once this is done 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:34.909
 we should see water 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.469
 we take the shower 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.469
 and the formentera redoma 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.569
 as it has although two below the tray 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:49.419
 even though we water it in excess there is no danger because 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.249
 what we say would come out with the holes 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:58.099
 nevertheless aena seed always needs a lot of water until it 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.009
 ends 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.409
 until we get the first stitches we need so much water then 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.499
 it would be fine the first days equal to water them 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.229
 every day a little bit 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.519
 until it is the earth stay well for a hundred 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.069
 will supply water 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.599
 and then with just pulverized a little bit from time to time 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.639
 if it's enough, so that he does not lose 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.119
 to the humidity that it has 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:25.789
 well happened management of spraying the earth itself if after doing this 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:27.169
 we put him 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:31.929
 a matte track of these plastic ones that are transparent because they still 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:35.129
 better because we're doing a fabero miner 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.839
 then what we do is that the plant there 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.530
 do not have highs and lows of heat and humidity what is locke 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.179
 what affects you most 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:47.229
 cover it 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.269
 and put it in an area of ​​the planet 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.809
 Do not get too much sun 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.209
 I had a show tomorrow 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.639
 for three hours 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.809
 and then already 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.180
 a couple of times a day you have to tuck to remove 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.229
 excess moisture 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:04.629
 and return them autopago yes during your suitcase and 15 days until it starts to 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:05.569
 germinate 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.909
 one since it starts to germinate we can remove the lid 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.909
 and place it in a Johnson area tomorrow 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:14.799
 until 12 until one in the sun 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.599
 to control humidity 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:21.159
 and then the little plants will grow up to get about three or four 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.130
 centimeters that have 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.559
 soon between all and four leaves 

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:30.459
 that would be the ideal time to transplant the screens to a small pot 

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:31.849
 a little bit bigger 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.139
 there to keep them during 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.309
 another 15 20 days of their communes a month 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:42.459
 and I would pass them oo to the box matt heron garden where we would like good 

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:48.240
 was that in our store you have all types of seed classes from 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.349
 the plan after flower 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.289
 vegetables on all kinds of plants then have no fear 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.219
 in cojedes and doing this type of planting that is very easy March days of 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:01.219
 2009
