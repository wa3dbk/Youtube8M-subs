00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
and split it into two sections generally

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.449 
and split it into two sections generally
make<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.230> back<00:03:05.410> one<00:03:05.650> bigger<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.220> front

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
make the back one bigger and the front

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.729 
make the back one bigger and the front
one<00:03:06.580> smaller<00:03:06.989> because<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.230> back<00:03:08.380> when<00:03:08.590> you're

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
one smaller because the back when you're

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.770 
one smaller because the back when you're
pulling<00:03:08.860> hair<00:03:09.130> from<00:03:09.280> over<00:03:09.550> here<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:10.030> as<00:03:10.270> you

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
pulling hair from over here so as you

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.229 
pulling hair from over here so as you
see<00:03:10.959> like<00:03:11.140> this<00:03:11.290> hair<00:03:11.650> is<00:03:12.010> pulled<00:03:12.910> from<00:03:13.000> all

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
see like this hair is pulled from all

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.820 
see like this hair is pulled from all
the<00:03:13.330> way<00:03:13.450> over<00:03:13.660> here<00:03:13.690> so<00:03:14.410> it's<00:03:14.530> going<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.709> be

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
the way over here so it's going to be

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.670 
the way over here so it's going to be
much<00:03:15.010> shorter<00:03:15.070> than<00:03:15.820> this<00:03:16.330> hair<00:03:16.600> as<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.500> see

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
much shorter than this hair as you see

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.560 
much shorter than this hair as you see
so<00:03:18.250> if<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.400> make<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:18.670> back<00:03:18.910> section<00:03:19.180> bigger

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
so if you make the back section bigger

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.050 
so if you make the back section bigger
and<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.560> front<00:03:20.769> section<00:03:21.010> smaller<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.880> will

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
and the front section smaller it will

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.520 
and the front section smaller it will
just<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.390> workout<00:03:22.780> butter<00:03:23.019> and<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.230> makes<00:03:23.410> it

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
just a workout butter and it makes it

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.720 
just a workout butter and it makes it
look<00:03:23.620> better<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:25.570> split<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.930> into<00:03:26.080> two<00:03:26.380> and

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
look better so split it into two and

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.310 
look better so split it into two and
you're<00:03:27.730> going<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:27.910> take<00:03:28.120> one<00:03:28.480> of<00:03:29.140> your

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
you're going to take one of your

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.830 
you're going to take one of your
sections<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:30.010> twist<00:03:30.940> it<00:03:31.150> any<00:03:31.390> way<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:31.720> want

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
sections and twist it any way you want

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.539 
sections and twist it any way you want
you<00:03:32.110> can<00:03:32.260> twist<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.590> this<00:03:32.769> way<00:03:32.950> or<00:03:33.220> twist<00:03:33.430> it

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
you can twist it this way or twist it

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.220 
here before I came out cuz I knew these
were<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.550> ones<00:05:46.700> that<00:05:46.790> always<00:05:47.120> fall<00:05:47.510> out<00:05:47.720> but

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
were the ones that always fall out but

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.020 
were the ones that always fall out but
just<00:05:48.380> kind<00:05:48.620> of<00:05:48.680> pull<00:05:48.890> some<00:05:49.160> random<00:05:49.700> pieces

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
just kind of pull some random pieces

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.810 
just kind of pull some random pieces
make<00:05:50.510> it<00:05:50.660> look<00:05:50.810> really<00:05:51.020> loose<00:05:51.580> kind<00:05:52.580> of<00:05:52.640> like

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
make it look really loose kind of like

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
make it look really loose kind of like
shake<00:05:53.390> your<00:05:53.600> head<00:05:54.520> move<00:05:55.520> around<00:05:55.850> and<00:05:56.300> then

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
shake your head move around and then

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.780 
shake your head move around and then
hopefully<00:05:57.230> some<00:05:57.650> pieces<00:05:57.830> won't<00:05:58.100> fall<00:05:58.400> out<00:05:58.430> and

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
hopefully some pieces won't fall out and

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.970 
hopefully some pieces won't fall out and
it<00:05:58.880> will<00:05:58.970> give<00:05:59.120> you<00:05:59.240> a<00:05:59.420> really<00:05:59.750> loose<00:05:59.930> look<00:06:00.230> um
