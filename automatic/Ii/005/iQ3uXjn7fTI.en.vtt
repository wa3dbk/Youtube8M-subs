00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:24.100

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:40.420
 consists of dubai in saint-cloud france 2 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.390
 xavier norman so I work at the 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.250
 crystal factory without him for 29 years 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.440
 now and we are producing 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.399
 daily paperweight 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.870
 1 each year offered a new 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.230
 collection celebrate this butterfly 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.449
 what is israel so there is the watch 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.570
 Hermes who came to contact us for 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.940
 do different tests for for 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.400
 create missing and frames the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.649
 world and it's been two years since we 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.540
 worked on these on his projects on this 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.810
 project there in the end we managed 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.210
 to do 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.810
 what the dials when we see 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.090
 currently 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.490
 what is the technique of millet flour 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.110
 start so that's done so the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.420
 missouri itself is a 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.880
 assembly of the wand 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.080
 chopsticks are crystal and his work 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.159
 is at home in the manufactory have 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.539
 do all our chopsticks or even 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.250
 with his chopsticks there we made a 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.140
 assembly they were cut off 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.429
 sectioned to a certain height and one 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.770
 worked them we assemble them and we 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.600
 worked them to have an object 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.800
 compact to be able to sign it for 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.509
 able to do frames then have 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.220
 for the big difficulty it's really 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.450
 to evacuate to evacuate the air that enters the 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.159
 different baguette that's really the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.050
 big constraint that we had was 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.539
 actually saw the whole development 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.190
 we realized we saw the pieces 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.720
 signed but we did not see the result 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.789
 final whose plane to pictures in fact and 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.110
 it's coming here really on the bottom 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.280
 the salons we discover the feet 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.420
 it's me, I think 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.340
 those really great pieces 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.629
 it's really beautiful pieces 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.119
 would also have the crystal worth 

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:09.319
 it's not bad we have a know- how we have 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.640
 our collections in the collector 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.050
 but it's still good to be able to 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.220
 Open this palette to other 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.230
 people who understand and they 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.849
 see and who also discovers and who have 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.830
 want to go see it's important for 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.950
 we to continue this profession the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.950
 rise
