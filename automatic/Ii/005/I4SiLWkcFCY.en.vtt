juice<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:06.180> start<00:00:06.450> with<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:07.200> easiest<00:00:07.799> thing<00:00:08.099> to

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
juice to start with the easiest thing to

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.299 
juice to start with the easiest thing to
do<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.820> if<00:00:09.150> you've<00:00:09.330> got<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.570> juicer<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.889> use<00:00:11.070> if

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
do is if you've got a juicer to use if

00:00:11.309 --> 00:01:04.250 
do is if you've got a juicer to use if
you<00:00:11.429> can<00:00:58.039> hold<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.910> clamp<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.080> you

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
you can hold a clamp on it so that you

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.700 
you can hold a clamp on it so that you
can<00:01:04.530> cut<00:01:04.799> off<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.010> flow<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.760> water<00:01:06.560> if<00:01:07.560> you

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
can cut off the flow of the water if you

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.070 
can cut off the flow of the water if you
can<00:01:07.770> afford<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.430> stainless<00:01:08.939> steel<00:01:08.970> one<00:01:09.479> get<00:01:09.930> it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
can afford a stainless steel one get it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.590 
can afford a stainless steel one get it
if<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.530> find<00:01:10.830> an<00:01:11.040> old<00:01:12.200> old<00:01:13.250> juicer<00:01:14.250> with

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
if you can find an old old juicer with

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.980 
if you can find an old old juicer with
ceramic<00:01:15.770> Hayti<00:01:17.450> there's<00:01:18.450> long<00:01:18.630> as<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.869> not

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
ceramic Hayti there's long as it's not

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660 
ceramic Hayti there's long as it's not
peeling<00:01:19.290> go<00:01:19.530> ahead<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.890> use<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.460> is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
peeling go ahead and use that this is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.910 
peeling go ahead and use that this is
not<00:01:20.880> good<00:01:21.150> because<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.689> looks<00:01:21.720> too<00:01:22.140> much<00:01:22.350> steam

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
not good because it looks too much steam

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.719 
not good because it looks too much steam
escape<00:01:23.900> but<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.590> what<00:01:25.830> I've<00:01:25.950> got<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.490> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
escape but it's what I've got and it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:42.850 
escape but it's what I've got and it
works

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.630 

and<00:01:43.860> look<00:01:44.100> inside<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.940> collectors<00:01:45.600> got<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
and look inside the collectors got a

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.380 
and look inside the collectors got a
funnel<00:01:47.660> coming<00:01:48.660> up<00:01:48.810> when<00:01:49.800> a<00:01:49.830> student<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:51.150> rise

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
funnel coming up when a student can rise

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.610 
funnel coming up when a student can rise
into<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.840> basket

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
into the basket

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.090 
into the basket
perhaps<00:01:53.490> another<00:01:53.880> thing<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.690> look<00:01:54.840> for<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:56.040> a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
perhaps another thing to look for is a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.030 
perhaps another thing to look for is a
funnel<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:56.910> bigger<00:01:57.300> holes<00:01:57.660> in<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.740> more

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
funnel with bigger holes in it so more

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:08.770 
funnel with bigger holes in it so more
steam<00:01:59.520> can<00:01:59.820> come<00:02:00.000> into<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.420> basket<00:02:07.310> juice

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
steam can come into the basket juice

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.810 
steam can come into the basket juice
grape<00:02:09.780> juice<00:02:10.670> juice<00:02:12.410> today<00:02:13.410> we're<00:02:13.590> doing

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
see there's plenty of chokecherries

00:04:51.580 --> 00:05:28.260 
see there's plenty of chokecherries
