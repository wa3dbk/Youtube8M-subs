00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.560
 fight de alexander teacher 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.020
 Contra Jam School of Driving Physics 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.580
 movement with us yesterday and trackers 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.170
 and we will look at it 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.990
 exercise as a permutation in order 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.160
 to be able to safely and quickly correctly 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.689
 get away from the obstacle which is suddenly 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.670
 appeared in front of the car 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.290
 it can be both human and fast 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.290
 stop the car passed 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.610
 Now we will consider 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.700
 the so-called moose test or 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.710
 permutation 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.170
 that 's what it's all about this 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.570
 training to move away from 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.970
 unexpected order we have such 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.820
 figure 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.010
 to which now 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.250
 I 'll tell you about the minute 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.079
 in short for a start we accelerate 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.330
 the first gate we do the first 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.540
 braking release the brake turn 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.150
 set the car left or 100 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.860
 question from the one that we went again 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.910
 do braking for dropping all the same 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.860
 more speed 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.810
 let go of the brakes turn again 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.180
 our lane back crawled away 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.580
 full zero is restored yes it is they 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.890
 imitation if in front of us sharply 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.670
 the car stopped and we need it 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.460
 go round 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.229
 because if we leave the business 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.149
 imitation as if we were real 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.670
 lane and we need to go back to ours 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.500
 same lane if you just need to the right 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.229
 return to your considered it just 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.570
 training is now in practice 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.470
 Accelerate begins exercise version 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.470
 what meters garden 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:50.290
 brake 0 straighten the car brake 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.130
 turned and stop completely repeat 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.550
 exercise 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.330
 so again 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.330
 divorce 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.479
 come back 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.479
 stop 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.080
 Today we have studied such an exercise as 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.610
 rearrangement in the country will be easier for us 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.410
 away from obstacles which is suddenly 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.540
 arises in front of the car whether 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.120
 animal man or just a car 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.990
 yourself was alexander chevrolet tracker and 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.990
