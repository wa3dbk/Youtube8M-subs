00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.730
 Today we travel with the malibu ship 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.109
 chevrolet badge 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.109
 if you want to come with me 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:34.210
 today we test today's car dotcom 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.210
 chevrolet malibú the biggest saloon 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.840
 with nothing less than 4 85 meters and 1700 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.860
 kilos 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.680
 even if it's called malibu, this brain does not 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.730
 it's a version is 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.730
 of the North American market 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.020
 but it's a global car that sells 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.440
 in europe with the opel platform 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.440
 insignia 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.630
 in this case we tested the turbo diesel 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.549
 two liters of 160 horses and box 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.549
 6-speed manual changes 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:27.190
 nice touch was guided tours 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.730
 and short shifter 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.730
 little size 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.070
 all right 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:43.890
 you have per minute and a maximum torque of 350 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.369
 thousand ton meter between 1,750 and 2,500 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.369
 turns 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:56.560
 this mechanics together with a weight of nothing 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:00.429
 less than almost 1700 kilos allow a 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.100
 attached speed of 213 kilometers 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:07.940
 hour and an acceleration from 0 to 100 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.930
 kilometers per hour of 9.8 seconds 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.620
 with similar weight and tires 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:20.660
 oversized 245 try 18 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:24.830
 the consumption soars a little 6.6 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.580
 in urban travel 42 in travel 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:33.040
 extra urban 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:37.700
 and 5.5 the mixed route 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:41.890
 does not drop 55 55 liters making a 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.980
 normal driving lower that figure 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.700
 it has been quite enough for me 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.700
 complicated 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.640
 the direction is smooth and very precise 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.860
 which allows to approach the curves with 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.860
 certain guarantees as long as we 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.940
 move within reasonable limits 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.819
 since it is a car 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.209
 like but do not devour alive 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.639
 also the suspensions are soft 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.129
 they isolate it perfectly from 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:21.069
 irregularities of the land always and 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:23.889
 when they are not too incisive 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.790
 in a curve the car will be dragged by 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:28.010
 the 1700 kilometers 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.980
 what makes inertias are 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.230
 quite pronounced along with a 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.810
 soft cushioning do that in 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:40.400
 certain turns the rolling of the 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:43.020
 body is remarkable a full support is 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.440
 slightly your shooter 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.230
 tends to leave front and the axis 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.190
 back does not accompany much at the time of 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.190
 make the turn 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.840
 has a brake team very 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.840
 good ones 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:07.400
 that allow you to stop easily and 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.400
 security to this plus all 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.150
 in short this chevrolet malibú is 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.060
 a large saloon very well 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.139
 equipped at a reasonable price for the 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.139
 equipment that carries 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.620
 the cousin brother of the young success 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:34.680
 the only thing is that it costs something less and its 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.680
 Mood is more bourgeois and less sporty
