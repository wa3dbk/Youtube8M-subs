00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450 

I<00:00:00.149> try<00:00:00.630> to<00:00:00.690> stay<00:00:00.930> away<00:00:00.960> from<00:00:01.380> using<00:00:01.560> real<00:00:02.100> books

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
I try to stay away from using real books

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.889 
I try to stay away from using real books
in<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.909> beginning<00:00:03.240> when<00:00:03.419> I'm<00:00:03.510> teaching<00:00:03.689> a

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
in the beginning when I'm teaching a

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.690 
in the beginning when I'm teaching a
child<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:04.230> read<00:00:04.440> because<00:00:04.890> they<00:00:05.370> will<00:00:05.549> have<00:00:05.670> a

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
child to read because they will have a

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.220 
child to read because they will have a
lot<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:06.089> words<00:00:06.359> that<00:00:06.600> they<00:00:06.839> haven't<00:00:07.140> learned

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
lot of words that they haven't learned

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.110 
lot of words that they haven't learned
the<00:00:07.440> rules<00:00:07.620> for<00:00:08.010> yet<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.550> can<00:00:08.820> become

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
the rules for yet and that can become

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.509 
the rules for yet and that can become
confusing<00:00:09.599> we<00:00:10.230> want<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.500> go<00:00:10.590> slowly<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.250> step

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
confusing we want to go slowly and step

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.220 
confusing we want to go slowly and step
by<00:00:11.670> step<00:00:12.030> so<00:00:12.389> therefore<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:12.990> becomes

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
by step so therefore it becomes

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.169 
by step so therefore it becomes
necessary<00:00:13.530> at<00:00:13.980> some<00:00:14.160> point<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.580> generate<00:00:15.000> your

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
necessary at some point to generate your

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.529 
necessary at some point to generate your
own<00:00:15.240> handmade<00:00:15.990> books<00:00:16.470> now<00:00:17.310> if<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:18.060> don't<00:00:18.420> want

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
them very quickly and you can slowly

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.840 
them very quickly and you can slowly
develop<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.560> library<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:32.250> them<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.550> keep<00:00:32.669> them
