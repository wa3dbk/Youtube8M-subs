00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
much the reflex sight is what i'm using

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.590 
much the reflex sight is what i'm using
right<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.280> which<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.700> really<00:01:15.060> good<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.509> really

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
right now which is really good it really

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.060 
right now which is really good it really
gives<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.049> some<00:01:16.200> good<00:01:16.380> precision<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
gives you some good precision with the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.429 
gives you some good precision with the
weapon<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.700> iron<00:01:18.240> sights<00:01:18.570> aren't<00:01:19.049> great

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
weapon as the iron sights aren't great

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.420 
weapon as the iron sights aren't great
and<00:01:20.990> it's<00:01:21.990> very<00:01:22.259> definitely<00:01:22.710> very<00:01:22.950> easy<00:01:23.159> to

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
and it's very definitely very easy to

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.130 
and it's very definitely very easy to
handle<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.060> know<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> recoil<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> guns

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
handle you know the recoil on the guns

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.160 
handle you know the recoil on the guns
not<00:01:25.290> all<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.740> high<00:01:26.000> that<00:01:27.000> reflex<00:01:27.869> sight<00:01:28.049> is

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
not all that high that reflex sight is

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.469 
not all that high that reflex sight is
definitely<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.250> i<00:01:29.280> said<00:01:29.549> probably<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.240> best

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
definitely like i said probably the best

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.630 
definitely like i said probably the best
catch<00:01:30.810> them<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> go<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> other

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
catch them to go with but on the other

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.969 
catch them to go with but on the other
attachments<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.570> silencer<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.380> also<00:01:34.680> good<00:01:34.950> i

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
attachments the silencer is also good i

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.560 
attachments the silencer is also good i
mean<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.700> these<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.180> iron<00:01:36.360> sights

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
mean you do have these the iron sights

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.210 
mean you do have these the iron sights
they<00:01:36.780> are<00:01:36.900> usable<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:37.979> much<00:01:38.189> easier

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
they are usable but it's much easier

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.580 
they are usable but it's much easier
going<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:38.939> an<00:01:39.030> optic<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:40.229> with<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
going with an optic but with the

keeping off the radar the recoil is

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.950 
keeping off the radar the recoil is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
going to get loaded a little bit but so

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.639 
going to get loaded a little bit but so
is<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> damage<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.590> range<00:01:46.850> which<00:01:47.960> can<00:01:48.960> kind

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
is the damage and range which can kind

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.219 
is the damage and range which can kind
of<00:01:49.850> alter<00:01:50.850> your<00:01:50.939> performance<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
but talking about a laser pointer now

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.470 
but talking about a laser pointer now
when<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.069> first<00:02:14.280> start<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.609> game<00:02:14.790> one<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.239> the

when you first start the game one of the

default classes the close quarters class

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.649 
default classes the close quarters class
is<00:02:18.239> going<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.569> be<00:02:18.689> stavi<00:02:19.230> one<00:02:19.890> with<00:02:20.129> a<00:02:20.659> laser

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
is going to be stavi one with a laser

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.599 
is going to be stavi one with a laser
pointer<00:02:21.930> on<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.560> it's<00:02:22.950> actually<00:02:23.069> possibly

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
pointer on it and it's actually possibly

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.240 
pointer on it and it's actually possibly
one<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> best<00:02:24.560> standard<00:02:25.560> classes<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.069> go

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
one of the best standard classes to go

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.789 
one of the best standard classes to go
with<00:02:26.489> because<00:02:26.939> you<00:02:27.569> get<00:02:27.689> a<00:02:27.750> very<00:02:27.959> good<00:02:28.079> gap

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
with because you get a very good gap

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.309 
with because you get a very good gap
itself<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.430> get<00:02:29.579> high<00:02:29.760> cap<00:02:30.000> magazine<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:31.230> you

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
itself you get high cap magazine and you

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.259 
itself you get high cap magazine and you
get<00:02:31.469> heavy<00:02:31.680> hit<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.189> snapshot<00:02:32.790> which<00:02:32.969> is<00:02:33.060> very

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
get heavy hit and snapshot which is very

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.390 
get heavy hit and snapshot which is very
good<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:34.409> gameplay<00:02:34.680> i<00:02:34.920> was<00:02:35.189> using

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
good and in this gameplay i was using

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.580 
good and in this gameplay i was using
exactly<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.150> was<00:02:36.329> using<00:02:36.569> high<00:02:37.139> cap<00:02:37.379> magazine

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
exactly that was using high cap magazine

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.099 
exactly that was using high cap magazine
heavy<00:02:38.069> hitter<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.519> snapshot<00:02:39.030> i<00:02:39.269> was<00:02:39.750> using<00:02:39.930> a

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
heavy hitter and snapshot i was using a

heavy hitter and snapshot i was using a
reflect<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:42.060> laser<00:02:42.299> point<00:02:42.689> is<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> pretty<00:02:43.079> good

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
reflect the laser point is a pretty good

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.750 
reflect the laser point is a pretty good
attachment<00:02:43.500> obviously<00:02:44.129> like<00:02:44.310> most<00:02:44.579> of

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
attachment obviously like most of

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.550 
attachment obviously like most of
submachine<00:02:45.209> guns<00:02:45.419> laser<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:45.989> very<00:02:46.349> very

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
submachine guns laser is a very very

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.619 
submachine guns laser is a very very
good<00:02:46.739> attachment<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.340> go<00:02:47.459> with<00:02:47.669> as<00:02:47.939> you're

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
good attachment to go with as you're

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.179 
good attachment to go with as you're
going<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.780> be<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.900> lot<00:02:49.319> more<00:02:49.349> accurate<00:02:49.889> with<00:02:50.010> hip

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
going to be a lot more accurate with hip

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.009 
going to be a lot more accurate with hip
firing<00:02:50.489> even<00:02:51.030> though<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.239> style<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.750> when

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
firing even though the style you a when

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.319 
firing even though the style you a when
it's<00:02:52.169> not<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.409> best<00:02:52.709> for<00:02:52.980> hip<00:02:53.099> firing<00:02:53.430> as<00:02:53.730> the

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
it's not the best for hip firing as the

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.599 
it's not the best for hip firing as the
rate<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.870> fire<00:02:55.139> is<00:02:55.169> very<00:02:55.590> slow<00:02:55.889> but<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.189> damage

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
rate of fire is very slow but the damage

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.770 
rate of fire is very slow but the damage
is<00:02:56.760> high<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:58.219> laser<00:02:59.219> pointer<00:02:59.849> again<00:03:00.389> coupled

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
is high so laser pointer again coupled

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.599 
is high so laser pointer again coupled
with<00:03:00.840> snapshot<00:03:01.379> on<00:03:01.530> most<00:03:01.799> guns<00:03:02.069> is<00:03:02.310> going<00:03:02.549> to

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
with snapshot on most guns is going to

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.699 
with snapshot on most guns is going to
be<00:03:02.730> good<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:03.450> on<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:03.989> gun<00:03:04.230> like<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.469> style

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
be good but on a gun like the style

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.699 
be good but on a gun like the style
whether<00:03:05.359> it's<00:03:06.359> not<00:03:06.540> going<00:03:06.659> to<00:03:06.719> make<00:03:06.840> all<00:03:07.079> that

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
whether it's not going to make all that

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.759 
whether it's not going to make all that
much<00:03:08.040> difference<00:03:09.349> there's<00:03:10.349> better<00:03:10.709> things

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
much difference there's better things

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.890 
much difference there's better things
you<00:03:11.219> can<00:03:11.400> go<00:03:11.549> within<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.969> ACOG<00:03:12.389> scope<00:03:12.419> the

suit more for a long-range situation and
it<00:03:23.639> does<00:03:23.790> very<00:03:24.030> well<00:03:24.239> when<00:03:24.449> you<00:03:24.540> put<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.810> a

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
it does very well when you put the a

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.149 
it does very well when you put the a
club<00:03:25.139> in<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.409> for<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.709> kind<00:03:25.919> of<00:03:25.949> situation

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
club in it for that kind of situation

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.170 
club in it for that kind of situation
but<00:03:27.709> again<00:03:28.709> it's<00:03:28.919> more<00:03:29.159> versatile<00:03:29.849> when

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
but again it's more versatile when

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.849 
but again it's more versatile when
you're<00:03:30.359> using<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:30.720> reflex<00:03:31.260> sight<00:03:31.560> there's

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
you're using the reflex sight there's

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.409 
you're using the reflex sight there's
not<00:03:32.010> really<00:03:32.250> much<00:03:32.459> more<00:03:32.729> I<00:03:32.790> can<00:03:32.909> say<00:03:32.970> about<00:03:33.209> the

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
not really much more I can say about the

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.420 
not really much more I can say about the
ACOG<00:03:33.750> but<00:03:33.989> definitely<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.680> attachment<00:03:35.280> I

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
ACOG but definitely the attachment I

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.990 
ACOG but definitely the attachment I
would<00:03:35.609> recommend<00:03:35.909> is<00:03:36.439> the<00:03:37.459> reflex<00:03:38.459> sight<00:03:38.669> and

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
would recommend is the reflex sight and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.819 
would recommend is the reflex sight and
it's<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:39.509> gadget<00:03:39.900> setups<00:03:40.319> you're<00:03:40.590> going<00:03:40.739> to

it's the gadget setups you're going to
be<00:03:40.919> wanting<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:42.139> preferably<00:03:43.139> I<00:03:43.470> always<00:03:43.859> like

recommends and the second perk there's a
few<00:04:16.199> different<00:04:16.289> things<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.739> can<00:04:16.829> go<00:04:16.979> with

lightfoot<00:04:17.639> is<00:04:17.849> so<00:04:18.359> pretty<00:04:18.870> good<00:04:18.959> if<00:04:19.200> you<00:04:19.320> want

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
lightfoot is so pretty good if you want

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.430 
lightfoot is so pretty good if you want
to<00:04:19.620> like<00:04:20.010> rush<00:04:20.370> around<00:04:20.579> but

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
to like rush around but

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.460 
to like rush around but
we<00:04:21.530> recommend<00:04:22.040> rushing<00:04:22.610> with<00:04:22.910> this<00:04:23.090> gun

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
we recommend rushing with this gun

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.540 
we recommend rushing with this gun
obviously<00:04:24.470> because<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.770> rate<00:04:25.040> of<00:04:25.070> fire<00:04:25.400> if

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
obviously because the rate of fire if

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.860 
obviously because the rate of fire if
you<00:04:25.670> want<00:04:25.820> to<00:04:25.910> rush<00:04:26.120> you're<00:04:26.330> better<00:04:26.510> off<00:04:26.600> using

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
you want to rush you're better off using

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.150 
you want to rush you're better off using
something<00:04:27.500> with<00:04:27.710> a<00:04:27.740> fast<00:04:28.070> rate<00:04:28.370> of<00:04:28.490> fire<00:04:28.790> then

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
something with a fast rate of fire then

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.740 
something with a fast rate of fire then
but<00:04:31.160> i'd<00:04:31.280> recommend<00:04:31.760> heavy<00:04:31.940> hitter<00:04:32.240> speed

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
but i'd recommend heavy hitter speed

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.630 
but i'd recommend heavy hitter speed
loader<00:04:33.020> could<00:04:33.410> be<00:04:33.590> good<00:04:33.800> but<00:04:34.130> this<00:04:34.430> gun

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
loader could be good but this gun

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.310 
loader could be good but this gun
already<00:04:34.820> has<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.150> bar<00:04:35.450> three<00:04:35.720> loads<00:04:35.900> as<00:04:36.080> it<00:04:36.170> is

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
already has a bar three loads as it is

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.800 
already has a bar three loads as it is
so<00:04:37.160> heavy<00:04:38.030> hitters<00:04:38.360> what<00:04:38.540> I'd<00:04:38.630> be

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
so heavy hitters what I'd be

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.860 
so heavy hitters what I'd be
recommending<00:04:39.440> for<00:04:39.650> this<00:04:40.660> from<00:04:41.660> for<00:04:41.780> your
