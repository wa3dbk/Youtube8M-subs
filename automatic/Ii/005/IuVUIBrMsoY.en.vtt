00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.229
 today we have more questions than usual 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:07.899
 so let's start with antonio that 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:09.550
 says hello could I upload a video 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.440
 explaining ways to cool the water of 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.060
 an aquarium that now with the arrival of 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.380
 summer many of us will need those 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.360
 tips thanks 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.820
 There is a lot of trick to cool the water 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.590
 but that I know the two ways more 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.460
 effective are putting a lid with 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.859
 fans 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.109
 which says that you say about 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.970
 good grades and it's usually done 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.879
 manually though you have to be a 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.070
 little handyman and know how to do or also 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.860
 Another way to cool your aquarium is 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.820
 put a fan in front of the aquarium what 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.380
 that can lower you some degree than others 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.300
 I do not have any of these two 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.040
 options at the moment so I limit myself to 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.440
 keep the light off at the time of 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.899
 more heat 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.579
 and as my fish do not jump I keep the 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.399
 lid open while I'm near the 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.829
 aquarium and watched him watch out for this 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.610
 because the fish are very hard and they jump 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.610
 outside the aquarium 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.379
 and it would not be the first time that some fish 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.060
 die for this so be careful 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.979
 Pablo question 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.590
 Hello, how would I like to make a 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.920
 Question I already have my aquarium three moles 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.799
 and five fry and a runner too 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.119
 I plan to put two or three nuns 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.030
 but I would like to put a fish something 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.220
 different pimp 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.280
 a cyclic that was sociable if 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.159
 existed or one that is a knife fish 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.350
 or an elephant fish 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.520
 so it will be more different tell me which one 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.719
 It would be better if you knew 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.020
 totally discouraged these fish that 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.869
 you tell me 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.729
 however I can recommend the grammy 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.649
 dwarf that is a fish easy to take care of and 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.110
 It is also quite compatible with 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.619
 most of the fish and they are also very 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.990
 showy I have wanted to get some 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.429
 I also long aquarium with a 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.159
 couple of this type and the fish that 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.530
 have already I think you would have your aquarium to 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:05.600
 complete if any more runner and 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.509
 think that yours is too lonely 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.759
 job the child tells me sorry what plants 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.590
 have in the aquarium very nice the 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.709
 estate 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.410
 yes, the plant I have is a nubia 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.660
 barter and variety bacteria went to 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.379
 when I saw angustifolia haul or can and 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.150
 cladophora aig agro row and as soil 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.720
 say they are very resistant plants and 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.720
 easy to care 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.140
 well, thank you very much everyone for having 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.390
 commented so much this time and see you 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.490
 morning 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.490
 I'm dying of heat
