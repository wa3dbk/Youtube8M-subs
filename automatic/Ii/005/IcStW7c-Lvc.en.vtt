00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.149
 said 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.910
 so then I always take a 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.059
 mustard glass for that to be my 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.470
 measuring glass so here it's a glass of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.079
 orange lenses and I just pour in 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:56.040
 the saucepan not suddenly I come to 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:01:01.890
 these three glasses of hot water and I 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.629
 come on my fire which clear you 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.470
 let it boil until your 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.470
 group lenses 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.620
 so here I am going to come check the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.120
 lenses if they are soft so here is 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.450
 for me they are very soft I will come 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:30.350
 extinguish the fire and there I will come 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.480
 add a last of bulgur as 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.690
 this is always the glass to 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.690
 mustard 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:55.670
 so here's a real but I mix the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:57.890
 everything I close the cover and there I go 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.040
 leave 30 minutes why 30 minutes 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.000
 so that bulgur can swell and 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.740
 let it be cold for me just now 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.390
 one so there I listened to an onion in 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.690
 little dice I'm going to do 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.190
 come back on sunflower oil or 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.850
 otherwise you can use dundo the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.850
 like you want 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.840
 so here I just add a spoon to 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.850
 tomato paste soup and a 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.530
 tablespoon chili concentrate 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.700
 of water you can even use 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:36.300
 hot pepper if you want it's still 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.550
 better but I'm not for 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.090
 to learn me from simandou so we mix 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.090
 crazy 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.620
 so here I add a little water 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.450
 afraid to do a little bit of money 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:15.090
 I was a little and I leave it there 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:18.880
 I left almost 40 minutes 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.819
 So that's what you 're doing this hand for 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.970
 the moment either with the spatula you 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:31.500
 come mix story not to them 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.500
 yield blocks of borgo lenses 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.570
 so you've seen we're seeing more 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.480
 lentils in this derby can well cooked 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:50.430
 so this attention taste before 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.200
 remove from the heat your lenses 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.940
 so here I just added my preparation 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:01.200
 of tomato sauce chilies and onions 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.200

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.920

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.920
 so here I am going to come the father added 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.480
 it is that I cut finely and the 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:26.410

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.410
 here we add the whole thing 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.800
 and we mix it all with your 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.780
 hand you will come crush your 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.520
 preparation 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.520
 English story the juice of the onion 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:53.330
 as if I had the strength 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.330
 we manage to create a cutter 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.580
 So here we are going to go to the 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.330

 it is still in it at crossroads 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.680
 so I find that aesthetically 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.990
 that's it better then I put a 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.270
 small bowl with water to them 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.090

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.130
 I do not have enough water for my 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.360
 preparation 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.700
 so I'm going to show you how 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:36.740
 do the land keufs ​​it's all simple 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:40.960
 you will need only one 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:43.580

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.430
 of preparation and you will come 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.980

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.610
 even the traces of your fingers so that's it 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:02.060
 means it's good and I come from 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:05.660
 ask on my little salad go you want 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.300
 a little water here is more 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:12.070
 easy to take 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:15.470
 preparation do not need to do 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:22.120
 we're going to do a little bit 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:25.830
 finely sees the little little bit of water 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.830
 a little bit of preparation 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:08.309
 so here is the result so I prefer 

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:09.900
 of tray so the decoration you 

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:10.860

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.979
 me differently 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.759
 so here I added pieces of 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:17.309
 lemon 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:18.749
 so I know we eat with lemon 

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:20.460
 also so you have to ask yourself 

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:24.059
