quarter well I found out something I
found<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.989> by<00:00:46.410> placing<00:00:46.950> objects<00:00:47.700> into

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
found it by placing objects into

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.090 
found it by placing objects into
balloons<00:00:48.690> some<00:00:49.410> pretty<00:00:49.649> bizarre<00:00:49.890> stuff

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
balloons some pretty bizarre stuff

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.150 
balloons some pretty bizarre stuff
begins<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.210> happen<00:00:51.390> now<00:00:52.110> what<00:00:52.440> sort<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.860> object

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
begins to happen now what sort of object

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.770 
begins to happen now what sort of object
so<00:00:53.520> we're<00:00:53.640> gonna<00:00:53.730> place<00:00:54.059> into<00:00:54.360> these<00:00:54.480> balloons

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
so we're gonna place into these balloons

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.319 
so we're gonna place into these balloons
well<00:00:55.020> let's<00:00:55.440> start<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> simplest<00:00:57.030> of

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
well let's start with the simplest of

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.670 
well let's start with the simplest of
objects<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:57.840> let's<00:00:57.989> start<00:00:58.050> with<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.379> penny

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
objects here let's start with a penny

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.799 
objects here let's start with a penny
and<00:00:59.250> we're<00:00:59.370> gonna<00:00:59.489> place<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.820> down<00:01:00.239> into<00:01:00.600> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
and we're gonna place that down into a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.090 
and we're gonna place that down into a
balloon<00:01:01.430> now<00:01:02.430> we're<00:01:02.610> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.350> then<00:01:04.350> blow<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
balloon now we're going to then blow the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.560 
balloon now we're going to then blow the
balloon<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.580> once<00:01:05.910> the<00:01:06.060> pennies<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
balloon up once the pennies in the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.300 
balloon up once the pennies in the
balloon<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.350> get<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.800> penny<00:01:08.009> in<00:01:08.160> there

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
balloon if I can get the penny in there

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.760 
balloon if I can get the penny in there
we're<00:01:08.700> gonna<00:01:08.789> blow<00:01:09.149> it<00:01:09.180> up<00:01:15.080> be<00:01:16.080> very<00:01:16.289> careful

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
we're gonna blow it up be very careful

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.949 
we're gonna blow it up be very careful
not<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> let<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.640> air<00:01:17.910> go<00:01:18.270> rushing<00:01:18.630> back<00:01:18.899> into

00:01:18.949 --> 00:01:18.959 
not to let the air go rushing back into

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:20.719 
not to let the air go rushing back into
your<00:01:19.259> lungs<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.679> shoot<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.069> penny<00:01:20.280> into<00:01:20.580> your

your lungs and shoot the penny into your
long<00:01:20.910> exactly<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.950> don't<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.250> that

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:23.459 
long exactly so don't do that

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
the penny key just bounce around in

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.029 
the penny key just bounce around in
there<00:01:29.580> but<00:01:30.289> there's<00:01:31.289> gonna<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.619> able<00:01:31.709> to<00:01:31.830> put

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
there but there's gonna be able to put

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.589 
there but there's gonna be able to put
up<00:01:32.069> a<00:01:32.190> force<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:32.970> at<00:01:33.060> work<00:01:33.270> called

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:33.599 
up a force here at work called

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:36.380 
up a force here at work called
centripetal<00:01:34.259> force<00:01:35.190> that's<00:01:35.940> going<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.209> cause

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
centripetal force that's going to cause

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.210 
centripetal force that's going to cause
the<00:01:36.569> penny<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.990> want<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> stay<00:01:37.410> in<00:01:37.530> motion<00:01:37.800> once

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the penny to want to stay in motion once

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.150 
the penny to want to stay in motion once
we<00:01:38.369> get<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.640> spinning<00:01:39.450> inside<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:40.140> balloon<00:01:40.380> so

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
we get it spinning inside the balloon so

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.839 
we get it spinning inside the balloon so
let's<00:01:41.880> get<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.149> penny<00:01:43.039> spinning<00:01:44.039> in<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.839 --> 00:01:44.849 
let's get the penny spinning in the

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:49.670 
let's get the penny spinning in the
balloon<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:46.050> you<00:01:46.110> hear<00:01:46.319> it

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.850 

and<00:01:50.680> it<00:01:50.799> just<00:01:50.979> keeps<00:01:51.220> wanting<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.640> spin<00:01:52.119> and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
and it just keeps wanting to spin and

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.679 
and it just keeps wanting to spin and
spin<00:01:53.860> and<00:01:53.890> spin<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.880> still<00:01:58.149> spinning<00:01:58.360> by<00:01:58.630> the

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
spin and spin it's still spinning by the

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.440 
spin and spin it's still spinning by the
way<00:01:58.869> all<00:01:59.049> on<00:01:59.229> its<00:01:59.409> own<00:01:59.789> and<00:02:00.789> you'll<00:02:00.909> be<00:02:01.030> amazed

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
way all on its own and you'll be amazed

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.440 
way all on its own and you'll be amazed
at<00:02:01.750> how<00:02:01.810> long<00:02:02.170> that<00:02:02.409> penny<00:02:02.789> will<00:02:03.789> continue<00:02:04.329> to

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
at how long that penny will continue to

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.109 
at how long that penny will continue to
spin<00:02:04.920> inside<00:02:05.920> of<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.189> balloon<00:02:06.280> only<00:02:06.939> being

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
spin inside of the balloon only being

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.059 
spin inside of the balloon only being
slowed<00:02:07.390> down<00:02:07.420> by<00:02:07.780> gravity<00:02:08.019> and<00:02:08.349> friction<00:02:08.679> as

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
slowed down by gravity and friction as

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.330 
slowed down by gravity and friction as
gravity<00:02:09.459> pulls<00:02:09.489> it<00:02:09.819> down<00:02:09.880> though<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.950> tends<00:02:12.250> to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
gravity pulls it down though it tends to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.000 
gravity pulls it down though it tends to
get<00:02:12.519> into<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> much<00:02:13.030> tighter<00:02:13.840> tighter<00:02:14.260> circle<00:02:14.709> a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
get into a much tighter tighter circle a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.160 
get into a much tighter tighter circle a
smaller<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.610> smaller<00:02:16.019> diameter<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.930> it'll

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
smaller and smaller diameter so it'll

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.699 
smaller and smaller diameter so it'll
spin<00:02:20.410> for<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.950> very<00:02:21.280> long<00:02:21.580> time<00:02:22.410> it's<00:02:23.410> still

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
spin for a very long time it's still

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.949 
spin for a very long time it's still
spinning<00:02:23.980> working<00:02:24.940> its<00:02:25.060> way<00:02:25.209> down<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:25.480> inside

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
spinning working its way down the inside

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.590 
spinning working its way down the inside
of<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.200> balloon<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:27.790> is<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:27.970> very<00:02:28.209> unique

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
of the balloon this is a very unique

ever do I should say once you get it
around<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.420> ball<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.870> back<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.170> the<00:04:44.230> balloon

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
around the ball the back of the balloon

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.610 
around the ball the back of the balloon
and<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:46.120> start<00:04:46.420> to<00:04:46.570> blow<00:04:46.900> into<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.350> balloon

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
and you start to blow into the balloon

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.130 
and you start to blow into the balloon
the<00:04:48.220> ball<00:04:48.460> will<00:04:48.670> go<00:04:49.300> down<00:04:49.480> into<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:49.930> balloon

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
the ball will go down into the balloon

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.530 
the ball will go down into the balloon
pretty<00:04:50.410> easily<00:04:50.590> there<00:04:51.550> I'll<00:04:52.510> blow<00:04:52.780> that<00:04:52.810> up

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
pretty easily there I'll blow that up

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.480 
pretty easily there I'll blow that up
now<00:04:55.540> this<00:04:55.660> one's<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:56.380> little<00:04:56.950> spin<00:04:57.160> of<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.340> we're

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
now this one's a little spin of it we're

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.370 
now this one's a little spin of it we're
not<00:04:57.550> going<00:04:57.700> to<00:04:57.790> just<00:04:57.910> spin<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.390> to<00:04:58.870> make<00:04:59.020> sound

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
not going to just spin it to make sound

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.050 
not going to just spin it to make sound
and<00:04:59.530> so<00:04:59.740> more<00:05:00.010> than<00:05:00.160> that<00:05:00.310> to<00:05:00.460> watch<00:05:00.640> it<00:05:00.820> spin

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
and so more than that to watch it spin

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.700 
and so more than that to watch it spin
for<00:05:01.270> a<00:05:01.330> very<00:05:01.480> long<00:05:01.660> time<00:05:01.690> due<00:05:02.380> to<00:05:02.500> some

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
for a very long time due to some

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.670 
for a very long time due to some
strapping<00:05:03.100> old<00:05:03.220> horse<00:05:03.490> and<00:05:04.170> basically<00:05:05.170> it's

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
strapping old horse and basically it's

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.290 
strapping old horse and basically it's
working<00:05:06.010> on<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.220> law<00:05:06.370> that<00:05:06.580> a<00:05:06.610> body<00:05:06.880> in<00:05:07.120> motion

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
working on the law that a body in motion

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.390 
working on the law that a body in motion
wants<00:05:07.720> to<00:05:07.840> stay<00:05:08.170> in<00:05:08.230> stay<00:05:08.740> in<00:05:08.770> motion<00:05:09.040> till

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
wants to stay in stay in motion till

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.430 
wants to stay in stay in motion till
it's<00:05:09.520> acted<00:05:09.820> on<00:05:09.940> by<00:05:10.090> an<00:05:10.120> outside<00:05:10.240> force<00:05:10.540> well

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
it's acted on by an outside force well

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.050 
it's acted on by an outside force well
when<00:05:11.560> that<00:05:11.680> Penny's<00:05:12.100> in<00:05:12.220> that<00:05:12.370> smooth<00:05:12.640> service

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
when that Penny's in that smooth service

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.670 
when that Penny's in that smooth service
the<00:05:13.180> inside<00:05:13.450> of<00:05:13.510> that<00:05:13.540> balloon<00:05:13.780> and<00:05:14.050> gravity

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
the inside of that balloon and gravity

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.410 
the inside of that balloon and gravity
is<00:05:14.740> pulling<00:05:14.950> down<00:05:15.100> in<00:05:15.520> that<00:05:15.670> dish<00:05:15.940> shape<00:05:16.180> it

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
is pulling down in that dish shape it

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:28.350 
is pulling down in that dish shape it
just<00:05:16.600> wants<00:05:16.810> to<00:05:16.870> keep<00:05:17.080> rotating

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.280 

but<00:05:29.360> I<00:05:29.419> thought<00:05:29.600> this<00:05:29.750> was<00:05:29.930> one<00:05:30.110> of<00:05:30.199> the

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
but I thought this was one of the

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.249 
but I thought this was one of the
coolest<00:05:30.710> of<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:31.520> three<00:05:32.030> I<00:05:32.360> couldn't<00:05:33.139> believe

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
coolest of the three I couldn't believe

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:34.870 
coolest of the three I couldn't believe
how<00:05:33.470> cool<00:05:33.740> this<00:05:33.860> was<00:05:34.070> when<00:05:34.250> I<00:05:34.280> actually<00:05:34.490> played

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
how cool this was when I actually played

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.570 
how cool this was when I actually played
around<00:05:35.199> so<00:05:36.199> we<00:05:36.740> know<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:36.979> super<00:05:37.280> ball<00:05:37.460> will

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
around so we know the super ball will

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.040 
around so we know the super ball will
bounce<00:05:37.759> and<00:05:38.060> a<00:05:38.150> balloon<00:05:38.360> wants<00:05:38.660> to<00:05:38.750> go<00:05:38.870> up<00:05:38.960> in

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
bounce and a balloon wants to go up in

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.830 
bounce and a balloon wants to go up in
the<00:05:39.139> air<00:05:39.229> balloons<00:05:39.759> so<00:05:40.759> now<00:05:40.940> a<00:05:40.970> super<00:05:41.630> ball

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
the air balloons so now a super ball

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.050 
the air balloons so now a super ball
here's<00:05:42.800> a<00:05:42.919> balloon<00:05:43.070> some<00:05:43.580> very<00:05:43.850> bizarre

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
here's a balloon some very bizarre

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.640 
here's a balloon some very bizarre
unique<00:05:45.310> look<00:05:46.310> at<00:05:46.400> that<00:05:46.490> movement<00:05:47.350> the<00:05:48.350> balloon

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
unique look at that movement the balloon

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.749 
unique look at that movement the balloon
almost<00:05:49.070> becomes<00:05:49.490> alive<00:05:50.150> it's<00:05:51.490> very<00:05:52.490> weird

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
almost becomes alive it's very weird

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.290 
almost becomes alive it's very weird
with<00:05:53.750> dropping<00:05:53.990> from<00:05:54.229> up<00:05:54.380> here<00:05:54.560> to<00:05:54.710> clean<00:05:54.919> it

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
with dropping from up here to clean it

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.820 
with dropping from up here to clean it
so<00:05:56.300> once<00:05:56.509> it<00:05:56.630> bounces<00:05:57.110> it<00:05:57.229> starts<00:05:57.500> hitting<00:05:57.620> the

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
so once it bounces it starts hitting the

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.029 
so once it bounces it starts hitting the
inside<00:05:58.479> the<00:05:59.479> balloon<00:05:59.750> you're<00:06:00.650> doing<00:06:00.860> some

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
inside the balloon you're doing some

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.439 
inside the balloon you're doing some
weird<00:06:01.190> things<00:06:01.430> and<00:06:01.490> of<00:06:01.639> course<00:06:01.850> it'll<00:06:02.120> spin

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
weird things and of course it'll spin

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.180 
weird things and of course it'll spin
the<00:06:02.630> balloon<00:06:02.750> just<00:06:03.050> as<00:06:03.229> well<00:06:03.410> as<00:06:03.560> them<00:06:03.740> as<00:06:03.979> the

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
the balloon just as well as them as the

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.450 
the balloon just as well as them as the
UH<00:06:04.220> the<00:06:05.000> coins<00:06:05.330> did<00:06:08.800> you<00:06:09.800> don't<00:06:10.039> want<00:06:10.190> to<00:06:10.280> spin

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
UH the coins did you don't want to spin

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.159 
UH the coins did you don't want to spin
for<00:06:10.669> very<00:06:10.880> long<00:06:11.060> time<00:06:11.300> as<00:06:11.419> well<00:06:11.449> but<00:06:11.750> I<00:06:11.840> really

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
for very long time as well but I really

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.050 
for very long time as well but I really
enjoyed<00:06:12.500> it<00:06:12.620> if<00:06:12.979> you<00:06:13.039> toss<00:06:13.400> this<00:06:13.639> like<00:06:13.850> to<00:06:14.000> a

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
enjoyed it if you toss this like to a

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.340 
enjoyed it if you toss this like to a
friend<00:06:14.330> or<00:06:14.419> something<00:06:14.660> get<00:06:14.750> it<00:06:14.840> spinning<00:06:15.080> and

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
friend or something get it spinning and

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.980 
friend or something get it spinning and
Temasek<00:06:15.560> oh<00:06:15.860> yeah<00:06:16.210> it<00:06:17.210> does<00:06:17.389> seem<00:06:17.630> really

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
Temasek oh yeah it does seem really

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.900 
Temasek oh yeah it does seem really
strange<00:06:18.530> stuff<00:06:18.919> I<00:06:19.220> don't<00:06:19.520> know<00:06:19.580> if<00:06:19.639> you<00:06:19.729> saw

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
strange stuff I don't know if you saw

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:25.480 
strange stuff I don't know if you saw
that<00:06:19.940> around<00:06:20.300> let's<00:06:20.479> try<00:06:22.930> watch<00:06:23.930> this<00:06:24.490> it's

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
that around let's try watch this it's

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:33.000 
that around let's try watch this it's
spinning<00:06:27.550> just<00:06:28.550> act<00:06:28.880> so<00:06:29.330> strange

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.469 

Wow<00:06:34.039> it<00:06:34.370> has<00:06:34.490> a<00:06:34.520> mind<00:06:34.849> of<00:06:35.030> its<00:06:35.120> own<00:06:35.330> so<00:06:37.330> you<00:06:38.330> can

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 
Wow it has a mind of its own so you can

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:40.689 
Wow it has a mind of its own so you can
place<00:06:38.750> objects<00:06:39.320> into<00:06:39.560> balloons<00:06:39.860> and<00:06:40.220> try<00:06:40.550> them

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:40.699 
place objects into balloons and try them

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.719 
place objects into balloons and try them
out<00:06:40.849> I<00:06:41.830> also<00:06:42.830> heard<00:06:43.070> somewhere<00:06:43.400> that<00:06:43.550> if<00:06:43.639> you

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729 
out I also heard somewhere that if you

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:45.640 
out I also heard somewhere that if you
put<00:06:43.880> a<00:06:43.909> hex<00:06:44.180> nut<00:06:44.330> in<00:06:44.659> it<00:06:45.110> makes<00:06:45.349> even<00:06:45.470> a

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
put a hex nut in it makes even a

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.010 
put a hex nut in it makes even a
stranger<00:06:45.949> sound<00:06:46.400> but<00:06:47.240> I<00:06:47.270> couldn't<00:06:47.570> find<00:06:47.780> one

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
stranger sound but I couldn't find one

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.670 
stranger sound but I couldn't find one
so<00:06:48.349> I<00:06:48.699> didn't<00:06:49.699> put<00:06:49.849> one<00:06:50.000> in<00:06:50.120> the<00:06:50.180> balloons

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
so I didn't put one in the balloons
