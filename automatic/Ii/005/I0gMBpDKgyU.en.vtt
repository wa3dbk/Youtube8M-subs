00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
something very very interesting this

something very very interesting this

whole interface the new touchflo 3d 2.5
doesn't<00:00:51.719> work<00:00:51.989> well<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> stylus<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.129> works

doesn't work well with a stylus it works

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.850 
doesn't work well with a stylus it works
very<00:00:53.550> well<00:00:53.850> with<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.390> fingertip<00:00:54.840> which<00:00:55.530> makes

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
very well with a fingertip which makes

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.369 
very well with a fingertip which makes
us<00:00:56.100> possibly<00:00:56.489> think<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.420> HTC<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
us possibly think that HTC is a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.959 
us possibly think that HTC is a
capacitive<00:00:58.980> device<00:00:59.250> coming<00:00:59.609> down<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> line

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
capacitive device coming down the line

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.389 
capacitive device coming down the line
especially<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.079> fire<00:01:01.320> stone<00:01:01.710> which<00:01:02.160> looks

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
especially the fire stone which looks

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.759 
especially the fire stone which looks
very<00:01:02.609> very<00:01:02.699> similar<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> HTC<00:01:03.750> touch<00:01:04.049> HD<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
very very similar to the HTC touch HD it

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.340 
very very similar to the HTC touch HD it
has<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> lot<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> same<00:01:06.390> specifications

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
has a lot of the same specifications

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.750 
has a lot of the same specifications
although<00:01:07.979> we're<00:01:08.159> thinking<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.610> there's

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
although we're thinking that there's

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.550 
although we're thinking that there's
gonna<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:08.939> one<00:01:09.180> big<00:01:09.479> differentiating<00:01:10.200> factor

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
gonna be one big differentiating factor

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
gonna be one big differentiating factor
it<00:01:10.770> could<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> has<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> capacitive

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
it could be that it has a capacitive

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.210 
it could be that it has a capacitive
touchscreen<00:01:13.200> we're<00:01:13.650> hearing<00:01:13.920> conflicting

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
touchscreen we're hearing conflicting

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.640 
touchscreen we're hearing conflicting
reports<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:15.030> whether<00:01:15.270> windows<00:01:15.930> mobile<00:01:16.110> 6.5

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
reports on whether windows mobile 6.5

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.890 
reports on whether windows mobile 6.5
will<00:01:17.040> support<00:01:17.430> capacitive<00:01:18.060> screens<00:01:18.420> right

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
will support capacitive screens right

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.940 
will support capacitive screens right
now<00:01:19.049> we're<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.380> say<00:01:19.560> right<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
now we're going to say right in the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.859 
now we're going to say right in the
middle<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.369> may<00:01:20.580> or<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.820> may<00:01:21.030> not<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.689> there's

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
middle it may or it may not but there's

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.020 
middle it may or it may not but there's
a<00:01:21.960> good<00:01:22.170> chance<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.890> may<00:01:23.009> especially<00:01:23.580> now

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
a good chance that it may especially now

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.300 
a good chance that it may especially now
that<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.600> manila<00:01:25.170> 2.5<00:01:25.380> does<00:01:26.070> really

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that we see that manila 2.5 does really

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.270 
that we see that manila 2.5 does really
well<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:27.210> finger<00:01:27.720> navigation<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.189> you're

go back and we can go to program and

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.389 
go back and we can go to program and
this<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.049> very<00:01:58.170> buggy<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.680> may<00:01:58.799> freeze<00:01:59.159> during

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
this is very buggy it may freeze during

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.859 
this is very buggy it may freeze during
this<00:01:59.549> demonstration<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.450> add<00:02:00.630> any

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
this demonstration and we can add any

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.530 
this demonstration and we can add any
program<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:02.100> an<00:02:02.310> item<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.180> main<00:02:03.360> screen

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
program to be an item on the main screen

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.730 
program to be an item on the main screen

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
and so we have bubble breaker and

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.020 
and so we have bubble breaker and
activesync<00:02:05.219> we<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.520> have<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> picture<00:02:06.000> of

deeper implementation of touchflo 3d

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.960 
deeper implementation of touchflo 3d
through<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.010> new<00:02:41.130> appointment<00:02:41.610> it's<00:02:41.700> very

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
very beautiful and it really hides

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.770 
very beautiful and it really hides
windows<00:02:43.860> mobile<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.340> lot<00:02:44.910> so<00:02:45.150> let's<00:02:45.330> go<00:02:45.540> back

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
windows mobile a lot so let's go back

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.390 
windows mobile a lot so let's go back
over<00:02:45.810> here<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.380> next<00:02:47.010> we're<00:02:47.100> going<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.250> go<00:02:47.370> to

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
over here and next we're going to go to

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.850 
over here and next we're going to go to
people<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.060> people<00:02:48.420> we<00:02:48.720> no<00:02:48.960> longer<00:02:48.990> can<00:02:49.470> flip

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
people and people we no longer can flip

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.950 
people and people we no longer can flip
through<00:02:50.130> pictures<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.880> people<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.330> think<00:02:51.750> HTC

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
through pictures of people I think HTC

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.720 
through pictures of people I think HTC
found<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.710> this<00:02:52.800> was<00:02:52.980> very<00:02:53.280> much<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.670> a

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
found that this was very much of a

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.640 
found that this was very much of a
novelty<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.690> makes<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.960> lot<00:02:55.110> more<00:02:55.140> sense<00:02:55.500> to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
novelty and it makes a lot more sense to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.920 
novelty and it makes a lot more sense to
have<00:02:55.800> just<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.190> grid<00:02:56.520> of<00:02:56.550> people<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.210> grid<00:02:57.900> of

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
have just a grid of people a grid of

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.420 
have just a grid of people a grid of
pictures<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.680> can<00:02:58.710> click<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.340> you

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
pictures that you can click on and you

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.670 
pictures that you can click on and you
can<00:02:59.550> dial<00:02:59.790> people<00:03:00.210> directly<00:03:00.870> from<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.320> screen

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
can dial people directly from the screen

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.080 
can dial people directly from the screen
so<00:03:02.130> that<00:03:02.160> makes<00:03:02.460> a<00:03:02.550> lot<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.700> sense<00:03:02.790> and

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
so that makes a lot of sense and

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.270 
so that makes a lot of sense and
furthermore<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:03.720> very<00:03:03.960> finger<00:03:04.350> friendly<00:03:04.530> so

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
furthermore it's very finger friendly so

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.590 
furthermore it's very finger friendly so
you<00:03:05.370> don't<00:03:05.520> have<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.730> take<00:03:05.850> out<00:03:06.000> your<00:03:06.120> stylus

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
you don't have to take out your stylus

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.170 
you don't have to take out your stylus
and<00:03:06.630> try<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.960> get<00:03:07.140> something<00:03:07.350> more<00:03:07.620> precise

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
and try to get something more precise

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.090 
and try to get something more precise
messages<00:03:09.180> I've<00:03:09.330> nothing<00:03:09.540> there<00:03:09.870> email<00:03:10.770> looks

about the same if we go over to pictures

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.630 
about the same if we go over to pictures
it's<00:03:46.470> about<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.800> same<00:03:47.010> we've<00:03:47.370> seen<00:03:47.550> this

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
before we flip throw pictures we can

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.110 
before we flip throw pictures we can
link<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.560> our<00:03:49.590> camera<00:03:49.980> or<00:03:50.490> to<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.820> video

camera if we go over to music this is

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.130 
camera if we go over to music this is
also<00:03:53.700> going<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.210> be<00:03:54.330> very<00:03:55.320> similar<00:03:55.680> weather

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
also going to be very similar weather

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.170 
also going to be very similar weather
again<00:03:58.140> very<00:03:58.380> similar<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.950> it<00:03:59.700> says<00:03:59.940> there's

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
again very similar and it says there's

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.850 
again very similar and it says there's
an<00:04:00.300> error<00:04:00.360> trying<00:04:00.990> to<00:04:01.320> connect<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.650> data

an error trying to connect the data

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.110 
an error trying to connect the data
which<00:04:02.010> makes<00:04:02.220> sense<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.550> now<00:04:02.940> we<00:04:03.000> have

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
which makes sense and now we have

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.240 
which makes sense and now we have
footprints<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:03.930> footprints<00:04:04.410> was<00:04:04.530> first

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
footprints and footprints was first

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.550 
footprints and footprints was first
introduced<00:04:05.760> on<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:05.970> HTC<00:04:06.450> touch<00:04:06.750> cruise<00:04:07.110> the

introduced on the HTC touch cruise the
new<00:04:07.740> touch<00:04:07.950> cruise<00:04:08.310> basically<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.180> assigns

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
new touch cruise basically it assigns

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.270 
new touch cruise basically it assigns
geo-coordinates<00:04:10.230> two<00:04:10.710> pictures<00:04:10.920> that<00:04:11.190> you

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
geo-coordinates two pictures that you

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.040 
geo-coordinates two pictures that you
take<00:04:11.460> so<00:04:11.910> if<00:04:12.030> you<00:04:12.120> take<00:04:12.270> a<00:04:12.330> picture<00:04:12.600> of<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:12.870> nice

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
take so if you take a picture of a nice

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.390 
take so if you take a picture of a nice
Italian<00:04:13.470> restaurant<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.070> found<00:04:14.250> in<00:04:14.340> the

Italian restaurant that you found in the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.750 
Italian restaurant that you found in the
city<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:15.210> can<00:04:15.560> assign<00:04:16.560> a<00:04:16.830> place<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.549> on<00:04:17.670> the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
city you can assign a place to it on the

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.610 
city you can assign a place to it on the
map<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.180> can<00:04:18.270> get<00:04:18.420> back<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.020> it<00:04:19.350> looks

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
map so you can get back to it it looks

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.260 
map so you can get back to it it looks
like<00:04:19.680> footprints<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.400> coming<00:04:20.730> to<00:04:20.850> all<00:04:21.060> future

like footprints is coming to all future
HTC<00:04:21.930> devices<00:04:22.169> which<00:04:22.680> makes<00:04:22.980> a<00:04:23.130> lot<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.310> sense

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
HTC devices which makes a lot of sense

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.159 
HTC devices which makes a lot of sense
all<00:04:23.790> devices<00:04:24.180> have<00:04:24.480> have<00:04:24.810> that<00:04:24.990> capability

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
all devices have have that capability

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.280 
all devices have have that capability
and<00:04:25.770> then

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
and then

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.900 
and then
get<00:04:26.470> into<00:04:26.680> settings<00:04:27.070> where<00:04:27.220> we<00:04:27.310> see<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.520> lot

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
get into settings where we see a lot

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.940 
get into settings where we see a lot
