00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.120 

I<00:00:15.020> shot<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.139> video<00:00:16.320> testing<00:00:16.890> out<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> new

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
I shot this video testing out a new

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.010 
I shot this video testing out a new
camera<00:00:17.820> rig<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.210> built<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.660> wasn't

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
camera rig that I built it wasn't

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.019 
camera rig that I built it wasn't
finished<00:00:19.500> yet<00:00:19.880> it<00:00:20.880> was<00:00:21.060> similar<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:22.130> I<00:00:23.130> might

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
finished yet it was similar to I might

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.480 
finished yet it was similar to I might
think<00:00:24.269> I'm<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> 15th<00:00:25.439> iteration<00:00:26.039> as<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> dad

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
think I'm on the 15th iteration as a dad

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.550 
think I'm on the 15th iteration as a dad
that<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.760> own<00:00:27.029> or<00:00:27.269> Mele<00:00:27.510> use<00:00:28.279> it<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:30.060> GoPro

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
that I own or Mele use it for the GoPro

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.200 
that I own or Mele use it for the GoPro
and<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:32.009> don't<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> weights<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:32.969> yet

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and I don't have the weights on it yet

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
and I don't have the weights on it yet
so<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.660> has<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> weird<00:00:34.140> wobble<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.399> y'all<00:00:36.230> so

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
so it has a weird wobble and y'all so

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.440 
so it has a weird wobble and y'all so
once<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.770> put<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> weights<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.730> end<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
once I put the weights on the end of the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:53.930 
once I put the weights on the end of the
T<00:00:50.960> so<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> bunch<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.530> guys<00:00:52.680> there<00:00:53.280> along

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
T so we have a bunch of guys there along

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.990 
T so we have a bunch of guys there along
the<00:00:53.969> tape<00:00:54.270> line<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.870> follows<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> creek<00:00:56.000> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the tape line that follows the creek and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240 
the tape line that follows the creek and
this<00:00:57.239> game<00:00:57.480> guy<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> rocket<00:00:58.949> launcher

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
this game guy with the rocket launcher

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.410 
this game guy with the rocket launcher
so<00:01:00.260> I<00:01:01.280> think<00:01:02.280> there's<00:01:02.520> three<00:01:02.699> cabins<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.239> are

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
so I think there's three cabins that are

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.670 
so I think there's three cabins that are
marked<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.719> yellow<00:01:03.809> tape<00:01:09.320> there's<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.409> lot<00:01:10.560> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
marked with yellow tape there's a lot of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.590 
marked with yellow tape there's a lot of
times<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> table<00:01:11.460> people<00:01:11.820> try<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.330> call

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
times at the table people try to call

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.600 
times at the table people try to call
other<00:01:12.960> players<00:01:13.470> now<00:01:14.600> this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:16.280> really<00:01:17.280> poor

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
other players now this is really poor

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.760 
other players now this is really poor
sportsmanship<00:01:18.240> you're<00:01:19.229> basically<00:01:19.560> calling

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
sportsmanship you're basically calling

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.050 
sportsmanship you're basically calling
someone<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> liar<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:22.159> most<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.369> time<00:01:23.610> when

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
someone a liar and most of the time when

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.539 
someone a liar and most of the time when
you<00:01:24.180> think<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.630> you've<00:01:24.780> hit<00:01:24.960> somebody

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
you think that you've hit somebody

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.640 
you think that you've hit somebody
you're<00:01:26.549> not<00:01:26.700> actually<00:01:26.850> hitting<00:01:27.270> them<00:01:27.650> I'm

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
you're not actually hitting them I'm

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.460 
you're not actually hitting them I'm
always<00:01:29.130> amazed<00:01:29.579> when<00:01:29.759> I'm<00:01:29.939> roughing<00:01:30.470> standing

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
always amazed when I'm roughing standing

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.350 
always amazed when I'm roughing standing
in<00:01:31.560> front<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.829> somebody<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.280> from<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.210> angle

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
in front of somebody that from one angle

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.020 
in front of somebody that from one angle
surely<00:01:34.290> looks<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.619> he's<00:01:34.740> getting<00:01:34.890> hit<00:01:35.280> but

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
surely looks like he's getting hit but

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.170 
surely looks like he's getting hit but
then<00:01:36.180> when<00:01:36.360> I'm<00:01:36.450> right<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.170> watching

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
looks like from one angles they're being

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.460 
looks like from one angles they're being
hit<00:03:37.420> but<00:03:38.420> I'm<00:03:38.540> standing<00:03:38.810> right<00:03:38.990> there<00:03:39.170> and

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
hit but I'm standing right there and

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.310 
hit but I'm standing right there and
listening<00:03:39.860> intently<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.810> even<00:03:41.960> stepped

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
listening intently and I even stepped

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.750 
listening intently and I even stepped
the<00:03:42.440> footage<00:03:42.740> through<00:03:42.980> to<00:03:43.100> make<00:03:43.280> sure<00:03:43.310> that<00:03:43.730> I

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
the footage through to make sure that I

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.720 
the footage through to make sure that I
was<00:03:43.910> correct<00:03:44.240> but<00:03:44.420> he<00:03:44.750> had<00:03:44.870> never<00:03:45.140> been<00:03:45.470> hit<00:03:45.770> it

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
was correct but he had never been hit it

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.940 
was correct but he had never been hit it
was<00:03:46.910> all<00:03:47.240> just<00:03:47.630> hitting<00:03:47.960> the<00:03:48.170> idea<00:03:48.380> up<00:03:48.560> strong

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
was all just hitting the idea up strong

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.250 
was all just hitting the idea up strong
right<00:03:49.160> in<00:03:49.250> front<00:03:49.460> of<00:03:49.550> him<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:50.300> I'm<00:03:50.450> sure<00:03:50.780> from

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
right in front of him and I'm sure from

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.150 
right in front of him and I'm sure from
the<00:03:51.410> shooters<00:03:51.770> angle<00:03:52.160> there<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:54.920> just

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
the shooters angle there and it just

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.550 
the shooters angle there and it just
simply<00:03:55.370> wasn't<00:03:55.940> so<00:03:56.810> that's<00:03:56.960> one<00:03:57.140> reason<00:03:57.350> you

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
simply wasn't so that's one reason you

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:23.680 
simply wasn't so that's one reason you
don't<00:03:57.680> want<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.070> you<00:03:58.460> know<00:03:58.490> call<00:03:59.150> your<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:23.060> don't

just really bad gameplay any fires six
rounds<00:04:44.140> I'm<00:04:45.140> not<00:04:45.350> sure<00:04:45.590> if<00:04:45.860> he<00:04:45.980> even<00:04:46.070> thought

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
rounds I'm not sure if he even thought

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.960 
rounds I'm not sure if he even thought
that<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:48.830> person<00:04:49.190> wasn't<00:04:49.460> calling<00:04:49.850> their

that the person wasn't calling their
hits<00:04:50.150> he<00:04:50.570> may<00:04:50.780> have<00:04:50.870> just<00:04:50.930> been<00:04:51.260> doing<00:04:51.380> that

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
hits he may have just been doing that

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.190 
hits he may have just been doing that
out<00:04:52.370> of<00:04:52.490> habit<00:04:52.700> because<00:04:53.000> so<00:04:53.360> many<00:04:53.480> people<00:04:53.630> say

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
out of habit because so many people say

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.190 
out of habit because so many people say
that<00:04:54.530> and<00:04:55.040> it's<00:04:55.760> becoming<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.270> norm<00:04:56.450> but

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
that and it's becoming the norm but

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.510 
that and it's becoming the norm but
that's<00:04:57.440> something<00:04:57.770> that<00:04:57.890> really<00:04:58.100> needs<00:04:58.250> to

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
that's something that really needs to

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.790 
that's something that really needs to
stop<00:04:58.850> not<00:04:59.720> just<00:05:00.020> in<00:05:00.140> a<00:05:00.200> Bing<00:05:00.380> field<00:05:00.590> but
