00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.981
 Welcome to the first episode of my photography section 

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:11.678
 Today I want to give only a few tips 

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.894
 to those who have decided to buy a digital reflex camera, 

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:16.150
 to know 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.989
 what to pay attention to at the time of purchase. 

00:00:19.628 --> 00:00:21.499
 First, you have to be careful 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.146
 not just buy the camera case 

00:00:24.698 --> 00:00:26.349
 because with a digital reflex camera, 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.724
 consisting solely of a housing, 

00:00:27.724 --> 00:00:29.383
 it is not possible to take pictures - 

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:31.523
 you must have at least one lens. 

00:00:32.304 --> 00:00:35.084
 The standard kit ... the standard kits that are in place 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.548
 when purchasing the first digital reflex camera 

00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:41.283
 usually consist of one housing 

00:00:41.283 --> 00:00:44.020
 and an 18-55mm lens. 

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:47.076
 I advise you to buy 

00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:48.382
 possible 

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.759
 one lens 17-85mm. 

00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:53.562
 What does this millimeter mean? 

00:00:53.676 --> 00:00:54.521
 It means, for example, 

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.863
 taking into account 17-85mm, 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.710
 that the distance between the lenses, 

00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:01.948
 that is, the focal length 

00:01:01.948 --> 00:01:06.436
 is a minimum of 17mm and a maximum of 85mm. 

00:01:06.436 --> 00:01:09.066
 This means, for example, 

00:01:09.505 --> 00:01:10.850
 looking out of the window - 

00:01:10.996 --> 00:01:14.667
 with 17mm we will take a picture, 

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:16.810
 which will include almost the whole landscape, 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.589
 it can be said that it is seen as a human eye, 

00:01:19.883 --> 00:01:24.170
 to continue and zoom out, 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.029
 we pass 50mm - 

00:01:26.057 --> 00:01:28.087
 this is the focal length, 

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:30.229
 which is usually used for portraits, 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.736
 until we reach 85mm - 

00:01:32.736 --> 00:01:34.763
 this is already an appropriate increase 

00:01:34.763 --> 00:01:37.933
 and we can have fun with him to isolate objects, 

00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:41.647
 a 18-55mm, which is usually found 

00:01:41.647 --> 00:01:44.006
 in sets for beginners, 

00:01:44.668 --> 00:01:47.670
 is a lens with more limited capabilities. 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.674
 You have just begun to have fun with the zuma 

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:53.385
 and it starts to feel 

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:55.528
 the approach of the object, 

00:01:55.528 --> 00:02:00.449
 and the limit of the camera ... on the lens is reached 

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:02.539
 decision in this case 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.482
 is not so drastic, 

00:02:05.482 --> 00:02:08.247
 as long as we approach the object if possible 

00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:11.774
 What should be considered for the camera body, 

00:02:11.774 --> 00:02:14.689
 is the size of the screen, 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.477
 because especially at the beginning 

00:02:16.477 --> 00:02:18.739
 can not be predicted well 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.663
 what will be the result of the photo, 

00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:23.834
 but a larger screen 

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:27.276
 helps to evaluate right now, right away, 

00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:30.063
 if the picture has become as we wish it to 

00:02:30.063 --> 00:02:30.781
 or not. 

00:02:31.455 --> 00:02:32.995
 The other thing to consider, 

00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:35.425
 is mainly related to the price. 

00:02:35.425 --> 00:02:38.502
 If our budget is limited, 

00:02:38.502 --> 00:02:39.615
 we can choose 

00:02:39.615 --> 00:02:41.520
 to sacrifice the ability to shoot a video. 

00:02:42.675 --> 00:02:45.409
 For example, this is a Canon EOS 450D 

00:02:45.756 --> 00:02:47.176
 and can not make video, 

00:02:47.244 --> 00:02:49.575
 while the next model 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.853
 500D can also make video in HD. 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.256
 In my case, I sacrificed the opportunity to make video, 

00:02:57.832 --> 00:03:00.870
 to buy a nicer lens 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.866
 17-85mm, 

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:04.516
 which gives you greater opportunities to play 

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:07.217
 especially at the beginning 

00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:08.196
 with the photos. 

00:03:09.365 --> 00:03:11.266
 Another thing to keep in mind is 

00:03:11.481 --> 00:03:13.618
 SD card - 

00:03:13.816 --> 00:03:15.429
 care should be taken, 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.966
 if SD cards are purchased 

00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:20.892
 of 8, 16 or 32 GB, 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.532
 to control whether 

00:03:22.532 --> 00:03:26.447
 the camera can use SDHC cards. 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.552
 My advice is to find a camera that can use them 

00:03:29.552 --> 00:03:32.507
 and buy the largest SD card possible, 

00:03:32.507 --> 00:03:35.303
 so you can go out and shoot for a whole day 

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.646
 calm and take pictures all the time 

00:03:37.646 --> 00:03:39.342
 without worrying, 

00:03:39.342 --> 00:03:41.156
 that the card will be filled. 

00:03:41.157 --> 00:03:43.877
 For today, 

00:03:43.877 --> 00:03:46.630
 I do not want to start with many tips 

00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:51.194
 and the next time I will focus on the core functions 

00:03:51.194 --> 00:03:51.979
 of the digital camera. 

00:03:52.384 --> 00:03:54.779
 The next episode, therefore, will not be 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.797
 interesting only for those who are starting to shoot 

00:03:57.797 --> 00:03:58.902
 with a digital camera with reflex technology, 

00:03:59.113 --> 00:04:01.055
 but it will be interesting for everyone, 

00:04:01.055 --> 00:04:05.199
 who want to shoot with a digital camera. 

00:04:06.057 --> 00:04:06.943
 That is all, 

00:04:06.943 --> 00:04:08.351
 I'll see you next time. 

00:04:09.763 --> 00:04:12.182
