00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
um this is a small enclosure so I'm

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.459 
um this is a small enclosure so I'm
trying<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:57.000> zoo<00:00:57.239> Med<00:00:57.510> under<00:00:57.960> tank<00:00:58.199> heater

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
trying just a zoo Med under tank heater

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.180 
trying just a zoo Med under tank heater
that<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.399> an<00:01:00.059> old<00:01:00.359> one<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.980> has<00:01:01.980> become

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
that is an old one that has become

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.039 
that is an old one that has become
unsticky<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.390> stick<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.899> bottom

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
unsticky and I stick to the bottom

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.579 
unsticky and I stick to the bottom
anymore

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
anymore

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.700 
anymore
so<00:01:05.250> I'm<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> try<00:01:07.280> will<00:01:08.280> be<00:01:08.400> enough<00:01:08.670> it's

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
so I'm going to try will be enough it's

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.560 
so I'm going to try will be enough it's
eight<00:01:10.710> watts<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.979> not<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.270> bunch<00:01:15.270> but

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
eight watts and so it's not a bunch but

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.300 
eight watts and so it's not a bunch but
I'm<00:01:15.659> hoping<00:01:15.960> it'll<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.229> enough<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
I'm hoping it'll be enough for this and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.690 
I'm hoping it'll be enough for this and
then<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> got<00:01:18.000> water<00:01:18.270> bombs<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.720> here<00:01:18.900> those<00:01:19.110> on

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
then I got water bombs and here those on

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.100 
then I got water bombs and here those on
it'll<00:01:20.700> warm<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.210> water<00:01:21.240> bottles<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.930> keep

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it'll warm up the water bottles and keep

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.580 
it'll warm up the water bottles and keep
kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:23.390> warm<00:01:24.390> all<00:01:24.659> over<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.110> not<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.439> in

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
kind of warm all over and not just in

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.910 
kind of warm all over and not just in
this<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.770> spot<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.640> it'll<00:01:27.450> help<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:28.020> with

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
this one spot and it'll help just with

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.030 
this one spot and it'll help just with
the<00:01:29.070> heat<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.490> get<00:01:29.610> give<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> little<00:01:30.420> push<00:01:31.040> keep

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the heat to get give a little push keep

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.460 
the heat to get give a little push keep
it<00:01:32.130> from<00:01:32.250> cutting<00:01:32.490> too<00:01:32.939> much<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.479> spread<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
it from cutting too much and spread it

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.830 
it from cutting too much and spread it
out<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.619> little<00:01:34.770> um<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> idea<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.540> take<00:01:36.659> some

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
out a little um so the idea is take some

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.480 
out a little um so the idea is take some
water<00:01:37.049> balls<00:01:37.290> down<00:01:37.500> there<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.950> need<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.340> add<00:01:38.460> one

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
water balls down there I need to add one

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.980 
water balls down there I need to add one
more<00:01:38.759> um<00:01:40.430> but<00:01:41.430> then<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.909> have<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.420> drill<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> hole

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
more um but then I have to drill a hole

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.929 
more um but then I have to drill a hole
right<00:01:43.350> now<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.530> having<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.979> drill<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.700> hole<00:01:44.820> and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
right now I having to drill the hole and

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.819 
right now I having to drill the hole and
this<00:01:45.000> doesn't<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.450> drainage<00:01:45.780> hole<00:01:45.930> for

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
this doesn't have a drainage hole for

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.530 
this doesn't have a drainage hole for
the<00:01:46.979> cords<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.369> go<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:47.909> here's<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.270> cord

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.420 
the cords to go out but here's a cord
right<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.950> then<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.990> got<00:01:52.100> this<00:01:53.100> right

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
was just the white metal part was there

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.219 
was just the white metal part was there

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
could really find it looks like it'll

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.670 
could really find it looks like it'll
work<00:02:23.310> fun<00:02:23.870> but<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:24.990> keeps<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.290> together<00:02:25.440> and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680

it is let me uh straighten it out whoa

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.330 
it is let me uh straighten it out whoa
it<00:03:03.960> doesn't<00:03:04.380> really<00:03:04.500> matter<00:03:04.770> I'm<00:03:04.980> not<00:03:05.040> going

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
it doesn't really matter I'm not going

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.340

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
to straighten it out

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.950 
to straighten it out
basically<00:03:07.640> you<00:03:08.640> need<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.940> make<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.300> graded

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
basically you need to make this graded

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.300 
basically you need to make this graded
part<00:03:10.200> level<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:11.420> far<00:03:12.420> enough<00:03:12.630> down<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:14.100> then

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
part level and far enough down and then

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.110 
part level and far enough down and then
basically<00:03:17.310> from<00:03:17.400> there<00:03:17.750> you're<00:03:18.750> gonna<00:03:18.870> need

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
basically from there you're gonna need

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.840 
basically from there you're gonna need
your<00:03:21.120> thing<00:03:21.330> with<00:03:21.540> vermiculite<00:03:22.550> to<00:03:23.550> go<00:03:23.700> in

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
your thing with vermiculite to go in

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.030

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
there I'm gonna have the holes with this

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.090 
there I'm gonna have the holes with this
coming<00:03:26.340> out<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:27.060> got<00:03:27.270> this<00:03:27.770> right<00:03:28.770> here<00:03:28.980> to

too cold right now and then I also have
a<00:03:34.230> rheostat<00:03:35.300> which<00:03:36.300> I'm<00:03:36.510> also<00:03:36.690> going<00:03:36.990> to

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
a rheostat which I'm also going to

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.870 
a rheostat which I'm also going to
thread<00:03:37.380> through<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:37.920> hole<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.130> make<00:03:38.400> here<00:03:38.700> and

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
thread through the hole I make here and

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.600 
thread through the hole I make here and
that<00:03:39.570> will<00:03:39.690> keep<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.110> at<00:03:40.350> whatever<00:03:40.770> degrees<00:03:41.370> I

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
that will keep it at whatever degrees I

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.990 
that will keep it at whatever degrees I
need<00:03:42.140> MIDI<00:03:43.140> meant<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.590> stay<00:03:43.800> so<00:03:44.580> yeah<00:03:44.760> that's
