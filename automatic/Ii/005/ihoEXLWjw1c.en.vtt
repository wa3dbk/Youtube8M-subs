obesity from your parents that is a fact

obesity from your parents that is a fact
and<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:32.220> doesn't<00:02:32.519> mean<00:02:32.610> you're<00:02:32.760> definitely

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
and it doesn't mean you're definitely

and it doesn't mean you're definitely
gonna<00:02:33.450> be<00:02:33.660> obese<00:02:34.019> but<00:02:34.319> you're<00:02:34.470> more<00:02:34.650> likely<00:02:35.810> to

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
gonna be obese but you're more likely to

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.000 
gonna be obese but you're more likely to

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
fall into that trap of becoming obese

because<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.129> your<00:02:41.250> genetics<00:02:41.640> because<00:02:41.790> your

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
because of your genetics because your

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.199 
because of your genetics because your
