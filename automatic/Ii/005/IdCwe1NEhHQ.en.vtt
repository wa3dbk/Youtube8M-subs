00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.670
 and me that we are here that leave me believe 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:07.790
 and we are going to bring the new ekin of varus 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.250
 healthy care varus that would be several 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.440
 looks for hearts just as it does and here it is 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.889
 so they do list 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.800
 as if it were the cupid the arch quoted 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.140
 decorated 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.039
 the exercise style you already know as the 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.270
 annie and this is 1300 river point works 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.270
 and let's see the animations 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.620
 control 2 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.370
 3 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.110
 and control 4 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.180
 I do not care about anything else 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.470
 this is who I think would have been 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:05.300
 better to own real by its nature 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:08.330
 a little loving not to not have the bow 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.170
 well, a little complicated there, let's see 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.360
 here 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.360
 the car is worth 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.700
 this is the passive that starts to shine 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.700
 the arc 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.880
 you 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:32.280
 the w that leaves its mark evidently 2 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.730
 and three marquita and a sound 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.700
 as well 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.070
 why 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.290
 that the e 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.480
 and we are going to have another velaco for example 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.050
 again 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.050
 there 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.350
 the marquitas again 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.990
 perfect and another in nothing for a 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.979
 little field of roses 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.979
 the last t 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.460
 there you have how it dies 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:20.580
 it does not do anything it responds to the fact 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.580
 something strange being 1300 the neighborhood 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.740
 ok it's fine but it's not me 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.150
 I do not fit in the personality of Baru 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.900
 with 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.780
 good 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.340
 to be a fucking cupid but nothing 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.930
 that has a bow and to spit the 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.150
 potash come 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.150
 Look how my mother runs 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.099
 it does not have a different animation 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.769
 and well, comments, I thought it was this 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.939
 corner law favorite italy you know that 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.489
 help a lot 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:08.140
 what I said I think there's real in 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.480
 tone of humor would have sinned more but 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.030
 good 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.269
 anything you already know that gives me a 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.269
 dot
