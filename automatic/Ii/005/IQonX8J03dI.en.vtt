 Murrieta said will be transferred from the technician of the most anticipated premieres 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:04.990
 for the 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.420
 fans are dedicated that have men x of x-men first generation 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.349
 osmel three classes 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.479
 the other film imposes em director of which if I was excited enough 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:19.489
 the kick ass that was his previous film percent in Aragon species 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:20.640
 of 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.390
 reilly center again try say the 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.619
 dt stir successfully 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.520
 the language of the graphic novel with the third got what they get very well 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.080
 in love a movie movie that although 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.650
 did not come for many people even reached the levels of violence that the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.989
 graphic novel pose 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.120
 well he got a goal 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.180
 a good speech I get a very good time with if a pretty movie 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.690
 successful quentin I would say towards your interiors 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.990
 and that 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.219
 that made us see that 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.079
 we do not necessarily have to make the characters talk like in the 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.629
 comics 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.289
 to make us feel that we are not getting 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.240
 and the same goes for this first generation of euros 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.550
 of men x 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.289
 percent and includes several ingredients in the movie 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:05.339
 that many others 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.490
 other people many directors I think I would have had even his 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.350
 fear 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.220
 to add anda 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.500
 france kehl 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.689
 already it seems it is going to end it was already in clear decline 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.150
 and that on the other hand had brought everyone closer 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.420
 in the species 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.470
 denny up where no one could touch them where nobody can get close to them 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.960
 where things were too rigid donges in two sectors you have to 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.159
 refresh the matter 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.869
 if we are going to retell the history of men x since its inception good 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.420
 you have to attack 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.740
 referred to them and they themselves have to refer to themselves 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.080
 cooke teens that what the most 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.600
 of the mutants that are raising us now are like people a lot 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.340
 younger 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.940
 in a time also quite more and that at a time of world history 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.350
 rather more uncertain what they did was god take away all these steroids 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.530
 and this time and that is because we already have characters 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.249
 to present the results younger 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:05.240
 and good 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.650
 the result I think it walks pretty well 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.310
 especially because all this 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.269
 he is also supported goal 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.210
 a lot more humor management 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.940
 it's in Saratov it's nothing explosives plus padlocks or 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.030
 it vanished 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.450
 and even self-referential clothing 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.780
 where the characters refer to themselves telling some jokes narrating 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.760
 some anecdotes 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.260
 the business government that is going to happen 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.159
 he is referring to the movies we have already told 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.970
 and that sometimes giving a touch of naivety 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.490
 but yes enough freshness to two people 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.410
 on the other hand the same with 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.999
 I had already said that he 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:45.309
 he has been very inspired by the first movies of the time 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:47.769
 the to put him also 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.190
 unwanted yes a little bit of that style 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.310
 to your movie 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.670
 We said to anyone who refused to be published the news is also voted on 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.470
 very clearly what he wanted to do and well that gives him a different dynamic 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.760
 the movies is not that necessarily premiere of a spy movie but 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.079
 good some of the action sequences 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.579
 and some of the ball one of the subframes are so much telling you the 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.050
 film walk from Santander and of course 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.560
 the style refreshment is evident the men's previous films x 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:19.370
 they were already common raised 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.450
 between the battle between about 30 years old others 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.009
 we have to hit 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.500
 we have to be partners we have real cases 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.590
 for children's gastaldi the matter 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.610
 here not here is no spy game obviously we are located in 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.959
 the stage of the cold war 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.840
 there are a lot of references to the cube percent missiles from the point of view 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.130
 of the comic postponed 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.330
 there is no kind of that historical attitude in the matter 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.270
 but another good that inject in little more than spirit of action 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.800
 yes yes poster of time and in turn more in time 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.890
 both characters that are the ones that really become 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.980
 in the axis of the between the movie that are themes of striking out two 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.599
 chancellor 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.839
 pesce and the forcÃ³n because people get very 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:05.040
 very jealous with 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.910
 with the issue about these two characters really 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.839
 in which history could be centered but around which 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:15.859
 all ultra plus all references all that the others 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.900
 mutant characters and they do not 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.090
 they are centered 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.240
 them two with the weight of ice cream bon jovi story or this one will be 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.340
 we had this relaunch 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.490
 this prequel is designed to tell 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.610
 the origins of magneto that's very well posed that the two 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.730
 as characters and how he acted as actors 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.780
 are the ones who are carrying the weight of the whole movie 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.790
 what is around is a cube rather diminished by pragmatic necessity 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.400
 it is a choir or quite the world even in activity 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.260
 sisi street and in planning what 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.080
 what I do in terms of the sections of the film 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.240
 and it is understood that it is discussed 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.449
 in the profile 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.840
 thanks to the good performance of the driver 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.180
 and then integrated well these two characters we can not 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.340
 we can not deny that despite a movie based on a comic 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.240
 that despite a movie I think that it is already the fourth fifth of the series 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.560
 heads a summer movie carlos maple a junk food movie like 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.040
 I'm loving this year 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.069
 well they are people who are very well written 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.250
 the movie is entertaining the movie is pretty funny 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.860
 it's very crazy referential 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.270
 the people that I dominate the data of the 11 that is going to happen pump 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.939
 for one hundrerd 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:30.039
 it is not at all a 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.199
 I do not know what to expect 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.960
 the 2 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.159
 in summer 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.660
 yesterday they told us yesterday that what they told us 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.830
 that the boy who considers it as the best proposed marvel movie 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.889
 far from that 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.319
 it makes me better for the mission to do better 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:47.460
 in palm in the first the first 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.139
 the part 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.389
 and is that the Peruvian is betting for treatment of those 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.060
 This is very well placed in the van to have a good time 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.340
 I think it will be good at the box office despite 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.669
 what will they support us to see what I am referring to 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.520
 once again a thousand copies have revalued from 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.160
 of all of mexico which leaves us without options to the rest of the billboard 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.060
 integrate metepec the movie I liked how 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.700
 Acciona is an abuse on the part of the exhibitors 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.389
 that we have so many rooms full with the same movie 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.680
 all the schedules gentlemen we need other options to see in the cinema 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.809
 and they are not letting us see 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:28.429
 that burst environment is going to flip the consumer decides whether it goes or not 

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:28.910
 goes 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.400
 and from there it must decide the permanence box office of the film 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.999
 there is no data the high 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:35.680
 with the same proposal 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.669
 go see 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:39.669
 is going to march very well men first generation
