we<00:00:26.500> had<00:00:26.830> a<00:00:26.890> chance<00:00:27.160> to<00:00:27.339> get<00:00:27.490> that<00:00:27.669> set<00:00:27.939> up<00:00:27.970> yet

we had a chance to get that set up yet

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:29.790 
we had a chance to get that set up yet
but<00:00:28.449> I'm<00:00:28.570> more<00:00:28.779> interested<00:00:29.050> in<00:00:29.410> seeing<00:00:29.470> how

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
but I'm more interested in seeing how

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.189 
but I'm more interested in seeing how
the<00:00:29.980> drill<00:00:30.369> performs<00:00:31.090> going<00:00:31.750> straight<00:00:32.020> into

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
stubble which meant we couldn't actually

stubble which meant we couldn't actually
do<00:00:39.010> anything<00:00:39.370> with<00:00:39.489> it<00:00:39.519> till<00:00:39.790> the<00:00:39.879> 15th<00:00:40.120> of

do anything with it till the 15th of
February<00:00:41.019> and<00:00:42.000> we've<00:00:43.000> just<00:00:43.030> left<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.600> field

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
February and we've just left the field

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.889 
February and we've just left the field
as<00:00:45.309> you<00:00:45.370> can<00:00:45.699> see<00:00:45.850> they're<00:00:46.059> just<00:00:46.089> all<00:00:46.480> stubble

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
as you can see they're just all stubble

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.030 
as you can see they're just all stubble
and<00:00:48.659> we're<00:00:49.659> just<00:00:49.930> going<00:00:50.260> straight<00:00:50.409> into<00:00:50.890> it

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
and we're just going straight into it

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.680 
and we're just going straight into it
here<00:00:51.309> with<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:51.760> drill<00:00:52.030> and<00:00:52.269> I'm<00:00:52.360> just<00:00:52.570> going

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
here with the drill and I'm just going

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.139 
here with the drill and I'm just going
to<00:00:52.720> have<00:00:52.839> a<00:00:52.870> little<00:00:53.140> thing<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:54.430> down<00:00:54.729> in<00:00:54.760> here

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
to have a little thing just down in here

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.930 
to have a little thing just down in here
now<00:00:56.309> -<00:00:57.600> there<00:00:58.600> you<00:00:58.660> go<00:00:58.690> there's<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.050> seed<00:00:59.940> so

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
now - there you go there's the seed so

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.970 
now - there you go there's the seed so
that's<00:01:01.090> putting<00:01:01.449> that<00:01:01.570> down<00:01:01.870> sort<00:01:02.230> of<00:01:02.320> half<00:01:02.769> an

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
that's putting that down sort of half an

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.210 
that's putting that down sort of half an
inch<00:01:03.129> it's<00:01:03.340> really<00:01:04.110> really<00:01:05.110> moist<00:01:05.410> actually

if you get hold of that it's almost

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.650 
if you get hold of that it's almost
almost<00:01:09.520> too<00:01:10.090> wet<00:01:11.399> but<00:01:12.399> times<00:01:12.729> moving<00:01:13.090> on<00:01:13.390> in

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
we need to get on in there

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.770 
we need to get on in there
get<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> crop<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.880> ground<00:01:27.000> really

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
get the crop in the ground really

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.580 
get the crop in the ground really
it<00:01:29.080> also<00:01:29.260> gives<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.650> bit<00:01:29.770> of<00:01:29.860> an<00:01:29.950> opportunity

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.540 

structure

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.200 

putting<00:01:38.180> actually<00:01:38.540> this<00:01:38.660> is

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
putting actually this is

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.090 
putting actually this is
got<00:01:41.210> 210<00:01:41.840> horsepower<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.620> sending<00:01:42.950> all

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
got 210 horsepower so sending all

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.620 
got 210 horsepower so sending all
parameter<00:01:44.890> on<00:01:45.890> fairly<00:01:46.340> light<00:01:46.670> land<00:01:47.650> albeit<00:01:49.630> is

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
parameter on fairly light land albeit is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.600 
parameter on fairly light land albeit is
very<00:01:51.020> well<00:01:51.200> demonstrated<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:52.130> little<00:01:52.490> bit

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
very well demonstrated a little bit

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.750 
very well demonstrated a little bit
stoning<00:01:53.620> but<00:01:54.620> it's<00:01:54.740> coping<00:01:55.040> with<00:01:55.160> stones<00:01:55.430> well

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
stoning but it's coping with stones well

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.030 
stoning but it's coping with stones well
it's<00:01:56.120> destroyed<00:01:56.870> just<00:01:57.110> seems<00:01:57.410> to<00:01:57.590> building<00:01:57.980> up

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
it's destroyed just seems to building up

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.310 
it's destroyed just seems to building up
a<00:01:58.190> little<00:01:58.310> bit<00:01:58.660> there's<00:01:59.660> a<00:01:59.780> bit<00:01:59.930> of<00:01:59.960> a<00:02:00.110> lump

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
a little bit there's a bit of a lump

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.030 
a little bit there's a bit of a lump
there

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
there

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.270 
there
I<00:02:02.050> think<00:02:03.050> that's<00:02:03.170> building<00:02:03.470> up<00:02:03.560> on<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.890> front

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
I think that's building up on the front

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.980 
I think that's building up on the front
legs<00:02:04.580> where<00:02:04.850> there's<00:02:05.120> a<00:02:05.180> bit<00:02:05.390> more<00:02:05.600> straw

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
legs where there's a bit more straw

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.249 
legs where there's a bit more straw
around<00:02:06.410> a<00:02:06.830> bit<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.430> valley<00:02:07.640> sort<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.229> bit<00:02:09.229> of

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
around a bit of a valley sort of bit of

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.840 
around a bit of a valley sort of bit of
a<00:02:09.320> valley<00:02:09.530> bottom<00:02:09.920> bit<00:02:10.130> here<00:02:10.340> where<00:02:10.610> they're

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
a valley bottom bit here where they're

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.910 
a valley bottom bit here where they're
just<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.360> wheat<00:02:11.540> crop<00:02:11.750> would<00:02:12.620> have<00:02:12.740> been<00:02:12.830> a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
just the wheat crop would have been a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.560 
just the wheat crop would have been a
bit<00:02:13.070> thicker<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.640> little<00:02:13.850> bit<00:02:13.970> more<00:02:14.150> straw<00:02:14.510> to

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
bit thicker a little bit more straw to

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.570 
bit thicker a little bit more straw to
try<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.080> deal<00:02:15.650> with<00:02:17.950> but<00:02:18.950> on<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.190> whole<00:02:19.340> it's

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
try and deal with but on the whole it's

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.310 
try and deal with but on the whole it's
putting<00:02:19.820> it<00:02:20.000> in<00:02:20.120> very<00:02:20.360> nicely<00:02:20.630> obviously<00:02:21.170> it's

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
putting it in very nicely obviously it's

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.100 
putting it in very nicely obviously it's
just<00:02:21.590> one<00:02:21.770> pass<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:22.340> it's<00:02:22.459> straight<00:02:22.730> in<00:02:22.930> we<00:02:23.930> did

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
just one pass so it's straight in we did

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.630 
just one pass so it's straight in we did
start<00:02:24.410> this<00:02:24.560> field<00:02:24.800> it's<00:02:24.950> five<00:02:25.130> hectares

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
start this field it's five hectares

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.900 
start this field it's five hectares
started<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:26.690> about<00:02:26.870> half<00:02:27.110> us<00:02:27.290> three<00:02:27.700> it's<00:02:28.700> now

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
started it about half us three it's now

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.740 
started it about half us three it's now
twenty<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.420> six<00:02:29.720> we've<00:02:29.900> done<00:02:30.050> about<00:02:30.140> three

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
twenty to six we've done about three

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.140 
twenty to six we've done about three
there<00:02:32.750> three<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.410> half<00:02:33.620> hectares<00:02:34.160> maybe

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.490 

there's<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.239> new<00:02:38.360> tractor<00:02:38.630> for<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.080> for<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
there's a new tractor for the for the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.360 
there's a new tractor for the for the
operator<00:02:39.830> Duncan<00:02:40.640> so<00:02:41.470> yeah<00:02:42.470> output<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:43.160> think

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
operator Duncan so yeah output I think

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.310 
operator Duncan so yeah output I think
would<00:02:43.550> probably<00:02:43.580> improve<00:02:44.150> when<00:02:44.720> we<00:02:44.870> get<00:02:45.110> a

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
would probably improve when we get a

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.690 
would probably improve when we get a
little<00:02:45.739> bit<00:02:45.950> more<00:02:47.050> in<00:02:48.050> tune<00:02:48.530> with<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.130> with

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
little bit more in tune with the with

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.750 
little bit more in tune with the with
the<00:02:49.760> tractor<00:02:50.000> but<00:02:51.160> seems<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.220> be<00:02:52.340> pulling<00:02:52.550> it

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
the tractor but seems to be pulling it

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.910 
the tractor but seems to be pulling it
fairly<00:02:53.000> well<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.360> little<00:02:53.600> bit<00:02:53.840> low<00:02:54.709> on

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
fairly well a little bit low on

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.990 
fairly well a little bit low on
hydraulic<00:02:55.430> power<00:02:55.640> I<00:02:55.760> think<00:02:57.220> but<00:02:58.220> it's<00:02:58.670> doing

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
hydraulic power I think but it's doing

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.820 
hydraulic power I think but it's doing
it<00:02:59.150> at<00:02:59.450> about<00:02:59.780> eight<00:02:59.930> kilometres<00:03:00.440> an<00:03:00.560> hour

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
it at about eight kilometres an hour

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.090 
it at about eight kilometres an hour
so<00:03:01.870> actually<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:02.989> get<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.530> reasonable<00:03:03.980> bit

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
so actually you get a reasonable bit

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.600 
so actually you get a reasonable bit
done<00:03:04.250> in<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.459> day<00:03:04.610> with<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.940> so<00:03:06.250> that's<00:03:07.250> where<00:03:07.459> we

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
done in a day with it so that's where we

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.360 
done in a day with it so that's where we
are<00:03:07.790> now

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
are now

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.630 
are now
middle<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.430> March<00:03:10.670> tune<00:03:11.330> in<00:03:11.600> as<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:13.310> season

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
middle of March tune in as the season

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.240 
middle of March tune in as the season
progresses<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.269> I'll<00:03:14.390> come<00:03:14.570> back<00:03:14.720> here<00:03:14.959> and

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
progresses and I'll come back here and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.420 
progresses and I'll come back here and
do<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.280> bit<00:03:16.489> more<00:03:16.519> video<00:03:17.000> footage<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:19.160> see<00:03:19.310> how

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
do a bit more video footage to see how

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.570 
do a bit more video footage to see how
the<00:03:19.489> crop<00:03:19.760> sort<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.120> develops<00:03:20.510> and

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
the crop sort of develops and

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.430 
the crop sort of develops and
see<00:03:22.390> it<00:03:22.480> actually<00:03:22.840> coming<00:03:23.080> up<00:03:23.170> through<00:03:23.350> the

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
see it actually coming up through the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:55.040 
see it actually coming up through the
ground

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.110
