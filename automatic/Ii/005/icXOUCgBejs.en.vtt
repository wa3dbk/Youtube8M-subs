00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
we can go to the radius battle mod

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.840 
we can go to the radius battle mod
alright<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.960> real<00:01:43.320> fast<00:01:43.590> morale<00:01:44.430> effects

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
alright so just real fast morale effects

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.539 
alright so just real fast morale effects
edited<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.630> there<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.049> go<00:01:46.079> let's<00:01:46.799> see<00:01:47.189> they

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
edited so there we go let's see they

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.710 
edited so there we go let's see they
will<00:01:47.700> fight<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.090> longer<00:01:48.299> period<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.659> time

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
will fight for a longer period of time

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.350 
will fight for a longer period of time
and<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:50.130> elite<00:01:50.430> ones<00:01:50.610> will<00:01:50.729> fight<00:01:50.939> for<00:01:51.119> even

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and the elite ones will fight for even

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.109 
and the elite ones will fight for even
longer<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.320> general<00:01:52.920> aura<00:01:53.189> has<00:01:53.759> been

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
longer the general aura has been

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.630 
longer the general aura has been
increased<00:01:54.450> from<00:01:54.479> 75<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.049> 100<00:01:55.619> their<00:01:56.340> speeds

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
increased from 75 to 100 their speeds

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.039 
increased from 75 to 100 their speeds
have<00:01:56.790> been<00:01:56.939> reduced<00:01:57.420> which<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.750> very<00:01:57.960> good

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
have been reduced which is very good

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.270 
have been reduced which is very good
depending<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.930> unit<00:02:00.930> type<00:02:01.280> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
depending on to you it the unit type and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.280 
depending on to you it the unit type and
from<00:02:02.490> there<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:02.969> unit<00:02:03.299> mass<00:02:03.600> changes

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
from there we have the unit mass changes

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.190 
from there we have the unit mass changes
so<00:02:04.619> some<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.549> them<00:02:05.700> got<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.240> reduction<00:02:06.780> some<00:02:07.020> got

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
so some of them got a reduction some got

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.770 
so some of them got a reduction some got
a<00:02:07.229> increase<00:02:07.979> capture<00:02:08.970> points<00:02:09.390> time<00:02:09.660> are

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
a increase capture points time are

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.440 
a increase capture points time are
doubled<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.440> has<00:02:10.560> gone<00:02:10.739> up<00:02:10.979> now

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
doubled so that has gone up now

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.180 
doubled so that has gone up now
equally<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:11.870> then<00:02:12.290> he's<00:02:12.410> changed<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.920> range

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
equally and then he's changed the range

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.830 
equally and then he's changed the range
of<00:02:13.340> all<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.670> range<00:02:13.940> troops<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.629> then<00:02:14.720> from

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
of all the range troops and then from

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.960 
of all the range troops and then from
there<00:02:15.110> transport<00:02:15.800> ships<00:02:16.010> changes<00:02:16.640> their<00:02:16.819> mass

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
there transport ships changes their mass

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.250 
there transport ships changes their mass
has<00:02:17.150> been<00:02:17.300> reduced<00:02:17.599> by<00:02:17.750> thirty<00:02:18.050> to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
has been reduced by thirty to

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.920 
has been reduced by thirty to
thirty-five<00:02:18.530> percent<00:02:18.709> hit<00:02:19.610> or<00:02:19.790> HP<00:02:20.540> or<00:02:20.780> hit

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
thirty-five percent hit or HP or hit

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.300 
thirty-five percent hit or HP or hit
points<00:02:21.260> reduced<00:02:21.470> by<00:02:21.680> twenty-five<00:02:22.129> percent

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
points reduced by twenty-five percent

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.440 
points reduced by twenty-five percent
which<00:02:22.640> means<00:02:22.849> that<00:02:22.879> they<00:02:23.030> won't<00:02:23.180> be<00:02:23.239> able<00:02:23.330> to

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
which means that they won't be able to

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.449 
which means that they won't be able to
just<00:02:23.569> go<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.200> destroy<00:02:24.620> your<00:02:24.830> Navy<00:02:25.099> just

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
just go in and destroy your Navy just

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.490 
just go in and destroy your Navy just
because<00:02:25.730> their<00:02:25.849> transport<00:02:26.300> ships<00:02:26.569> let's<00:02:27.379> see

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
because their transport ships let's see

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.470 
because their transport ships let's see
all<00:02:27.530> units<00:02:27.890> got<00:02:28.370> reduced<00:02:28.760> melee<00:02:29.120> skilled<00:02:29.360> like

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
all units got reduced melee skilled like

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.020 
all units got reduced melee skilled like
fifteen<00:02:29.780> percent<00:02:30.280> increase<00:02:31.280> defense<00:02:31.550> kill<00:02:31.910> by

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
fifteen percent increase defense kill by

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.330 
fifteen percent increase defense kill by
fifteen<00:02:32.510> percent<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:33.500> people<00:02:34.010> will<00:02:34.160> be<00:02:34.280> able

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
fifteen percent so people will be able

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.280 
fifteen percent so people will be able
to<00:02:34.459> fight<00:02:34.790> longer<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.360> not<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.110> won't

area anti calorie and elephants bonuses
change<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.090> then<00:03:02.180> from<00:03:02.329> there<00:03:02.599> we<00:03:02.750> can<00:03:02.780> go

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
change and then from there we can go

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.830 
change and then from there we can go
over<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.500> radius<00:03:04.400> economy<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.299> research<00:03:05.599> mod

over to radius economy and research mod

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.080 
over to radius economy and research mod
okay<00:03:06.410> so<00:03:06.470> let's<00:03:07.370> say<00:03:07.489> food<00:03:07.700> consumption

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
okay so let's say food consumption

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.729 
okay so let's say food consumption
slightly<00:03:08.569> reduced<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.319> then<00:03:09.500> we<00:03:09.590> have

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
slightly reduced and then we have

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.559 
slightly reduced and then we have
squalor<00:03:10.069> effect<00:03:10.519> slightly<00:03:10.849> reduced<00:03:11.269> income

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
squalor effect slightly reduced income

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.500 
squalor effect slightly reduced income

from all building increased taxes

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.509 
from all building increased taxes
change<00:03:14.900> technology<00:03:15.319> changes<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.430> we

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
change technology changes and that we

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.970 
change technology changes and that we
have<00:03:16.549> Smith<00:03:16.880> bonuses<00:03:17.510> changed<00:03:18.079> and<00:03:18.319> just<00:03:18.889> a
