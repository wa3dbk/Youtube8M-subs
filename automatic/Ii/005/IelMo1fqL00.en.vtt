stage falls the same path but with a

stage falls the same path but with a
slightly<00:01:43.930> different<00:01:44.229> idea<00:01:44.740> we<00:01:45.250> wanted<00:01:45.490> to

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
slightly different idea we wanted to

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.750 
slightly different idea we wanted to
offer<00:01:45.760> better<00:01:46.119> performance<00:01:46.750> but<00:01:46.990> without

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
offer better performance but without

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.030 
offer better performance but without
without<00:01:48.760> hurting<00:01:49.180> compatibility<00:01:49.840> so<00:01:50.830> this

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
without hurting compatibility so this

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.160 
without hurting compatibility so this
this<00:01:51.369> one<00:01:51.580> uses<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.909> triple<00:01:52.330> stack<00:01:52.570> design<00:01:52.960> you

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
this one uses a triple stack design you

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.500 
this one uses a triple stack design you
can<00:01:53.320> see<00:01:53.500> it's<00:01:53.680> got<00:01:53.799> three<00:01:54.310> thin<00:01:54.549> stacks<00:01:54.909> so

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
can see it's got three thin stacks so

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.990 
can see it's got three thin stacks so
both<00:01:55.750> of<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:56.080> fans<00:01:56.350> blow<00:01:57.009> over<00:01:57.159> to<00:01:57.460> fin<00:01:57.700> stacks

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
both of the fans blow over to fin stacks

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.260 
both of the fans blow over to fin stacks
to<00:01:58.240> improve<00:01:58.509> airflow<00:01:58.750> efficiency<00:01:59.970> but<00:02:00.970> at<00:02:01.150> the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
to improve airflow efficiency but at the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.090 
to improve airflow efficiency but at the
same<00:02:01.479> time<00:02:01.750> compatibility<00:02:02.530> is<00:02:02.590> excellent

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
same time compatibility is excellent

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.820 
same time compatibility is excellent
because<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.549> outer<00:02:03.700> fin<00:02:04.390> stacks<00:02:04.689> are<00:02:05.350> set

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
because the outer fin stacks are set

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.009 
because the outer fin stacks are set
very<00:02:06.070> high<00:02:06.159> so<00:02:06.640> you've<00:02:06.850> got<00:02:06.880> 70<00:02:07.390> millimeter<00:02:07.810> of

nhd<00:02:14.230> 14<00:02:14.860> cooler<00:02:15.430> we've<00:02:16.329> modified<00:02:16.720> two<00:02:17.349> points

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
nhd 14 cooler we've modified two points

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.610 
nhd 14 cooler we've modified two points
first<00:02:18.640> off<00:02:18.909> we've<00:02:19.209> got<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.540> recessed<00:02:20.319> fin

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
first off we've got a recessed fin

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.949 
first off we've got a recessed fin
design<00:02:20.829> here<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:21.909> if<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.180> move<00:02:22.390> up<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.750> front

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
design here so if you move up the front

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.410 
design here so if you move up the front
fan<00:02:23.349> you've<00:02:23.680> now<00:02:23.890> got<00:02:23.920> sixty<00:02:24.909> millimeter<00:02:25.150> of

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
fan you've now got sixty millimeter of

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.140 
fan you've now got sixty millimeter of
space<00:02:25.810> for<00:02:26.049> your<00:02:26.200> RAM<00:02:26.379> modules<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
space for your RAM modules and the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.610 
space for your RAM modules and the
second<00:02:28.480> improvement<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.349> we're<00:02:29.500> now

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
second improvement is that we're now

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.559 
second improvement is that we're now
using<00:02:29.860> an<00:02:30.099> alternating<00:02:30.700> fin<00:02:30.909> design<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.420> can

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
using an alternating fin design you can

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.690 
using an alternating fin design you can
see<00:02:31.720> every<00:02:32.019> second<00:02:32.379> film<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.950> moved<00:02:33.370> back

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
see every second film is moved back

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.179 
see every second film is moved back
slightly<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:35.170> we<00:02:35.319> get<00:02:35.470> less<00:02:35.739> air<00:02:35.980> flow

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
slightly so we get less air flow

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.949 
slightly so we get less air flow
resistance<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.970> at<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.209> same<00:02:37.359> time<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:37.810> could

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
resistance and at the same time we could

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.080 
resistance and at the same time we could
increase<00:02:38.379> the<00:02:38.439> fing<00:02:38.769> count<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.189> fifty<00:02:39.549> so

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
increase the fing count to fifty so

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.179 
increase the fing count to fifty so
we've<00:02:40.209> got<00:02:40.390> more<00:02:40.629> surface<00:02:41.260> area<00:02:41.439> less<00:02:41.980> air

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
we've got more surface area less air

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.789 
we've got more surface area less air
flow<00:02:42.370> resistance<00:02:42.640> which<00:02:43.180> results<00:02:44.079> in<00:02:44.230> better

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
flow resistance which results in better

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.009 
flow resistance which results in better
performance<00:02:45.579> in<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.909> end<00:02:46.030> we've<00:02:46.720> also<00:02:46.900> worked

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
performance in the end we've also worked

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.809 
performance in the end we've also worked
on<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.379> design<00:02:47.739> for<00:02:47.950> those<00:02:48.129> who<00:02:48.310> care<00:02:48.609> about

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
on the design for those who care about

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.449 
on the design for those who care about
Ram<00:02:49.569> compatibility<00:02:50.290> even<00:02:50.500> more<00:02:50.739> who<00:02:51.010> don't

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
Ram compatibility even more who don't

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.940 
Ram compatibility even more who don't
want<00:02:51.730> in<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.690> fan<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.109> overhang<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.590> RAM

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
want in the fan to overhang the RAM

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.270 
want in the fan to overhang the RAM
slots<00:02:54.250> it's<00:02:54.609> a<00:02:54.730> slim<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.239> our<00:02:55.359> design<00:02:56.280> built

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
slots it's a slim to our design built

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.220 
slots it's a slim to our design built
for<00:02:57.579> either<00:02:57.970> one<00:02:58.299> or<00:02:58.359> two<00:02:58.689> one<00:02:58.870> hundred<00:02:59.109> forty

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.110 
for either one or two one hundred forty
millimeter<00:02:59.829> fans<00:03:00.099> and<00:03:00.340> it's<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:00.609> slim<00:03:00.909> that

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
millimeter fans and it's so slim that

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.089 
millimeter fans and it's so slim that
even<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.659> fan<00:03:01.870> won't<00:03:02.109> overhang<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.530> RAM<00:03:02.829> so

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
even the fan won't overhang the RAM so

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.129 
even the fan won't overhang the RAM so

the<00:05:53.530> bottom<00:05:53.979> magnet<00:05:54.400> is<00:05:54.580> even<00:05:55.270> stronger<00:05:55.599> so<00:05:56.229> we

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
the bottom magnet is even stronger so we

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.050 
the bottom magnet is even stronger so we
get<00:05:56.530> better<00:05:56.800> precision<00:05:57.219> better<00:05:57.729> reliability

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
get better precision better reliability

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.120 
get better precision better reliability
and<00:05:58.810> better<00:05:58.960> longevity<00:05:59.229> this<00:05:59.800> is<00:05:59.860> also<00:06:00.009> our

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
and better longevity this is also our

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.670 
and better longevity this is also our
first<00:06:00.490> fan<00:06:00.729> to<00:06:00.909> have<00:06:01.060> integrated<00:06:01.900> anti

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
first fan to have integrated anti

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.589 
first fan to have integrated anti
vibration<00:06:02.860> pad<00:06:03.550> so<00:06:03.849> if<00:06:03.940> you<00:06:04.060> put<00:06:04.270> it<00:06:04.360> on<00:06:04.479> your

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
vibration pad so if you put it on your

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.899 
vibration pad so if you put it on your
heatsink<00:06:05.050> already<00:06:05.349> radiator<00:06:06.069> it<00:06:06.639> will<00:06:06.789> not

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909 
heatsink already radiator it will not

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:08.790 
heatsink already radiator it will not
transmit<00:06:07.210> any<00:06:07.479> vibrations<00:06:08.110> you<00:06:08.530> can<00:06:08.680> also

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
transmit any vibrations you can also

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.320 
transmit any vibrations you can also
take<00:06:09.069> them<00:06:09.219> off<00:06:09.370> if<00:06:09.550> you<00:06:09.639> like<00:06:09.819> if<00:06:10.000> you<00:06:10.090> haven't

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
take them off if you like if you haven't

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.939 
take them off if you like if you haven't
got<00:06:10.419> the<00:06:10.449> space<00:06:10.719> to<00:06:10.870> use<00:06:11.050> them<00:06:11.259> and<00:06:11.440> last<00:06:11.860> but

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
got the space to use them and last but

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:14.730 
got the space to use them and last but
not<00:06:12.159> least<00:06:12.219> it<00:06:12.819> will<00:06:13.240> be<00:06:13.419> our<00:06:13.569> first<00:06:13.840> fan<00:06:14.199> to

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
not least it will be our first fan to

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.879 
not least it will be our first fan to
have<00:06:14.919> PWM<00:06:15.610> so<00:06:16.449> we've<00:06:16.599> custom<00:06:17.020> custom<00:06:17.380> designed

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889 
have PWM so we've custom custom designed

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.300 
have PWM so we've custom custom designed
our<00:06:18.069> own<00:06:18.370> IC<00:06:19.110> which<00:06:20.110> integrates<00:06:20.680> our<00:06:20.949> smooth

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
our own IC which integrates our smooth

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.480 
our own IC which integrates our smooth
commutation<00:06:21.819> drive<00:06:22.259> technology<00:06:23.259> so<00:06:23.710> this<00:06:24.310> one

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
commutation drive technology so this one

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.610 
commutation drive technology so this one
that<00:06:24.699> this<00:06:24.880> fan<00:06:25.090> will<00:06:25.300> be<00:06:25.330> for<00:06:26.110> those<00:06:26.259> who<00:06:26.440> want
