00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.880

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:31.429
 pvp and presentation of can but this 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:36.559
 serious pepe and good that this would be like 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:38.510
 already after this video I went to go to 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.790
 see what chapter 1 of the pp would be 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.010
 that is something winning but what I'm going to 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.829
 talk here would be the server that not only 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.050
 that the baby has plots and we're going 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.780
 to see this is spanish 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.360
 and of course, if you want to see only the 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.220
 part of the pvp advance the video the 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.890
 truth is that I do not know in what part well 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.440
 would be in minute 2 I think more or less 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.140
 and good here you are welcome for the 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.090
 crack and good good wolf a place are 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:12.200
 these work enchantments you can see 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.080
 all this and here you can enchant your 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.670

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.680
 same level enchantments ward 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.570
 well and I do not know what it is to play parcels 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.820
 this what would be doing the plots 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.590
 As you can see, these are not parcels of the 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.939
 that the map has been great and that good 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.280
 these are not smaller plots 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.140
 because I admire one was told he does not 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.270
 I noticed or those people are like that very 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.610
 big very exaggerated so we 're going to 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.630
 place it here daughter what happens with this 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.119
 and you will find like some posters 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.549
 my beautiful house is not going to find 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:54.020

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:56.210
 comes out '7 100 and well that's going to tell you if 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.100
 those are forced from right click 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.990
 and it's going to buy you but you're going to 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.080
 need 100 of money if in currencies 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.750
 we are going to get jobs and placing 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.130
 not with him we removed it good because I 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.760
 I think they're going to put us after 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.470
 placing jobs and well I think this 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.150
 it has been all in the representation the ip 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.600

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.870
 of the video and nothing this server is going to be 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.370
 another series that would be the pp series not only 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.830
 I do it to record in this service to 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.290
 record they go in another one because I make another mini 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.600
