00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.190
 which snaps very well, resists enlarged 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.530
 of the opponent and out of condition of 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.640
 precarious balance manages to beat in 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.640
 goal the launch in purpose the shot 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.340
 timely of klinsmann serious at first 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.490
 thousand then serves to mounfield loses

 the balance 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.980
 split puts the ball inside 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.770
 of the one to zero for the inter 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.560
 towards the aston villa and it must 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.829
 profiling the very situation that 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.710
 it is desirable for the nerazzurri this in 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:42.060
 depth 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.190

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.550
 then klinsmann takes over and continues 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.740
 klinsmann matheus does not cross 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.440
 find the time for the winning break 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.009
 then the ball is played again by 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.009
 pay in 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.580
 I have to do for inter drumming 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.080
 actions 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.520
 though not very accurate from 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.520
 of course it is necessary 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.060
 but the heat 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.030
 this beautiful game 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.950
 the inter 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.250
 what complicated life in the race 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.510
 outbound to buried 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.580

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.470
 opportunities as well as he did this 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.480
 evening after klinsmann's other goals 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.300
 sometimes the Nerazzurri showed up 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.350
 by the distinct parts in a manner 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.250
 this morning 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.010
 to assign the second necessary goal 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.680
 matheus putting the ball in the middle 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.100
 touched then there is the shot that ends the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.930
 goal by parts parties 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.030
 marks for the inter 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.590
 sixteenth of the second half situation 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.590
 is restored now 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.480
 thank you 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.480
 the article 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.440
 as in all he puts to attention 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.590
 four people 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.900
 we hoped 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.900
 we coordinate ourselves beautifully 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.880
 in which it was carried 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.410
 b 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.370
 let's review the winning conclusion of 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.269
 berti 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.269
 and now we are on 2 to 0 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.640
 I'd say 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.850
 back there 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.330
 luxury item 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.050
 Athens 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.050
 from 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.510
 the parable 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.849
 they work well with the help of the heart 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.450
 of the two tips serene and green star i 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.969
 Inter 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.969
 there is this gray header 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.349
 a pro bar is created on the left puts 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.680
 in the middle but right on the feet of lean 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.470
 she still laces her prof 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.780
 those whites g 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.400
 and the fields 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.070
 donated white for the inter 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.420
 the counter- sign precedes the counterattack 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.420
 in his third tip 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.720
 yesterday was his best man up to 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:37.740
 this time whites 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.740
 explodes san siro we are on 3 to 0 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.740
 result 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.240
 you see lace stealing the ball 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.610
 it's that own cross 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.100
 is coming out coordinates for the joke 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.760
 white ball passing violence instead 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.760
 let me explain 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.960
 to discuss if the ball was good 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.340
 at least I remind you that the 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.870
 for myself to be judged out 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.889
 of separate areas 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.200
 the bottom line is almost even 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.790
 74 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.590
 cross in net time 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.450
 realized during the 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.150
 taking 3 to 0 the score in favor 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.020
 of the gray now in possession of the ball 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.020
 now of her 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.449
 foul on him by game wounds 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.449
 stop the kick
