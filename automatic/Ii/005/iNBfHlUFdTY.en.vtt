 very well 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.520
 because 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.780

 profitable how safe 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.720
 for a house 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.720
 the elections were over 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.320
 it of course a mixture of the mud 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.340
 recovery promoted 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.180
 no country because as much as possible

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.769
 have you ever had a pack of milk? 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.429
 yes, it is not going to be easy there 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.229
 well actually 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.809
 usually it was mainly about solving this hobby 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.219
 we don't have time for that 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.219
 they would take care of it themselves 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.099
 get a long day 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:04.039

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.639
 they just do it for fun 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.179
 but on 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.179
 I honestly admit 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:18.309
 cheer from this 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:26.179
 anp 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.489

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:11.539
 the euro countries 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.419
 we in you 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.830
 woudenberg 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.129
 it's not about what matters 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.080
 a ds 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.150
 energy meant in those areas and can see them all 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.580
 of an illusion 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.740
 a big bump of energy 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.380
 with that when I join this company 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.870
 for another brand 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.830
 that meeting 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.770
 the festival 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.770
 x it does not stink 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.580
 in 2009 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.349
 the former strong man 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:10.580
 in one 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.830
 and those in the beautiful evangelical church 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.110
 send 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.610
 and that other option that energy 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.570
 you get the energy 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.380
 and you once he knew strong and music 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.050
 we all have 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.949
 in the supermarket 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.020
 and you have your energy 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.860
 you don't have an oath 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.569
 see 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.639
 of course you don't have to be a writer at all 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.530
 that must be different then you really have to get going then you should not start flowing then 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.030
 you must i am sure you must 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.400
 there you need a passenger car leo and you have that energy 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.309
 who did you say i did after all 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:51.930
 I went wrong 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.710
 I seriously I have the idea that I have I have the idea that you have one here 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.610

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:04.110

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.919

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.909
 structure 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.699
 the city 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.479

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.479
 it reported it on Wednesday 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.229
 a number of companies 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:32.430
 That has 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.430
 where to prepare verbally 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.340
 it attracted attention 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.619
 the attack 

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:46.379
 the take over 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:49.050
