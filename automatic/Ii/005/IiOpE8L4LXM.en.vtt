operating<00:01:47.100> system<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.090> guess<00:01:48.180> all<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.600> was

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
operating system so I guess all it was

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.450 
operating system so I guess all it was
down<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.380> whether<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.920> want<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.189> slide-out

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
down to is whether you want a slide-out

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.819 
down to is whether you want a slide-out
keyboard<00:01:50.759> or<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.210> well<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:52.170> not<00:01:52.409> all<00:01:52.590> from

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
keyboard or not well that's not all from

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.620 
keyboard or not well that's not all from
