later<00:00:57.750> well<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.920> later<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.399> was<00:00:59.820> added<00:01:00.030> a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
later well this is later I was added a

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.819 
later well this is later I was added a

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
very cheap wireless adapter that I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.590 
very cheap wireless adapter that I
actually<00:01:02.010> pulled<00:01:02.340> out<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.460> an<00:01:02.609> older<00:01:02.879> PC<00:01:03.329> I

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
actually pulled out of an older PC I

actually pulled out of an older PC I
don't<00:01:04.320> know<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:04.860> tell<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.129> my<00:01:05.430> recent

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
don't know if you can tell but my recent

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.310 
don't know if you can tell but my recent
videos<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.299> been<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.630> different<00:01:06.840> setting

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
videos have been in a different setting

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.380 
videos have been in a different setting
than<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.950> couple<00:01:08.280> months<00:01:08.490> ago<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.030> I'm<00:01:09.240> actually

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
than a couple months ago so I'm actually

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.060 
than a couple months ago so I'm actually
a<00:01:09.540> college<00:01:09.869> student<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.619> some<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.860> you

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
a college student and like some of you

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.190 
a college student and like some of you
can<00:01:11.220> probably<00:01:11.369> relate<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.939> one<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.080> don't

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
can probably relate to one I don't

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.260 
can probably relate to one I don't
really<00:01:13.560> want<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.830> live<00:01:13.979> at<00:01:14.070> home<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.310> 2<00:01:14.880> I'm

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
really want to live at home and 2 I'm

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.060 
really want to live at home and 2 I'm
Way<00:01:15.900> too<00:01:15.930> broke<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> afford<00:01:16.710> any<00:01:16.860> type<00:01:17.040> of

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
Way too broke to afford any type of

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.550 
Way too broke to afford any type of
apartment<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.210> solution<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:19.200> live<00:01:19.470> in

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
apartment so the solution is to live in

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.929 
apartment so the solution is to live in
a<00:01:19.619> residence<00:01:19.950> hall<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.310> before<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.640> even

a residence hall and before I even
forget<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.540> point<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.869> bringing<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.170> up<00:01:22.320> I

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
forget the point of bringing this up I

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.140 
forget the point of bringing this up I
remember<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> couple<00:01:23.430> months<00:01:23.549> ago<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.850> had<00:01:24.030> an

remember a couple months ago I had an

remember a couple months ago I had an
ethernet<00:01:24.509> jack<00:01:24.720> my<00:01:25.380> room<00:01:25.560> at<00:01:25.650> home<00:01:25.799> doesn't

simple answer was i just never had the
opportunity<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.280> really<00:01:56.430> use<00:01:56.729> OS<00:01:57.360> 10<00:01:57.600> and

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
opportunity to really use OS 10 and

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.300 
opportunity to really use OS 10 and
windows<00:01:58.350> did<00:01:58.469> everything<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.860> needed<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.280> just

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
windows did everything I needed to just

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.789 
windows did everything I needed to just
fine<00:01:59.840> anyways<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.930> took<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.140> opportunity<00:02:01.320> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
fine anyways it took this opportunity to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.480 
fine anyways it took this opportunity to
install<00:02:02.369> OS<00:02:03.360> 10<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.320> nice<00:02:04.680> it's

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
install OS 10 and it's nice it's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.980 
install OS 10 and it's nice it's
definitely<00:02:05.850> more<00:02:06.060> friendly<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.509> prettier

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
definitely more friendly and prettier

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
except for this now I know it's really

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.910 
except for this now I know it's really
simple<00:02:15.750> but<00:02:15.959> before<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.290> got<00:02:16.379> this<00:02:16.530> second

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
simple but before I got this second

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.679

increased<00:02:19.290> my<00:02:19.439> productivity<00:02:19.680> by<00:02:20.250> at<00:02:20.400> least

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
increased my productivity by at least

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.119 
increased my productivity by at least
50%<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.900> like<00:02:22.019> it<00:02:22.140> gives<00:02:22.200> me<00:02:22.409> more<00:02:22.620> virtual

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129

real estate and I just love it anyways I

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.250 
real estate and I just love it anyways I
think<00:02:26.010> that's<00:02:26.159> about<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.700> for<00:02:26.879> changes<00:02:27.480> on<00:02:28.109> the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
think that's about it for changes on the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.599 
think that's about it for changes on the
performance<00:02:28.739> side<00:02:28.829> everything<00:02:29.099> is<00:02:29.310> great

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609

I've<00:02:29.849> built<00:02:30.209> this<00:02:30.420> PC<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.500> edit<00:02:31.739> videos<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.069> a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
I've built this PC to edit videos and a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.369 
I've built this PC to edit videos and a
3-bit<00:02:32.670> job<00:02:32.819> pretty<00:02:33.060> well<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.900> CPU<00:02:34.319> is

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
3-bit job pretty well the CPU is

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.140 
3-bit job pretty well the CPU is
overclocked<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:34.980> 4<00:02:35.489> gigahertz<00:02:35.760> they'll

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
overclocked to 4 gigahertz they'll

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.699 
overclocked to 4 gigahertz they'll
probably<00:02:36.329> overclock<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.139> some<00:02:37.290> more<00:02:37.469> when<00:02:37.680> I

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
probably overclock it some more when I

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.649 
probably overclock it some more when I
stop<00:02:37.950> being<00:02:38.129> lazy<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.090> does<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.209> great<00:02:39.599> job

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
stop being lazy but it does a great job

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.409 
performance of say a 6 or 12 core
machine<00:02:43.709> but<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.549> still<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> vast<00:02:44.939> improvement

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:45.419 
machine but it still a vast improvement

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
don't do a ton of gaming on it but it

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.129 
don't do a ton of gaming on it but it
can<00:02:50.280> basically<00:02:50.639> play<00:02:51.120> any<00:02:51.419> game<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:51.989> would

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
can basically play any game that I would

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.559 
can basically play any game that I would
ever<00:02:52.260> wanted<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.739> on<00:02:53.730> max<00:02:54.030> settings<00:02:54.389> and<00:02:54.510> I'm

ever wanted to on max settings and I'm

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.440 
ever wanted to on max settings and I'm
using<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.870> 2560<00:02:55.680> by<00:02:55.799> 1440<00:02:56.310> monitor<00:02:56.969> so<00:02:57.239> that's

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
using a 2560 by 1440 monitor so that's

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.959 
using a 2560 by 1440 monitor so that's
pretty<00:02:57.750> good<00:02:58.069> so<00:02:59.069> overall<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.519> computer<00:02:59.909> is

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
pretty good so overall the computer is

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.369 
pretty good so overall the computer is
