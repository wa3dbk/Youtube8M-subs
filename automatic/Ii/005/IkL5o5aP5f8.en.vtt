00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.200
 I had a new life totally planned. 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.200
 When you finish the exam, close the booklet, 

00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:17.000
 Put it upside down and raise your hand. You can start 

00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:19.000
 Then when a door opens ... 

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:20.000
 Mr. Jankowski. 

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:21.400
 whatever plan he had vanished. 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.700
 Is there another family member to call? 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 No, it's just me. 

00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:33.000
 No home, no family ... forcing me not to look back. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 -Who is it, Earl? -A college student. 

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:43.000
 I'm just looking for work, sir. 

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:48.000
 Jacob Jankowski, I think, the veterinarian of the Benzini Brothers. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 If you do what I tell you, I will show you a life that the vast majority of these imbeciles can not even imagine. 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.000
 Who is the woman who works with the horses? 

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:03.800
 It's the boss's wife. She does not talk to anyone and you do not talk to her. 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.000
 All creatures need to know who is in charge, 

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:14.000
 You can feel when a man's power is complete ... and when it is not. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Everyone works until they can not do it anymore, nobody stops until August says it. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 You are a beautiful woman, you deserve a precious life. 

00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:28.000
 The star of the show, out there have nothing. 

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.000
 There is a better life that is for you. 

00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:33.000
 You should go. 

00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:35.000
 If someone just touches it ... 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.000
 I hate to think about that. 

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:41.000
 This year 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.000
 Do not follow me. Will kill you. It will. 

00:01:46.301 --> 00:01:48.000
 This is the plan? 

00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:50.000
 Do you leave me, for him? 

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.000
 August, please. 

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:52.000
 It means nothing to you ... 

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:54.000
 Tell me, to fire him. 

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.700
 A young man falling madly in love with a woman out of his reach. 

00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:02.000
 It has to be now. 

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:04.800
 What am I doing? 

00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:10.000
 You have broken my law, you have to pay the consequences. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Marlena! 

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:26.000
