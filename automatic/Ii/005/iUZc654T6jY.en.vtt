00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.370
 Hmm 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:12.110
 Nice to meet you, it is an open leader song 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.230
 The percussion charge is also good and the skill of the open needs charge 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.940
 Is good 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:23.300
 It is as Sato who is in charge of the open reel 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:24.620
 When it is paired with Gamba, who is in charge of the open reel, the open reel is originally that 40 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.320
 year ago 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.230
 If you get tired of the crane 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.730
 Listen 6 minutes 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.119
 Cassette tape will 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.920
 Edamame time 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.160
 Number who supported the previous era 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.200
 It is the world close now through the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.510
 It is from the original usage that registering and playing a woman is 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.950
 Ummm 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:53.000
 The mechanism that records the sound itself is exposed 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.910
 In fact really thinking with their own hands by touching it by hand 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.250
 Former husband 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.870
 Or rather this way 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.720
 It may distort the time axis of Uekura Uchi Este adults 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.270
 Attached 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.360
 It is the song that made this time 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.480
 Practice 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.220
 With the usual long gold 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.260
 Attari Masu in Mayuri 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:22.300
 Even though the finish comes in, it is part 2 with it 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:25.770
 What happens when the machine that reel-to-reel to the rotation 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.770
 After all it is using 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.930
 Let 's learn what is inseparable and let it be an ordinary instrument 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.320
 I'm doing my tongue 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.580
 In particular 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.240
 This launch is not so 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.600
 With balloons 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.080
 People who are news 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.410
 You should go far now 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.610
 Take another love or put in a balloon 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.980
 In contrast to this song 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.610
 I think that old words are fine 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.610
 Garlic 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.010
 I'm thinking of that open reel too 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.350
 The 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.460
 Control a lie or a smart 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.759
 In 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.710
 The thing itself is now 10 years ago 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.480
 That's it 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.620
 It is a place with the current planning 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.660
 Made outside of brown rice long before planning 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.360
 It is the song 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.710
 And has topped leak 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.710
 For example, it scratches on this project 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:33.180
 It's amazing, for example now 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:36.520
 Or the even Aizu of the universe that I want to say to the ancient people 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:43.930
 Using what is in Tokyo called fear 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:47.540
 I'm going to fly away so far and say that it's time to exchange that distance saying that I'm building and returning again 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.819
 It is until now towards the distant person of 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.880
 Exchange Suruga the messages that had been exchanged 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:59.610
 So new 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:03.460
 I want to tell people in Tokyo that I dare to go far 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:07.110
 I thought from now on that it is new and interesting 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.260
 Maybe more and more on the twitter Catalyst 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.349
 I do not feel the distance at the same time 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.250
 twitter festival Toka ustream because everyone is watching the relay of 2 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:19.790
 Is 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:24.890
 Dare for that Tteyuu are today your shame in the voice fly that distance 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:28.390
 Did not come strong and also to do so is not it it is it is not a certain distance in what th 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.390
 Re-identify the distance of things 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.940
 s bar of the project everyone's voice to the universe
