00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
smartphone ever right now at least I

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.240 
smartphone ever right now at least I
know<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.030> you're<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> Russian

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
know that you're like a Russian

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.410 
know that you're like a Russian
something<00:00:44.250> else<00:00:44.399> knows<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:44.879> gonna<00:00:45.090> come<00:00:45.360> out

something else knows it's gonna come out
soon<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> think<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.219> smaller

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
soon but I think was a little smaller

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.610 
soon but I think was a little smaller
but<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.510> thing<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.200> they<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.440> been

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
but the thing is that they have been

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.130 
but the thing is that they have been
selling<00:00:50.280> two<00:00:50.820> million<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.570> they're<00:00:51.690> focusing

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
selling two million and they're focusing

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.380 
selling two million and they're focusing
this<00:00:52.350> year<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.890> selling<00:00:53.340> 10<00:00:53.640> millions<00:00:54.030> that's

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
this year on selling 10 millions that's

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.060 
this year on selling 10 millions that's
another<00:00:54.660> eight<00:00:54.899> million<00:00:55.410> I'm<00:00:55.770> kind<00:00:56.010> of

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
another eight million I'm kind of

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.400 
another eight million I'm kind of
skeptical<00:00:56.399> too<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:57.059> they're<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> ship

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
skeptical too if they're going to ship

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.680 
skeptical too if they're going to ship
that<00:00:58.859> many<00:00:59.100> away<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.120> yeah<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.660> should

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690

people again
small<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.020> know<00:02:14.140> but<00:02:14.560> i<00:02:14.890> still<00:02:15.550> like<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:15.970> big

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
small you know but i still like it big

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.140 
small you know but i still like it big
and<00:02:16.390> they<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.770> know<00:02:17.800> untouched<00:02:18.340> in<00:02:18.580> big<00:02:18.850> hand

and they you know untouched in big hand
so<00:02:19.360> i<00:02:19.510> should<00:02:19.690> say<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.200> pretty<00:02:20.650> small

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.550 
so i should say that I pretty small
hands<00:02:21.400> but<00:02:21.580> still<00:02:21.850> think<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.300> mean<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:23.050> can<00:02:23.320> use

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
hands but still think I mean you can use

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.560 
hands but still think I mean you can use
this<00:02:23.770> as<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.100> foam<00:02:24.490> because<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.330> phone

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
this as a foam because it is the phone

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.410 
this as a foam because it is the phone
but<00:02:26.350> just<00:02:26.710> because<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.280> have<00:02:27.490> smaller<00:02:27.970> hands

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
but just because you have smaller hands

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.260 
but just because you have smaller hands
doesn't<00:02:28.810> mean<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.260> it's<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.680> tablet<00:02:30.270> ok

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
doesn't mean that it's a tablet ok

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.910 
doesn't mean that it's a tablet ok
because<00:02:31.780> tablets<00:02:32.440> or<00:02:32.710> 10<00:02:33.580> inch<00:02:33.960> 7-inch<00:02:34.960> ok

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920
