aspect of playing bass is knowing how to

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.520 
aspect of playing bass is knowing how to
read<00:00:11.910> rhythms<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.450> understand<00:00:12.929> rhythms<00:00:13.259> in

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
read rhythms and understand rhythms in

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.310 
read rhythms and understand rhythms in
different<00:00:14.460> contexts<00:00:14.849> let's<00:00:15.480> look<00:00:15.660> at<00:00:15.780> reading

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
different contexts let's look at reading

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.070 
different contexts let's look at reading
rhythm<00:00:16.590> on<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.980> bass<00:00:17.130> clef<00:00:17.930> using<00:00:18.930> notation

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
rhythm on the bass clef using notation

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.240 
rhythm on the bass clef using notation
so<00:00:22.080> here's<00:00:22.260> something<00:00:22.560> here's<00:00:22.740> an<00:00:22.890> example

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
so here's something here's an example

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.070 
so here's something here's an example
there's<00:00:23.609> four<00:00:24.150> measures<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.630> different

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
there's four measures of different

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.200 
there's four measures of different
rhythms<00:00:25.380> now<00:00:25.740> these<00:00:26.189> are<00:00:26.519> called<00:00:26.760> quarter

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
rhythms now these are called quarter

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.200 
rhythms now these are called quarter

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
in the line this will be a quarter note

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.720 
in the line this will be a quarter note
for<00:00:33.570> four<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.440> behind<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.040> bass<00:00:35.190> clef<00:00:35.460> sign

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
for four here behind the bass clef sign

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.700 
for four here behind the bass clef sign
or<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.870> front<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.140> bass<00:00:37.320> clef<00:00:37.530> sign

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.549 
or in front of the bass clef sign
indicates<00:00:38.640> four<00:00:39.120> beats<00:00:39.390> per<00:00:39.570> measure<00:00:40.020> measure

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
indicates four beats per measure measure

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.410 
indicates four beats per measure measure
will<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.950> broken<00:00:41.160> up<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.640> way<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.300> we'll

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
will be broken up in this way so we'll

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.420 
will be broken up in this way so we'll
count<00:00:42.600> one<00:00:42.989> two<00:00:43.620> three<00:00:44.399> four<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.660> two<00:00:46.230> three

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
count one two three four one two three

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.160 
count one two three four one two three
four<00:00:47.460> even<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.390> we're<00:00:48.539> only<00:00:48.600> playing<00:00:48.899> two

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
four even if we're only playing two

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.189 
four even if we're only playing two
beats<00:00:49.550> so<00:00:50.550> our<00:00:51.210> first<00:00:51.420> measure<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:51.930> will<00:00:52.079> be

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
beats so our first measure here will be

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.020 
beats so our first measure here will be
playing<00:00:53.010> open<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:54.000> two<00:00:54.870> three<00:00:55.640> four<00:00:56.640> try

one<00:01:02.219> two<00:01:02.969> three<00:01:03.930> four<00:01:05.090> here's<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> tablature

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
one two three four here's the tablature

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.969 
one two three four here's the tablature
the<00:01:06.869> tablature<00:01:07.200> will<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.560> give<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the tablature will not give you the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.679 
the tablature will not give you the
rhythm<00:01:08.130> that's<00:01:08.640> why<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.119> bass<00:01:09.240> clef<00:01:09.510> is

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
rhythm that's why it the bass clef is

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.370 
rhythm that's why it the bass clef is
very<00:01:09.869> important<00:01:11.240> similarly<00:01:12.240> here's<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> next

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
very important similarly here's the next

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.950 
very important similarly here's the next
slide<00:01:13.560> these<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.700> called<00:01:14.850> half<00:01:15.090> notes<00:01:15.390> where

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
slide these are called half notes where

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.570 
slide these are called half notes where
the<00:01:16.140> note<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.830> filled<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:17.400> there's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the note is not filled in but there's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.179 
the note is not filled in but there's
still<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.820> stem<00:01:18.150> they<00:01:18.780> take<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.400> two<00:01:20.400> beats<00:01:20.670> per

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
still a stem they take up two beats per

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.100 
still a stem they take up two beats per
/<00:01:23.189> they're<00:01:23.820> playing<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.509> would<00:01:24.659> be<00:01:24.750> one

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
/ they're playing so this would be one

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.260 
/ they're playing so this would be one
two<00:01:25.979> three<00:01:26.900> four<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.400> pluck<00:01:29.729> only<00:01:30.030> once

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
two three four so you pluck only once

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.480 
two three four so you pluck only once
but<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.630> count<00:01:30.900> two<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.070> twice<00:01:32.430> as

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
but you count two so this is twice as

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.060 
but you count two so this is twice as
long<00:01:32.759> as<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> quarter<00:01:33.329> note<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.920> have

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
long as a quarter note you can have

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.740 
long as a quarter note you can have
quarter<00:01:35.520> notes<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.820> half<00:01:36.270> notes<00:01:36.450> in

one two three four now you may end this

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.120 
one two three four now you may end this
song<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> whole<00:01:53.040> note<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.549> whole<00:01:54.299> note<00:01:55.130> will

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
song with a whole note a whole note will

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.340 
song with a whole note a whole note will
have<00:01:56.280> no<00:01:56.520> stem<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.210> not<00:01:57.540> be<00:01:57.689> filled<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.110> at<00:01:58.229> all

have no stem and not be filled in at all

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.319 
have no stem and not be filled in at all
this<00:01:59.189> will<00:01:59.430> count<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.670> four<00:02:00.000> beats<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.670> this

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
this will count for four beats so this

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.310 
this will count for four beats so this
will<00:02:03.479> be<00:02:03.600> one<00:02:03.930> two<00:02:04.680> three<00:02:05.060> four

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
will be one two three four

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.620 
will be one two three four
so<00:02:06.680> try<00:02:06.920> playing<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.370> pattern<00:02:07.730> like<00:02:07.880> this<00:02:08.149> using

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
so try playing a pattern like this using

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.450 
so try playing a pattern like this using
quarter<00:02:09.110> notes<00:02:09.290> and<00:02:09.440> half<00:02:09.680> notes<00:02:09.979> because

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
quarter notes and half notes because
