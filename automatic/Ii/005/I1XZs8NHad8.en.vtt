00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
lot of this stuff both in performance

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.550 
lot of this stuff both in performance
and<00:00:17.070> concepts<00:00:17.640> we've<00:00:17.820> got<00:00:17.939> triads<00:00:18.570> over<00:00:19.529> a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
and concepts we've got triads over a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:29.420 
and concepts we've got triads over a
pedal<00:00:20.570> there's<00:00:21.570> an<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.170> triad<00:00:23.480> G<00:00:24.980> D<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:28.430> and

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
pedal there's an a a triad G D a and

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.030 
pedal there's an a a triad G D a and
then<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.000> second<00:00:30.390> repetition<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.519> G

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
then the second repetition it's a G

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.460 
then the second repetition it's a G
right<00:00:35.040> seventh<00:00:35.760> fret<00:00:36.000> G<00:00:36.630> shape<00:00:36.900> D

okay and those are like a lot of

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.800 
okay and those are like a lot of
syncopations<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:44.120> important<00:00:44.630> thing<00:00:44.780> to

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
syncopations and the important thing to

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.570 
syncopations and the important thing to
notice<00:00:45.140> is<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.380> lot<00:00:45.500> of<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:45.950> time<00:00:46.190> what's

when we get done one other thing that
happens<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:24.880> there<00:02:25.060> there's<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.510> little<00:02:25.660> lick

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
happens in there there's a little lick

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.900 
happens in there there's a little lick
in<00:02:26.290> between<00:02:26.680> each<00:02:27.010> turn<00:02:27.310> around<00:02:27.610> we<00:02:27.700> have<00:02:27.819> this

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
in between each turn around we have this

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.820 
in between each turn around we have this
little<00:02:28.350> let's<00:02:29.350> just<00:02:29.620> pull<00:02:29.860> off<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:32.739> know

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
little let's just pull off and you know

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.530 
little let's just pull off and you know
you<00:02:32.890> throwing<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.370> lick<00:02:33.580> in<00:02:33.790> your<00:02:34.030> rhythm<00:02:34.180> part

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
you throwing a lick in your rhythm part

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.840 
you throwing a lick in your rhythm part
and<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:35.470> just<00:02:35.709> it<00:02:35.950> just<00:02:35.980> adds<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.459> little<00:02:36.640> bit<00:02:36.730> of

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
and it just it just adds a little bit of

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:56.590 
and it just it just adds a little bit of
interest<00:02:37.300> right<00:02:37.510> so

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.510 

okay<00:02:57.600> one<00:02:58.080> other<00:02:58.110> thing<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.560> notice<00:02:58.800> is<00:02:59.010> this<00:02:59.190> D

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
okay one other thing to notice is this D

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.070 
okay one other thing to notice is this D
chord<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.030> held<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.480> know<00:03:00.540> some<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:00.960> the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
chord is held you know some of the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.690 
chord is held you know some of the
chords<00:03:01.320> are<00:03:01.440> held<00:03:01.680> longer<00:03:02.100> than<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.460> others

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
chords are held longer than the others

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.760 
chords are held longer than the others
so<00:03:02.970> again<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.630> know<00:03:03.750> it's<00:03:03.960> how<00:03:04.260> do<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:04.530> create

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
so again you know it's how do you create

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.440 
so again you know it's how do you create
the<00:03:04.950> negative<00:03:05.340> space<00:03:05.610> how<00:03:05.880> long<00:03:06.060> do<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.180> hold

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
the negative space how long do you hold

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.480 
the negative space how long do you hold
the<00:03:06.630> chord<00:03:06.930> when<00:03:07.650> do<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:07.830> choke<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.250> chord

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
the chord when do you choke the chord

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.330 
the chord when do you choke the chord
it's<00:03:08.940> really<00:03:09.210> important<00:03:09.830> then<00:03:10.830> we<00:03:10.950> move<00:03:11.130> up<00:03:11.280> to

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
it's really important then we move up to

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:21.830 
it's really important then we move up to
a<00:03:11.580> D<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:18.950> in<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.100> case<00:03:20.340> I'm<00:03:20.550> just<00:03:20.610> moving<00:03:21.240> the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
a D and in this case I'm just moving the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.880 
a D and in this case I'm just moving the
major<00:03:22.170> shape<00:03:22.650> up<00:03:23.360> against<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.450> court<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:24.960> you

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
major shape up against the court and you

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.660 
major shape up against the court and you
know<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.190> total<00:03:26.970> prog<00:03:27.300> rock<00:03:27.330> technique<00:03:28.670> you

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
know it's total prog rock technique you

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.800 
know it's total prog rock technique you
hear<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.030> everywhere

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
hear it everywhere

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.860 
hear it everywhere
and<00:03:31.590> it's<00:03:31.770> just<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.370> know<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.240> first<00:03:33.690> it

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
and it's just you know the it first it

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.490 
and it's just you know the it first it
sounds<00:03:34.200> Lydian<00:03:36.050> because<00:03:37.050> you<00:03:37.200> got<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.470> e

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
sounds Lydian because you got the e

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.210 
sounds Lydian because you got the e
shape<00:03:38.100> as<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.550> G<00:03:38.730> sharp<00:03:38.760> over<00:03:39.270> the<00:03:39.360> D

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
shape as the G sharp over the D

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.610 
shape as the G sharp over the D
then<00:03:41.940> suddenly<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.390> sounds<00:03:42.690> like<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.840> minor<00:03:43.170> 7

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
then suddenly it sounds like a minor 7

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.000 
then suddenly it sounds like a minor 7
chord<00:03:43.650> because<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.310> f<00:03:44.460> /<00:03:45.030> d

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
chord because the f / d

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.640 
chord because the f / d
sounds<00:03:47.370> like<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.520> D<00:03:47.760> minor<00:03:48.030> 7<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.780> then<00:03:49.470> you're

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
sounds like a D minor 7 and then you're

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.760 
sounds like a D minor 7 and then you're
back<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:49.860> major

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
back to major

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
back to major
you<00:03:52.130> have<00:03:52.490> the<00:03:52.640> G<00:03:52.910> over<00:03:53.270> the<00:03:53.360> D<00:03:53.600> so<00:03:54.290> d<00:03:54.800> e<00:03:56.590> f<00:03:57.790> over

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
you have the G over the D so d e f over

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.080 
you have the G over the D so d e f over
D

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
D

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.440 
D
and<00:04:00.239> then<00:04:01.200> G<00:04:01.410> or<00:04:01.530> D<00:04:01.880> I'm<00:04:02.880> holding<00:04:03.300> them<00:04:03.390> a

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
and then G or D I'm holding them a

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:12.559 
and then G or D I'm holding them a
little<00:04:03.720> longer<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:10.650> then<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.390> the

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
little longer and then and and the

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.819 
little longer and then and and the
bottom<00:04:13.200> part<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.410> straight<00:04:13.890> eighths<00:04:15.829> no

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
bottom part is straight eighths no

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:36.880 
bottom part is straight eighths no
gallop

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.560 

so<00:04:37.890> that's<00:04:38.580> it

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
so that's it

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.030 
so that's it
it's<00:04:39.990> a<00:04:40.080> good<00:04:40.200> one<00:04:40.290> to<00:04:40.410> get<00:04:40.530> down<00:04:40.710> remember

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
it's a good one to get down remember

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.860 
it's a good one to get down remember
you're<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.490> machine<00:04:41.850> on<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.270> one<00:04:42.540> you<00:04:42.690> got

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
you're the machine on this one you got

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.570 
you're the machine on this one you got
to<00:04:42.900> provide<00:04:43.530> that<00:04:43.770> gallop<00:04:44.130> with<00:04:44.160> your<00:04:44.400> right
