00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Halli hello and welcome 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.040
 his fashion show today from samson 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:11.190
 pg 227 slurry is almost 27,000 liters 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.590
 right here in the shop is displayed 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.529
 from kyoto here forge the logo of 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.250
 Kyoto and a nice picture of samsung 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.130
 pg 227 for 78.000 euro available 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.910
 require 200 ps with minimal power 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.779
 from the tractor and still costs us 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.550
 the manure barrel stood at 102 euros per day 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.640
 description still mentioned otherwise 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.790
 everything OK 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.239
 we go to the samsung where is that 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.680
 lok where is the error the try the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.379
 question is there is a mistake 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.149
 I hope we have not already there 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.550
 which is okay here is the beta above 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.410
 samson pg top line error-free 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.870
 that's how it should be 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.370
 texture moderately was really madness finally 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.100
 Write here from here no 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.799
 mad confusion to recognize 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.070
 were made there were hints 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.840
 warning labels madness technically 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.520
 probably even believe that 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.670
 I still moore on it really cool 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.950
 made complete texture is really 1a 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.890
 the hoses here in front of the whole 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.090
 connections what else is there 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.520
 finesses the number warnings the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.200
 really very high resolution and are 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.530
 also the texture of grill what is so 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.700
 perfect if the position lights 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.840
 I do not know then 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.939
 madness brutal so people we 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.079
 have a contender here again 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.880
 full five star mature are horny 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.680
 look similar to those of the tsunami 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.159
 maybe a bit smaller 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.060
 taken from the 115 are the fenders 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.009
 also good and back but even more 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.409
 a light and work lights na 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.799
 that's normal super as well as blinkers 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.450
 and other things here is just back 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.149
 the problem now have a problem and 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.590
 Although you would need back here actually 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.450
 either the tow hose or one 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.380
 global group glencore try that 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.869
 could work 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.160
 Unfortunately, I find here in the pack no 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.780
 schlepp hose while also a 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.069
 picture is displayed one i know it 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.659
 Not 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.659
 the extra download or is it the 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.209
 extra as a mod if so I have that well 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.650
 distributed and scheduled 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.719
 I would like to test it anyway 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.010
 it is full 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.930
 I do not think so now 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.849
 can penetrate immediately 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.159
 but we probably still have to 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.290
 the normal original manure pit to 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:37.209
 buy because otherwise I would not know what 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.459
 we should still buy there we have here 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.980
 Only the slurry tanker then we buy ourselves 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.349
 but sometimes simply a standard 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.239
 slurry pit maybe works with 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.769
 that would be good we have 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.760
 In 2006 we can work with them 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.060
 I think I drive forever 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.180
 I can give it a try 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.519
 turn on 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.370
 It would be functions of the sound though 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.719
 we have no function directly we 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.099
 test briefly on the field 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:02.859
 works if it brings nothing 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:07.609
 if you do not fill any 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:08.829
 animation there is only the sound it comes 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.689
 does not work in itself 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:15.469
 All-round lights are functions 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:17.239
 work wonderful left ideas 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:20.389
 really horny out of madness here you have 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.750
 really worked exactly and that 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:25.849
 light as well now also slow down 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.750
 brake light that in vechta really looks 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.970
 out so madness in any case 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.169
 Great, we switch all the light 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.370
 was by otherwise there is yes 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.470
 not many options are available 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.389
 are simply functions only turn 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.909
 know a short test with the motto oh 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.849
 I nevertheless spread of course there 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:47.150
 functions left mouse button up left 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:56.989
 mouse button right mouse button up and 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:58.430
 down okay so we have the yes here 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.500
 what is that really nothing else 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.109
 as that here the manure a point 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.879
 normally we can turn right here 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:09.739
 go down and out so you can 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.620
 it is also the hammer madness that 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.319
 works really great there is quite 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.139
 nice that we are against this here 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.969
 madness that's what this poor one is here 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.610
 brutal the chambers for a long time 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:25.279
 extend and so we really have 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.540
 much working with axle can here so 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:29.240
 go down except save 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.240
 The grade looks like a cannon 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.090
 with the futuristic game on everyone 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.740
 case is the function dar 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.880
 if it now makes a meaningful whether we 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.020
 can also use is the other 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.860
 ask but it is definitely 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.180
 This is already extremely cool 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.530
 and the question is now only 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.690
 how we manage that now 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.170
 It is actually possible to drive slurry 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.610
 The only question I want to say problem 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.190
 was to hang back here then 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:00.560
 could that work, i hope 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.960
 at least steering axles are also available 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.370
 first and third 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.290
 usually that was when I was 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.080
 Blink in the position lights 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.580
 a page does not have to work 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.810
 They also do not really have to be honest 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.850
 not but i would have been happy if 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.020
 because now we have what we have 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.330
 You can definitely look over 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.130
 Attach that works I do not know 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.650
 whether idyll been murdered group are 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.790
 that is the question 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.290
 ie for example have twelve meter 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.130
 I think so, what is there then 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.990
 you could do this for example 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.280
 however, they reinstall the question 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.280
 thought reality but no matter 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.930
 does work and automatically if 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.680
 We can drive many down here 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.710
 you can see it here too 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.790
 we have good texture because we can too 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.190
 It also looks good here 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.830
 better again and the crew has on 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.090
 definitely work it does in 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.100
 Of course, tow would still be one 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.080
 So I'm just wondering here 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.030
 where is the drag but you have to 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.530
 download it separately or should 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.240
 which is actually impact that is 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.190
 just the only question otherwise there is 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.540
 of me here is five stars 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.240
 There is no tow here 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.230
 no deduction it is a pity 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.610
 view the manure tank can but then 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.830
 it does not matter if you work 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.510
 can grow a hose if so 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.430
 one is for download 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.380
 about the size then you look 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.290
 just as little manure pit at the back 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.640
 with this hack hydraulics and works 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.780
 then this and then the thing would have 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.430
 Actually, we just have to fit 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.650
 a top functional cool we summarize 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.910
 not just a working width otherwise 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.920
 works here only the first 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.780
 Mine pit is also ok for the 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.030
 The like small groups want otherwise 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.540
 five star people I'm out making 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.540
 Hello
