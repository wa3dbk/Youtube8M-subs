um<00:01:39.500> now<00:01:40.500> from<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.979> test<00:01:41.509> which<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.540> not

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
um now from this test which is not

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.280 
um now from this test which is not
completely<00:01:45.000> accurate<00:01:47.330> but<00:01:48.330> from<00:01:48.570> what<00:01:48.840> we

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
completely accurate but from what we

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.340 
completely accurate but from what we
have<00:01:49.440> to<00:01:49.560> go<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:51.479> Mavericks<00:01:51.930> started

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
have to go on here the Mavericks started

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.010 
have to go on here the Mavericks started
out<00:01:52.470> pretty<00:01:52.710> good<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.490> clear<00:01:53.850> ones<00:01:54.119> did<00:01:54.840> not

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
out pretty good the clear ones did not

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.740 
out pretty good the clear ones did not
seem<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.880> perform<00:01:56.880> as<00:01:57.149> well<00:01:58.700> but<00:01:59.700> uh<00:01:59.759> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
seem to perform as well but uh the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.529 
seem to perform as well but uh the
whiteout<00:02:00.990> series<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:02.420> definitely<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
whiteout series is definitely the

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.820 
whiteout series is definitely the
performer<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.770> best<00:02:05.039> of<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.399> bunch<00:02:06.830> to

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
performer and the best of the bunch to

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.969 
performer and the best of the bunch to
get<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> really<00:02:08.940> complete<00:02:09.539> accurate<00:02:10.350> reading<00:02:10.800> I

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
get a really complete accurate reading I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.449 
get a really complete accurate reading I
would<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.340> needed<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:12.440> place<00:02:13.440> each<00:02:13.680> maverick

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
would have needed to place each maverick

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.640 
would have needed to place each maverick
in<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.819> same<00:02:15.090> exact<00:02:15.569> spot<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:16.200> shoot<00:02:16.410> them

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
in the same exact spot to shoot them

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.030 
in the same exact spot to shoot them
which<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.220> didn't<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.090> ranges<00:02:18.480> may<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:19.040> off

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
which I didn't so the ranges may be off

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.229 
which I didn't so the ranges may be off
a<00:02:20.100> little<00:02:20.400> but<00:02:21.830> from<00:02:22.830> what<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.130> got<00:02:23.310> there<00:02:24.090> you

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
a little but from what you got there you

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.320 
a little but from what you got there you
have<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.110> clearly<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.880> best<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.209> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
have it this is clearly the best of the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.780 
have it this is clearly the best of the
Mavericks
