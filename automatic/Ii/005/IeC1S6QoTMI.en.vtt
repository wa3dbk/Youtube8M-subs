00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.590 
quick video on my hairstyle I know a lot
of<00:00:11.230> you<00:00:11.440> guys<00:00:11.710> asked<00:00:12.490> what<00:00:13.299> the<00:00:13.420> cut<00:00:13.629> was<00:00:13.840> and

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
of you guys asked what the cut was and

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.870 
of you guys asked what the cut was and
the<00:00:16.600> color<00:00:16.840> and<00:00:17.230> the<00:00:17.320> technique<00:00:17.740> and<00:00:18.010> stuff

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
the color and the technique and stuff

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.920 
the color and the technique and stuff
like<00:00:19.000> that<00:00:19.180> so<00:00:19.930> um<00:00:20.350> this<00:00:21.220> is<00:00:21.520> basically<00:00:22.330> a<00:00:22.450> long

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
like that so um this is basically a long

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.880 
like that so um this is basically a long
a<00:00:23.380> line<00:00:23.830> or<00:00:24.280> a<00:00:24.310> long<00:00:24.640> bob<00:00:24.880> I<00:00:25.210> guess<00:00:25.770> but<00:00:26.770> it

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
a line or a long bob I guess but it

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.220 
a line or a long bob I guess but it
definitely<00:00:27.040> is<00:00:27.430> a<00:00:28.030> lot<00:00:28.630> shorter<00:00:28.840> in<00:00:29.110> the<00:00:29.140> back

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:49.179 
this is really dark up here this is my

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.619 
this is really dark up here this is my
natural<00:00:49.980> brown<00:00:50.980> dark<00:00:51.370> brown<00:00:51.460> hair<00:00:52.030> color<00:00:52.329> and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
then the bottom is just lightened I

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.329 
then the bottom is just lightened I
think<00:00:57.609> she<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:58.479> think<00:00:58.719> the<00:00:59.679> girl<00:00:59.890> that<00:01:00.039> I<00:01:00.069> went

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
think she I think the girl that I went

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.130 
think she I think the girl that I went
to<00:01:00.579> did<00:01:00.909> like<00:01:01.120> a<00:01:01.979> 20<00:01:02.979> volume<00:01:03.729> I<00:01:04.030> think<00:01:04.809> she<00:01:05.019> did

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
to did like a 20 volume I think she did

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.270 
to did like a 20 volume I think she did
a<00:01:05.199> 20<00:01:05.470> volume<00:01:05.830> lift<00:01:06.729> on<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.060> bottom<00:01:08.040> she<00:01:09.040> did

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
a 20 volume lift on the bottom she did

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.580 
a 20 volume lift on the bottom she did
the<00:01:09.869> ombre<00:01:10.869> technique<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:13.259> think<00:01:14.259> it<00:01:14.380> was<00:01:14.500> the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
the ombre technique I think it was the

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.370 
the ombre technique I think it was the
ombre<00:01:14.860> technique<00:01:15.070> it<00:01:15.490> was<00:01:15.670> where<00:01:15.850> she<00:01:16.380> teased

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
ombre technique it was where she teased

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.120 
ombre technique it was where she teased
the<00:01:17.590> hair<00:01:17.619> up<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:17.950> then<00:01:19.170> foiled<00:01:20.170> all<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.950> hair

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
the hair up and then foiled all the hair

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.620 
the hair up and then foiled all the hair
with<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:22.740> bleach<00:01:23.740> or<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.390> Meitner<00:01:25.390> or

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
with the bleach or the Meitner or

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.580 
with the bleach or the Meitner or
whatever<00:01:25.899> um<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:27.490> then<00:01:28.420> she<00:01:28.869> toned<00:01:29.289> it<00:01:29.560> down

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
whatever um but then she toned it down

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.599 
whatever um but then she toned it down
to<00:01:30.490> be<00:01:30.640> like<00:01:30.789> a<00:01:30.820> caramel<00:01:31.390> color<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:33.579> I

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
to be like a caramel color but I

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.539 
to be like a caramel color but I
definitely<00:01:33.880> do<00:01:34.420> see<00:01:34.689> that<00:01:34.960> it's<00:01:35.549> turning

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
definitely do see that it's turning

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.550 
definitely do see that it's turning
orange<00:01:36.939> II<00:01:37.299> kind<00:01:37.600> of<00:01:37.719> but<00:01:38.049> I<00:01:38.079> think<00:01:38.229> that's

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
orange II kind of but I think that's

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.440 
orange II kind of but I think that's
just<00:01:38.649> cause<00:01:38.859> of<00:01:38.890> my<00:01:39.130> natural<00:01:39.579> undertones<00:01:40.270> on

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
just cause of my natural undertones on

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.920 
just cause of my natural undertones on
my<00:01:40.570> hair<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.979> does<00:01:42.219> have<00:01:42.490> some<00:01:43.119> orange

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
my hair it does have some orange

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.260 
my hair it does have some orange
undertones<00:01:44.649> so<00:01:44.890> I<00:01:45.070> have<00:01:45.430> been<00:01:46.200> toning<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.380> with

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
undertones so I have been toning it with

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.910 
undertones so I have been toning it with
my<00:01:49.270> own<00:01:49.390> little<00:01:49.539> mixture<00:01:50.049> of<00:01:50.259> toner<00:01:50.649> which

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
my own little mixture of toner which

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.190 
my own little mixture of toner which
I'll<00:01:51.219> probably<00:01:51.369> make<00:01:51.759> another<00:01:51.820> video<00:01:52.270> on<00:01:52.390> for

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200
