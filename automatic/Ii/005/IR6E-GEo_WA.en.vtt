00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
what is up everybody uses a drab and in

what is up everybody uses a drab and in
this<00:00:03.689> video<00:00:03.870> I'm<00:00:04.290> going<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.770> be<00:00:04.859> counting<00:00:05.220> down

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
this video I'm going to be counting down

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.000 
this video I'm going to be counting down
my<00:00:05.700> top<00:00:05.759> five<00:00:06.390> training<00:00:06.990> spots<00:00:07.290> in<00:00:07.529> call<00:00:07.980> of

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
my top five training spots in call of

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.970 
my top five training spots in call of
duty<00:00:08.189> zombies<00:00:08.510> now<00:00:09.510> in<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:09.960> video<00:00:10.260> I'm<00:00:10.500> only

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
duty zombies now in this video I'm only

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.100 
duty zombies now in this video I'm only
counting<00:00:11.340> something<00:00:11.969> as<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> training<00:00:12.540> spot<00:00:12.870> if

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
counting something as a training spot if

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.090 
counting something as a training spot if
it<00:00:13.620> exists<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.549> one<00:00:15.030> viable<00:00:15.540> area<00:00:16.289> meaning

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
it exists in one viable area meaning

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.060 
it exists in one viable area meaning
trains<00:00:17.820> like<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.240> ones<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.720> derice<00:00:19.410> do<00:00:19.800> not

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
trains like the ones on derice do not

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.160 
trains like the ones on derice do not
count<00:00:20.490> because<00:00:21.180> you're<00:00:21.390> running<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.810> kind<00:00:22.080> of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
count because you're running it kind of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.349 
count because you're running it kind of
all<00:00:22.380> around<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.890> map<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.760> don't<00:00:23.970> really

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
all around the map and I don't really

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.269 
all around the map and I don't really
think<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.720> counts<00:00:24.960> as<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.230> training<00:00:25.650> area<00:00:25.949> so

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
think that counts as a training area so

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.279 
think that counts as a training area so
we're<00:00:26.430> only<00:00:26.609> talking<00:00:26.970> about<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.750> confined

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
we're only talking about the confined

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.279 
we're only talking about the confined
spaces<00:00:28.710> where<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.220> run<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.699> train<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.810> starting

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
spaces where you run a train so starting

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.709 
spaces where you run a train so starting
off<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.710> list<00:00:32.009> at<00:00:32.219> number<00:00:32.489> five<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
off this list at number five we have the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.380 
off this list at number five we have the
base<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.530> lighthouse<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:35.399> call<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
base of the lighthouse on call of the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.720 
base of the lighthouse on call of the
dead<00:00:36.660> now<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.469> biggest<00:00:37.800> factor<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.579> this

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
dead now the biggest factor to this

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.229 
dead now the biggest factor to this
train<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> ak-74<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.370> right<00:00:42.030> on

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
train is that the ak-74 you is right on

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.030 
train is that the ak-74 you is right on
the<00:00:42.390> wall<00:00:42.600> next<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.079> where<00:00:43.290> your<00:00:43.500> training

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the wall next to where your training

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.760 
the wall next to where your training
this<00:00:44.640> actually<00:00:45.120> makes<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> spot<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
this actually makes the spot one of the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.889 
this actually makes the spot one of the
best<00:00:47.190> early<00:00:47.640> game<00:00:47.850> training<00:00:48.210> areas<00:00:48.690> in

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
best early game training areas in

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.529 
best early game training areas in
zombies<00:00:49.829> mainly<00:00:50.700> because<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.329> easily

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
zombies mainly because you can easily

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.290 
zombies mainly because you can easily

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
points with the ak-74 you you can even

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.450 
points with the ak-74 you you can even
pack<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> punch<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.320> later<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.100> give

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
Call of the Dead you have George coming

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.230 
Call of the Dead you have George coming
after<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.650> at<00:01:07.799> all<00:01:07.950> times<00:01:08.250> another<00:01:09.000> good

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
after you at all times another good

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.030 
after you at all times another good
thing<00:01:09.270> about<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.900> training<00:01:10.350> area<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.799> that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
thing about this training area is that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.130 
thing about this training area is that
there's<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.369> little<00:01:11.790> pool<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.330> water<00:01:12.600> right

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
there's a little pool of water right

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.410 
there's a little pool of water right
next<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.070> if<00:01:14.250> George<00:01:14.580> ever<00:01:14.850> gets<00:01:15.119> pissed

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
next to it so if George ever gets pissed

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.450 
next to it so if George ever gets pissed
off<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:15.900> whatever<00:01:16.170> reason<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:17.009> simply

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
off for whatever reason you can simply

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.399 
off for whatever reason you can simply
run<00:01:17.610> into<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> water<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.509> let<00:01:18.810> him<00:01:19.020> cool<00:01:19.350> down

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
run into the water and let him cool down

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.310 
run into the water and let him cool down
the<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.610> drawback<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.509> area<00:01:21.840> though<00:01:22.140> is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the one drawback to this area though is

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.620 
the one drawback to this area though is
that<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.070> get<00:01:23.250> caught<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:23.759> cornered<00:01:24.479> on

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
that if you get caught or cornered on

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.899 
that if you get caught or cornered on
the<00:01:24.720> far<00:01:25.409> side<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.009> train<00:01:26.340> there's

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the far side of this train there's

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.210 
the far side of this train there's
really<00:01:27.180> no<00:01:27.540> way<00:01:27.570> out<00:01:28.049> there's<00:01:28.500> only<00:01:28.710> three

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
really no way out there's only three

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.550 
really no way out there's only three
ways<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.610> exit<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.270> training<00:01:30.689> area<00:01:30.990> none<00:01:31.530> of

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
ways to exit this training area none of

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.310 
ways to exit this training area none of
them<00:01:31.710> found<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> far<00:01:32.670> side<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:34.049> easy

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
them found on the far side so it's easy

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.649 
them found on the far side so it's easy
to<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.619> caught<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.189> go<00:01:35.250> down<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.030> not<00:01:36.390> really

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
to get caught and go down and not really

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.289 
to get caught and go down and not really
have<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> chance<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.409> get<00:01:37.530> out<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.860> there<00:01:38.009> and

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
have a chance to get out of there and

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.810 
have a chance to get out of there and
number<00:01:39.299> four<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.500> stage<00:01:40.829> from<00:01:41.340> Kino

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
number four we have the stage from Kino

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.600 
number four we have the stage from Kino
now<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> lot<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.439> train<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.979> call<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
now a lot like the train on call of the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.359 
now a lot like the train on call of the
dead<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:45.450> once<00:01:45.720> again<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.560> wall<00:01:46.920> weapon

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
dead we once again have a wall weapon

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.700 
dead we once again have a wall weapon
that<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.909> great<00:01:48.270> for<00:01:48.540> building<00:01:48.750> points<00:01:49.350> early

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
that is great for building points early

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.980 
that is great for building points early
on<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.610> really<00:01:50.939> good<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.420> clearing<00:01:51.869> out

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
on and is really good for clearing out

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.020 
on and is really good for clearing out
zombies<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> mid<00:01:52.950> rounds<00:01:53.340> once<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.880> gets

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
zombies in the mid rounds once it gets

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.749 
zombies in the mid rounds once it gets
pack<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> punched<00:01:54.810> now<00:01:55.380> instead<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.070> AK<00:01:56.520> we

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
pack a punched now instead of the AK we

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.840 
pack a punched now instead of the AK we
have<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> m16<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.159> admittedly<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.549> not

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
have the m16 and admittedly it's not

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.999 
have the m16 and admittedly it's not
quite<00:02:00.000> as<00:02:00.479> good<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> AK<00:02:01.380> off<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.799> bat

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
quite as good as the AK off the bat

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.520 
quite as good as the AK off the bat
mainly<00:02:02.850> because<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.630> three<00:02:03.930> round<00:02:04.140> burst

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
mainly because it's a three round burst

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.639 
mainly because it's a three round burst
instead<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.579> fully<00:02:05.850> automatic<00:02:06.329> gun<00:02:06.689> however

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
instead of a fully automatic gun however

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.550 
instead of a fully automatic gun however
in<00:02:07.950> my<00:02:08.190> opinion<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:09.119> skull<00:02:09.420> crusher<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:10.200> pack

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
in my opinion the skull crusher the pack

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.190 
in my opinion the skull crusher the pack
a<00:02:10.590> punch<00:02:10.890> version<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.670> m16<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.480> much

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
a punch version of the m16 is much

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.940 
a punch version of the m16 is much
better<00:02:13.500> than<00:02:13.680> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
better than the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.910 
better than the
pack<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.069> punched<00:02:14.520> AK<00:02:15.060> mainly<00:02:15.959> because<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.620> has

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
pack a punched AK mainly because it has

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.369 
pack a punched AK mainly because it has
more<00:02:17.280> ammo<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.450> grenade<00:02:18.930> launcher

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
more ammo and a grenade launcher

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.949 
more ammo and a grenade launcher
attachment<00:02:19.950> now<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.400> train<00:02:20.849> itself<00:02:21.090> may<00:02:21.720> be<00:02:21.780> a

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
attachment now the train itself may be a

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.160 
attachment now the train itself may be a
bit<00:02:22.260> harder<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.769> run<00:02:23.129> on<00:02:23.310> kino<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.840> get<00:02:25.110> a

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
bit harder to run on kino but you get a

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.290 
bit harder to run on kino but you get a
turret<00:02:25.769> which<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.160> can<00:02:26.310> activate<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:27.120> it

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
turret which you can activate and it

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.479 
turret which you can activate and it
mows<00:02:27.810> through<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.290> zombies<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:29.310> have<00:02:29.400> a

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
mows through the zombies you have a

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.160 
mows through the zombies you have a
teleporter<00:02:30.120> which<00:02:30.269> makes<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.750> completely

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
teleporter which makes you completely

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.710 
teleporter which makes you completely
invulnerable<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.430> act<00:02:32.700> as<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.030> really<00:02:33.480> good

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
invulnerable and act as a really good

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.229 
invulnerable and act as a really good
escape<00:02:34.170> route<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:35.430> have<00:02:35.550> an<00:02:35.670> extremely

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
escape route and you have an extremely

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.960 
escape route and you have an extremely
powerful<00:02:36.660> wonder<00:02:37.349> weapon<00:02:37.709> in<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.370> thundergun

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
powerful wonder weapon in the thundergun

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.479 
powerful wonder weapon in the thundergun
so<00:02:39.569> all<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.049> all<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.560> train<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> lot<00:02:41.250> easier

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
so all in all this train is a lot easier

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.059 
so all in all this train is a lot easier
and<00:02:41.940> can<00:02:42.660> get<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.170> those<00:02:43.319> high<00:02:43.590> rounds

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069

run around and hope for the best and

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.449 
run around and hope for the best and
usually<00:04:09.480> it'll<00:04:09.660> turn<00:04:09.900> out<00:04:09.959> okay<00:04:10.139> just<00:04:11.099> because

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
usually it'll turn out okay just because

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.059 
usually it'll turn out okay just because
you<00:04:12.030> have<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:12.419> much<00:04:12.599> free<00:04:13.109> space<00:04:13.319> on<00:04:13.799> this

in<00:05:05.310> zombies<00:05:05.880> I'm<00:05:06.090> going<00:05:06.960> with<00:05:07.139> the<00:05:07.289> Buddha

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
in zombies I'm going with the Buddha

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.879 
in zombies I'm going with the Buddha
room<00:05:07.919> for<00:05:08.490> die<00:05:08.699> rise<00:05:09.060> now<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:10.050> lot<00:05:10.350> of<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:10.710> are

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
room for die rise now a lot of you are

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.740 
room for die rise now a lot of you are
going<00:05:11.160> to<00:05:11.310> say<00:05:11.490> that<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:11.940> lander<00:05:12.330> station

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
going to say that the lander station

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.570 
going to say that the lander station
from<00:05:12.960> ascension<00:05:13.320> deserves<00:05:13.919> the<00:05:14.130> number<00:05:14.430> one

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
from ascension deserves the number one

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.270 
from ascension deserves the number one
spot<00:05:14.760> and<00:05:15.210> I<00:05:15.539> could<00:05:15.930> see<00:05:16.199> a<00:05:16.229> case<00:05:16.680> being<00:05:16.979> made

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
spot and I could see a case being made

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.090 
spot and I could see a case being made
for<00:05:17.490> that<00:05:17.699> both<00:05:18.240> training<00:05:19.050> areas<00:05:19.380> are<00:05:19.620> really

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
for that both training areas are really

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.400 
for that both training areas are really
good<00:05:20.310> and<00:05:20.490> make<00:05:20.820> their<00:05:21.030> maps<00:05:21.330> pretty<00:05:22.110> easy

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
good and make their maps pretty easy

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.279 
good and make their maps pretty easy
once<00:05:22.590> you<00:05:22.919> get<00:05:23.130> set<00:05:23.430> up<00:05:23.460> however<00:05:24.330> i'm<00:05:24.600> picking

kind<00:05:36.990> of<00:05:37.080> throws<00:05:37.410> you<00:05:37.680> off<00:05:37.710> and<00:05:38.099> makes<00:05:38.340> you

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
kind of throws you off and makes you

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.040 
kind of throws you off and makes you
think<00:05:38.700> there's<00:05:38.970> a<00:05:39.030> challenge<00:05:39.300> when<00:05:39.660> there

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
think there's a challenge when there

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.710 
think there's a challenge when there
really<00:05:40.229> isn't<00:05:40.800> also<00:05:41.729> a<00:05:41.760> lot<00:05:42.060> of<00:05:42.090> people<00:05:42.450> think

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
really isn't also a lot of people think

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.480 
really isn't also a lot of people think
that<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.169> Buddha<00:05:43.440> rooms<00:05:43.620> not<00:05:43.830> easy<00:05:44.220> because

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
that the Buddha rooms not easy because

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.700 
that the Buddha rooms not easy because
you<00:05:44.760> can<00:05:44.940> fall<00:05:45.150> off<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.510> side<00:05:45.690> but<00:05:46.320> honestly

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
you can fall off the side but honestly

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.469 
you can fall off the side but honestly
if<00:05:46.950> you<00:05:47.070> fall<00:05:47.340> off<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.700> side<00:05:47.880> in<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.150> Buddha

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
if you fall off the side in the Buddha

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.050 
if you fall off the side in the Buddha
room<00:05:48.630> you're<00:05:49.470> probably<00:05:49.800> new<00:05:50.250> to<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.580> game<00:05:50.820> or
