00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.509
 Tell us what youtube guys are coming back to 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.849
 no one site droid point to point br 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.849
 in this video I'm going to ask a question 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.830
 about ippuc android 5.0 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.230
 now I'm with him here at motogp 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.390
 the first generation he updated the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.320
 motorola has already updated first and second 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.900
 generation 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.630
 so if you have one of these two and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.939
 I still have this new android going there 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.869
 settings on the 0 on the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.080
 telephone 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.500
 updating the system and upgrades 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.050
 download to it one hour ago he banks 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.480
 does not give an exact number 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.510
 anyway there is doubt that shows me the day or 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.469
 even with the public is to activate and 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.840
 deactivate her style while in the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.800
 settings of land where it was 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.239
 usually there is no more this does not have 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.620
 plus this option 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.780
 so the people were thinking that 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.030
 really had no way to activate or 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.859
 Turn it off and this is wrong 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.360
 simply moved from place to place 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:11.689
 can see the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.689
 screen automatically turn on or off 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.900
 O 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.810
 when you have not activated you will see 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.150
 This time, it's new here, right here in the middle. 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.040
 still appears for you to start automatic 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.530
 if you want to deactivate then it's just 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.040
 you click he goes straight to the picture 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.040
 OK 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.740
 Good, that's all I had to teach. 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.470
 today but I'll show you too 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.659
 some new things here then I'll go 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.060
 make a video just to do it just to 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.369
 you see what has changed what you have to 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.990
 new really on the new android but by 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.630
 while I'm going to show you some things 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.600
 besides changing places for this to 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.250
 enable or disable screen rotation 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.149
 we also have high text here 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:09.610
 contrast you can see that the text 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:13.630
 it gets totally dark even we have 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.480
 here also the inversion of colors that both 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.950
 this as the text in high contrast 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.670
 can opt for performance that are only 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.150
 experimental resources are currently 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.700
 colors reverses potal mind things but 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:37.720
 can see that it slowed down 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:40.540
 as it already warns he also color but 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:49.269
 also slightly affect the performance of the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:52.299
 device has not changed much more is 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.540
 say in this video change has really changed 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:03:07.810
 lot 6 place thor up here 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:10.329
 bark the material design 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.609
 a lot has changed here for this video 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.140
 it's not necessary to say much I'm going 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.500
 say only more basic when you 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.959
 regardless of whether it rises 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.780
 notification only really essential 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.209
 essential notification friends nothing 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.040
 too much 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.230
 goes down it will appear the menu of 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.810
 options on the quick menu is for you 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.850
 activate or deactivate the flashlight mode 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.760
 plane reverse color location 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.600
 Access Everything else there, going to talk is everything 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.670
 easier handy here menu 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.790
 settings that exit already had 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.080
 then you will also realize that ide 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.700
 and non - energy control 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:55.120
 there are more who and the graphic icons all 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.820
 changed a lot changed a lot 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.040
 the feature that only had a motorcycle x that was 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.110
 even smart with notifications in the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.110
 The screen is no more 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.970
 but anyway that's the law to watch until 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.280
