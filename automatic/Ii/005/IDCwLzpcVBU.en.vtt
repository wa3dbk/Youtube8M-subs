00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.639
 hello to everyone who looked at the channel with you 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.359
 I double bass and my video blog 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.039
 sd fitness and today we have a plan 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:27.949
 cooking fish for a couple for this 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:34.260
 we will need 3 school of fish any salt 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:37.920
 seasoning and carrot carrot I already washed 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.129
 and cut into straws like this it is she 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.390
 looks and of course we will need 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:49.129
 steamer steamer we pour water 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:55.350
 lay down the cover on top we take sprinkle 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:01:01.219
 pour out the carrot pour out so she 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:07.200
 put out all who have no steamer 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:11.460
 you can just take the drushlag pot 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.490
 and in this way doing it too will 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.900
 reckon as a pair of war points take the fish 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.900
 add salt to taste 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:25.500
 take open seasoning me seasoning 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:29.150
 I usually bought a store for fish here 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.150
 see managing for fish 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:38.570
 open neatly and sprinkle our 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.570
 fish on one side 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:49.630
 carefully sprinkle so flavor is good 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:54.780
 when editing and doing the same with 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:57.479
 the other side so that we have all the fish 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.280
 marinated in seasoning and in salt and 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:08.530
 here so neatly take more here 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:12.120
 sprinkle like that sprinkled aside 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.980
 seasoning a little more salt 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.940
 salt and do not overdo it and so here 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:23.680
 we mix it carefully so that everywhere 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:29.260
 its inside was missed a well 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.500
 so that we were more pleased to eat here 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.690
 all here and so looks marinated 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.880

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.880
