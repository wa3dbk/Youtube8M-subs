module<00:01:10.890> will<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.189> unloaded<00:01:11.760> from<00:01:11.880> them<00:01:16.759> now<00:01:17.759> I

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
module will be unloaded from them now I

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.719 
module will be unloaded from them now I
will<00:01:18.180> show<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.450> how<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.810> overclock<00:01:19.740> optimus

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
will show you how to overclock optimus

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.039 
will show you how to overclock optimus
one<00:01:20.759> CT<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:22.220> have<00:01:23.220> said<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.299> will<00:01:24.540> come

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
one CT I have said to you this will come

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.440 
one CT I have said to you this will come
with<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.610> custom<00:01:26.610> rom<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> right<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.220> is

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
with the custom rom so right now it is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.250 
with the custom rom so right now it is
softer<00:01:30.470> 600<00:01:31.470> megawatts

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
softer 600 megawatts

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.649 
softer 600 megawatts
I<00:01:34.100> will<00:01:34.370> increase<00:01:34.730> it<00:01:34.910> to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.690 

you<00:01:39.749> need<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.140> slide<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.549> maximum

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you need to slide it that is the maximum

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.539 
you need to slide it that is the maximum
frequency<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.170> said<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:44.069> you<00:01:44.249> switch

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
frequency that I have said if you switch

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.020 
frequency that I have said if you switch
to<00:01:44.579> info<00:01:45.179> tab<00:01:45.600> there<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.710> will<00:01:46.829> see<00:01:46.969> it<00:01:47.969> is

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to info tab there you will see it is

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.469 
to info tab there you will see it is
right<00:01:48.450> now<00:01:48.659> running<00:01:48.929> back<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.439> 25-metre<00:01:50.189> fights

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
right now running back a 25-metre fights

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.169 
right now running back a 25-metre fights
but<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.719> pretty<00:01:52.049> stable<00:01:52.319> at<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:53.060> frequency<00:01:54.060> I

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
but is pretty stable at that frequency I

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.039 
but is pretty stable at that frequency I
have<00:01:57.179> taken<00:01:57.560> several<00:01:58.560> screenshots<00:02:00.049> by
