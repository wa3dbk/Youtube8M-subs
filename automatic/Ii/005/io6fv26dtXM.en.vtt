00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.670
 hi I am massimiliano corso with this 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:12.240
 tutorial show how to correct a 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.849
 common problem that you can have when 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.350
 they are taken outdoors for example like 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:22.830
 in this case a gray sky or 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.260
 as in this other case a sky 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.510
 so overexposed as to result 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.000
 white then we are working in 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.439
 photoshop so let's start with this 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.649
 example 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.579
 first we select the tool 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.590
 Magic wand 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:45.690
 here with the letter v in the options 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.629
 let's set 10 as tolerance 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.180
 to select the sky with the tool 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.000
 Magic wand 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.800
 now of course the first selection does not 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.570
 completely select the whole sky 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.840
 so we continue to select 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.199
 all the sky keeping the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.640
 pil the key uppercase and continuing to 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.350
 select the one that does not have 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.810
 selected the first selection 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.400
 we must be able to select all the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.990
 sky 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:25.549
 here we continue it takes a bit of 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:28.549
 patience but in the end the result 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.549
 important 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:42.810
 we try to select everything 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.810
 also smaller points with here 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.020
 calmly we try not to do it 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.240
 escape 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.069
 on a point to get a result 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.439
 optimal 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:05.959
 then let's see here again here here it is 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:10.120
 the pezzettino tree here we say that for 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:12.069
 our example can be can be 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:17.000
 enough 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:20.360
 ok there is another dot here here is that 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.400
 we had missed it, it seems to me that everything is going 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:32.930
 well then ok let's go to the menu now 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:35.660
 selection we select edit and spread 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.750
 these are the edges of the selection e 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.269
 we set as an expansion board 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:49.160
 of selection 2 pixels 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:52.890
 let's see ok ok now let's open the page 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.550
 to the photo from which to take the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:00.390
 the sky here is a blue sky we open 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.170
 the eyedropper tool or by pressing 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.170
 lakes 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.450
 Now let's click here for example 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:20.010
 high left where there is more sky 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:23.610
 dark here we reward the aics for 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.360
 change to set the color of 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.450
 first floor 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.450
 here and now always with the instrument 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.730
 dropper we choose a point of the sky 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.769
 clearer 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.650
 here is what we see this way 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.630
 we reward hicks 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.910
 so we here in the foreground 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:50.130
 clearer sky color is like 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:52.470
 background a darker sky color 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.580
 now back to our photo 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.209
 the one we need to correct we create 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.209
 a new level 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:06.239
 select the gradient tool or 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:11.459
 by clicking on the icon or by pressing the 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:15.510
 button we click by dragging the 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:21.299
 cursor from bottom to top 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:26.090
 so we release here we have 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:33.090
 got the blue sky of barcelona 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:36.870
 on the photo of Paris we clear here 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.639
 here we have changed the gray of the 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.409
 sky with a beautiful blue sky 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.800
 if we want in the case we can also 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:50.719
 intervene here on the value opacity 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:53.270
 of the level making it more transparent 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:57.889
 opaque and then choosing the shade 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:05:02.169
 which we most prefer 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:05.509
 now I'll show you another system 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:09.499
 through which change to change or 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:11.719
 there is what gives us problems in a photo 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:17.360
 take this picture here is right 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:21.889
 the sky is almost and almost white and 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:25.219
 maybe take a picture in the sky with 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:28.400
 a sky that we already like that we want 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:35.509
 replace select part of 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:37.789
 heaven that interests us and we copy let's go 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:43.310
 in the photo to be corrected 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:47.560
 also here magic wand tool 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.560
 we select the sky 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:58.759
 let's go on special paste editing 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.789
 paste it in here here 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:04.009
 this can be a system here 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:07.759
 just as quick to change the 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.349
 sky of a photo that not that there 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.909
 meets 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:13.120
 maybe it can be useful at this point 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:16.399
 keep some shots 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.310
 only of blue skies and of celic 

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:20.770
 clouds to be used then followed for 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.979
 correct the 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.520
 to correct our photos here here 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:29.520
 the photo we corrected 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.539
 at the beginning here is what the photo was like 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:36.060
 and like now 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:36.060
 that 's all at the next tutorial
