00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
going to MCEdit stack them and make a

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.560 
going to MCEdit stack them and make a
spawner<00:01:53.649> out<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:53.979> them<00:01:54.100> so<00:01:54.359> fish<00:01:55.359> almost

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
spawner out of them so fish almost

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.780 
spawner out of them so fish almost
disappear<00:01:57.270> okay

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
so now we have a spawner here looks like

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.139 
so now we have a spawner here looks like
it<00:02:06.050> might<00:02:06.380> have<00:02:06.409> just<00:02:06.590> chosen<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.400> top<00:02:07.670> thing

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
it might have just chosen the top thing

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.040 
it might have just chosen the top thing
to<00:02:08.630> spawn<00:02:10.030> but<00:02:11.030> just<00:02:11.240> in<00:02:11.390> case<00:02:11.420> we'll<00:02:11.840> put<00:02:12.020> a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
to spawn but just in case we'll put a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:21.900 
to spawn but just in case we'll put a
normal<00:02:13.480> time<00:02:16.060> set<00:02:17.060> for<00:02:17.950> 14,000<00:02:20.290> yes<00:02:21.290> by<00:02:21.530> Mike

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
normal time set for 14,000 yes by Mike

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.980 
normal time set for 14,000 yes by Mike
yeah<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:22.970> looks<00:02:23.120> like<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.270> just<00:02:23.360> chose<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.810> top

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
yeah it looks like it just chose the top

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.820
