tutorial for spiral flowers this is

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.680 
tutorial for spiral flowers this is
stitched<00:00:05.370> by<00:00:05.640> first<00:00:05.910> starting<00:00:06.390> with<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
stitched by first starting with the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.620 
stitched by first starting with the
spiral<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.649> you're<00:00:07.980> actually<00:00:08.130> going<00:00:08.460> to

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.630 
spiral and you're actually going to

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.280 
spiral and you're actually going to
spiral<00:00:09.630> into<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:10.139> circle<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.840> this<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:12.960> kind<00:00:13.200> of

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
spiral into a circle and this is kind of

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.090 
spiral into a circle and this is kind of
like<00:00:13.469> peppermint<00:00:14.340> candy<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:16.529> build<00:00:16.800> up

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
like peppermint candy so and to build up

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.170 
like peppermint candy so and to build up
the<00:00:17.130> outside<00:00:17.760> edges<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:19.260> Center<00:00:20.180> spiral

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the outside edges of this Center spiral

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.300 
the outside edges of this Center spiral
I<00:00:21.330> actually<00:00:21.570> travel<00:00:22.560> stitch<00:00:22.769> all<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.070> way

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
I actually travel stitch all the way

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.189 
I actually travel stitch all the way
around<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.119> build<00:00:24.330> up<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> thread<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:25.080> a

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
around it to build up the thread just a

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.740 
around it to build up the thread just a
little<00:00:25.439> bit<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.490> now<00:00:26.910> we're<00:00:27.119> going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.420> stitch

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
little bit so now we're going to stitch

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.460 
little bit so now we're going to stitch
spiral<00:00:28.740> petals<00:00:29.160> all<00:00:29.340> around<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.470> central

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
spiral petals all around this central

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.220 
spiral petals all around this central
swirl<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.820> order<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.329> create<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.840> spiral

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
swirl in order to create the spiral

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.380 
swirl in order to create the spiral
flower<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:35.010> first<00:00:35.309> stitch<00:00:35.579> your<00:00:35.760> spiral<00:00:36.030> and

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
flower so first stitch your spiral and

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.020 
flower so first stitch your spiral and
then<00:00:37.110> stitch<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.590> little<00:00:37.860> echo<00:00:38.160> around<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.850> and

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
then stitch a little echo around it and

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.600 
then stitch a little echo around it and
you<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.719> definitely<00:00:40.260> change<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.950> size<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
you can definitely change the size and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.750 
you can definitely change the size and
the<00:00:42.180> shape<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.660> your<00:00:42.690> flower<00:00:43.110> by<00:00:43.950> changing<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
the shape of your flower by changing the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.940 
the shape of your flower by changing the
size<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.210> shape<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.450> your<00:00:45.660> starting<00:00:46.410> spirals

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
size and shape of your starting spirals

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.760 
size and shape of your starting spirals
of<00:00:47.100> your<00:00:47.250> spiral<00:00:47.700> petals<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.530> first

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
of your spiral petals so this first

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.130 
of your spiral petals so this first
spiral<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> little<00:00:51.000> bit<00:00:51.120> bigger<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.840> that

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
spiral is a little bit bigger and that

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.650 
spiral is a little bit bigger and that
makes<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.860> resulting<00:00:53.610> petal<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.149> lot<00:00:54.449> bigger

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
makes the resulting petal a lot bigger

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.959 
makes the resulting petal a lot bigger
too<00:00:54.980> this<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> design<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
too this is going to be a design that

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.240 
too this is going to be a design that
works<00:00:57.270> really<00:00:57.629> well<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.230> kind<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> open

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
works really well in kind of the open

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.910 
works really well in kind of the open
uncomplicated<00:00:59.969> areas<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.809> your<00:01:00.930> quilt<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.770> you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
uncomplicated areas of your quilt as you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.100 
uncomplicated areas of your quilt as you
can<00:01:02.039> see<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> center<00:01:03.059> fill<00:01:03.329> design<00:01:03.780> so

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
can see this is a center fill design so

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.690 
can see this is a center fill design so
it's<00:01:04.229> stitched<00:01:04.470> from<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> center<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.400> your

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
it's stitched from the center of your

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.990 
it's stitched from the center of your
space<00:01:05.970> tilt<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.930> outside<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.970> because<00:01:08.970> of

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
space tilt to the outside and because of

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.510 
space tilt to the outside and because of
that<00:01:09.770> it's<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> work<00:01:11.159> really<00:01:11.369> really

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
that it's going to work really really

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.010 
that it's going to work really really
well<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.560> an<00:01:13.560> open<00:01:14.070> block<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.909> if<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
well in an open block so if you have a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.800 
well in an open block so if you have a
quilt<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.070> every<00:01:17.909> other<00:01:18.030> block<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.570> left

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
quilt that every other block is left

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.510 
quilt that every other block is left
empty<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.470> let's<00:01:19.680> say<00:01:19.830> some<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.189> them<00:01:20.340> are

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
empty so let's say some of them are

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.310 
empty so let's say some of them are
either<00:01:20.549> p<00:01:20.909> store<00:01:21.180> appliqued<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.170> other

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
either p store appliqued and the other

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.410 
either p store appliqued and the other
ones<00:01:22.560> are<00:01:22.740> empty<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.790> would<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.090> good

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
ones are empty this would be a good

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.480 
ones are empty this would be a good
design<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.049> stitch<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.530> empty<00:01:25.710> block<00:01:26.130> or

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
design to stitch in that empty block or

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.749 
design to stitch in that empty block or
you<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.330> also<00:01:27.540> use<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:29.189> circle<00:01:29.549> quilt

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
you can also use this in a circle quilt

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.130 
you can also use this in a circle quilt
you<00:01:30.000> could<00:01:30.150> stitch<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> center<00:01:31.110> of

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
you could stitch this in the center of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.920 
you could stitch this in the center of
several<00:01:32.040> circles<00:01:32.430> there<00:01:33.150> are<00:01:33.329> many<00:01:33.509> different

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
several circles there are many different

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.230 
several circles there are many different
uses<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.579> best<00:01:35.759> thing<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.150> is

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
uses for it and the best thing to do is

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.210 
uses for it and the best thing to do is
just<00:01:36.299> simply<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.990> creative<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:37.950> where

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
just simply be creative with where

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.429 
just simply be creative with where
you're<00:01:38.400> going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> use<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.259> see

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
you're going to use it so you can see

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.730 
you're going to use it so you can see
how<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> first<00:01:41.159> set<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:42.170> spiral<00:01:43.170> petals<00:01:43.500> kind

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
how the first set of spiral petals kind

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.219 
how the first set of spiral petals kind
of<00:01:43.829> went<00:01:44.009> around<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.579> shape<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.750> central

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
of went around the shape of the central

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.080 
of went around the shape of the central
swirl<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.159> now<00:01:47.340> I'm<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.670> show<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.909> how

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
swirl so now I'm going to show you how

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.499 
swirl so now I'm going to show you how
the<00:01:48.840> outer<00:01:49.229> petals<00:01:49.860> really<00:01:50.369> work<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.360> does

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the outer petals really work and it does

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.810 
the outer petals really work and it does
require<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.869> little<00:01:52.649> bit<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:53.040> traveling<00:01:53.610> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
require a little bit of traveling and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.609
