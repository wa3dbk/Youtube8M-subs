not<00:05:25.220> what<00:05:25.490> I<00:05:25.520> intended<00:05:25.940> but<00:05:26.680> he<00:05:27.680> is<00:05:27.770> not<00:05:27.979> a

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
not what I intended but he is not a

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.990 
not what I intended but he is not a
villain<00:05:29.530> and<00:05:30.530> he's<00:05:30.740> not<00:05:30.919> completely<00:05:31.430> crazy

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
villain and he's not completely crazy

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.879 
villain and he's not completely crazy
he<00:05:32.150> just<00:05:32.300> needs<00:05:32.479> just<00:05:32.599> like<00:05:32.690> whoa<00:05:33.020> why<00:05:33.680> are<00:05:33.710> you

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
he just needs just like whoa why are you

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.469 
he just needs just like whoa why are you
rebuilding<00:05:34.610> this<00:05:34.729> that's<00:05:35.030> that<00:05:35.240> that's<00:05:35.419> just

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
rebuilding this that's that that's just

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.439 
rebuilding this that's that that's just
wrong<00:05:35.750> but<00:05:36.680> beyond<00:05:37.280> that<00:05:37.520> whole<00:05:38.030> you<00:05:38.360> know

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
wrong but beyond that whole you know

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:41.230 
wrong but beyond that whole you know
building<00:05:38.780> a<00:05:38.870> robot<00:05:39.110> I<00:05:39.139> put<00:05:39.289> up<00:05:39.380> my<00:05:39.409> son<00:05:40.150> it's<00:05:41.150> a

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
building a robot I put up my son it's a

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.950 
building a robot I put up my son it's a
very<00:05:41.389> sensitive<00:05:41.840> character<00:05:42.530> and<00:05:42.800> I<00:05:43.960> think

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
very sensitive character and I think

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.450 
very sensitive character and I think
that's<00:05:45.080> what<00:05:45.199> I<00:05:45.229> latched<00:05:45.409> on<00:05:45.650> to<00:05:45.680> most<00:05:46.070> it's

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
that's what I latched on to most it's

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.129 
that's what I latched on to most it's
the<00:05:46.580> one<00:05:46.729> major<00:05:47.030> deviation<00:05:47.330> from<00:05:48.020> the

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
the one major deviation from the

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.649 
the one major deviation from the
original<00:05:48.229> Astro<00:05:48.800> Boy<00:05:49.009> material<00:05:50.000> and<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.539> one

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:50.659 
original Astro Boy material and the one

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.439 
original Astro Boy material and the one
that<00:05:50.780> I<00:05:50.810> think<00:05:50.900> is<00:05:51.110> is<00:05:51.380> works<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.250> best<00:05:52.460> Tenma

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
that I think is is works the best Tenma

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.850 
that I think is is works the best Tenma
goes<00:05:53.719> from<00:05:54.229> this<00:05:54.590> convenient<00:05:56.080> oddball<00:05:57.080> genius

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860

exists to basically foist this problem

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.189 
exists to basically foist this problem
on<00:06:03.710> Astro<00:06:04.039> Boy<00:06:04.159> and<00:06:04.280> then<00:06:04.370> disappears<00:06:05.199> goes

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 
from that into a sensitive character

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.270 
from that into a sensitive character
with<00:06:08.180> tough<00:06:08.509> moral<00:06:08.870> choices<00:06:09.110> someone<00:06:09.979> who<00:06:10.130> has

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:56.569 
an artist I think it is what Texaco

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:58.420 
an artist I think it is what Texaco
would<00:06:56.749> have<00:06:56.869> liked<00:06:57.139> to<00:06:57.259> have<00:06:57.469> done<00:06:57.529> with<00:06:57.949> Astro

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430

00:07:01.359 --> 00:07:01.369 
if he were alive today with the benefit

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:05.170 
if he were alive today with the benefit
of<00:07:01.399> his<00:07:01.729> experience<00:07:03.580> so<00:07:04.580> what<00:07:04.759> can<00:07:04.849> I<00:07:04.939> say<00:07:05.149> I

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180 
of his experience so what can I say I

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.839
