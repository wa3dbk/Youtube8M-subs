are<00:00:51.940> see<00:00:52.149> DVDs<00:00:52.570> existed<00:00:53.290> way<00:00:53.469> before<00:00:53.500> all<00:00:53.979> this

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
are see DVDs existed way before all this

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.640 
are see DVDs existed way before all this
high<00:00:54.790> definition<00:00:55.089> camcorder<00:00:55.540> stuff<00:00:56.049> way

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
high definition camcorder stuff way

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.859 
high definition camcorder stuff way
before<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.280> current<00:00:57.610> line<00:00:57.759> of<00:00:57.909> Mac's<00:00:58.119> in<00:00:58.750> the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:58.869 
before the current line of Mac's in the

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:01.469 
before the current line of Mac's in the
early<00:00:59.110> 90s<00:00:59.739> they<00:01:00.489> basically<00:01:00.970> how<00:01:01.089> to<00:01:01.119> play<00:01:01.330> on

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
early 90s they basically how to play on

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.249 
early 90s they basically how to play on
standard<00:01:01.839> definition<00:01:02.739> TVs<00:01:03.280> so<00:01:03.879> you<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.989> the

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
standard definition TVs so you get the

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.289 
standard definition TVs so you get the
standard<00:01:05.740> definition<00:01:05.830> resolution<00:01:06.340> now<00:01:07.210> if

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
standard definition resolution now if

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.929 
standard definition resolution now if
you<00:01:07.450> look<00:01:07.600> at<00:01:07.750> a<00:01:07.810> 640<00:01:08.590> 480<00:01:08.890> video<00:01:09.340> I<00:01:09.549> mean<00:01:09.880> the

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
you look at a 640 480 video I mean the

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.370 
you look at a 640 480 video I mean the
number<00:01:10.119> of<00:01:10.210> pixels<00:01:10.420> it's<00:01:10.900> less<00:01:11.140> than<00:01:11.350> a

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
number of pixels it's less than a

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.020 
number of pixels it's less than a
quarter<00:01:11.920> of<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.130> number<00:01:12.369> of<00:01:12.460> pixels<00:01:12.759> you<00:01:12.820> get

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
quarter of the number of pixels you get

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.630 
quarter of the number of pixels you get
even<00:01:13.420> at<00:01:14.250> 720<00:01:15.250> so<00:01:16.530> well<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:18.100> just<00:01:18.310> don't<00:01:18.430> have

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
even at 720 so well you just don't have

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.859 
even at 720 so well you just don't have
much<00:01:18.850> of<00:01:18.970> a<00:01:19.030> choice<00:01:19.210> if<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:19.540> want<00:01:19.689> to<00:01:19.750> make<00:01:19.840> a

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
much of a choice if you want to make a

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.990 
much of a choice if you want to make a
DVD<00:01:20.079> a<00:01:20.380> DVD<00:01:20.890> is<00:01:21.040> just<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.310> inter<00:01:21.460> definition

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
DVD a DVD is just the inter definition

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.179 
DVD a DVD is just the inter definition
that's<00:01:22.270> all<00:01:22.570> DVD<00:01:23.110> does<00:01:23.290> it<00:01:23.500> doesn't<00:01:23.770> upgrade

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
that's all DVD does it doesn't upgrade

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.399 
that's all DVD does it doesn't upgrade
you<00:01:24.399> can't<00:01:24.610> get<00:01:25.149> a<00:01:25.180> new<00:01:25.479> type<00:01:25.750> of<00:01:25.780> DVD<00:01:26.170> player

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
you can't get a new type of DVD player

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.320 
you can't get a new type of DVD player
because<00:01:26.770> those<00:01:27.100> DVDs<00:01:27.520> wouldn't<00:01:28.000> work<00:01:28.150> on

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
because those DVDs wouldn't work on

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330 
because those DVDs wouldn't work on
older<00:01:28.659> ones<00:01:28.840> so<00:01:29.409> you're<00:01:29.560> stuck<00:01:29.860> with<00:01:30.040> standard

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
older ones so you're stuck with standard

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.670 
older ones so you're stuck with standard
definition<00:01:30.760> video<00:01:31.170> now<00:01:32.170> if<00:01:32.229> you<00:01:32.320> do<00:01:32.470> want<00:01:32.650> to
