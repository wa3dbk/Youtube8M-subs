 video tutorial santander laws today 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.340

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.690
 security of a good nokia phone 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.030
 any kind of Nokia phone that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.920
 we have changed that security code 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.710
 the code normally ensures everything 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.570
 Nokia phone with only buy 1345 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.510
 but we have the bad habit 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.610
 change it and at the time we forget and if 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.519
 we want a phone material or 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.140
 restore everything from the factory in a paper 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.089
 security code that we have 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.820
 forgotten today I bring you the tutorial is 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.070
 a help for you to leave 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.480
 go ahead with that problem and good 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.510
 let's start 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.950
 three programs that need to be to nokia 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:21.070
 Suite nss and nokia baby baby 5 pm 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.580
 security co co de 1.3 let's see fast 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.530
 but the time 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.960
 but we have to have installed that I am 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.270
 with the last update of last 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.740
 update after this program is 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.730
 I suggested inscription of the video 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.390
 called nemesis suite service suite and 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.710
 this baby nokia 5 pm segurity code about 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.190
 three showed off by writing videos 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.310
 everyone 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.829
 this work is 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.200
 and these two for them to work have to 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.390
 be installed this this has to be 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.850
 installed so that work this is 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.320
 as the update and it's a 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.600
 important of the three programs are the 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.479
 basic that you have to have good I 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.189
 I 'm jealous that I'm going to find out the 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.820
 phone security game then 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.820
 we go 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.550
 to touch the installation point of this 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.200
 this month and they are all installed in a 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.910
 next next without changing in the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.790
 room normally in the next 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.110
 next next good after that 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.000
 the program is installed we give it 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.620
 properties 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.120
 would share would be here in xp 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.340
 service pack 3 we will change it in 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.160
 windows 7 x Bhutanese tested I started 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.400
 we talk check in this box apply and 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.540
 accept good then 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.930
 well the second thing is to connect this in 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.510
 mode is seen from fish we fix at times 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.010
 we connect it and leave it 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.950
 storage does not connect to the company 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.610
 upload recommendation have weight I have them 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.470
 thought closed 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.500
 that is not right and that is not open 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.130
 here if it's open here is the icon 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.020
 here the right click and it will leave 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.250
 so you do not have problems by roads 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.100
 functions and it's like this 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.880
 good connect 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.880
 it's dollar 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.180
 but if we give it there 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.120
 and after a while we wait 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:22.980
 we fixed that it is that it appears is fine 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.920
 and we open the computer again in mx 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.959
 let's wait for the view to load later 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.180
 I do not leave these icons I do not know why 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.190
 what if you come out that made but to me 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.849
 I do not get it then the problem is that 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.849
 let's go find 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.380
 here we get this information but this 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.730
 I think from the computer more than all 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.970
 the ports fall 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.700
 remember to have all this way 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.610
 they see it orient 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.430
 we are leaving, nothing changes, we are going to 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.290
 information the phone keep in mind 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.950
 all this is the gas and we are going 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.950
 scan 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.760
 well I think that hangs sure not what 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.610
 change in the epic 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.190
 the phone version would be the code 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.000
 of series but it does not matter we go 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.310
 it says here I fashion permanent memory no 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.810
 let's read here in this option and ready 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.760
 the network either in English good 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.130
 we believe that it ends it will not send a 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.260
 folder address do not send us going to 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.130
 send a folder to an address and 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.780
 no more follow saved empty more 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.729
 saved to the saving payment 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.160
 remember comment 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.300
 I like it 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.639
 and share 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.699
 there is another way to block a phone 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.979
 when he is good, the 7 asks him for a rope 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.949
 security and of no so there is no way 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:51.650
 of happening if we reach a good amount of 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.810
 visualizations I like shared os 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.039
 If you share, I'll show you how 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.590
 do what 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:02.430
 well here it is at the address 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.050
 let's go look with the other program 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.290
 I do not have to vibrate but this can 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.060
 extract it because I have because the cntv 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.240
 where I started I want to delete it but 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.590
 I'm going to generate avoid that then I'll 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.390
 we give our own we will open double click 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.850
 we execute recommendation have your 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.190
 antivirus disabled for this but 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.910
 how are they crack the ones of the technique 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.849
 they do not see it in a bad way or they detect 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.539
 bad way 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:35.540
 s open a file of pm well let's 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:39.020
 the address that tells us here that was 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:42.220
 discs in program rows by 86-57 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.220
 windows 8 believe 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:49.820
 ns cow pm and this one is good come on 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:54.340
 here we go to local disk here by 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:58.090
 first disk the university local disk 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.090
 says I did 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.260
 you have to be 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.320
 we are going to open 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.860
 the backup 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.860
 p.m 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.620
 here the show now if the code is 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.420
 go to 1 2 3 4 5 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.200
 there it is and that's it 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.390
 we'll see 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.130
 that's the code but I know it's not going to 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.420
 function 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.420
 he is not going to prove it 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.580
 it does not just change 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.009
 let's change it, I'll put it because 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.009
 very easy to remember 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:49.510
 let's see how security in 1902 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.600
 code does that in the game one two three 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:56.010
 four five 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:07:00.390
 equal about 345 of the 3 459 I do not have 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:05.310
 problem nothing 100% 200 by 1100 by 1000 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:08.460
 percent works without these steps but 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:11.160
 is not responsible for the chiqui 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.560
 studies use from a bad path what 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.030
 take on the other hand recommended in this 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.470
 video only to help help 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.590
 those people who obviously 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:22.680
 they need to format the phone by 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:25.140
 yes, because we really do not know 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.380
 the code that find out by other 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:32.040
 circumstances and well there's easy 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:34.490
 program and I bless you all and follow 

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.490
 ahead
