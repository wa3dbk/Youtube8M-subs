which brought a lot of changes in terms

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.500 
which brought a lot of changes in terms
of<00:00:25.109> how<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.380> interact<00:00:25.769> with<00:00:26.130> touchflo<00:00:26.760> 3d<00:00:26.970> so

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
of how you interact with touchflo 3d so

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.480 
of how you interact with touchflo 3d so
the<00:00:27.599> interface<00:00:27.930> went<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.230> lot<00:00:28.320> deeper

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
the interface went a lot deeper

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.209 
the interface went a lot deeper
everything<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.640> very<00:00:29.699> well<00:00:30.060> optimized<00:00:30.779> for

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
everything was very well optimized for

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.740 
everything was very well optimized for
finger-friendly<00:00:32.219> navigation<00:00:33.059> which<00:00:33.420> made<00:00:33.630> us

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
finger-friendly navigation which made us

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.330 
finger-friendly navigation which made us
think<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.170> HTC<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.770> working<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
think that HTC is working on a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.520 
think that HTC is working on a
capacitive<00:00:36.120> windows<00:00:36.719> mobile<00:00:36.870> device<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.440> now

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
capacitive windows mobile device and now

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
capacitive windows mobile device and now
we're<00:00:37.680> hearing<00:00:37.890> about<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> HTC<00:00:38.489> lio<00:00:38.820> which

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
we're hearing about the HTC lio which

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.690 
we're hearing about the HTC lio which
supposedly<00:00:39.930> has<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.379> capacitive<00:00:41.070> screen<00:00:41.399> so

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
supposedly has a capacitive screen so

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.130 
supposedly has a capacitive screen so
this<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.090> all<00:00:42.239> starting<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.660> make<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.899> lot<00:00:43.079> of

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
this is all starting to make a lot of

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.979 
this is all starting to make a lot of
sense<00:00:43.350> now<00:00:43.920> touchflo<00:00:44.160> 3d<00:00:44.450> 2.6<00:00:45.450> brings<00:00:45.780> some

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
sense now touchflo 3d 2.6 brings some

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.830 
sense now touchflo 3d 2.6 brings some
additional<00:00:46.530> changes<00:00:46.770> mostly<00:00:47.550> aesthetic<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
additional changes mostly aesthetic to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.330 
additional changes mostly aesthetic to
the<00:00:48.870> touchflo<00:00:49.410> interface<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.070> we're<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the touchflo interface so we're going to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.580 
the touchflo interface so we're going to
go<00:00:50.460> through<00:00:50.670> them<00:00:50.789> now<00:00:51.230> what<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.320> probably

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
go through them now what you probably

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.869 
go through them now what you probably
notice<00:00:52.890> right<00:00:53.010> off<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> bat<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
notice right off the bat is that the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.430 
notice right off the bat is that the
clock<00:00:54.120> has<00:00:54.300> been<00:00:54.480> changed<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> clock<00:00:55.140> looks

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
clock has been changed the clock looks

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.979 
clock has been changed the clock looks
just<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.070> does<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:57.149> Android<00:00:57.690> based

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
just like it does on the Android based

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.889 
just like it does on the Android based
HTC<00:00:58.710> hero<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.309> let's<00:00:59.730> slide<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.120> over<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.870> you

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
HTC hero so let's slide that over so you

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.330 
HTC hero so let's slide that over so you
get<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> clock<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.829> current

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
get the clock with the current

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.549 
get the clock with the current
temperature<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.690> high<00:01:03.840> low<00:01:04.080> temperature

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
temperature and the high low temperature

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.200 
temperature and the high low temperature
so<00:01:05.159> which<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.460> convenient<00:01:05.970> because

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
so which is really convenient because

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.609 
so which is really convenient because
you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.390> quickly<00:01:06.630> glance<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.229> your<00:01:07.350> your

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
you can quickly glance at your your

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.620 
you can quickly glance at your your
device<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> homescreen<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.390> what

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
device on the homescreen and see what

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.969 
device on the homescreen and see what
the<00:01:09.750> temperature<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.170> without<00:01:10.530> having<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the temperature is without having to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.580 
the temperature is without having to
flip<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.640> way<00:01:11.850> over<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:13.080> weather<00:01:13.320> tab

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
flip all the way over to the weather tab
