00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.670
 next weekend will be the title fight in which ajax will compete with twente and psv 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.660
 continues again last weekend, ajax swung against and in the first half 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.460
 is a continued leg thanks to kenneth vermeer it seemed like the team did not 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.149
 realized that the title was at stake 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.289
 With the backlog turned into a win it seemed like they were 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.859
 the others strongest under the trees 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.409
 it did not realize that it would be 2 0 within four minutes 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.239
 But luckily we got the chance to recover 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.300
 Yes and then 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.199
 do you know that the weather is nice and that you plan not to forget the title 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.200
 how much are you going in this week's discussions with his discussions 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.600
 at that title on achieving the sharpness her personal record 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.460
 depending on psv 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.320
 we must probably not be the only thing we can do is the goal 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.320
 nine points make the last three league matches 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.270
 and that must be our goal 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.810
 and then everything has to give way everything for later you have to be focused on 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.199
 and then you can go on by May 15, there is also another scale to accommodate 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.700
 Normally in the media about acquisition Twente and PSV or Ajax 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.880
 one it is the champion of poverty 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.290
 serious spring 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.220
 to kick after the toes 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.880
 quite close together so why not 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.550
 it may be that somebody has given them the fact that many in advance never champion 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.230
 therefore man can knock 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.530
 Ajax went 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.950
 the golfer and that is the business still believe in the title 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.160
 really in that competition that can happen 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.310
 yes we want the youngsters but we also have to really believe 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.410
 and what we depend on psv 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.830
 Here you really have to believe that you have these three games 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.930
 kamminga 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.500
 a playground 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.500
 he lent we have a name you can become champion 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.340
 this weekend it's important that i think i ado twente and 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.240
 and feyenoord psv 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.570
 yes there will be another important one but also 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.020
 where is certainly allowed at home you should never lose 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.820
 at excelsior where, however, the previous week proved again 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.779
 what is just a good team is not to let it go 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:16.869
 that is often not the intention in the arena so let it run lisse 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.539
 can get my throat released 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.339
 but i like that 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:24.219
 alex pastor 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.909
 has made a good sense team and 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.899
 that they can make it a nuisance through the ps of a damn 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:33.109
 ajax also experienced that in the mutual meeting in rotterdam 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.450
 we drag Jan exhibit 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.619
 a draw from the fire 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:37.530
 farmer is nevertheless 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.799
 do not exclude negative about the level of the premier division 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.449
 it is very changeable but maybe also typical for me 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.269
 to play football 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.909
 Oh dear 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.180
 very good match we are especially where they each team 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.139
 takes 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.879
 perhaps the exception of zealand two hours over a very bad year 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:57.629
 to have 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.480
 he has a lot of volatility in all ten years both in the upper 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.749
 regions like a controversial film 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:06.200
 look beyond 2 2 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.359
 that is the period of 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.059
 he sees something 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:11.319
 9 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.319
 there you hit him again 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.329
 you see that mail 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.709
 what stands out in the premier league is that the competition 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.619
 has been exciting since 2007 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:26.109
 the question is whether that is good for the competition the farmer has about that in each 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.239
 clear opinion 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.239
 the whole time the artist's main conclusion was that 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.420
 and twente normally for feyenoord also the March partner there put the 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.269
 last years 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.159
 that made the competition a lot more interesting because you really like it 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.319
 against a club as a twente or another club as the last 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:49.009
 just unilever turned up against tapping 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:52.299
 the jury world is only fun is the competition 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.299
 but maybe not annoying for an ajax either 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.259
 yes but we must ensure that we got wrong again 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:01.709
 can do five matches for you
