00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.649 
honest it wasn't really sticky
I<00:00:38.699> cannot<00:00:39.699> articulate<00:00:40.690> it<00:00:41.019> well<00:00:41.050> how<00:00:42.059> my<00:00:43.059> how

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
I cannot articulate it well how my how

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.979 
I cannot articulate it well how my how
it<00:00:43.870> felt<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.530> felt<00:00:44.589> like<00:00:45.309> a<00:00:45.610> film<00:00:46.210> or<00:00:46.539> something

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
it felt it felt like a film or something

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.279 
it felt it felt like a film or something
and<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.199> little<00:00:47.440> bit<00:00:47.559> too<00:00:48.870> gave<00:00:49.870> a<00:00:49.989> great

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
and a little bit too gave a great

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.139 
and a little bit too gave a great
analogy<00:00:50.829> she<00:00:51.129> said<00:00:51.309> it<00:00:51.399> felt<00:00:51.640> like<00:00:51.789> rubbing

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
analogy she said it felt like rubbing

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.260 
analogy she said it felt like rubbing
your<00:00:52.239> hands<00:00:52.480> on<00:00:52.690> wet<00:00:52.870> velvet<00:00:53.350> maybe<00:00:53.590> and<00:00:54.270> I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
your hands on wet velvet maybe and I

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.849 
your hands on wet velvet maybe and I
think<00:00:55.719> that's<00:00:55.899> probably<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.289> closest<00:00:56.800> thing

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
think that's probably the closest thing

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.889 
think that's probably the closest thing
that's<00:00:57.160> how<00:00:57.280> money<00:00:57.520> that's<00:00:57.850> how<00:00:58.059> it<00:00:58.300> felt<00:00:58.600> and

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
that's how money that's how it felt and

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.470 
that's how money that's how it felt and
I<00:00:59.050> played<00:00:59.680> my<00:00:59.949> hair<00:01:00.190> and<00:01:00.489> twirl<00:01:00.760> my<00:01:00.940> hair<00:01:01.180> too

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
I played my hair and twirl my hair too

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.889 
I played my hair and twirl my hair too
