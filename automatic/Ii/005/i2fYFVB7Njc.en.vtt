00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hi here again with you I hope 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.339
 be well this time I'm going to 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.010
 teach how to remove the annoying 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.500
 advertising your applications as 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.330
 you can see at the bottom those 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.730
 annoying messages that do not allow us 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.449
 use our applications 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.400
 comfortably those for example this is 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.820
 very easy to do for that we're going to 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.350
 install an apk called to dewey in the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.570
 description I leave the download link 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.990
 since it is not available anymore in the play 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.790
 store 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:36.320
 we give you click on install 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.320
 we wait for it to be installed 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.390
 once installed we give in open 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.180
 I told you that it is necessary to have 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.110
 superuser permissions we give you in 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.090
 allow 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.740
 we click on uninhabited 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.280
 wait for it to download the 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.280
 records 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.010
 what this application does is modify 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.430
 the host and thus help us block that 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.050
 annoying advertising 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.880
 in my case it will give you not in 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.310
 restart but you I recommend that 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.310
 give him that if we are going to try 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.109
 let's open the first application 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.560
 As you can see, the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.119
 annoying advertising 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.119
 let's try the other 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.659
 just as you can see it has already disappeared 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.720
 to reverse this is very simple 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.180
 we execute the application 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.500
 and we give you in deactivate blocking 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.530
 advertisements 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.840
 and this we give in you give you that if 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.210
 in my case and he's going to give it not to 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.930
 can see this what it does is return 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.020
 to the normal state the host file we are going to 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.509
 enter 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.120
 and as you can see, the 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.400
 annoying advertising 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.350
 For my part it would be everything I hope there 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.350
 liked that you have an excellent day
