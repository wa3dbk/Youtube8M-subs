especially if you're a three at the back

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.039 
especially if you're a three at the back
player<00:01:48.820> because<00:01:49.150> you<00:01:49.270> can<00:01:49.390> put<00:01:49.570> Kyle<00:01:49.750> Walker

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
player because you can put Kyle Walker

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.200 
player because you can put Kyle Walker
Kabul<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.799> then<00:01:50.950> one<00:01:51.189> of<00:01:51.220> your<00:01:51.610> choice<00:01:51.970> in

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
Kabul and then one of your choice in

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.300 
Kabul and then one of your choice in
there<00:01:52.510> with<00:01:52.720> them<00:01:52.840> as<00:01:53.020> well<00:01:53.260> and<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:53.950> all<00:01:54.159> the

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
there with them as well and you all the

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.429 
there with them as well and you all the
sudden<00:01:54.490> have<00:01:54.700> an<00:01:54.790> extremely<00:01:55.540> Pacey<00:01:56.049> back

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
sudden have an extremely Pacey back

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.870 
sudden have an extremely Pacey back
three<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:56.950> I'm<00:01:57.040> assuming<00:01:57.159> that's<00:01:57.520> what<00:01:57.640> he's

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
three so I'm assuming that's what he's

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.120 
three so I'm assuming that's what he's
going<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.090> do<00:01:58.330> so<00:01:58.810> it<00:01:58.900> should<00:01:59.080> be<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.200> very<00:01:59.979> very

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
going to do so it should be a very very

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.730 
going to do so it should be a very very
tough<00:02:00.460> matchup<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.689> come<00:02:01.840> up<00:02:01.990> again<00:02:02.080> so<00:02:02.409> if<00:02:02.650> you

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
tough matchup to come up again so if you

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.260 
tough matchup to come up again so if you
guys<00:02:02.890> have<00:02:03.009> suggestions<00:02:03.400> for<00:02:03.549> how<00:02:03.729> best<00:02:04.090> to
