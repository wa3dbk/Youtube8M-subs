covered and now the next step is to get
some<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> Purell<00:01:55.610> it<00:01:56.610> has<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.210> have

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
gonna want to do is um put this actually

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.080 
gonna want to do is um put this actually
around

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
around

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.449 
around
like<00:02:11.989> three<00:02:12.319> drops<00:02:12.620> per<00:02:12.890> side<00:02:13.660> okay

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
like three drops per side okay

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.620 
like three drops per side okay
and<00:02:16.459> what<00:02:17.060> that's<00:02:17.270> gonna<00:02:17.480> do<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:18.489> two<00:02:19.489> things

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
and what that's gonna do is two things

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.630 
and what that's gonna do is two things
accelerate<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.750> drying<00:02:20.900> time<00:02:21.349> and<00:02:21.680> then<00:02:22.310> the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
accelerate the drying time and then the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.640 
accelerate the drying time and then the
vapors<00:02:23.170> okay<00:02:24.170> from<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.340> from<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.000> PRL<00:02:26.650> are

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
vapors okay from the from the PRL are

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.910 
vapors okay from the from the PRL are
gonna<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.519> good<00:02:29.420> AAB<00:02:29.769> they're<00:02:30.769> gonna

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
gonna the good AAB they're gonna

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.729 
gonna the good AAB they're gonna
increase<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.550> flap<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.150> ability<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.140> the

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
increase the flap of ability and the the

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.180 
increase the flap of ability and the the
reliability<00:02:34.519> of<00:02:34.550> this<00:02:34.790> views<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.950> soon<00:02:36.950> this

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
reliability of this views and soon this

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.680 
reliability of this views and soon this
fuse<00:02:37.459> is<00:02:37.610> gonna<00:02:37.790> start

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
fuse is gonna start

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.050 
fuse is gonna start
crinkling<00:02:39.290> as<00:02:39.440> I<00:02:39.560> say<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:40.069> think<00:02:40.430> it's<00:02:40.730> doing<00:02:41.000> it

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
crinkling as I say I think it's doing it

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.580 
crinkling as I say I think it's doing it
right<00:02:41.150> now<00:02:41.209> actually<00:02:41.569> great<00:02:42.200> if<00:02:42.319> you<00:02:42.440> look

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590

like this yeah right there you see how

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.570 
like this yeah right there you see how
it's<00:02:48.200> kind<00:02:48.380> of<00:02:48.410> like<00:02:48.560> getting<00:02:48.799> engulfed<00:02:49.190> in

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
it's kind of like getting engulfed in

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.320 
it's kind of like getting engulfed in
the<00:02:50.209> flammable<00:02:50.690> materials<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.970> can<00:02:53.090> almost

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
the flammable materials you can almost

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.229 
the flammable materials you can almost
see<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.840> gas<00:02:54.080> exchange<00:02:54.500> between<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.400> TRL<00:02:56.209> and

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
see the gas exchange between the TRL and

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.630 
see the gas exchange between the TRL and
this<00:02:56.720> but<00:02:57.049> it's<00:02:57.230> hard<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.530> see<00:03:00.340> next

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
this but it's hard to see next

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.960 
this but it's hard to see next
the<00:03:02.120> my<00:03:02.720> favorite<00:03:03.760> step<00:03:04.760> actually<00:03:06.040> um<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.790> get

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
the my favorite step actually um you get

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.949 
the my favorite step actually um you get
to<00:03:08.180> roll<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:10.370> fuse<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:11.090> little<00:03:11.630> more<00:03:11.900> in<00:03:12.200> the

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
to roll the fuse a little more in the

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.220 
to roll the fuse a little more in the
you<00:03:14.959> know<00:03:15.079> in<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.560> stuff<00:03:16.630> just<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.810> make<00:03:17.989> sure

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
you know in the stuff just to make sure

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.789 
you know in the stuff just to make sure
that<00:03:18.410> it's<00:03:18.590> coated<00:03:19.870> now<00:03:20.870> you<00:03:20.930> don't<00:03:21.470> want<00:03:21.680> to

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
that it's coated now you don't want to

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.319 
that it's coated now you don't want to
use<00:03:22.220> this<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:24.019> get<00:03:24.380> it<00:03:24.560> out<00:03:26.410> okay

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
use this to get it out okay

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:37.090 
use this to get it out okay
you<00:03:29.329> should<00:03:29.600> see<00:03:31.209> this<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:34.540> come<00:03:35.540> out<00:03:36.069> we<00:03:37.069> just
