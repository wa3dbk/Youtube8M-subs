00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
little under a thousand when I got it so

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.550 
little under a thousand when I got it so
I<00:00:18.390> foot<00:00:18.840> around<00:00:19.320> 4,000<00:00:20.010> mile<00:00:20.189> time<00:00:20.779> so<00:00:21.779> it'll

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
I foot around 4,000 mile time so it'll

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.700 
I foot around 4,000 mile time so it'll
be<00:00:22.740> come<00:00:23.580> July<00:00:23.840> 4th<00:00:24.840> it'll<00:00:25.230> be<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> year<00:00:25.680> that

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
be come July 4th it'll be a year that

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.130 
be come July 4th it'll be a year that
I've<00:00:26.010> had<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:27.180> by<00:00:27.330> then<00:00:27.480> I'll<00:00:27.630> probably<00:00:27.810> be

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
I've had it so by then I'll probably be

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.060 
I've had it so by then I'll probably be
up<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.410> 5,000<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.490> my<00:00:29.640> own<00:00:29.820> miles<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.390> and

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
up to 5,000 of my own miles on it and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.139 
up to 5,000 of my own miles on it and
that's<00:00:32.070> probably<00:00:32.369> about<00:00:32.610> how<00:00:32.820> much<00:00:33.000> I

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
that's probably about how much I

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.549 
that's probably about how much I
normally<00:00:33.510> Drive<00:00:33.750> because<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.380> pretty

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
but I'm doing a sparkplug change you

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.569 
but I'm doing a sparkplug change you
know<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.960> uses<00:00:40.320> these<00:00:41.840> waterproof<00:00:43.280> auto<00:00:44.280> light

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
built into a distributor but then it

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.280 
built into a distributor but then it
uses<00:03:09.520> these<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:10.270> know<00:03:10.360> everything<00:03:10.810> shield<00:03:11.080> up

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
I like working on this thing there's

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.590 
I like working on this thing there's
none<00:04:20.680> of<00:04:20.709> this<00:04:20.950> having<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.489> block<00:04:22.030> it<00:04:22.270> up<00:04:22.360> to

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
none of this having to block it up to

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.090 
none of this having to block it up to
get<00:04:22.720> it<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:22.930> can<00:04:23.080> just<00:04:23.229> crawl<00:04:23.440> underneath<00:04:23.740> any

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
get it you can just crawl underneath any

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.870 
get it you can just crawl underneath any
place<00:04:24.370> I<00:04:24.580> mean<00:04:24.850> it

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
place I mean it

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.310 
place I mean it
high<00:04:26.060> enough<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.480> get<00:04:26.630> all<00:04:26.750> kinds<00:04:27.080> of<00:04:27.170> ground

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
high enough to get all kinds of ground

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.730 
high enough to get all kinds of ground
clearance<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:29.120> like<00:04:29.870> I<00:04:29.960> say<00:04:30.140> everything<00:04:30.530> is

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
clearance and like I say everything is

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.730 
clearance and like I say everything is
out<00:04:30.860> in<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:30.980> open<00:04:31.780> including<00:04:32.780> like<00:04:33.320> here<00:04:33.590> on

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
out in the open including like here on

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.790 
out in the open including like here on
the<00:04:33.860> gas<00:04:34.010> tank<00:04:34.310> it's<00:04:35.270> got<00:04:35.450> a<00:04:35.510> drain<00:04:35.780> plug<00:04:36.050> well

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
the gas tank it's got a drain plug well

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.040 
the gas tank it's got a drain plug well
it<00:04:37.100> just<00:04:37.130> makes<00:04:37.850> sense<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.450> drain<00:04:38.690> plug<00:04:38.930> on

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
it just makes sense that a drain plug on

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.390 
it just makes sense that a drain plug on
a<00:04:39.080> gas<00:04:39.320> tank<00:04:39.620> but<00:04:39.770> they<00:04:39.890> don't<00:04:40.070> do<00:04:40.250> that

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
a gas tank but they don't do that

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.030 
a gas tank but they don't do that
anymore<00:04:40.930> no<00:04:41.930> everything's<00:04:42.320> gonna<00:04:42.530> be<00:04:42.710> sealed

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
anymore no everything's gonna be sealed

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.870 
anymore no everything's gonna be sealed
up<00:04:44.500> or<00:04:45.500> plastic<00:04:46.160> this<00:04:46.280> is<00:04:46.340> a<00:04:46.520> good<00:04:46.790> metal<00:04:47.270> tank

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
up or plastic this is a good metal tank

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.980 
up or plastic this is a good metal tank
okay<00:04:49.880> here's<00:04:50.120> another<00:04:50.240> thing<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:50.720> don't<00:04:50.780> know
