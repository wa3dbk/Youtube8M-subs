okay<00:00:01.350> this<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.829> a<00:00:01.860> tutorial<00:00:02.190> on<00:00:02.760> motion

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
okay this is a tutorial on motion

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.289 
okay this is a tutorial on motion
tracking<00:00:03.480> in<00:00:03.870> Apple's<00:00:04.440> motion<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.299> what

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
tracking in Apple's motion and what

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.730 
tracking in Apple's motion and what
we're<00:00:06.420> going<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.629> do<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:07.140> we're<00:00:07.379> going<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.589> look

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
we're going to do is we're going to look

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.249 
we're going to do is we're going to look
at<00:00:08.000> the<00:00:09.000> behavior<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:10.219> analyze<00:00:11.219> motion<00:00:11.610> and

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
at the behavior of analyze motion and

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.099 
at the behavior of analyze motion and
match<00:00:13.259> move<00:00:13.849> so<00:00:14.849> since<00:00:15.360> we<00:00:15.509> have<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.780> video

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
match move so since we have this video

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.560 
match move so since we have this video
selected<00:00:16.850> well<00:00:17.850> first<00:00:18.119> let<00:00:18.240> me<00:00:18.270> tell<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.480> what

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
selected well first let me tell you what

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.900 
selected well first let me tell you what
we're<00:00:18.690> going<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.869> do<00:00:19.520> we're<00:00:20.520> going<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.699> add

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
we're going to do we're going to add

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.660 
we're going to do we're going to add
this<00:00:21.119> thought<00:00:21.510> bubble<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.980> top<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.430> baby

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
this thought bubble on top of the baby

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.330 
this thought bubble on top of the baby
and<00:00:24.230> we<00:00:25.230> wanted<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.529> track<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.010> baby's

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
and we wanted to track the baby's

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.960 
and we wanted to track the baby's
forehead<00:00:26.869> over<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:27.990> DV<00:00:28.470> video<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.220> as<00:00:29.849> you

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
forehead over this DV video and as you

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.920 
forehead over this DV video and as you
can<00:00:30.090> see<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.359> have<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> cut<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.859> video<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
can see we have a cut in the video and a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.160 
can see we have a cut in the video and a
very<00:00:33.930> shaky<00:00:34.380> camera<00:00:34.800> very<00:00:35.160> old<00:00:35.399> footage<00:00:36.170> and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
very shaky camera very old footage and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.690 
very shaky camera very old footage and
we<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.530> another<00:00:37.770> cut<00:00:38.040> coming<00:00:38.399> up<00:00:38.489> right

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
we have another cut coming up right

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.729 
we have another cut coming up right
there<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.510> we<00:00:39.660> got<00:00:39.809> three<00:00:40.020> cuts<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> short

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
there so we got three cuts in the short

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.950 
there so we got three cuts in the short
little<00:00:40.890> clip<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> want<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.750> is

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
little clip so what you want to do is

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.510 
little clip so what you want to do is
you<00:00:43.050> want<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.260> put<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> playhead<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.340> very

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
you want to put the playhead at the very

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.750 
you want to put the playhead at the very
first<00:00:44.789> frame<00:00:45.590> click<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> video<00:00:47.129> that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
first frame click on the video that

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.080 
first frame click on the video that
we're<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.090> apply<00:00:48.960> behavior<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:50.090> motion

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
we're going to apply behavior to motion

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.560 
we're going to apply behavior to motion
tracking<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.899> analyze<00:00:52.590> motion<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.570> it

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
tracking and analyze motion and it

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.650 
tracking and analyze motion and it
defaults<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.410> behaviors<00:00:56.070> tab<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.660> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
defaults to the behaviors tab and the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.479 
defaults to the behaviors tab and the
little<00:00:57.960> yellow<00:00:58.289> crosshair<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> middle<00:00:59.370> is

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
little yellow crosshair in the middle is

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.119 
little yellow crosshair in the middle is
the<00:00:59.520> tracker<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> when<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.379> click<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the tracker so when you click on it you

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.750 
the tracker so when you click on it you
get<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.719> exploded<00:01:03.719> view<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> video<00:01:04.760> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
get a exploded view of the video and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.219 
get a exploded view of the video and
what<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.030> want<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:06.630> want<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.960> find

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
what we want to do is we want to find

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.990 
what we want to do is we want to find
the<00:01:07.470> baby's<00:01:08.100> forehead<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.670> there's<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000

the baby's forehead so there's the
baby's<00:01:09.299> eyes<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.130> want<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.400> put<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
baby's eyes and we want to put the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.880 
baby's eyes and we want to put the
thought<00:01:11.909> bubble<00:01:12.180> about<00:01:12.750> right<00:01:13.020> there<00:01:13.290> we're

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
thought bubble about right there we're

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.580 
thought bubble about right there we're
going<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> track<00:01:14.340> his<00:01:14.549> forehead<00:01:14.970> right<00:01:15.150> there

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
going to track his forehead right there

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.039 
going to track his forehead right there
now<00:01:16.590> over<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.130> tracker<00:01:17.689> we<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.840> some

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
now over in the tracker we have some

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.980 
now over in the tracker we have some
more<00:01:19.200> parameters<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.420> defaults<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.450> smart

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
more parameters and defaults to smart

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.920 
more parameters and defaults to smart
retry<00:01:23.150> but<00:01:24.150> what<00:01:24.270> we're<00:01:24.420> going<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.810> hit

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
retry but what we're going to do is hit

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.719 
retry but what we're going to do is hit
analyze<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:26.000> if<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.270> tracking<00:01:27.720> goes<00:01:27.960> crazy

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
analyze and if the tracking goes crazy

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.850 
analyze and if the tracking goes crazy
get<00:01:29.729> ready<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.970> hit<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.180> escape<00:01:30.990> button<00:01:31.439> or

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
get ready to hit the escape button or

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.249 
get ready to hit the escape button or
you<00:01:32.100> could<00:01:32.250> click<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.579> stop<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.509> escape<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.229> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
you could click on stop but escape is a

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.960 
you could click on stop but escape is a
lot<00:01:34.470> quicker<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.610> we're<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.909> hit

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
lot quicker so we're going to hit

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.969 
lot quicker so we're going to hit
analyze<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.869> watch<00:01:37.170> how<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.530> thing<00:01:37.770> goes

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
analyze and watch how this thing goes

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.789 
analyze and watch how this thing goes
and<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.689> tracking<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> forehead<00:01:40.500> there<00:01:40.680> it

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
and it's tracking the forehead there it

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.310 
and it's tracking the forehead there it
goes<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.189> puts<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.460> dot<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.909> every<00:01:42.150> frame<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
goes it puts a dot for every frame the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:54.910 
goes it puts a dot for every frame the
positioning<00:01:43.979> data

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.670 

doing<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.880> great<00:01:56.119> job<00:01:56.150> of<00:01:56.390> tracking<00:01:56.780> hope<00:01:57.110> stop

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
doing a great job of tracking hope stop

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.730 
doing a great job of tracking hope stop
hit<00:01:58.100> escape<00:01:58.720> okay<00:01:59.720> so<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.140> got<00:02:00.290> off<00:02:00.439> because<00:02:00.710> it

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
hit escape okay so it got off because it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.800 
hit escape okay so it got off because it
did<00:02:00.950> was<00:02:01.040> a<00:02:01.130> cut<00:02:01.340> in<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.490> video<00:02:01.790> but<00:02:02.479> what<00:02:02.689> we

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
did was a cut in the video but what we

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.440 
did was a cut in the video but what we
can<00:02:02.960> do<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.470> we<00:02:03.770> can<00:02:03.799> reapply<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.520> analyze

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
can do is we can reapply the analyze

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.949 
can do is we can reapply the analyze
behavior<00:02:06.939> to<00:02:07.939> the<00:02:08.060> same<00:02:08.239> filter<00:02:08.479> on<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.720> same

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
behavior to the same filter on the same

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.970 
behavior to the same filter on the same
clip<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:10.250> we're<00:02:10.520> going<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.810> left<00:02:11.810> our<00:02:12.110> radar<00:02:12.680> oh

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
clip so we're going to left our radar oh

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.470 
clip so we're going to left our radar oh
and<00:02:13.280> that's<00:02:13.489> where<00:02:13.670> we<00:02:13.760> get<00:02:13.880> off<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:14.360> can

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
and that's where we get off and you can

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.710 
and that's where we get off and you can
see<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.690> dot<00:02:15.050> that's<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.130> key<00:02:16.340> frame<00:02:16.580> dot<00:02:16.880> so

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
see a dot that's the key frame dot so

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.059 
see a dot that's the key frame dot so
we're<00:02:17.870> going<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.050> drag<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:18.470> over<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
is we're going to put the tracker right

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.350 
is we're going to put the tracker right
on<00:02:26.810> top<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.530> dot<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:28.060> then<00:02:29.060> we're<00:02:29.239> going

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
on top of the dot and then we're going

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.680 
on top of the dot and then we're going
to<00:02:29.420> resume<00:02:30.550> analyzed<00:02:31.550> from<00:02:32.060> this<00:02:32.269> point<00:02:32.510> of

to resume analyzed from this point of
the<00:02:32.780> video<00:02:33.049> on<00:02:33.319> so<00:02:33.620> we<00:02:33.769> click<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.250> it's<00:02:34.910> going

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.070 
get ready to hit the escape button if it
goes<00:02:43.819> crazy<00:02:44.150> but<00:02:44.390> it's<00:02:44.540> doing<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.810> pretty<00:02:44.989> good

goes crazy but it's doing a pretty good

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.610 
goes crazy but it's doing a pretty good
job<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.410> staying<00:02:46.160> right<00:02:46.340> on<00:02:46.400> target<00:02:50.620> it's

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
job of staying right on target it's

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.470 
job of staying right on target it's
going<00:02:51.920> frame<00:02:52.190> by<00:02:52.370> frame

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
track so we're going to go back a couple

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.789 
track so we're going to go back a couple
of<00:04:16.229> frames<00:04:16.729> and<00:04:18.229> see<00:04:19.229> where<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.470> baton<00:04:19.680> hear

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
of frames and see where the baton hear

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.409 
of frames and see where the baton hear
the<00:04:19.919> little<00:04:20.070> head<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.729> little<00:04:20.970> girl's<00:04:21.180> head

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
the little head the little girl's head

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.090 
the little head the little girl's head
is<00:04:21.570> on<00:04:21.720> top<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:22.139> we<00:04:22.229> can't<00:04:22.440> find<00:04:22.710> where<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.889> go

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
is on top so we can't find where to go

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.129 
is on top so we can't find where to go
so<00:04:23.849> we<00:04:23.940> just<00:04:24.120> drag<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.300> go<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.780> next<00:04:24.900> frame

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
so we just drag it go to the next frame

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.770 
so we just drag it go to the next frame
take<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.530> weight<00:04:25.680> thought<00:04:25.860> drag<00:04:26.220> it<00:04:26.340> back

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
take the weight thought drag it back

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.029 
take the weight thought drag it back
advance<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.930> frame<00:04:28.200> go<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.650> white<00:04:28.770> dot<00:04:29.010> on

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
advance a frame go to the white dot on

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.680 
advance a frame go to the white dot on
that<00:04:29.310> frame<00:04:29.639> drag<00:04:29.940> it<00:04:30.090> back<00:04:30.560> next<00:04:31.560> frame<00:04:32.690> drag

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
that frame drag it back next frame drag

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.469 
that frame drag it back next frame drag
it<00:04:33.840> back<00:04:34.050> this<00:04:34.470> can<00:04:34.650> be<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.770> little<00:04:34.919> bit<00:04:35.099> tedious

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
it back this can be a little bit tedious

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.260 
it back this can be a little bit tedious
but<00:04:36.479> really<00:04:37.229> no<00:04:37.349> other<00:04:37.470> way<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.680> do<00:04:37.919> it<00:04:38.270> because

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
but really no other way to do it because

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.450 
but really no other way to do it because
the<00:04:39.479> this<00:04:39.900> footage<00:04:40.229> is<00:04:40.320> very<00:04:40.560> old<00:04:40.860> it's<00:04:41.099> DV

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
the this footage is very old it's DV

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.550 
the this footage is very old it's DV
it's<00:04:41.610> very<00:04:41.789> compressed<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.630> it's<00:04:43.380> very

it's very compressed and it's very

it's very compressed and it's very

blurry and there is no great region of

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.100 
blurry and there is no great region of
contrast<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:50.820> head<00:04:51.030> is<00:04:51.060> very<00:04:51.449> kind<00:04:51.810> of<00:04:51.960> a

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
contrast the head is very kind of a

contrast the head is very kind of a
bland<00:04:53.039> beige<00:04:53.340> color<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:54.030> it's<00:04:54.120> hard<00:04:54.300> to<00:04:54.419> keep

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
bland beige color and it's hard to keep

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.920 
bland beige color and it's hard to keep
the<00:04:55.470> track<00:04:55.710> but<00:04:55.949> what<00:04:56.130> you'd<00:04:56.280> want<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.490> do<00:04:56.610> is

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
the track but what you'd want to do is

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.180 
the track but what you'd want to do is
find<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:58.050> tracking<00:04:58.260> point<00:04:58.800> if<00:04:58.979> you<00:04:59.039> get

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
find the tracking point if you get

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.719 
find the tracking point if you get
really<00:04:59.400> good<00:04:59.520> clean<00:05:00.120> video<00:05:00.539> of<00:05:01.099> high<00:05:02.099> contrast

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
really good clean video of high contrast

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.330 
really good clean video of high contrast
and<00:05:03.150> then<00:05:04.110> it<00:05:04.260> would<00:05:04.410> have<00:05:04.889> a<00:05:04.949> much<00:05:05.190> better

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
and then it would have a much better

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.520 
and then it would have a much better
success<00:05:05.880> rate<00:05:06.120> of<00:05:06.270> tracking<00:05:09.289> the<00:05:10.289> source

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
success rate of tracking the source

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.420 
success rate of tracking the source
video<00:05:11.300> so<00:05:12.300> this<00:05:13.050> is<00:05:13.229> just<00:05:13.349> a<00:05:13.530> little<00:05:13.710> bit<00:05:13.949> of

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
video so this is just a little bit of

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.909 
video so this is just a little bit of
doing<00:05:14.970> it<00:05:15.090> frame<00:05:15.270> by<00:05:15.300> frame<00:05:15.500> but<00:05:16.500> for<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.770> most

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
doing it frame by frame but for the most

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.980 
doing it frame by frame but for the most
part<00:05:17.090> 99%<00:05:18.090> of<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:18.300> was<00:05:18.510> done<00:05:18.690> in<00:05:18.900> a<00:05:18.960> really

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
part 99% of it was done in a really

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.760 
part 99% of it was done in a really
great<00:05:19.400> way<00:05:20.539> by<00:05:21.539> the<00:05:21.599> by<00:05:22.169> the<00:05:22.199> tracking

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
great way by the by the tracking

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.800 
great way by the by the tracking
software<00:05:25.070> so<00:05:26.070> let's<00:05:26.910> just<00:05:27.090> call<00:05:27.270> it<00:05:27.300> a<00:05:27.419> day<00:05:27.570> for

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
software so let's just call it a day for

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.000 
software so let's just call it a day for
right<00:05:27.960> here<00:05:28.200> we're<00:05:28.409> going<00:05:28.530> to<00:05:28.590> go<00:05:28.650> back<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:28.830> the

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
right here we're going to go back to the

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.820 
right here we're going to go back to the
very<00:05:29.130> beginning<00:05:29.580> of<00:05:29.760> the<00:05:30.539> video<00:05:30.659> and<00:05:31.140> we're

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
very beginning of the video and we're

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.410 
very beginning of the video and we're
going<00:05:31.950> to<00:05:31.979> turn<00:05:32.159> on<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.400> thought<00:05:32.610> bubble<00:05:32.849> and

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
going to turn on the thought bubble and

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.390 
going to turn on the thought bubble and
we're<00:05:33.480> going<00:05:33.630> to<00:05:33.720> say<00:05:33.990> you<00:05:34.770> just<00:05:34.800> place<00:05:35.220> the

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
we're going to say you just place the

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.000 
we're going to say you just place the
thought<00:05:35.610> bubble<00:05:36.350> now<00:05:37.350> we're<00:05:37.560> going<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.770> apply

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
thought bubble now we're going to apply

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.620 
thought bubble now we're going to apply
another<00:05:38.280> filter<00:05:38.580> to<00:05:38.850> the<00:05:38.970> thought<00:05:39.150> bubble<00:05:39.180> so

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
another filter to the thought bubble so

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.440 
another filter to the thought bubble so
we<00:05:39.720> go<00:05:39.840> up<00:05:39.870> to<00:05:40.050> add<00:05:40.230> behavior<00:05:41.180> motion<00:05:42.180> tracking

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
we go up to add behavior motion tracking

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.340 
we go up to add behavior motion tracking
we're<00:05:42.930> going<00:05:43.080> to<00:05:43.140> add<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:43.860> match<00:05:44.070> move<00:05:44.460> and<00:05:45.350> it

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
we're going to add the match move and it

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.710 
we're going to add the match move and it
defaults<00:05:46.800> to<00:05:46.980> showing<00:05:47.970> you<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.300> parameters

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
defaults to showing you the parameters

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.640 
defaults to showing you the parameters
of<00:05:49.050> that<00:05:49.320> filter<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:49.950> you<00:05:50.790> can<00:05:50.970> see<00:05:51.120> how<00:05:51.300> the

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
of that filter and you can see how the

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.910 
of that filter and you can see how the
the<00:05:52.650> source<00:05:52.950> well<00:05:53.250> is<00:05:53.550> showing<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.150> video<00:05:54.390> and

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
the source well is showing the video and

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.990 
the source well is showing the video and
what<00:05:55.920> we<00:05:56.010> want<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.250> do<00:05:56.370> is<00:05:56.490> we<00:05:56.610> want<00:05:56.640> to<00:05:56.880> click

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
what we want to do is we want to click

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.120 
what we want to do is we want to click
on<00:05:57.470> the<00:05:58.470> analyze<00:05:58.860> motion<00:05:59.370> and<00:06:03.410> match<00:06:04.410> move<00:06:04.800> is

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
on the analyze motion and match move is

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.720 
on the analyze motion and match move is
going<00:06:05.430> to<00:06:05.550> match<00:06:05.970> the<00:06:06.930> move<00:06:07.200> of<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:08.310> analyze

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
going to match the move of the analyze

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.210 
going to match the move of the analyze
motion<00:06:09.090> filter<00:06:09.630> all<00:06:09.810> these<00:06:10.050> keyframe<00:06:10.740> dots<00:06:10.980> in
