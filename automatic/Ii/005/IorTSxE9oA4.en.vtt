it in this version of seasons now season
started<00:00:56.010> out<00:00:56.130> as<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> Halloween<00:00:56.850> version<00:00:58.070> for

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070

the iPhone iPod Touch and the iPad and

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.740 
the iPhone iPod Touch and the iPad and
what<00:01:02.640> they've<00:01:02.790> done<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.180> they've<00:01:03.360> expanded

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
what they've done is they've expanded

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.509 
what they've done is they've expanded
that<00:01:04.079> they've<00:01:04.350> changed<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.829> from<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.280> being

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
that they've changed it from just being

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.700 
that they've changed it from just being
Angry<00:01:05.969> Birds<00:01:06.180> Halloween<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.079> Angry<00:01:07.469> Birds

Angry Birds Halloween to Angry Birds
Seasons<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.640> I'm<00:01:08.790> assuming<00:01:09.119> they'll

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
Seasons and I'm assuming they'll

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.910 
Seasons and I'm assuming they'll
probably<00:01:09.750> add<00:01:10.170> different<00:01:10.380> things<00:01:10.770> like

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
probably add different things like

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.730 
probably add different things like
Easter<00:01:11.509> and<00:01:12.509> other<00:01:12.719> holidays<00:01:12.990> throughout<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
Easter and other holidays throughout the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.949 
Easter and other holidays throughout the
year<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.950> don't<00:01:14.069> know<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:14.700> sure<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:15.119> it's

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:15.959 
year I don't know that for sure but it's

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:17.840 
year I don't know that for sure but it's
just<00:01:16.170> an<00:01:16.380> assumption<00:01:16.709> because<00:01:17.159> they<00:01:17.310> continue

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
just an assumption because they continue

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.489 
just an assumption because they continue
to<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.090> very<00:01:18.119> successful<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:19.259> this

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
challenging than the original what I

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.359 
challenging than the original what I
really<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.409> about<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.859> is<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.249> they

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
really like about this is that they

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.980 
really like about this is that they
didn't<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.759> rid<00:01:41.969> of<00:01:41.999> the<00:01:42.209> Halloween<00:01:42.630> version
