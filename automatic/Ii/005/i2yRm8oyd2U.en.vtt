00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.660
 hello friends today we are going to learn to do 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.869
 the double high point is this symbol with 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.900
 two girls that cross it this is the 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.280
 point that we are going to learn 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.370
 here I have my 10 chains 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.910
 let's start working frame the 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.910
 last 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.630
 to give the height to the point I'm going to 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.329
 make 4 chains 1 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.180
 two 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.350
 3 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.230
 4 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.570
 in the chain that I have marked I will 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.540
 to do the point I'm going to do two laps 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.870
 the needle 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:00.489
 entered the chain 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.850
 I take out the lacing I have four points in the 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.850
 needle 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:11.790
 took out 2 I have left 3 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.960
 He took 2 I have two left and I take them out 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.300
 the two together I turn again spin 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.220
 two to the needle 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.910
 I enter 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.910
 I take out the lacing and I take out two by two 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.860
 double return to the needle I enter 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.860
 sack of two in two 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.150
 this is the double high point
