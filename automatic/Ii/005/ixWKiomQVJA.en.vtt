WrestleMania<00:05:18.160> and<00:05:18.880> extreme<00:05:19.330> rules<00:05:20.640> nobody

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
WrestleMania and extreme rules nobody

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.980 
WrestleMania and extreme rules nobody
cared<00:05:21.850> about<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.150> second<00:05:22.510> match<00:05:22.630> they<00:05:22.870> only

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
cared about the second match they only

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.690 
cared about the second match they only
really<00:05:23.260> wanted<00:05:23.680> to<00:05:23.770> see<00:05:23.980> that<00:05:24.130> first<00:05:24.400> match

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
really wanted to see that first match

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.000 
really wanted to see that first match
but<00:05:25.060> I<00:05:25.300> guess<00:05:25.690> oh<00:05:25.960> and<00:05:26.140> all<00:05:26.260> that<00:05:26.500> was<00:05:26.680> this

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
but I guess oh and all that was this

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.500 
but I guess oh and all that was this
that<00:05:27.400> could<00:05:27.550> match<00:05:27.760> in<00:05:27.940> the<00:05:28.060> third<00:05:28.270> match

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
that could match in the third match

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.270 
that could match in the third match
anyways<00:05:28.900> with<00:05:29.140> SummerSlam<00:05:29.680> being<00:05:29.920> the<00:05:30.070> first

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
anyways with SummerSlam being the first

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.720 
anyways with SummerSlam being the first
match<00:05:30.490> last<00:05:30.790> year<00:05:31.060> um<00:05:32.100> you<00:05:33.100> know<00:05:33.190> brockton

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
one time in my opinion and much like UFC

one time in my opinion and much like UFC
you<00:05:39.760> know<00:05:39.820> if<00:05:39.940> a<00:05:40.000> guy<00:05:40.120> fights<00:05:40.420> one<00:05:40.630> guy<00:05:40.810> he

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
you know if a guy fights one guy he

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.390 
you know if a guy fights one guy he
moves<00:05:41.140> on<00:05:41.290> any<00:05:41.320> fight<00:05:41.620> somebody<00:05:41.860> else<00:05:42.190> they

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
moves on any fight somebody else they

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.920 
moves on any fight somebody else they
might<00:05:42.550> do<00:05:42.730> a<00:05:42.760> rematch<00:05:43.150> down<00:05:43.420> the<00:05:43.540> road<00:05:43.720> but

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
might do a rematch down the road but

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.070 
might do a rematch down the road but
it's<00:05:44.110> not<00:05:44.460> back<00:05:45.460> to<00:05:45.610> back<00:05:45.730> to<00:05:45.850> back<00:05:45.880> and<00:05:46.300> I

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
it's not back to back to back and I

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.720 
it's not back to back to back and I
think<00:05:47.620> that's<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.830> way<00:05:47.860> they<00:05:48.130> need<00:05:48.490> to<00:05:48.580> look

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
think that's the way they need to look

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.220 
think that's the way they need to look
at<00:05:48.940> and<00:05:49.150> the<00:05:49.330> way<00:05:49.480> they<00:05:49.630> need<00:05:49.780> a<00:05:49.810> book<00:05:50.020> brock

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230

vs<00:06:10.060> Bryan's<00:06:10.480> got<00:06:10.660> me<00:06:10.810> really<00:06:10.990> pumped<00:06:11.380> for<00:06:11.500> a

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
vs Bryan's got me really pumped for a

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.700 
vs Bryan's got me really pumped for a
lot<00:06:11.680> of<00:06:11.830> stuff<00:06:13.170> but<00:06:14.170> just<00:06:14.380> for<00:06:14.530> some<00:06:14.680> reason

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
lot of stuff but just for some reason

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.290 
lot of stuff but just for some reason
the<00:06:15.340> one<00:06:15.550> thing<00:06:15.700> that's<00:06:15.820> probably<00:06:16.120> going<00:06:16.240> to

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
the one thing that's probably going to

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.080 
the one thing that's probably going to
be<00:06:16.360> the<00:06:16.450> main<00:06:16.660> event<00:06:16.960> I<00:06:17.490> don't<00:06:18.490> think<00:06:18.550> so<00:06:18.730> i

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
be the main event I don't think so i

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.910 
be the main event I don't think so i
think<00:06:19.270> that<00:06:19.540> Cena<00:06:19.930> and<00:06:20.050> Bryan<00:06:20.110> will<00:06:20.560> still<00:06:20.800> be

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
think that Cena and Bryan will still be

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.200 
think that Cena and Bryan will still be
the<00:06:21.010> main<00:06:21.160> event<00:06:21.310> especially<00:06:21.640> if<00:06:22.030> they're

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
the main event especially if they're

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.900 
the main event especially if they're
really<00:06:22.390> teasing<00:06:22.750> us<00:06:22.990> with<00:06:23.340> that<00:06:24.340> you<00:06:24.880> know

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
really teasing us with that you know

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.730 
really teasing us with that you know
that<00:06:25.210> briefcase<00:06:25.510> cash<00:06:26.020> in<00:06:26.260> because<00:06:26.380> I<00:06:26.620> think

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
that briefcase cash in because I think

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.230 
that briefcase cash in because I think
that'd<00:06:26.830> be<00:06:27.010> one<00:06:27.250> hell<00:06:27.490> of<00:06:27.520> a<00:06:27.700> way<00:06:27.850> to<00:06:27.880> in<00:06:28.120> the

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
that'd be one hell of a way to in the

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.290 
that'd be one hell of a way to in the
show<00:06:28.450> is<00:06:29.010> for<00:06:30.010> Daniel<00:06:30.910> Bryan<00:06:30.940> to<00:06:31.210> be
