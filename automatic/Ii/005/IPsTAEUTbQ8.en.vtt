00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
access lock and that's what seemed to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.480 
access lock and that's what seemed to
release<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.229> pieces<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.009> now<00:01:44.130> I'm<00:01:44.189> gonna<00:01:44.280> go

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
here it is and actually the best way to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.300 
here it is and actually the best way to
get<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.540> into<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.170> was<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.710> release<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
get it into it was to just release the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.160 
get it into it was to just release the
little<00:01:50.460> wire<00:01:50.700> clips<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> access<00:01:51.689> lock<00:01:51.899> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
little wire clips on the access lock and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.139 
little wire clips on the access lock and
then<00:01:52.890> there's<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.280> auto<00:01:53.430> versus<00:01:53.729> right<00:01:53.909> there

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
then there's the auto versus right there

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.010 
then there's the auto versus right there
it's<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.780> spring<00:01:56.420> yep<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.659> I'm<00:01:57.719> gonna<00:01:57.810> pull

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
it's just a spring yep so I'm gonna pull

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.459 
it's just a spring yep so I'm gonna pull
that<00:01:58.170> out<00:01:58.409> sorry<00:01:59.070> about<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.340> shaky<00:01:59.610> hands

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
see when I was pulling apart where this

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.610 
see when I was pulling apart where this
little<00:02:09.330> piece<00:02:09.599> came<00:02:09.840> from

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 
little piece came from

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
now I know this is all the safety

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.220 
now I know this is all the safety
assembly<00:02:13.420> there<00:02:13.600> I'm<00:02:13.750> not<00:02:13.900> gonna<00:02:14.020> put<00:02:14.200> that

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
assembly there I'm not gonna put that

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.050 
assembly there I'm not gonna put that
back<00:02:14.530> in<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.800> never<00:02:14.860> used<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.610> think<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:15.940> was

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
just a pole I guess it would be and then

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.820 
just a pole I guess it would be and then
this<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.060> skeletal<00:02:55.630> piece<00:02:56.260> that's<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:56.739> the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
is that all the pieces that's actually

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.370 
is that all the pieces that's actually
this<00:03:06.580> form<00:03:07.060> they<00:03:07.209> need<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.450> go<00:03:07.570> in<00:03:07.750> it's<00:03:08.050> just

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
this form they need to go in it's just

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.830 
this form they need to go in it's just
separated<00:03:08.830> now<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.790> I'll<00:03:10.120> pan<00:03:10.390> down<00:03:10.600> and<00:03:10.780> you

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
separated now and I'll pan down and you

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.210 
separated now and I'll pan down and you
can<00:03:10.989> see<00:03:11.230> when<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:11.830> put<00:03:11.980> all<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.190> pieces

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
can see when you put all the pieces

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.090 
can see when you put all the pieces
together<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.200> long<00:03:14.560> Lumina<00:03:14.920> beasts

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
together this the long Lumina beasts

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.789 
together this the long Lumina beasts
this<00:03:15.579> piece<00:03:15.790> here<00:03:16.120> actually<00:03:16.930> has<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.260> tip<00:03:17.590> that

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
this piece here actually has a tip that

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.400 
this piece here actually has a tip that
fits<00:03:18.519> into<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:19.060> little<00:03:19.390> recession<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:20.079> that

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
fits into a little recession in that

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.340 
fits into a little recession in that
skeletal<00:03:20.950> piece<00:03:21.600> when<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:22.690> do<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.019> you'll

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
skeletal piece when you do that you'll

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.920 
skeletal piece when you do that you'll
find<00:03:23.560> it<00:03:23.680> doesn't<00:03:23.860> want<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.040> stay<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.220> place

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
find it doesn't want to stay in place

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.930 
find it doesn't want to stay in place
but<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.140> pole<00:03:26.470> provided<00:03:27.130> keeps<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.579> in<00:03:27.670> place

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
but the pole provided keeps it in place

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.910 
but the pole provided keeps it in place
and<00:03:28.299> that's<00:03:28.480> held<00:03:28.750> in<00:03:28.930> in<00:03:29.350> place<00:03:29.650> by<00:03:29.860> the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
and that's held in in place by the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.430 
and that's held in in place by the
scales<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.549> knife<00:03:30.730> actually<00:03:31.170> there<00:03:32.170> she's

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
scales of the knife actually there she's

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.400 
scales of the knife actually there she's
maybe<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.910> aluminum<00:03:33.910> parts<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.329> knife<00:03:34.480> anyway

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
maybe a aluminum parts the knife anyway

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.370 
maybe a aluminum parts the knife anyway
so<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:35.680> put<00:03:36.280> that<00:03:36.310> in<00:03:36.730> position<00:03:37.510> on<00:03:37.720> top<00:03:38.140> of

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
so you put that in position on top of

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.800 
so you put that in position on top of
the<00:03:38.590> limited<00:03:39.400> bar<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.239> that'll<00:03:40.480> hold<00:03:40.630> it

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
the limited bar and that'll hold it

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.440 
the limited bar and that'll hold it
tight<00:03:41.019> and<00:03:41.640> when<00:03:42.640> you<00:03:42.760> put<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.000> aluminum<00:03:43.120> bar

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
tight and when you put the aluminum bar

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.420 
tight and when you put the aluminum bar
and<00:03:43.600> you<00:03:43.660> want<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.930> put<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.709> down<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.220> hook

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
and you want to put it down and hook

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.340 
and you want to put it down and hook
over<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.940> axis<00:03:46.420> lock<00:03:46.630> that's<00:03:46.900> actually<00:03:47.230> how

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
over the axis lock that's actually how

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.350 
over the axis lock that's actually how
it<00:03:47.470> works<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:48.670> you'll<00:03:48.790> see<00:03:48.970> how<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.150> have<00:03:49.329> it

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
it works so you'll see how I have it

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.759 
it works so you'll see how I have it
there<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.690> best<00:03:49.840> way<00:03:49.989> to<00:03:50.019> just<00:03:50.320> insert<00:03:50.650> it

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
there the best way to just insert it

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.979 
there the best way to just insert it
into<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.040> knife<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.400> hook<00:03:51.579> it<00:03:51.700> down<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.120> then

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
into the knife and hook it down and then

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.960 
into the knife and hook it down and then
you<00:03:53.140> drop<00:03:53.380> that<00:03:53.530> piece<00:03:53.769> down<00:03:53.980> set<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.579> pole<00:03:54.760> in

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
you drop that piece down set the pole in

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.960 
you drop that piece down set the pole in
and<00:03:55.209> that'll<00:03:56.110> keep<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.980> loose<00:03:57.220> safety<00:03:57.640> button

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
and that'll keep the loose safety button

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.500 
and that'll keep the loose safety button
in<00:03:58.209> place<00:03:58.510> right<00:03:58.780> there<00:03:59.130> now<00:04:00.130> I<00:04:00.549> know<00:04:01.329> this

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
in place right there now I know this

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.509 
in place right there now I know this
isn't<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.780> best<00:04:02.019> description<00:04:02.560> but<00:04:03.370> it's

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
isn't the best description but it's

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.100 
isn't the best description but it's
better<00:04:03.670> than<00:04:03.790> nothing<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.299> I<00:04:04.480> could<00:04:04.750> not<00:04:04.870> find

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
better than nothing and I could not find

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.530 
better than nothing and I could not find
anything<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.430> was<00:04:06.670> able<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:07.030> finally<00:04:07.269> get

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
anything so I was able to finally get

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.810 
anything so I was able to finally get
that<00:04:07.570> safety<00:04:08.290> put<00:04:08.440> back<00:04:08.590> together<00:04:08.769> but<00:04:09.519> I<00:04:09.549> did

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
that safety put back together but I did

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.099 
that safety put back together but I did
choose<00:04:10.359> to<00:04:10.540> go<00:04:10.660> without<00:04:10.930> it

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
choose to go without it

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.470 
choose to go without it
hey<00:04:11.620> guys<00:04:11.799> here's<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.190> final<00:04:12.370> result<00:04:12.640> my

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
bench made mini barrage manual open I

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.550 
bench made mini barrage manual open I
really<00:04:17.560> like<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:17.950> result<00:04:18.100> I<00:04:19.140> now<00:04:20.140> get<00:04:20.349> from

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.589 
really like the result I now get from
this<00:04:20.650> knife<00:04:20.859> what<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.099> wanted<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.640> can<00:04:22.210> carry<00:04:22.539> it

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
this knife what I wanted I can carry it

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.800 
this knife what I wanted I can carry it
more<00:04:22.870> as<00:04:22.960> an<00:04:23.080> EDC<00:04:23.320> without<00:04:23.800> raising<00:04:24.130> I

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
more as an EDC without raising I

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.170 
more as an EDC without raising I
I<00:04:24.870> feel<00:04:25.680> like<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:25.979> can<00:04:26.129> use<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.460> exes<00:04:26.789> lots<00:04:27.060> more

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
I feel like I can use the exes lots more

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.600 
I feel like I can use the exes lots more
as<00:04:27.509> it<00:04:27.659> was<00:04:27.780> intended<00:04:28.050> once<00:04:28.979> I<00:04:29.069> figure<00:04:29.370> out<00:04:29.520> how

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
as it was intended once I figure out how

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.249 
as it was intended once I figure out how
to<00:04:29.669> keep<00:04:29.819> it<00:04:29.939> from<00:04:30.030> bouncing<00:04:30.439> and<00:04:33.139> more<00:04:34.139> than

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
to keep it from bouncing and more than

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:35.270 
to keep it from bouncing and more than
that<00:04:34.379> the<00:04:34.500> nice<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.650> little<00:04:34.830> bit<00:04:35.039> easier<00:04:35.250> to

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
that the nice a little bit easier to

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.890 
that the nice a little bit easier to
keep<00:04:35.460> clean<00:04:35.520> now<00:04:36.300> that<00:04:36.419> I've<00:04:36.509> removed<00:04:36.810> that

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
keep clean now that I've removed that

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.339 
keep clean now that I've removed that
inner<00:04:38.300> safety<00:04:39.300> I<00:04:39.449> can<00:04:39.689> just<00:04:39.810> kind<00:04:39.960> of<00:04:39.990> blow<00:04:40.199> out

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
inner safety I can just kind of blow out

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.080 
inner safety I can just kind of blow out
any<00:04:40.469> pocket<00:04:40.830> line<00:04:40.949> or<00:04:41.069> whatever<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.550> it's

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
any pocket line or whatever and it's

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.309 
any pocket line or whatever and it's
actually<00:04:42.449> a<00:04:42.479> little<00:04:42.599> bit<00:04:42.689> lighter<00:04:43.020> nothing

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
actually a little bit lighter nothing

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.279 
actually a little bit lighter nothing
noticeable<00:04:43.770> but<00:04:43.919> it<00:04:44.009> is<00:04:44.210> I<00:04:45.210> know<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:46.020> lot<00:04:46.259> of

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
noticeable but it is I know a lot of

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.450 
noticeable but it is I know a lot of
