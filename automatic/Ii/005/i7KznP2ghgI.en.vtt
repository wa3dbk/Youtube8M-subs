what<00:01:45.700> I'm<00:01:45.820> going<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.030> do<00:01:46.210> is<00:01:46.330> I'm<00:01:46.479> going<00:01:46.509> to

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:54.390 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
like<00:01:47.909> do<00:01:48.909> it<00:01:48.940> just<00:01:49.630> concentrate<00:01:50.380> on<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.680> Sally

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.910 

I<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:58.450> do<00:01:58.690> find<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.200> bronzing<00:01:59.680> powder

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
I really do find the bronzing powder

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.620 
I really do find the bronzing powder
really<00:02:00.790> works<00:02:01.060> well<00:02:01.450> on<00:02:01.980> my<00:02:02.980> skin<00:02:03.010> type<00:02:03.430> I'm<00:02:03.630> in

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
really works well on my skin type I'm in

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.070 
really works well on my skin type I'm in
between<00:02:04.810> fair<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.800> medium<00:02:06.660> probably<00:02:07.660> mostly

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
between fair and medium probably mostly

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.220 
between fair and medium probably mostly
medium<00:02:09.240> but<00:02:10.240> this<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:10.570> how<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.840> looks<00:02:11.080> like

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
medium but this is how it looks like

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.120 
medium but this is how it looks like
when<00:02:11.410> it's<00:02:11.590> on<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:17.080> think<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.650> only<00:02:17.830> comes

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
when it's on and I think this only comes

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.690 
when it's on and I think this only comes
in<00:02:18.280> one<00:02:18.310> color<00:02:18.520> with<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.660> blush<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.590> find<00:02:21.100> that

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
in one color with the blush I find that

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.230 
in one color with the blush I find that
when<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.090> put<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.660> when<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.440> just<00:02:23.740> kind<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.940> put<00:02:25.150> it

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
when I put it when I just kind of put it

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.150 
when I put it when I just kind of put it
on<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.450> brush<00:02:25.720> like<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:27.600> nothing<00:02:28.600> goes<00:02:28.900> on<00:02:29.260> I

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
on the brush like that nothing goes on I

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.380 
on the brush like that nothing goes on I
finally<00:02:31.000> doesn't<00:02:31.360> come<00:02:31.600> off<00:02:31.870> easily<00:02:33.270> even<00:02:34.270> if

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
finally doesn't come off easily even if

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.090 
finally doesn't come off easily even if
I<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:34.840> try<00:02:35.170> as<00:02:35.230> hard<00:02:35.560> as<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.860> can<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:38.770> only<00:02:38.800> a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
I like try as hard as I can the only a

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.080 
I like try as hard as I can the only a
little<00:02:39.459> bit<00:02:39.760> goes<00:02:40.060> on<00:02:40.709> not<00:02:41.709> so<00:02:42.100> much<00:02:42.370> but<00:02:42.640> it

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
little bit goes on not so much but it

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.540 
little bit goes on not so much but it
seems<00:02:43.450> like<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.720> only<00:02:43.750> have<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.380> dig<00:02:45.070> in<00:02:45.280> there

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
seems like you only have to dig in there

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:54.250 
seems like you only have to dig in there
to<00:02:45.760> music

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.929
