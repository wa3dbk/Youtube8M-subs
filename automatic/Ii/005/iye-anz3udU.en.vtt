00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
because the in dirt they eaten case is

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.649 
because the in dirt they eaten case is
dumb<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.170> dirt<00:01:37.520> now<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.579> see<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:38.970> how<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.509> in

now there's no longer water blocks here
it's<00:02:04.920> been<00:02:05.070> dirt<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:06.030> replace<00:02:06.360> iron

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
it's been dirt it can replace iron

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.430
