 what a beautiful words the box is in the shape of a book 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:43.529
 also the history of these cards that are cards 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:47.929
 they have almost the same laugh just that I am a lesbian and the good thing I care about 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:51.009
 because these cards, like you can book, don't like chords 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:57.189
 I am a whole there is no white border that I help many times in this 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.359
 In this case, we don't need the white border because they are cards 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.659
 who have no utility 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.929

 which continues there is the card no buildings qua march drops more flights 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.140
 and it is very nice to you as a deckhouse certainly see the cards when 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.260
 if he sees so they get confused 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.189

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.969
 have not left years for a free game lady writer get confused with 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.620

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.620
 White 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.939
 and yet these cards are ideal 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:23.069
 just for 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:24.920

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.490
 many gambling games 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.050
 how the hell you call it 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.370

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:20.420
 You order and these are rarely perfect cards for these types of games 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.510
 where we have to mix it there look how well they start to intersect for 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.839
 make the table-top mixture 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:31.619
 so let's not talk about it then the cards series the cards I put in the end 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:36.709

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:04.309
 then from the deck goes out of the logical race ranks a card that now comes out 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:06.229
