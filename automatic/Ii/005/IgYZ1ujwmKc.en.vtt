 canteen 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.370

 I have a video about massage lines 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:17.350
 channel now we have a clean face and 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:22.930
 proceed to applying the mask in the recipe 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:25.600
 it is written to wash off after 20 minutes but also as i 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.530
 I understand that you need to wait until clay 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.680
 dries completely so after i tell you 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.180
 I will say how many minutes it really is 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:41.020
 it took me on white clay of course 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.480
 I did not seem to think she was too strong 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.680
 thick layer 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.540
 eye area we avoided 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.599
 for the area around the eyes there are 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.019
 separate masks that also have 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:58.549
 I added a cucumber on the channel 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:01.760
 Masochka very fresh fresh smell 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.370
 cucumber also whitens the skin 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.739
 whitening masks remind we do 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.849
 either vecha 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.140
 either then when we will not go on 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.350
 Sun 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.140
 [music] 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.270
 Iâ€™ll put a little on this zone 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.400
 recommend to apply but where you have it 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.950
 me there freckles 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.580
 so I will put here a little to 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.470
 to 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.720
 may be a little skin on sawn all 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.460
 I expect then I will tell you how much 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.309
 glorification 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.309
 [music] 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.780
 and so it took not 20 minutes as I said 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.930
 30 minutes passed in 30 minutes mask 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.599
 completely dried off I washed it for a long time and 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.370
 Now I have a red face from either 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.650
 the fact that I'm not going to wash away any water 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.220
 due to 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.900
 white clay is not clear but the skin is soft 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.319
 very pretty I hope it is all 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.780
 the redness will come down and everything will be fine but 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.220
 full effect after the first time 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.060
 it is very difficult to speak 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.110
 this mask should be done once or twice in 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.000
 a week is better once a week and at least 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.760
 procedures 10 and then it will be possible to see 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.320
