the<00:00:08.099> Maximo<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.150> said<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
the Maximo and you said this is the

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.470 
the Maximo and you said this is the
world's<00:00:10.110> first<00:00:10.320> two<00:00:11.040> cylinder<00:00:11.429> CRD<00:00:12.179> engine

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
world's first two cylinder CRD engine

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.850 
world's first two cylinder CRD engine
and<00:00:12.630> that's<00:00:12.900> one<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.290> highlights<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.740> the

Maximo

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
Maximo
would<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.549> tell<00:00:14.700> us<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.820> little<00:00:14.880> bit<00:00:15.120> more

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
would you tell us a little bit more

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.550 
would you tell us a little bit more
about<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> development<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.320> engine

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
about the development of this engine

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.400 
about the development of this engine
yeah<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.699> said<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.300> first<00:00:18.510> two

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
yeah this said it's the first two

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.720 
yeah this said it's the first two
cylinder<00:00:19.980> for<00:00:20.640> Val<00:00:20.910> direct<00:00:21.810> overhead<00:00:22.140> cam<00:00:22.730> CID

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.359 
cylinder for Val direct overhead cam CID
engine<00:00:23.910> we<00:00:24.570> started<00:00:24.900> work<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.529> about

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
engine we started work on this about

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.880 
engine we started work on this about
nine<00:00:26.760> months<00:00:27.000> back<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:28.289> first<00:00:28.529> set<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
nine months back we first set the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.250 
nine months back we first set the
concept<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:30.560> if<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.740> know<00:00:32.009> correctly<00:00:32.989> this<00:00:33.989> is

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
concept so if I know correctly this is

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.200 
concept so if I know correctly this is
the<00:00:34.530> fastest<00:00:34.980> development<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.700> an<00:00:35.880> engine

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
the fastest development of an engine

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.000 
the fastest development of an engine
anywhere<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> world<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.410> nine<00:00:37.680> months

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
anywhere in the world in nine months

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.860 
anywhere in the world in nine months
from<00:00:38.129> concept<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> delivery<00:00:39.239> okay

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
from concept to delivery okay

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.130 
from concept to delivery okay

uses an IDI engine at what stage did in
the<00:01:12.510> development<00:01:12.900> did<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.140> decide<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> CR

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the development did you decide on the CR

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.749 
the development did you decide on the CR
D<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> specific<00:01:15.240> engine<00:01:15.540> configuration

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
D and the specific engine configuration

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.080 
D and the specific engine configuration
well<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:18.659> did<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.200> sometime<00:01:19.860> about<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.580> year

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
well we did that sometime about a year

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.020 
well we did that sometime about a year
and<00:01:21.210> year<00:01:21.479> back<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.380> was<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> CR<00:01:23.400> d<00:01:23.520> required

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
and year back and was the CR d required

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.700 
and year back and was the CR d required
to<00:01:24.330> meet<00:01:24.540> your<00:01:24.720> performance<00:01:25.170> norms<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.500> was<00:01:25.619> it

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
to meet your performance norms or was it

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.960 
to meet your performance norms or was it
one<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.040> ways<00:01:26.189> one<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> things<00:01:26.880> that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
one of the ways one of the things that

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.760 
one of the ways one of the things that
you<00:01:27.060> would<00:01:27.150> say<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.780> continuously<00:01:28.259> upgrade

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
you would say we continuously upgrade

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.990 
you would say we continuously upgrade
and<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.090> we<00:01:30.090> know<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.509> CR<00:01:30.810> T<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.320> be

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
and we we know that CR T is going to be

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.940 
and we we know that CR T is going to be
the<00:01:33.000> engine<00:01:33.360> required<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:33.990> times<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.320> come<00:01:34.590> so

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
the engine required for times to come so

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.350 
the engine required for times to come so
therefore<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.369> start<00:01:35.700> earlier<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> better

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
therefore if we start earlier the better

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.260 
therefore if we start earlier the better
can<00:01:37.110> deploy<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:38.000> model<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.240> can

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
can deploy it on this model you can

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.390 
can deploy it on this model you can
deploy<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.900> other<00:01:40.049> platforms<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.950> when<00:01:41.310> do

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
deploy it on other platforms and when do

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.859 
deploy it on other platforms and when do
you<00:01:41.460> think<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.790> kind<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.030> deployment<00:01:42.270> will

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
you think that kind of deployment will

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.480 
you think that kind of deployment will
happen<00:01:43.140> well<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:43.560> continuous<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
happen well it's continuous it's on the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.300 
happen well it's continuous it's on the
on<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.090> way<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:46.020> other<00:01:46.320> variants<00:01:47.159> on

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
on the way and we have other variants on

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.219 
on the way and we have other variants on
which<00:01:47.490> we<00:01:47.640> are<00:01:47.729> working<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.780> engine

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
which we are working with this engine

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.050 
which we are working with this engine
