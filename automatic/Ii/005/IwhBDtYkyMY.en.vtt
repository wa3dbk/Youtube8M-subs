00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.170
 for buses in a public sphere 5 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.500
 very complicated 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.330
 there is nothing to dread we can do it simply is fast enough if 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.559
 we have the technique 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.829
 e i will show you happy 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.829
 my technique and I then took the upper hand and complicity 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.889
 both want to work with pressure rising but taking water 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.699
 he is presumed on a paul part 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.029
 but you people are parading a tale now I'm not going to do 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.130
 in front of your eyes 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.960
 they are dealing with a bubble 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
 axa we take the tilly 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.619
 a trace any line 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.720
 precious element second 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.720
 see to make a bubble shape of the tumble 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.380
 we change we take a color 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.720
 the bailout plan we do not care 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.260
 and we appreciate and half 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.830
 for cuts 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.220
 then you have to fill with the little filling propensity as you want 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.570
 we filled it with neon green 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.780
 concluding at the cud since time 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.020
 then in homes 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.680
 and this time we will type the text 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.170
 so leave him if the parent 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.140
 it's marked on the head 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.110
 we enlarge the inde computing text box not all we want to 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.110
 two years 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.070
 I can not easily 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.070
 preclinical 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.730
 this time see for example 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.550
 stromae if I do not even know if harper to the body how to deal with it 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.110
 so 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.770
 we still need how we will see against the risk of anger 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.800
 so I put black 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.370
 the g-8 of genes 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.050
 I take a small selection 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.570
 the work must be focused so it's the sprick and a half select and 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.440
 then placed there 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.010
 it's too easy 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.010
 selected on August 30th 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.810
 yeah well I understood young participant taxes plus for its part what I saw 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.329
 francis salagoÃ¯ty 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.739
 ben spies fiat-yamaha you advocate suede you having him extended the 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.839
 rounded rectangle go over time so we say 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:19.549
 and we make people about the size of the text since it is necessary that the south texas 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.449
 in the city 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.949
 and we do that 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.139
 of their waves so I take the neon green 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.139
 I take little painting and I fill 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:33.179
 he then puts the cud that we did just now 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.659
 we will place it 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.999
 on the basis of all the remarks well 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.989
 it's not that easy 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.999
 we can not forget 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:44.689
 multi magic 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.749
 it seems that in the white high school that makes disappear whites who turn 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:50.609
 but that will not make the greens disappear 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.709
 % due to the so I'm not mistaken 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.479
 the postulate 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:58.159
 I'll take them only a clever 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.249
 I am soothed the street 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.249
 so between personal loans I'm too happy 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:07.709
 and then we take a little white 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.039
 washington dulles 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:12.039
 he just has to put the text one does not select 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.369
 and spahic to mix this principle 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:17.499
 weird actually write themselves a piece of this mechanism 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.409
 so these effects have a mission structure somehow
