00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
period or the switch between like just

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.180 
period or the switch between like just
turning<00:02:14.200> one<00:02:14.350> way<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.709> turning<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.069> other

what<00:03:42.260> EA<00:03:42.440> does<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:43.070> it's<00:03:43.190> a<00:03:43.280> mistake<00:03:43.610> on<00:03:43.730> their

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
what EA does and it's a mistake on their

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.080 
what EA does and it's a mistake on their
their<00:03:44.299> part<00:03:44.600> is<00:03:44.810> they<00:03:45.549> focus<00:03:46.549> too<00:03:46.760> much<00:03:46.790> on

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
their part is they focus too much on

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.470 
their part is they focus too much on
small<00:03:47.510> things<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:48.019> expect<00:03:48.380> everyone<00:03:48.950> to<00:03:49.190> be

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
small things and expect everyone to be

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.770 
small things and expect everyone to be
so<00:03:51.100> like<00:03:52.100> happy<00:03:52.430> that<00:03:52.850> they<00:03:53.030> fixed<00:03:53.450> something

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
so like happy that they fixed something

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.560 
so like happy that they fixed something
so<00:03:54.140> small<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.950> like<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.940> true<00:03:56.150> performance

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
so small and like the true performance

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.110 
so small and like the true performance
skating<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:57.140> was<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.290> big<00:03:57.890> fix<00:03:58.280> but<00:03:58.610> to<00:03:58.970> be

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
skating that was a big fix but to be

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.630 
skating that was a big fix but to be
honest<00:03:59.510> hope<00:04:00.079> like<00:04:00.560> I<00:04:00.829> didn't<00:04:01.250> find<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.579> that

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
honest hope like I didn't find it that

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.370 
honest hope like I didn't find it that
greedy<00:04:02.030> like<00:04:02.269> I<00:04:02.390> said<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:02.690> turning<00:04:02.989> stuff<00:04:03.200> was

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
greedy like I said the turning stuff was

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.949 
greedy like I said the turning stuff was
really<00:04:03.829> bad<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.250> they<00:04:04.970> are<00:04:05.090> updating<00:04:05.329> it<00:04:05.810> they

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
really bad and they are updating it they

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.330 
really bad and they are updating it they
put<00:04:06.079> Doug<00:04:06.260> trailer<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.680> couple<00:04:06.980> days<00:04:07.100> ago<00:04:07.130> you

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
put Doug trailer a couple days ago you

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.860 
put Doug trailer a couple days ago you
can<00:04:07.549> check<00:04:07.730> that<00:04:07.760> out<00:04:07.940> it's<00:04:08.209> our<00:04:08.269> previous

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
can check that out it's our previous

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.590 
can check that out it's our previous
video<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.820> that<00:04:10.820> that<00:04:11.120> thing<00:04:11.329> was<00:04:11.360> pretty

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
video and that that thing was pretty

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.490 
video and that that thing was pretty
cool<00:04:12.220> but<00:04:13.220> like<00:04:13.480> they<00:04:14.480> put<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:15.019> broken<00:04:15.470> glass

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
cool but like they put the broken glass

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.740 
cool but like they put the broken glass
and<00:04:15.980> stuff<00:04:16.190> I'd<00:04:16.310> rather<00:04:16.489> them<00:04:16.789> not<00:04:17.000> have

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
and stuff I'd rather them not have

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.630 
and stuff I'd rather them not have
broken<00:04:17.959> glass<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:18.590> have<00:04:18.979> smoother<00:04:19.489> gameplay

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
broken glass and have smoother gameplay

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.620 
broken glass and have smoother gameplay
then<00:04:20.919> just<00:04:21.919> then<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.850> opposite<00:04:23.390> you<00:04:23.510> know

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
then just then the opposite you know

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.690 
then just then the opposite you know
have<00:04:23.930> less<00:04:24.560> smooth<00:04:24.830> gameplay<00:04:25.100> in<00:04:25.340> broken

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
have less smooth gameplay in broken

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.790 
have less smooth gameplay in broken
glass<00:04:25.729> like<00:04:26.210> they<00:04:26.750> focus<00:04:27.110> too<00:04:27.229> much<00:04:27.260> on<00:04:27.470> small

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
glass like they focus too much on small

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.770 
glass like they focus too much on small
like<00:04:28.099> in<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.400> Nats<00:04:28.700> being<00:04:28.970> knocked<00:04:29.210> off<00:04:29.450> and

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
like in the Nats being knocked off and

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.930 
like in the Nats being knocked off and
stuff<00:04:29.990> there's<00:04:30.200> a<00:04:30.260> lot<00:04:30.440> of<00:04:30.470> small

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
stuff there's a lot of small

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.820 
stuff there's a lot of small
things<00:04:31.120> in<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.330> game<00:04:31.540> that<00:04:31.840> make<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.560> kind<00:04:32.710> of

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
things in the game that make it kind of

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.790 
things in the game that make it kind of
cool<00:04:33.040> but<00:04:33.730> I<00:04:33.970> just<00:04:34.600> want<00:04:34.810> them<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.050> have<00:04:35.230> solid

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
cool but I just want them to have solid

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.380 
cool but I just want them to have solid
gameplay<00:04:36.100> first<00:04:36.640> because<00:04:36.940> that's<00:04:37.060> what<00:04:37.240> it's

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
gameplay first because that's what it's

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.450

video<00:05:10.810> and<00:05:11.970> it's<00:05:12.970> so<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.120> couple<00:05:13.540> other<00:05:13.720> things

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
video and it's so a couple other things

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.050 
video and it's so a couple other things
I<00:05:14.260> probably<00:05:15.190> will<00:05:15.460> make<00:05:15.610> a<00:05:15.670> video<00:05:15.760> on<00:05:15.970> this

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
I probably will make a video on this

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.520 
I probably will make a video on this
later<00:05:16.360> so<00:05:16.570> I<00:05:16.600> won't<00:05:16.840> talk<00:05:16.990> about<00:05:17.110> it<00:05:17.230> but<00:05:17.440> the

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
later so I won't talk about it but the

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.930 
later so I won't talk about it but the
trail<00:05:17.740> cast<00:05:17.950> should<00:05:18.280> be<00:05:18.430> starting<00:05:18.670> up<00:05:18.760> pretty

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
trail cast should be starting up pretty

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.910 
trail cast should be starting up pretty
soon<00:05:19.090> I<00:05:19.390> finally<00:05:20.080> want<00:05:20.260> to<00:05:20.350> get<00:05:20.440> it<00:05:20.560> done<00:05:20.680> we've

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
soon I finally want to get it done we've

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.800 
soon I finally want to get it done we've
thrown<00:05:21.220> around<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:21.730> idea<00:05:21.940> before<00:05:22.150> people

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
thrown around the idea before people

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.940 
thrown around the idea before people
different<00:05:23.140> people<00:05:23.320> are<00:05:23.410> translated<00:05:23.860> and

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
different people are translated and

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.770 
different people are translated and
stuff<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:24.550> I<00:05:24.610> tried<00:05:24.880> to<00:05:24.940> start<00:05:25.150> it<00:05:25.210> before<00:05:25.510> but

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
stuff and I tried to start it before but

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.780 
stuff and I tried to start it before but
it<00:05:25.990> just<00:05:26.230> hasn't<00:05:26.530> been<00:05:26.770> going<00:05:26.980> well<00:05:27.070> I<00:05:27.400> am

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
it just hasn't been going well I am

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.480 
it just hasn't been going well I am
going<00:05:28.060> on<00:05:28.180> vacation<00:05:28.240> in<00:05:29.130> less<00:05:30.130> than<00:05:30.340> a<00:05:30.400> week

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
going on vacation in less than a week

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.480 
going on vacation in less than a week
now<00:05:30.970> so<00:05:31.690> probably<00:05:32.470> when<00:05:32.890> i<00:05:32.920> get<00:05:33.100> back<00:05:33.190> i'll<00:05:33.400> be

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
now so probably when i get back i'll be

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.190 
now so probably when i get back i'll be
starting<00:05:33.670> it<00:05:33.880> up<00:05:33.970> but<00:05:34.210> you<00:05:34.450> know<00:05:34.540> school<00:05:34.930> work

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
starting it up but you know school work

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.590 
starting it up but you know school work
and<00:05:35.530> just<00:05:36.370> the<00:05:36.520> gaming<00:05:36.850> out<00:05:37.000> it's<00:05:37.270> gonna<00:05:37.419> be

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
and just the gaming out it's gonna be

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.290 
and just the gaming out it's gonna be
tough<00:05:37.780> to<00:05:37.840> a<00:05:38.580> find<00:05:39.580> a<00:05:39.669> day<00:05:39.820> that's<00:05:40.060> good<00:05:40.210> for

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
tough to a find a day that's good for

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.110 
tough to a find a day that's good for
everyone<00:05:40.510> it's<00:05:41.320> and<00:05:41.800> like<00:05:42.280> who's<00:05:42.550> all<00:05:42.730> on<00:05:42.910> it

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
too so i'll probably put out a different

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.260 
too so i'll probably put out a different
video<00:05:45.130> on<00:05:45.340> that<00:05:45.370> i<00:05:45.550> won't<00:05:45.790> talk<00:05:46.000> too<00:05:46.150> much
