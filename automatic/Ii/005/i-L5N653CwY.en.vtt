alcohol<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.340> will<00:01:11.549> work<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:12.810> vessel<00:01:13.470> that

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
alcohol that will work the vessel that

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.830 
alcohol that will work the vessel that
I'm<00:01:13.710> using<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> standard<00:01:15.030> cube<00:01:15.360> which<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
I'm using is a standard cube which is

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.280 
I'm using is a standard cube which is
five<00:01:16.380> inches<00:01:17.030> five<00:01:18.030> by<00:01:18.270> five<00:01:18.540> make<00:01:18.960> sure<00:01:19.140> that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
five inches five by five make sure that

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.770 
five inches five by five make sure that
you<00:01:19.439> stick<00:01:19.860> with<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.130> same<00:01:20.310> size<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:21.030> you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
you stick with the same size because you

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.450 
you stick with the same size because you
can<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> different<00:01:22.320> outcome<00:01:22.680> if<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.250> use

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
can get a different outcome if you use

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.950 
can get a different outcome if you use
something<00:01:23.850> larger<00:01:24.299> or<00:01:24.479> smaller<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.960> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
something larger or smaller so the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.359 
something larger or smaller so the
recipe<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.770> one<00:01:29.159> large<00:01:29.420> antique<00:01:30.420> hydrangea

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
recipe is one large antique hydrangea

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.499

actually there are several colors to
choose<00:01:33.720> from<00:01:34.049> but<00:01:34.290> today<00:01:34.560> I'm<00:01:34.680> using<00:01:34.829> them

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
choose from but today I'm using them

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.609

antique<00:01:35.579> hydrangea<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.900> about<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.259> size<00:01:37.470> of

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
antique hydrangea it's about the size of

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.590 
antique hydrangea it's about the size of
my<00:01:37.770> head<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.310> about<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.850> size<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
my head it's about the size of a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.740 
my head it's about the size of a
cantaloupe<00:01:40.790> that's<00:01:41.790> why<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.000> only<00:01:42.119> need<00:01:42.360> just

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
cantaloupe that's why you only need just

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.980 
cantaloupe that's why you only need just
one<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.490> we're<00:01:44.610> going<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> cut<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.180> at<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> 45

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
one so we're going to cut this at a 45

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.050 
one so we're going to cut this at a 45
degree<00:01:46.140> angle<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:47.009> way<00:01:47.549> there's<00:01:48.000> more

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
degree angle that way there's more

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.480 
degree angle that way there's more
surface<00:01:48.689> area<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.409> we<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.649> drink<00:01:49.860> better<00:01:50.130> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
surface area so we can drink better and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.630 
surface area so we can drink better and
it<00:01:50.579> won't<00:01:53.600> we're<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.960> flop<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.439> in

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
it won't we're just going to flop it in

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.180 
it won't we're just going to flop it in
then<00:01:56.760> it<00:01:56.880> kind<00:01:56.970> of<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> little<00:01:57.450> bit<00:01:57.600> shorter

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
then it kind of it a little bit shorter

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.350 
then it kind of it a little bit shorter
because<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.280> don't<00:01:59.460> want<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.790> Teeter<00:02:00.060> one

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
because I don't want it to Teeter one

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.600 
because I don't want it to Teeter one
way<00:02:00.510> or<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.690> other

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
way or the other

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.680 
way or the other
try<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.790> conservative<00:02:03.210> when<00:02:03.570> you're

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
try to be conservative when you're

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.450 
try to be conservative when you're
cutting<00:02:03.930> because<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.890> hair<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.310> can

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
cutting because just like hair you can

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.309 
cutting because just like hair you can
always<00:02:05.640> cut<00:02:06.000> more<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.690> can't<00:02:06.960> add<00:02:07.200> to

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
always cut more but you can't add to

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.460

can get peonies all year round but

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.410 
can get peonies all year round but
really<00:03:48.650> in<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.400> off<00:03:49.550> seasons<00:03:50.060> they're<00:03:50.270> going

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.880 
really in the off seasons they're going
to<00:03:50.480> come<00:03:50.660> so<00:03:50.870> small<00:03:51.260> they're<00:03:51.530> going<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.710> come

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
to come so small they're going to come

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.890 
to come so small they're going to come
about<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.250> size<00:03:52.490> of<00:03:52.640> her<00:03:52.790> rose<00:03:53.000> therefore

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
about the size of her rose therefore

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.240 
about the size of her rose therefore
they're<00:03:54.050> not<00:03:54.080> worth<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.620> price

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
they're not worth the price

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.180 
they're not worth the price
that<00:03:56.030> way<00:03:56.230> when<00:03:57.230> we<00:03:57.260> can't<00:03:57.590> get<00:03:57.800> them<00:03:57.980> you'll

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
that way when we can't get them you'll

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.600 
that way when we can't get them you'll
get<00:03:58.400> garden<00:03:58.820> roses<00:03:59.030> which<00:03:59.450> are<00:03:59.690> just<00:03:59.990> as<00:04:00.200> nice

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
get garden roses which are just as nice

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.100 
get garden roses which are just as nice
not<00:04:01.610> quite<00:04:01.910> this<00:04:02.090> thing<00:04:02.330> but<00:04:02.660> I<00:04:02.690> don't<00:04:02.930> think

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
not quite this thing but I don't think

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:17.460 
not quite this thing but I don't think
you'll<00:04:03.440> be<00:04:03.560> disappointed<00:04:11.230> work<00:04:12.230> them<00:04:12.470> in

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:25.470 

I<00:04:22.770> tend<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:23.830> like<00:04:24.040> three<00:04:24.520> of<00:04:24.700> a<00:04:24.790> kind<00:04:24.820> together

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
I tend to like three of a kind together

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.040 
I tend to like three of a kind together
rather<00:04:25.780> than<00:04:25.930> two<00:04:26.440> three<00:04:27.370> visually<00:04:28.050> visually

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
rather than two three visually visually

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:51.420 
rather than two three visually visually
looks<00:04:29.500> better<00:04:29.820> than<00:04:30.820> two<00:04:31.290> so<00:04:47.310> cut<00:04:48.310> and<00:04:50.310> work<00:04:51.310> it

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
looks better than two so cut and work it

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.650 
looks better than two so cut and work it
down<00:04:51.460> into<00:04:51.790> your<00:04:52.030> hydrangea<00:04:53.790> as<00:04:54.790> you<00:04:55.270> can<00:04:55.450> see

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
down into your hydrangea as you can see

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.640 
down into your hydrangea as you can see
these<00:04:55.900> these<00:04:56.410> look<00:04:56.680> pretty<00:04:56.890> pretty<00:04:57.640> open<00:04:58.650> and

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
these these look pretty pretty open and

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.530 
these these look pretty pretty open and
I've<00:04:59.800> taken<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.220> foliage<00:05:00.580> off<00:05:00.910> when<00:05:01.480> you

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
I've taken the foliage off when you

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.630 
I've taken the foliage off when you
receive<00:05:01.900> these<00:05:02.080> roses<00:05:02.350> originally<00:05:03.190> they're

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
receive these roses originally they're

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.820 
receive these roses originally they're
going<00:05:03.790> to<00:05:03.850> be<00:05:03.940> closed<00:05:04.270> up<00:05:04.480> pretty<00:05:04.720> tight<00:05:05.080> and

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
going to be closed up pretty tight and

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.200 
going to be closed up pretty tight and
they're<00:05:06.400> gonna<00:05:06.490> be<00:05:06.670> looking<00:05:07.000> basically

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
they're gonna be looking basically

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.909 
they're gonna be looking basically
pretty<00:05:07.780> sad<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:09.250> same<00:05:09.550> for<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.240> peonies<00:05:10.919> you

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
pretty sad the same for the peonies you

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.010 
pretty sad the same for the peonies you
don't<00:05:12.100> want<00:05:12.340> them<00:05:12.550> shift<00:05:12.850> open<00:05:13.240> because<00:05:13.900> it

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
don't want them shift open because it

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.690 
don't want them shift open because it
will<00:05:14.140> damage<00:05:14.350> them<00:05:14.770> so<00:05:15.010> when<00:05:15.160> you<00:05:15.250> get<00:05:15.430> them

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
will damage them so when you get them

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.790 
will damage them so when you get them
when<00:05:16.390> I<00:05:16.419> got<00:05:16.660> these<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:16.900> few<00:05:17.050> days<00:05:17.350> ago<00:05:17.620> they

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
when I got these a few days ago they

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.090 
when I got these a few days ago they
were<00:05:17.860> completely<00:05:18.780> completely<00:05:19.780> tight<00:05:20.110> so<00:05:21.010> you

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
were completely completely tight so you

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.710 
were completely completely tight so you
