00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.529

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.600

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.930

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.300
 the one of sexy and if you want so that I want 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.010
 cure a villainous zombie villain because 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.800
 As you know you can make some farms 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.970
 that are made of iron and for that you need 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.289
 village lessons so I'm going to 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.369
 teach how it's done because inside 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.290
 little I will upload another video 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.559
 us well but how to make a farm 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.969
 of iron so for you to see how it 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.530
 does this good since you need two 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.239
 things you need a position of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.100
 throwaway weakness does not matter if it 's the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.020
 three minutes or one minute I do not know 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.000
 how long is the little one and you need 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.160
 also a golden apple what you have 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.930
 what to do is somehow get a 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.460
 zombie of these who are wandering around 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.680
 the world is not super complicated either 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.239
 get and you have to lock it in 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.789
 somewhere so that it does not escape in addition 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.710
 you have to throw it so that the sun does not 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.600
 I will kill you when you have it 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.070
 locked up you have to have him alone 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.659
 in agreement 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.250
 once you have it so isolated more or 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.800
 less like 8 yo with a berry that gives 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.960
 just simply isolated and covered 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.270
 the sunlight because you have to throw it 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.940
 the weakness portion 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.400
 throws and you see that now you have to 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.110
 the light the cones I'm going around 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.360
 here and before it is removed 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.880
 you have to throw a golden apple without 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.290
 enchantment or have you heard that 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.369
 noise is not worth because that noise wants 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.369
 say that good is freaking 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.210
 and now you have to wait a little while 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.740
 it's about 5 minutes or so and this is 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.600
 will convert a villager and you will already have a 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.520
 villager and when you have two villagers 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.049
 As you know, they are going to be 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.159
 sweethearts are going to leave little hearts and 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.119
 you will have many more villagers 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.799
 good and after waiting a little while 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.509
 As I said, we have a villager 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.100
 that is ready next to unicef ​​or with 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.600
 like like the zombie and telling me that yes 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.539
 you have same eye you want it same way 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.920
 as a child and nothing because here you have it 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.630
 this is all I hope you liked 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.549
