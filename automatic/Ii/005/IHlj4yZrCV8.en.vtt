00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello to all of us we see today 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.600
 how to make a pear puff pastry 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.769
 we will need as ingredients of the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.040
 puff pastry an egg yolk and 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.900
 pear jam first of all we 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.410
 let's cut a rectangle in our 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.410
 puff pastry 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.969
 at 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.280
 like these we will then spread out the 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.309
 jam on the middle of the patrol 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:52.059
 was taking care not to in 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:54.040
 put up to 1 cm from each edge a 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.070
 once done we will then use the 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:02.289
 rest of our puff pastry for 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:07.770
 cut strips of strips 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.770
 pretty thin like this 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:18.250
 then put egg yolk on the 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:23.920
 edge of our dough in order to solder the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:27.729
 puff pastry between one uses 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.909
 then our strips to make a 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.060
 grid all along the dough 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.060
 puff 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.940
 once done, then apply 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.940
 egg yolk on our paw 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.250
 then we will bake 1,200 for 10 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.250
 minutes 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.390
 this is our cooking time and finish 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.500
 our leaf is golden brown it does not 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.880
 remains more than to taste it 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.880
