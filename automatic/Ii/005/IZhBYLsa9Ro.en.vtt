00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:11.938
What is happening right now is the phenomenon that we call the economics of attention. 

00:00:11.938 --> 00:00:15.595
And we can listen to music and do homework at the same time,

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:19.096
but we cannot watch two channels or read the newspaper

00:00:19.096 --> 00:00:21.629
and surf the web on the iPad at the same time.

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:25.548
As a result we have to choose our primary channel for information. 

00:00:25.548 --> 00:00:28.160
The rule we have in economics is basically

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.556
 that content is king and communication is commodity. 

00:00:31.556 --> 00:00:34.247
I don’t really care which channel is broadcasting the Super Bowl,

00:00:34.247 --> 00:00:37.068
 I’m going to flip channels until I get to the Super Bowl. 

00:00:37.068 --> 00:00:41.718
My loyalty is not to channel X, Y and Z, but to the event itself. 

00:00:41.718 --> 00:00:48.483
As we move our attention to the cable television with dozens an dozens of offerings and the Internet.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.558
They get fewer viewership, less advertising, as a result less money for

00:00:52.558 --> 00:00:55.928
preparation of the news. That’s something that one expects.

00:00:55.928 --> 00:01:00.082
It’s a technological transition from the sailboat to the steamboat to the diesel  engine.

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:03.007
Many of us are still like the information aggregator. 

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:06.821
The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The USA Today, and so forth. 

00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:09.970
On the other hand, there is a great thirst for localized news.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.647
 What happens in my village? What happens to my friends?

00:01:12.647 --> 00:01:15.442
So you see this division of attention. 

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:20.614
Social media grabs a lot of our time because it talks about the individual which you are close with. 

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:24.532
It’s our family, our friends our work environment and so forth. 

00:01:24.532 --> 00:01:29.051
As a result we spend much less time on reading the printed media.

00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:32.082
To me the printed media is on the last leg of its life.

00:01:32.082 --> 00:01:34.851
It’s going to disappear in the next five to ten years. It’s too expensive 

00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:38.064
to print several dozen square feet on paper and

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:41.851
 deliver it to tens of thousands of houses in the average American city. 

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:45.561
Media companies are here to stay, but they are going to produce a lot more 

00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:50.028
of the soft media and the print on paper is a model that is pretty much dying out.

00:01:50.028 --> 00:01:53.816
We’ve always done a little bit of targeted advertising with the printed media. 

00:01:53.816 --> 00:01:58.570
But now we do micro targeting on individual by individual based upon your location,

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.443
 based on the time and based on your past purchases. 

00:02:01.443 --> 00:02:06.929
The idea is, you want to be far more focused because that yields the highest return for the buck. 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.456
The question is basically whether the advertising we see on Google 

00:02:10.456 --> 00:02:13.224
is effective or not given that we see so much of it.

00:02:13.224 --> 00:02:17.117
Advertising on Facebook is dramatically different than advertising on Google

00:02:17.117 --> 00:02:20.095
And why is that? When a user goes on Google, 

00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:22.864
they are searching to solve a problem. 

00:02:22.864 --> 00:02:26.860
How do I fix my car or what is the best model of BMW that I’m interested in. 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.059
When I’m going on Facebook, I’m not going to solve typically a problem, I want to entertain myself.

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.115
I want to see what’s going on with my friends, my family.

00:02:35.115 --> 00:02:39.687
So I’m looking for different things and thereby advertising on Facebook 

00:02:39.687 --> 00:02:43.709
while expensive has not been proven to be as effective as Google advertising.

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.949
With social media it gives a lot of power to the grass roots. 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:50.344
Companies are listening to what people write about the product,

00:02:50.344 --> 00:02:52.722
 product support, pricing and features. 

00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:57.659
And if there are a few unhappy customers, it’s like fire in the summer. You can’t stop it. 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.081
Same thing we see with the politics in the Middle East recently. 

00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:05.522
So both politician and business leaders are paying tremendous attention 

00:03:05.522 --> 00:03:10.093
to the great power that goes bottom up from the customer field base.
