00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.880
 the fans come in all shapes and sizes and privileged of everything for example 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.680
 frowned discussion m but for those fans it is pretty swallowing 

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:11.860
 for the first time in sixty years, suske and wiske will be completely new 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.150
 so put the jacket on the fact that the red card for example disappears 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.740
 you also go away for years, but also to the publishing house of the high 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.439
 time for modernization but he was all the exams 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.569
 I was sent though well I do and 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.830
 That's very good news for that too 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.830
 do you still have 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.330
 foxhol in the attic 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.250
 because 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.990
 they are a lot of money 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.240
 to everyone's surprise, the publishing house announced a few days before it 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.120
 appearance of the newest copy 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.860
 that has broken with years of tradition 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.880
 resident limited to we have a chance 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.280
 the wallonie 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.710
 for a lot of things in the world it has become much harder against the fire 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.820
 suske and wiske offices birthday boy with declining sales 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.790
 the circulation was kept up to par thanks to special often free releases 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.640
 businesses 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.560
 it is hoped that the new buy will breathe new life into the dynamic duo 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.620
 You are not above the law but also here that the past 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.610
 police is looking for one of the van online 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.619
 in that sense, new roundabout in Hoogeveen 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.820
 suske wiske books 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.820
 this is all curry cause with its all foreign gaming 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.610
 just like our largest collector, sergio ommel, 25 from brabant 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.880
 The gems from sixty years are in a converted, well-secured garage 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.899
 This is a so-called Flemish comic strip history 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.170
 big format 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.520
 extra large 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.180
 with pending drawings and 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.810
 and very special 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.440
 the surgeon by the all is the draftsman 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.450
 we just want to play 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.600
 estimated value of the complete collection 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.000
 40,000 euros as a testing ground I am not happy with the new exterior of the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.810
 albums all on the back 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.870
 there is a very famous tower on it 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.810
 marije to the rest of the middle east 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.210
 and use those of nearly 40 years 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.720
 it now comes to him with a valid 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.249
 That was a pity, but as a collector, it was no harm 

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:09.739
 becoming an old printer is therefore only worth more 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.630
 the very first album the first print it 46 that already delivers 3,000 euros in just 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.569
 On the internet that a million people would be watching is a sign of that 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.889
 want to be able to offer 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:23.089
 I'm having a lot of trouble with a tile and I've never had such a beautiful 6th stage 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:24.209
 comes sooner 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.659
 So there will undoubtedly be its value 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:27.799
 then the internet 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.159
 nevertheless it pays to search well in attics 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.730
 because in the past album gave you the seventies or eighties for free 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.879
 a pack of detergent 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.889
 which offered up to 20 euros 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:41.560
 what the colony in the picture that Kim Wiske all lacks in the collection of 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:43.879
 rooy now suppose you don't 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.439
 bump into 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.439
 and you have to pay 3000 euros for it 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:50.499
 then we cannot 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:54.209
 9 because in reality a quarter to three was also very fun alone 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.370
 Be I have I sell in many German spurter of the 500 meter copper pipes 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.799
 publishing standard is not just planning the new one 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.709
 but also releasing the old story in a new jacket
