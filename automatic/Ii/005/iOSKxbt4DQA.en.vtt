00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
act for fighting an elite pack if you

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.340 
act for fighting an elite pack if you
want<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.209> notice<00:02:35.510> he<00:02:35.690> really<00:02:35.930> doesn't<00:02:36.230> take

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
much damage at all and then his life on

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.370 
much damage at all and then his life on
hit<00:02:39.860> is<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.130> high<00:02:40.370> one<00:02:41.270> or<00:02:41.390> two<00:02:41.540> hits<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.200> his

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
spirit dump and then just save your

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.340 
spirit dump and then just save your
defensive<00:03:05.420> abilities<00:03:05.840> for<00:03:06.080> when<00:03:06.200> they're

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
defensive abilities for when they're

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
needed also make sure that breath of

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.790 
needed also make sure that breath of
heaven<00:03:08.720> buff<00:03:08.959> is<00:03:09.110> up<00:03:09.260> on<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.560> at<00:03:09.650> all<00:03:09.739> times

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
heaven buff is up on you at all times

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
and it's that that's all there is to it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.979 
and it's that that's all there is to it
you<00:03:13.340> notice<00:03:13.610> it<00:03:13.880> takes<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.209> lot<00:03:14.330> longer<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.690> kill

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
you notice it takes a lot longer to kill

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.540 
you notice it takes a lot longer to kill
things<00:03:15.230> but<00:03:15.560> that's<00:03:15.739> kind<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.160> trade-off

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
things but that's kind of the trade-off

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.120 
things but that's kind of the trade-off
the<00:03:17.420> more<00:03:17.600> tankier<00:03:18.079> you<00:03:18.290> are<00:03:18.410> obviously<00:03:18.680> the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
the more tankier you are obviously the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.690 
the more tankier you are obviously the
less<00:03:19.280> dps<00:03:19.790> you're<00:03:20.000> doing<00:03:20.329> so<00:03:21.230> but<00:03:21.590> it's<00:03:21.769> much

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
less dps you're doing so but it's much

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.780 
less dps you're doing so but it's much
cheaper<00:03:22.730> than<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.329> crit<00:03:23.570> build<00:03:24.549> okay<00:03:25.549> and<00:03:25.700> now

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
cheaper than a crit build okay and now

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
that the exercise only group proved just

that the exercise only group proved just
as<00:04:39.780> effective<00:04:40.320> in<00:04:40.470> alleviating<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:41.160> symptoms

of depression as the drug only group and

of depression as the drug only group and
what's<00:04:45.510> even<00:04:45.930> more<00:04:45.960> interesting<00:04:46.320> is<00:04:46.830> that<00:04:46.889> six

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
what's even more interesting is that six

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.000 
what's even more interesting is that six
months<00:04:47.760> later<00:04:48.080> they<00:04:49.080> found<00:04:49.350> of<00:04:49.740> those

group that did exercise and took drugs
saw<00:05:06.419> their<00:05:06.660> depression<00:05:06.990> return<00:05:07.530> so<00:05:08.340> when<00:05:08.550> the

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
saw their depression return so when the

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.610 
saw their depression return so when the
lead<00:05:08.790> researcher<00:05:09.000> was<00:05:09.510> asked<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.200> explain

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
lead researcher was asked to explain

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.370 
lead researcher was asked to explain
this<00:05:11.010> kind<00:05:11.520> of<00:05:11.580> puzzling<00:05:12.060> finding<00:05:12.660> his

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
this kind of puzzling finding his

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.550 
this kind of puzzling finding his
explanation<00:05:14.250> was<00:05:14.280> that<00:05:14.870> those<00:05:15.870> who<00:05:15.900> exercise

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
explanation was that those who exercise

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.409 
explanation was that those who exercise
may<00:05:17.010> have<00:05:17.130> felt<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.460> greater<00:05:17.700> sense<00:05:17.790> of<00:05:18.120> mastery

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
may have felt a greater sense of mastery

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.600 
may have felt a greater sense of mastery
over<00:05:18.720> their<00:05:19.260> condition<00:05:19.800> and<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:20.310> greater<00:05:20.520> sense

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
over their condition and a greater sense

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.820 
over their condition and a greater sense
of<00:05:20.910> accomplishment<00:05:21.210> that<00:05:21.840> may<00:05:22.470> have<00:05:22.590> felt

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
of accomplishment that may have felt

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.890 
of accomplishment that may have felt
more<00:05:23.070> self-confident<00:05:24.060> incompetent<00:05:24.780> because

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
more self-confident incompetent because

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.170 
more self-confident incompetent because
they<00:05:25.139> were<00:05:25.200> able<00:05:25.500> to<00:05:25.590> do<00:05:25.740> it<00:05:25.860> themselves<00:05:26.180> so

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
they were able to do it themselves so

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.210 
they were able to do it themselves so
what<00:05:27.390> this<00:05:27.690> tells<00:05:27.750> us<00:05:28.200> is<00:05:28.260> that<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.770> patients

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
what this tells us is that the patients

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.010 
what this tells us is that the patients
who<00:05:29.280> treated<00:05:29.550> their<00:05:29.760> depression<00:05:30.090> themselves

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
who treated their depression themselves

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.820 
who treated their depression themselves
by<00:05:31.169> just<00:05:31.710> exercising<00:05:32.510> they<00:05:33.510> practice<00:05:34.440> greater

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
by just exercising they practice greater

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.640 
by just exercising they practice greater
self<00:05:35.250> efficacy<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:36.150> in<00:05:36.810> doing<00:05:36.990> so<00:05:37.110> they<00:05:37.380> built

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
self efficacy and in doing so they built

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.190 
self efficacy and in doing so they built
more<00:05:38.520> confidence<00:05:39.240> in<00:05:39.360> themselves<00:05:39.539> they<00:05:39.930> built

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
more confidence in themselves they built

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.990 
more confidence in themselves they built
a<00:05:40.289> belief<00:05:40.620> in<00:05:40.830> themselves<00:05:41.010> that<00:05:41.340> they<00:05:41.610> could

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
a belief in themselves that they could

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.110 
a belief in themselves that they could
improve<00:05:42.840> their<00:05:43.080> lives<00:05:43.380> that<00:05:43.620> they<00:05:43.650> could<00:05:44.120> get

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
improve their lives that they could get

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.659 
improve their lives that they could get
a<00:05:45.180> handle<00:05:45.570> on<00:05:45.690> this<00:05:45.840> depression<00:05:46.520> so<00:05:47.520> I<00:05:47.550> think

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
a handle on this depression so I think

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.430 
a handle on this depression so I think
what's<00:05:47.940> even<00:05:48.210> more<00:05:48.240> interesting<00:05:48.600> than<00:05:49.229> the

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
what's even more interesting than the

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.520 
what's even more interesting than the
exercise<00:05:49.919> curing<00:05:50.310> depression<00:05:50.910> is<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:51.810> power

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
exercise curing depression is the power

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.190 
exercise curing depression is the power
of<00:05:52.710> self-efficacy<00:05:53.610> the<00:05:54.180> power<00:05:54.360> of<00:05:54.720> having<00:05:55.110> a

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
of self-efficacy the power of having a

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.980 
of self-efficacy the power of having a
belief<00:05:55.530> in<00:05:55.800> yourself<00:05:56.419> so<00:05:57.419> if<00:05:57.539> you<00:05:57.690> needed
