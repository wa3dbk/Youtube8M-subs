00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
if you look at the base there is room

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.670 
if you look at the base there is room
for<00:00:38.489> double<00:00:39.420> giant<00:00:39.629> bombs<00:00:39.719> I'll<00:00:40.230> defend

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
for double giant bombs I'll defend

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
for double giant bombs I'll defend
against<00:00:41.300> hogs<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.960> Kimmy<00:00:43.260> Hawk<00:00:43.559> has<00:00:43.890> opted

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
against hogs but Kimmy Hawk has opted

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.690 
against hogs but Kimmy Hawk has opted
just<00:00:45.210> put<00:00:45.450> those<00:00:46.039> single<00:00:47.039> giant<00:00:47.280> bombs<00:00:47.520> around

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
just put those single giant bombs around

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.610 
just put those single giant bombs around
and<00:00:48.270> spread<00:00:48.870> them<00:00:48.989> around<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.260> bit<00:00:49.440> because

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
and spread them around a bit because

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.189 
and spread them around a bit because
most<00:00:50.070> most<00:00:50.820> attackers<00:00:51.300> sink<00:00:51.629> there's<00:00:51.930> double

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
most most attackers sink there's double

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.720 
most most attackers sink there's double
giant<00:00:52.440> bombs<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.949> they<00:00:53.070> don't<00:00:53.280> use<00:00:53.460> hogs

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
giant bombs so they don't use hogs

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.830 
giant bombs so they don't use hogs
anyway<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.770> so<00:00:55.770> that's<00:00:56.699> what<00:00:56.940> she's<00:00:57.149> quite<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
anyway and so that's what she's quite of

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.410 
anyway and so that's what she's quite of
figured<00:00:58.260> out<00:00:58.609> during<00:00:59.609> her<00:00:59.730> war<00:00:59.940> experience

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
figured out during her war experience

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.729 
figured out during her war experience
that<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:00.840> she<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.170> doesn't<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.440> attacked

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
that there she just doesn't get attacked

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.740 
that there she just doesn't get attacked
by<00:01:01.859> hogs<00:01:02.280> anymore<00:01:02.870> because<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:06.420> spots

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
by hogs anymore because of the the spots

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.469 
by hogs anymore because of the the spots
where<00:01:06.990> players<00:01:07.860> sink<00:01:08.340> there's<00:01:08.970> double<00:01:09.299> giant

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
where players sink there's double giant

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.440 
where players sink there's double giant
bombs<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.930> don't<00:01:10.110> bother<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:11.450> because

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
bombs to the don't bother so because

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.179 
bombs to the don't bother so because
there's<00:01:12.750> many<00:01:13.020> places<00:01:13.409> where<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:13.979> put

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
there's many places where you can put

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.910 
there's many places where you can put
double<00:01:14.520> giant<00:01:14.729> bombs<00:01:15.170> most<00:01:16.170> players<00:01:16.470> get<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
double giant bombs most players get a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.270 
double giant bombs most players get a
bit<00:01:17.100> off<00:01:17.250> put<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:17.939> by<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.299> base<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.500> let's<00:01:20.100> have

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
bit off put it by the base so let's have

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.700 
bit off put it by the base so let's have
a<00:01:20.340> look<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.850> first<00:01:21.119> attack<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.720> see<00:01:22.530> how

where<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.420> hole<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.829> you've<00:02:04.979> got<00:02:05.009> to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
where that hole is so you've got to

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.440 
where that hole is so you've got to

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
back more than any other air troop

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.599 
back more than any other air troop
because<00:04:14.730> of<00:04:14.970> their<00:04:15.180> weight<00:04:15.360> and<00:04:16.280> we<00:04:17.280> still<00:04:17.489> got

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
because of their weight and we still got

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.740 
because of their weight and we still got
Wizards<00:04:17.910> running<00:04:18.120> around<00:04:18.299> from<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.510> clan

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
Wizards running around from the clan

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.010 
Wizards running around from the clan
castle<00:04:18.780> so<00:04:19.440> he<00:04:20.310> didn't<00:04:20.609> lure<00:04:20.729> every<00:04:21.450> all<00:04:21.810> the

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
castle so he didn't lure every all the

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.020 
castle so he didn't lure every all the
troops<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.440> I<00:04:22.470> think<00:04:22.650> that's<00:04:22.800> why<00:04:22.979> he<00:04:23.729> failed

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
troops and I think that's why he failed

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.150 
troops and I think that's why he failed
on<00:04:24.300> this<00:04:24.450> base<00:04:25.039> because<00:04:26.039> he<00:04:26.250> didn't<00:04:26.520> lure

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
on this base because he didn't lure
