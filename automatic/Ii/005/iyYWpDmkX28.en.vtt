00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.740
 two days before the away match against the controversial players of today 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.069
 take it easy last Saturday 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:11.029
 taking free kicks 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:12.490
 and finishing on purpose 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.490
 Jan Vertonghen was the best in both parts 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.070
 trainer does not train that with roly bonevacia separate from the group 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.369
 left back seems a doubtful case and vice versa that possibly suspended ear 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.369
 can replace gave a clear answer about his broken nose 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.500
 christian eriksen trained in the other group the young deen was the last year 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.990
 discovery of the season and even went to the world cup 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.880
 this year it all went a bit stiffer against heracles with two assists 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.880
 look back on a good raid 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.820
 from a distance 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.480
 Ajax to take the lead 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.620
 yes i am happy too 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.070
 and everything that comes with it and two seats from a big fire 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.280
 certainly a role for a midfielder is also a marketer very beautiful 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.760
 but Russian comes close 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.270
 it's just the same of 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.600
 unless it comes however 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.490
 this season is for you the season that you think tonight i will be new 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.460
 play but so far infomotive 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.920
 yes exactly Friday recovered and yes fixed but it is getting better to give this one 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.270
 to play on Saturday 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.270
 yes I sometimes go to build a bar so 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.080
 it's on the way back 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.770
 that's on the way back 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.160
 it a lot harder when it was a stormy development last year 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.450
 went through 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.630
 I myself have been there so the bar was very high exactly divergent me 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.990
 can easily set a half year valid so experienced a lot 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.409
 Certainly I think the market interest in the Kleijn than finding pears will come once 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.790
 gets better again 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.650
 this has been nominated with us for the title danish talent of the year how 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.140
 that was no surprise to him 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.620
 this time a week nominees is between it goes very well and when 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.380
 both the om and the us than now is the spring 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.380
 the great people from testing with certainty 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.400
 when is the award ceremony 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.440
 the five children 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.319
 it is that state among other things find 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.429
 I'm definitely going to ask 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:14.749
 also its his agenda that the upcoming match in the champions league against 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:15.769
 odense 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.290
 I sign will be exciting but tomorrow 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.520
 that made chef 30 match certainly exciting we are doing well 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.009
 to serve it was to take it all off 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:26.789
 what should we do this 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:29.589
 and hopefully with christian eriksen in the field 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:30.539
 this year on the shelves
