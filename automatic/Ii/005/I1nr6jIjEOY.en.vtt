00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
because right now I just feel like it's

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.880 
because right now I just feel like it's
not

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
not

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.920

pace<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.490> vim<00:02:14.670> crab<00:02:14.940> season<00:02:15.360> 1<00:02:15.510> was<00:02:15.660> if<00:02:15.900> you

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
pace that vim crab season 1 was if you

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.260 
pace that vim crab season 1 was if you
guys<00:02:16.170> watch<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.740> series<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.460> put<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> lot<00:02:18.209> of

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
guys watch that series I put a lot of

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.170 
guys watch that series I put a lot of
time<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.780> effort<00:02:18.930> into<00:02:19.410> every<00:02:20.250> episode<00:02:20.880> into

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
time and effort into every episode into

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.090 
time and effort into every episode into
editing<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:22.020> I'm<00:02:22.290> not<00:02:22.410> saying<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.770> don't<00:02:22.830> do

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
editing and I'm not saying I don't do

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.860 
editing and I'm not saying I don't do
that<00:02:23.250> now<00:02:23.459> I<00:02:23.490> just<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:24.030> think<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.390> did<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.600> lot<00:02:24.810> more

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
that now I just I think I did a lot more

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.620 
that now I just I think I did a lot more
editing<00:02:25.380> back<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.890> day<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:27.300> think<00:02:27.540> I

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
editing back in the day and I think I

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.650 
editing back in the day and I think I
could<00:02:27.780> do<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> lot<00:02:28.110> better<00:02:28.170> if<00:02:29.160> i<00:02:29.520> uploaded<00:02:30.300> less

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
could do a lot better if i uploaded less

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.930 
could do a lot better if i uploaded less
I<00:02:31.050> don't<00:02:31.260> know<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:32.630> today<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.959> really<00:02:34.320> a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
I don't know so today is really a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.670 
I don't know so today is really a
decision<00:02:35.940> last<00:02:36.450> year<00:02:36.720> my<00:02:36.930> decision<00:02:37.380> was<00:02:37.530> to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
decision last year my decision was to

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.760 
decision last year my decision was to
upload<00:02:38.010> at<00:02:38.130> least<00:02:38.160> three<00:02:38.520> videos<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.910> week<00:02:39.090> in

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
upload at least three videos a week in

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.380 
upload at least three videos a week in
2013<00:02:40.820> because<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:41.910> thought<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.120> was<00:02:42.330> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
2013 because I thought that was the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.090 
2013 because I thought that was the
perfect<00:02:42.690> balance<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.260> quality<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:43.890> quantity

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
perfect balance of quality and quantity

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.280 
perfect balance of quality and quantity
but<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.360> need<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.540> know<00:02:45.660> what<00:02:45.989> you<00:02:46.110> guys<00:02:46.140> want

thousand subscribers by the end of the
new<00:04:18.359> year<00:04:18.539> and<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.750> know<00:04:18.810> we<00:04:19.019> can<00:04:19.049> do<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.590> if<00:04:20.010> we

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
new year and I know we can do that if we

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.790 
new year and I know we can do that if we
keep<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:21.870> know<00:04:21.989> growing<00:04:22.289> the<00:04:22.470> way<00:04:22.590> we<00:04:22.770> have

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
keep you know growing the way we have

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.219 
keep you know growing the way we have
been<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.640> you<00:04:24.180> know<00:04:24.270> yeah<00:04:24.599> youtube<00:04:24.930> channel

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
been and you know yeah youtube channel

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.510 
been and you know yeah youtube channel
should<00:04:25.410> exponentially<00:04:26.280> grow

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
should exponentially grow

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.670 
should exponentially grow
eventually<00:04:27.120> at<00:04:27.210> some<00:04:27.419> point<00:04:27.690> where<00:04:28.379> more<00:04:28.620> and

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
eventually at some point where more and

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.680 
eventually at some point where more and
more<00:04:28.860> people<00:04:29.009> are<00:04:29.250> knowing<00:04:29.580> about<00:04:29.699> it<00:04:29.849> so<00:04:30.419> I

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
more people are knowing about it so I

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.600 
more people are knowing about it so I
think<00:04:31.110> eighty-five<00:04:31.620> thousand<00:04:32.039> subscribers<00:04:32.190> a

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
think eighty-five thousand subscribers a

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.200 
think eighty-five thousand subscribers a
good<00:04:32.970> middle<00:04:33.780> ground<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:34.620> if<00:04:35.490> we<00:04:35.520> overpass

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
good middle ground and if we overpass

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.930 
good middle ground and if we overpass
that<00:04:36.449> that<00:04:36.599> would<00:04:36.690> be<00:04:36.720> cool<00:04:37.020> as<00:04:37.139> well<00:04:37.379> but<00:04:37.940> yeah

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
that that would be cool as well but yeah

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.570
