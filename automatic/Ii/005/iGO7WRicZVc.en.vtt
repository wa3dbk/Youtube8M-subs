00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.979
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:05.840
 a new video of microsoft inside air 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:08.209
 this time we are going to analyze 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.490
 overkill 3 the last game of game 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:12.200
 troopers and the truth changing in addition to 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.619
 style because until now we had seen 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.810
 a more infant type of games we got 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.400
 to a simpler theme and in this 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.020
 case it's a shooter where 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.540
 we have to shoot and kill the 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.820
 bad as always but keeping that 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.590
 essence that tries to take game 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.320
 troopers the platform is to say with 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.140
 achievements xbox and with games in general very 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.880
 well refined yes with very good quality 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.740
 so we 're not going to see how they work 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.740
 overkill 3 for windows phones 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.900
 and good we are back here for the 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.580
 teach us to teach you a new game of 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.460
 of intruders that as you can see there what 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.860
 we have all so we're not going to do anything 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.810
 overkill 3 the last game from within 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.820
 Well, you see, I have all of them down there 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.760
 because as you know I'm a super fan 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.310
 I already know that I have the power to overflow 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.739
 I will change it 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.500
 we give it to pour 3 we put it a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.020
 backward this is the only thing we see that 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.540
 it takes a little bit more of the account in 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.460
 load but it 's a different game than 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.080
 they have done so far and the truth is 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.760
 that the result what I was testing 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.620
 for now I liked it and I've 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.990
 sent the feedback I will keep sending you 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.720
 feedback but the truth is that it is very 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.520
 very interesting if you are inside the 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.980
 beta for having looked at the forum 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.290
 microsoft inside air leave feedback 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.020
 because if they will make new sales with more 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.090
 people and you can target more people from the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.060
 web so nothing do not stop sending 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.009
 fifa 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.110
 here we have what it is as a kind 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.560
 of store so we can continue it has 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.289
 achieved with my user here we have a 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.450
 kind of store where we can buy 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.180
 different weapons and go unlocking like 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.090
 you see we have the money up and apart 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.399
 medalists to go buying we are going to 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.990
 play so you can see a little how is the 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.960
 it's true that it's a beta but it's 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.740
 pretty well slows down has its 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.989
 little things but it works to say to me 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.940
 is liking pretty I am very bad already 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.310
 you know that I am perhaps the worst person 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.349
 to teach the games but good 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.750
 let's fight and especially if they are from 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.420
 quirÃ³s and is with the mobile is terrible 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.130
 this little message I love that of hey if 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.260
 you want to enjoy the experience well 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.720
 this game put on some headphones and 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.690
 enjoy it 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.670
 let's put some sound not 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.870
 imagine dragons that if they do not put us 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.870
 our idea if interesting 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.230
 first of all we aim this they have it 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.230
 to get better 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.760
 because the pointed is a little terrible 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.060
 here is that we load 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.330
 surprise out there flying is convenient 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.550
 give him with me what 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.270
 you do not get to know almost where you have to 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.070
 point 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.070
 and it is quite complicated 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.380
 sometimes 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.219
 does not usually touch 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.000
 I am not able to take it as I say 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.080
 It has a lot of room for improvement and gives 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.080
 a lot of anger because 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.590
 it would be appreciated a control over everything more 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.310
 precise targeting system because 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.780
 is that when you put something on it you do not see 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.180
 then it gives a little bit of rage 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.819
 works fine yes 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:50.129
 has much room for improvement 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.129
 like the whole game over there 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.320
 like a tomato 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.920
 it is not 2 to 1 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.590
 the crusade 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.590
 we were in a big shot for you 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.239
 I hide surcharge 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.560
 we were expecting now a little bit 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.880
 the numbers 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.240
 one less 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.680
 I hope you are seeing it well, if not 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.680
 I will try to improve it 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.919
 be motivated 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.970
 with a gun zones like mola 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.400
 for this hands today 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.110
 is the name of the hole 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.640
 has discovered one less 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.060
 yes 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.550
 finally 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.430
 what's done comes very well from how 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.910
 but good as you see is again a 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:16.610
 mission game 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.610
 for which good we curcio 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.080
 this is understandable with quick games 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.700
 and other and good as you see then we are going 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.070
 at a level we will have access to 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.410
 new weapons and we can buy weapons 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.030
 how we buy weapons with the medallions 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.030
 and with the money that they are giving us 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.560
 once 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:42.640
 with the money that they are giving us then 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.760
 there you see the different achievements and improvements 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.340
 what are we going to have and when we have 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.360
 all these medals, we won more 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:54.040
 then like it's a beat that yes 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.040
 It is true that as you know it is in 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.740
 beta phase has been sent public and 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.420
 Well, I do not expect anything that I have 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.130
 liked this new game of game 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.010
 I do not want to do much troopers either 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.440
 longer because they take 7 minutes and 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.570
 well then to see if we are improving it 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.490
 between all and in a short time attentive 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.800
 because people in troupe are publishing 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.440
 new games and if we give feedback 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.330
 positive will publish new goals in the 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.400
 microsoft forum first on our website 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.830
 so you know how to give it good support 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.950
 and leave him 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.420
 and other positives in the applications and 

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.060
 these people will continue to bring 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.220
 great games to windows phone so 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.390
 nothing we see in the next video of 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.900
 microsoft inside air 

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.900
 a greeting
