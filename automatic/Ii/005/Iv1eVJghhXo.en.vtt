emergency<00:00:08.700> brake<00:00:08.910> cable

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
emergency brake cable

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.950 
emergency brake cable
I<00:00:09.780> was<00:00:10.280> changed<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.400> new<00:00:11.519> trains<00:00:12.059> cables<00:00:12.599> to

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
I was changed the new trains cables to

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.359 
I was changed the new trains cables to
new<00:00:13.139> ones<00:00:15.020> both<00:00:16.020> sides<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.770> back<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
new ones both sides in the back the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.150 
new ones both sides in the back the
hookup<00:00:17.930> down<00:00:18.930> here<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.350> real<00:00:19.500> easy<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.920> get

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
hookup down here was real easy to get

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.460 
hookup down here was real easy to get
them<00:00:20.310> off<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.760> just<00:00:22.100> took<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.310> off<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:24.470> you

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
them off I just took this off and you

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.920 
them off I just took this off and you
could<00:00:25.590> easily<00:00:25.769> get<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.430> end<00:00:26.970> here

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
could easily get to the end here

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.749 
could easily get to the end here
put<00:00:28.650> them<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.830> no<00:00:29.220> problem<00:00:29.880> ran<00:00:30.330> them<00:00:30.449> through

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
put them on no problem ran them through

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.620 
put them on no problem ran them through
hook<00:00:32.759> them<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:33.140> this<00:00:34.579> bracket<00:00:35.579> I'm<00:00:36.210> all<00:00:36.420> hooked

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
hook them up this bracket I'm all hooked

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.900 
hook them up this bracket I'm all hooked
up<00:00:36.860> then<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.890> couldn't<00:00:38.100> get<00:00:38.219> enough<00:00:40.670> slack<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
up then I couldn't get enough slack to

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.690 
up then I couldn't get enough slack to
get<00:00:42.320> this<00:00:43.320> cable<00:00:43.829> into<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.190> hole<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.520> had<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
get this cable into this hole you had to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.250 
get this cable into this hole you had to
turn<00:00:44.879> sideways<00:00:45.120> push<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> through<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.899> big<00:00:46.079> hole

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
turn sideways push it through a big hole

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.819 
turn sideways push it through a big hole
and<00:00:46.469> let<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.739> slip<00:00:46.950> back<00:00:47.840> so<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:51.590> couldn't<00:00:52.590> pull

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
and let it slip back so I couldn't pull

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.200 
and let it slip back so I couldn't pull
put<00:00:53.520> come<00:00:53.760> along<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:55.460> welding<00:00:56.460> clamp<00:00:56.820> but

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
put come along on this welding clamp but

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.450 
put come along on this welding clamp but
couldn't<00:00:58.079> get<00:00:58.170> enough<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:58.590> pull<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> from

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
couldn't get enough up pull on it from

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.119 
couldn't get enough up pull on it from
the<00:00:59.579> back<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:01.230> I'm<00:01:01.350> figuring<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.800> Kevlar

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the back so I'm figuring this Kevlar

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.820 
the back so I'm figuring this Kevlar
cell<00:01:02.309> around<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.640> Kay<00:01:02.850> well<00:01:03.530> be<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.710> to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
cell around this Kay well be here to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.160 
cell around this Kay well be here to
click<00:01:05.180> there's<00:01:06.180> an<00:01:06.360> adjustment<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
click there's an adjustment up on the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.859 
click there's an adjustment up on the
back<00:01:07.380> up<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> front<00:01:08.600> but<00:01:09.600> there<00:01:09.750> was<00:01:09.840> a

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
back up in the front but there was a

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.030 
back up in the front but there was a
recall<00:01:10.520> like<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:14.090> emergency<00:01:15.090> brake<00:01:15.330> and

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
recall like for the emergency brake and

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.730 
recall like for the emergency brake and
they<00:01:17.040> put<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.400> little<00:01:17.729> white<00:01:18.570> plastic<00:01:19.229> they

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
they put this little white plastic they

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.600 
they put this little white plastic they
called<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.040> wedge

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
called a wedge

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.640 
called a wedge
I<00:01:20.659> guess<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:24.380> ratchet<00:01:25.380> wouldn't

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
I guess so that the ratchet wouldn't

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.130 
I guess so that the ratchet wouldn't
slip<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.729> leave<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:27.630> no<00:01:27.810> emergency

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
slip and leave you with no emergency

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.260 
slip and leave you with no emergency
brake<00:01:28.320> what<00:01:28.650> -<00:01:28.740> no<00:01:28.829> way<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> want<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.340> but<00:01:30.240> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
brake what - no way to want that but you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.050 
brake what - no way to want that but you
can't<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:31.500> can't<00:01:31.740> get<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:34.490> release<00:01:35.490> what

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
can't you can't get it to release what

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.289 
can't you can't get it to release what
it's<00:01:36.180> already<00:01:36.360> thought<00:01:37.189> wound<00:01:38.189> up<00:01:38.579> without

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
it's already thought wound up without

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.020 
it's already thought wound up without
taking<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.579> stuck<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> little<00:01:41.790> piece

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
taking this out I stuck a little piece

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.319 
taking this out I stuck a little piece
of<00:01:42.060> out<00:01:42.420> wouldn't<00:01:42.869> would<00:01:43.590> wedge<00:01:44.030> this<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.180> not

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
of out wouldn't would wedge this is not

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.880 
of out wouldn't would wedge this is not
gonna<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> good<00:01:45.750> picture<00:01:45.990> here<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.649> there

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
gonna be a good picture here but there

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.429 
gonna be a good picture here but there
there's<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:50.990> ratchet<00:01:51.990> assembly

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
there's this the ratchet assembly

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.370 
there's this the ratchet assembly
there's<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.710> Paul<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.540> gears<00:01:54.540> I'm<00:01:55.049> just

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
there's a Paul and gears I'm just

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.170 
there's a Paul and gears I'm just
holding<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.740> loose<00:01:55.979> holding<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.549> open<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.000> it

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
holding it loose holding it open so it

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.950 
holding it loose holding it open so it
won't<00:01:57.329> lock<00:01:58.079> up<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> cable<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.719> once<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.780> did

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
won't lock up the cable so once I did

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.480 
won't lock up the cable so once I did
all<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.110> everything<00:02:01.890> worked

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
all that everything worked

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.600 
all that everything worked
it<00:02:03.180> was<00:02:03.360> simply<00:02:04.850> pulling<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.909> cable<00:02:06.210> through

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
it was simply pulling the cable through

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.089 
it was simply pulling the cable through
through<00:02:08.610> Mike<00:02:08.819> C<00:02:09.660> clamp<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.860> had

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
through Mike C clamp and then I had

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.490 
through Mike C clamp and then I had
plenty<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.550> a

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
plenty of a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.080 
plenty of a
plenty<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.530> slack<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.190> pushed<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.550> through<00:02:14.700> you

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
plenty of slack I pushed it through you

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.300 
plenty of slack I pushed it through you
can<00:02:15.330> try<00:02:15.510> can't<00:02:15.870> see<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.230> folio<00:02:16.590> but<00:02:17.130> there's

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
can try can't see this folio but there's

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.500 
can try can't see this folio but there's
a<00:02:17.400> hole<00:02:17.580> right<00:02:17.730> there<00:02:17.790> push<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.330> through<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
a hole right there push it through the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.680 
a hole right there push it through the
side<00:02:18.860> slipped<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:19.980> around<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.400> now<00:02:20.520> it's<00:02:20.690> it's

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
side slipped it around so now it's it's

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.210 
side slipped it around so now it's it's
ready<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.990> go<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.710> put<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.010> all<00:02:23.070> back

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
ready to go just put it all back

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.380 
ready to go just put it all back
together<00:02:25.550> wasn't<00:02:26.550> too<00:02:26.640> bad<00:02:26.790> look<00:02:27.060> up<00:02:27.180> on<00:02:27.330> the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390
