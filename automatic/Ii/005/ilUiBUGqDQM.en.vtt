00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:09.769 
was trying to figure out it actually

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:12.189 
was trying to figure out it actually
took<00:05:10.279> a<00:05:10.339> while<00:05:10.549> to<00:05:10.580> make<00:05:10.909> this<00:05:11.179> I<00:05:11.539> don't<00:05:12.110> know

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
took a while to make this I don't know
