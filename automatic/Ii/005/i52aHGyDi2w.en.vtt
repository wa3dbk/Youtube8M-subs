come<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.080> against<00:01:22.409> Kim<00:01:22.770> na<00:01:22.950> beds<00:01:23.159> he<00:01:23.310> played

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
come up against Kim na beds he played

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.429 
come up against Kim na beds he played
blue<00:01:24.090> afros<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.479> saved<00:01:24.840> everything<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.200> sight

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
blue afros and saved everything in sight

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.660 
blue afros and saved everything in sight
and<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.770> made<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.430> really

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and it just made for a really

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.510 
and it just made for a really
frustrating<00:01:27.479> time<00:01:28.140> playing<00:01:28.470> clubs<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.979> it's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
frustrating time playing clubs and it's

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.100 
frustrating time playing clubs and it's
almost<00:01:29.700> as<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:29.850> EA<00:01:30.119> did<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> checklist<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.020> all

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
almost as if EA did a checklist of all

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.940 
almost as if EA did a checklist of all
the<00:01:31.170> things<00:01:31.320> they<00:01:31.500> need<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.829> with

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the things they need to do with

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.200 
the things they need to do with
goalkeeper<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.610> forgot<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> few<00:01:33.150> things

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
goalkeeper then just forgot a few things

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.270 
goalkeeper then just forgot a few things
because<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:33.750> just<00:01:33.780> strange<00:01:34.200> how<00:01:34.500> certain

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
because it's just strange how certain

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.249 
because it's just strange how certain
things<00:01:35.610> with<00:01:35.880> keepers<00:01:36.210> are<00:01:36.360> actually<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:37.110> too

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
things with keepers are actually not too

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.020 
things with keepers are actually not too
bad<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.680> way<00:01:37.799> they<00:01:37.920> dive<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.460> general<00:01:38.880> isn't

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
bad the way they dive in general isn't

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.270 
bad the way they dive in general isn't
bad<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.290> when<00:01:40.470> they<00:01:40.560> come<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:40.829> with

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
bad but it's just when they come up with

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.310 
bad but it's just when they come up with
some<00:01:41.549> certain<00:01:41.909> shots<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.360> just<00:01:42.479> makes

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
some certain shots that just makes

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.710 
some certain shots that just makes
cheaply<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.920> mystic<00:01:44.310> saved<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:44.790> if<00:01:44.970> EA<00:01:45.570> for

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
cheaply on mystic saved and as if EA for

cheaply on mystic saved and as if EA for
didn't<00:01:46.140> want<00:01:46.259> goal<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.710> bad<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.070> they

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
didn't want goal is to be bad so they

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.010 
didn't want goal is to be bad so they
made<00:01:47.340> him<00:01:47.490> instead<00:01:47.909> massively<00:01:48.479> overpowered

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
made him instead massively overpowered

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.660 
made him instead massively overpowered
when<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.740> only<00:01:49.860> makes<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.130> good<00:01:50.220> save<00:01:50.460> it's

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
when it only makes a good save it's

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.350 
when it only makes a good save it's
nothing<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> do<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.180> player

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
nothing to do with the player

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.570 
nothing to do with the player
controlling<00:01:51.750> kohli<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.290> just

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
controlling kohli it's just

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.520 
controlling kohli it's just
that<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.910> game<00:01:53.150> does<00:01:53.660> that<00:01:53.840> say<00:01:54.020> for<00:01:54.050> you<00:01:54.380> this

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
that the game does that say for you this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.230 
that the game does that say for you this
is<00:01:54.590> absolutely<00:01:54.950> no<00:01:55.220> user<00:01:55.460> input<00:01:55.850> at<00:01:55.940> all<00:01:56.060> which

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
is absolutely no user input at all which

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.060 
is absolutely no user input at all which
was<00:01:56.420> what<00:01:56.660> makes<00:01:56.870> goalie<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:57.350> pointless<00:01:57.740> and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
was what makes goalie so pointless and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.680 
was what makes goalie so pointless and
the<00:01:58.430> thing<00:01:58.550> this<00:01:58.640> next<00:01:58.910> clip<00:01:59.060> just<00:01:59.210> sums<00:01:59.540> up

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
the thing this next clip just sums up

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.600 
the thing this next clip just sums up
what<00:01:59.900> a<00:01:59.960> joke<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.530> girls<00:02:00.800> are<00:02:00.890> in<00:02:01.010> this<00:02:01.070> game<00:02:01.160> I

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
what a joke the girls are in this game I

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.310 
what a joke the girls are in this game I
just<00:02:02.120> play<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.360> bear<00:02:02.540> down<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:02.750> go<00:02:02.960> right<00:02:03.170> he's

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
just play a bear down and go right he's

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.140 
just play a bear down and go right he's
about<00:02:03.740> 40<00:02:04.130> yards<00:02:04.250> away<00:02:04.400> when<00:02:04.550> it<00:02:04.640> takes<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.850> shot

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
about 40 yards away when it takes a shot

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.220 
about 40 yards away when it takes a shot
and<00:02:05.450> it's<00:02:05.570> one<00:02:05.720> of<00:02:05.810> three<00:02:05.960> things<00:02:05.990> gonna

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
and it's one of three things gonna

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.480 
and it's one of three things gonna
happen<00:02:06.320> here<00:02:06.710> he's<00:02:06.890> either<00:02:07.010> going<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.340> hit<00:02:07.460> the

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
happen here he's either going to hit the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.950 
happen here he's either going to hit the
target<00:02:07.700> in<00:02:07.970> score<00:02:08.270> which<00:02:08.420> is<00:02:08.540> most<00:02:08.720> likely

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
target in score which is most likely

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.080 
target in score which is most likely
scenario<00:02:09.290> the<00:02:10.040> second<00:02:10.340> option<00:02:10.460> is<00:02:10.640> he'll<00:02:10.790> hit

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
scenario the second option is he'll hit

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.210 
scenario the second option is he'll hit
the<00:02:11.120> keeper<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.260> will<00:02:12.380> like<00:02:12.530> rebound<00:02:12.920> off

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
the keeper and it will like rebound off

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.890 
the keeper and it will like rebound off
maybe<00:02:13.580> go<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:13.970> goal<00:02:14.120> maybe<00:02:14.360> come<00:02:14.570> back<00:02:14.690> out

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
maybe go in the goal maybe come back out

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.690 
maybe go in the goal maybe come back out
and<00:02:15.140> then<00:02:15.500> lastly<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:16.280> is<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.430> small<00:02:16.640> chance

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
and then lastly this is a small chance

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.070 
and then lastly this is a small chance
he'll<00:02:17.030> miss<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.180> target<00:02:17.390> which<00:02:17.690> is<00:02:17.780> unlikely

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
he'll miss the target which is unlikely

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.960 
he'll miss the target which is unlikely
but<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.560> possible<00:02:18.770> so<00:02:19.550> one<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.730> those<00:02:19.820> three

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
but it is possible so one of those three

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.340 
but it is possible so one of those three
fingers<00:02:20.210> will<00:02:20.420> likely<00:02:20.630> happen<00:02:20.840> here<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.200> any

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
fingers will likely happen here in any

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.470 
fingers will likely happen here in any
normal<00:02:21.740> functioning<00:02:22.340> game<00:02:22.520> so<00:02:23.360> you've

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
normal functioning game so you've

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.730 
normal functioning game so you've
probably<00:02:23.660> guessed<00:02:23.960> already<00:02:24.260> but<00:02:24.500> none<00:02:24.620> those

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
probably guessed already but none those

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.800 
probably guessed already but none those
three<00:02:24.950> things<00:02:25.130> actually<00:02:25.340> do<00:02:25.640> happen<00:02:26.090> what<00:02:26.660> was

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
three things actually do happen what was

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.840 
three things actually do happen what was
instead<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.530> keeper<00:02:27.740> catches<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.550> ball

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
instead is the keeper catches the ball

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.600 
instead is the keeper catches the ball
from<00:02:29.720> four<00:02:30.050> yards<00:02:30.200> out<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:31.130> ball<00:02:31.310> shopping<00:02:31.550> in

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
from four yards out the ball shopping in

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.340 
from four yards out the ball shopping in
about<00:02:31.790> 60<00:02:32.209> miles<00:02:32.360> an<00:02:32.480> hour<00:02:32.600> at<00:02:32.870> point-blank

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
about 60 miles an hour at point-blank

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.710 
about 60 miles an hour at point-blank
range<00:02:33.440> catches<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.430> ball<00:02:34.640> as<00:02:34.910> if<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.480> was<00:02:35.570> no

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
range catches the ball as if it was no

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.510 
range catches the ball as if it was no
problem<00:02:35.930> at<00:02:36.080> all<00:02:36.260> now<00:02:36.860> I've<00:02:37.010> slowed<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.370> down

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
problem at all now I've slowed this down

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.770 
problem at all now I've slowed this down
as<00:02:37.640> much<00:02:37.760> as<00:02:37.910> possible<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.420> try<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:38.660> make<00:02:38.720> it

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
as much as possible to try and make it
