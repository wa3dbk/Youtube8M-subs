when it's all completely put together
with<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> sidewall<00:01:05.610> well<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.510> sidewalls<00:01:07.140> sit

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
with the sidewall well the sidewalls sit

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.580 
with the sidewall well the sidewalls sit
on<00:01:07.920> top<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.820> floor<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.479> floor<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.290> sits<00:01:10.500> on

on top of the floor a floor then sits on

on top of the floor a floor then sits on
top<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> chassis<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.299> actually<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.840> is

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
top of the chassis and we actually do is

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.860 
top of the chassis and we actually do is
George<00:01:13.380> bolt<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.550> side<00:01:14.910> wall<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.600> floor

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
George bolt on a side wall to the floor

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.560 
George bolt on a side wall to the floor
and<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:16.560> parish<00:01:16.890> let's<00:01:17.160> go<00:01:17.370> through<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.700> we

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
and the parish let's go through that we

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.550 
and the parish let's go through that we
do<00:01:18.750> fill<00:01:19.050> this<00:01:19.530> will<00:01:20.330> sill<00:01:21.330> plate<00:01:21.660> with<00:01:22.260> wood

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
do fill this will sill plate with wood

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.350 
do fill this will sill plate with wood
the<00:01:22.890> reason<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.190> put<00:01:23.250> wooden<00:01:23.640> siding<00:01:24.000> here

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
the reason they put wooden siding here

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.870 
the reason they put wooden siding here
you<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.290> right<00:01:25.440> here<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.640> when<00:01:26.760> we

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you can see it right here is so when we

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.090 
you can see it right here is so when we
actually<00:01:27.000> bolt<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.660> side<00:01:27.900> wall<00:01:28.140> down<00:01:28.440> that

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
actually bolt that side wall down that

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.370 
actually bolt that side wall down that
would<00:01:29.850> allow<00:01:30.300> that<00:01:30.360> aluminum<00:01:30.870> up<00:01:31.020> crushing

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
would allow that aluminum up crushing

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.350 
would allow that aluminum up crushing
and<00:01:31.980> we<00:01:32.100> there<00:01:32.250> gives<00:01:32.490> us<00:01:32.580> some<00:01:32.700> more<00:01:32.850> solid

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
and we there gives us some more solid

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.160 
and we there gives us some more solid
foundation<00:01:34.520> wall<00:01:35.520> itself<00:01:35.910> then<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.750> top<00:01:36.960> of

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
foundation wall itself then on top of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.930 
foundation wall itself then on top of
this<00:01:37.260> enough<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> exterior<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.760> we

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
this enough on the exterior this we

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.480 
this enough on the exterior this we
actually<00:01:39.030> use<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.360> hung<00:01:39.720> side<00:01:40.560> wall<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.220> hung

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
actually use a hung side wall that hung

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.800 
actually use a hung side wall that hung
gel<00:01:41.850> coat<00:01:42.120> fiberglass<00:01:42.720> side<00:01:43.020> wall

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.060 

this<00:01:47.810> is<00:01:47.990> actually<00:01:48.320> going<00:01:48.439> to<00:01:48.560> allow<00:01:48.799> it<00:01:48.830> out

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
this is actually going to allow it out

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.010 
this is actually going to allow it out
of<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.310> window<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.970> you<00:01:50.299> can<00:01:50.420> take<00:01:50.570> a<00:01:50.600> look<00:01:50.840> at

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
of a window and you can take a look at

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.440 
of a window and you can take a look at
the<00:01:51.110> thickness<00:01:51.320> right<00:01:51.710> here<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.700> sidewall

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
the thickness right here of the sidewall

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.870 
the thickness right here of the sidewall
itself<00:01:53.869> it's<00:01:54.380> got<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.740> gel<00:01:54.979> coat<00:01:55.190> exterior

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
itself it's got the gel coat exterior

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.940 
itself it's got the gel coat exterior
and<00:01:56.270> then<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:56.690> got<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.930> luan<00:01:57.259> backhoe<00:01:57.530> for

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
and then you got the luan backhoe for

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.660 
and then you got the luan backhoe for
reinforcement<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.710> it's<00:02:00.710> all<00:02:00.890> glued<00:02:01.310> and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
reinforcement and it's all glued and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.890 
reinforcement and it's all glued and
screwed<00:02:01.909> onto<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.540> exterior<00:02:03.080> side<00:02:03.440> wall<00:02:03.710> but
