00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.630
 the team hello hello started to 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.029
 kong have a little bit how has 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.180
 carried out which one arrives and one transfers 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.100
 here in Aix en Provence 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.140
 I got there 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.490
 early July I moved so early 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.940
 July after I left a little in 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.420
 vacation 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:37.050
 so here I am slowly starting to 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.880
 make me at the villa at the club his machine 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.280
 according to this gently for now the 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.700
 feeling is really good indoor game 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.530
 Team of the club we saw all frozen 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.960
 good ones good impressions 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.820
 after that must be necessary that it must 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.400
 that it pushes a little crazy it is refine 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.870
 a little but for now his debut a 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.170
 good feeling birds why have 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.909
 chose aix in provence at the bottom because 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.339
 I think it's a club that has 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.739
 big ambitions and who gives himself 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.370
 also ways to help him 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.590
 accomplish 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.380
 and here I wanted to discover 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.670
 something else because if there is 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.670
 stay at dijon but here I wanted 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.860
 see something else and it's true that the ex 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.020
 bad them by the means they put in 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.080
 place the coach also the group 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.880
 pass to my aunt and I decided to come 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.140
 you're talking about their coach 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.150
 noka serdarusic that what you 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.710
 knew of him before he arrived 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.450
 what you're learning about on the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.219
 character finally inquire have them 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.329
 also did a little bit of order knows him 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.680
 necessarily 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.770
 after that it's true that me personally 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.539
 I did not know at all 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.429
 l'ag I talked about it a little around me 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.149
 and here I think he has a reputation 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:46.340
 here is not to redo and so we 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.289
 may be that want to 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.119
 work with someone like that so 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.100
 here is it sure it played in 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.200
 the balance also to have a coach 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.689
 dice guarantees a good coach 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.429
 is that even if I do not play 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.079
 a lot or what I'm going to progress to 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.759
 workouts it's a certainty for 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.090
 me so it's a big plus 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.759
 what is going to be able 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.619
 to bring I think he can bring 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.800
 in all areas whatsoever 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.200
 tactical physics at the game level and 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.060
 then I think that even the fact of 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.290
 change two teammates and the coach 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.300
 that's why we have to adapt 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.650
 adapt to a new game system 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.000
 new workouts I think nothing 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.150
 that it's interesting even without 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.800
 talk about really get the content so I 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.500
 think there's every point of view that's 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.300
 positive for me you'll experienced the d1 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.770
 last season with dijon how 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.350
 happened for you this 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.240
 times this season 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.280
 it was a difficult current season 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.990
 since we go down so it's 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.780
 never easy after we came out of a 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.420
 big season in d2 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.430
 we win the play-offs so we had a 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.200
 frame that was strong enough that we have 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.780
 managed to keep even if we have two three 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.060
 who left thanks to that when I 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.530
 even had a good season with 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.420
 people I really liked a lot 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.390
 after the results it was still 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.610
 complicated because we lost 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.050
 most of our games so here is more 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.090
 what happened during the year 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.530
 it was not an easy season for a 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.390
 first season of d1 it is inevitably 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.120
 complicated all five a descent at the end 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.590
 has appreciated in any case you have 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.480
 marked the fourth- best minds 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.300
 scorer of the championship with his 54 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.190
 achievements 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.050
 I did not expect it after that 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.200
 and that's a special context 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.440
 it was done dijon I'm aware 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.300
 that it would not be done everywhere after 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.400
 that's for sure I can not say that 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.720
 I'm not happy about what started 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.090
 passed individually 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.680
 last season but here it stays 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.140
 anecdotal because 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.269
 it's with a season now in Dijon 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.370
 here I am also coming to prove that I 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.959
 am able to be good at another 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.620
 team in another context in a 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.340
 other way of playing and it's 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.069
 it's all sara to prove 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.390
 so there are two causes still waiting 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.950
 especially when arriving here in the country it is 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.230
 is 7000 small pressure not the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.420
 everything not because anyway as 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.080
 I have big expectations about myself 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.209
 so it's veiling and I knew what 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.340
 wait for me coming here I know I know 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.070
 why I have here so now here is 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.979
 I think we have to work hard and have 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.530
 no reason that it goes wrong all 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.150
 should be fine did a little 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.010
 word for him wearing who program that 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.630
 what you want to tell them I bah 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.880
 want to tell them that I hope that the 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.310
 season is beautiful and we will succeed in 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.350
 do beautiful things together and that's it 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.830
 we wait for all seasons for us 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.139
 support 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.139
 this is so pierrick thank you
