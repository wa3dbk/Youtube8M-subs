so<00:00:17.600> far<00:00:17.810> we've<00:00:17.960> been<00:00:18.080> doing<00:00:18.880> tunes<00:00:19.880> to<00:00:20.180> just

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
so far we've been doing tunes to just

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.150 
so far we've been doing tunes to just
have<00:00:20.540> one<00:00:20.570> role<00:00:20.960> throughout<00:00:21.290> the<00:00:21.500> whole<00:00:21.650> tune

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
have one role throughout the whole tune

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.580 
have one role throughout the whole tune
now<00:00:23.090> we're<00:00:23.240> going<00:00:23.360> to<00:00:23.420> start<00:00:23.630> getting<00:00:24.410> a

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
now we're going to start getting a

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.140 
now we're going to start getting a
little<00:00:24.619> more<00:00:24.980> sophisticated<00:00:25.610> with<00:00:25.880> it<00:00:26.000> and

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
little more sophisticated with it and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.760 
little more sophisticated with it and
putting<00:00:26.420> a<00:00:26.720> number<00:00:27.230> of<00:00:27.290> different<00:00:27.439> role

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
putting a number of different role

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.580 
putting a number of different role
different<00:00:28.340> roles<00:00:28.520> in<00:00:29.290> particular<00:00:30.290> tune<00:00:30.439> in

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
different roles in particular tune in

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.619 
different roles in particular tune in
this<00:00:30.710> case<00:00:30.920> will<00:00:31.699> do<00:00:31.789> boil<00:00:32.000> and<00:00:32.180> cabbage<00:00:32.480> down

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
this case will do boil and cabbage down

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.650 
this case will do boil and cabbage down
again<00:00:33.400> and<00:00:34.400> we'll<00:00:35.000> build<00:00:35.210> up<00:00:35.360> till<00:00:35.510> we<00:00:35.570> have

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
again and we'll build up till we have

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.040 
again and we'll build up till we have
three<00:00:35.870> or<00:00:35.960> four<00:00:36.110> different<00:00:36.260> roles<00:00:36.590> in<00:00:36.860> it<00:00:36.980> and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
three or four different roles in it and

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.540 
three or four different roles in it and
we're<00:00:39.050> going<00:00:39.170> to<00:00:39.230> start<00:00:39.410> really<00:00:39.620> beginning<00:00:40.370> to

index<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:06.050> middle<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:07.869> we'll<00:01:08.869> do<00:01:09.020> it

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
index the middle and we'll do it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.600

throughout the entire thing through all

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.859 
throughout the entire thing through all
the<00:01:10.729> chords<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:11.090> it'll<00:01:11.240> be<00:01:11.270> 0<00:01:11.649> to<00:01:12.649> lees<00:01:12.979> on<00:01:13.869> g2

tuanjie

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.970 

to<00:01:29.450> unsee

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.590 

now<00:01:32.980> for<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.250> end<00:01:33.370> it'll<00:01:33.490> be<00:01:33.640> one<00:01:33.850> on<00:01:33.880> G

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
now for the end it'll be one on G

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.490 
now for the end it'll be one on G
1d<00:01:36.200> seven<00:01:37.420> two<00:01:38.420> more

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.790 

so<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.620> whole<00:01:42.740> thing<00:01:42.890> will<00:01:43.010> sound<00:01:43.159> like<00:01:43.250> this

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.160 

Oh

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.140 

Oh

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:04.930 

Oh

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.220 

okay<00:02:05.940> and<00:02:06.060> that's<00:02:06.210> fine<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.840> gets<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.080> little

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
okay and that's fine it gets a little

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.690 
okay and that's fine it gets a little
boring<00:02:07.440> when<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.070> one<00:02:08.280> roll

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
boring when you just have one roll

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.160 
boring when you just have one roll
through<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.030> whole<00:02:09.180> thing<00:02:09.210> as<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.780> was<00:02:09.930> saying

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
through the whole thing as I was saying

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.360 
through the whole thing as I was saying
so<00:02:10.770> now<00:02:11.430> let's<00:02:11.790> try<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> forward<00:02:12.630> backward<00:02:12.870> roll

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
so now let's try a forward backward roll

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.740 
so now let's try a forward backward roll
the<00:02:14.370> forward<00:02:14.790> backward<00:02:15.180> roll<00:02:15.300> takes<00:02:15.600> the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
the forward backward roll takes the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.780 
the forward backward roll takes the
forward<00:02:16.110> roll<00:02:16.320> in<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:17.190> case<00:02:17.460> it'll<00:02:17.610> be<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
forward roll in this case it'll be the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.030 
forward roll in this case it'll be the
third<00:02:18.060> second<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.080> first<00:02:19.530> strings<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:22.200> of

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
third second and first strings and of

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.350 
third second and first strings and of
course<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.400> backer<00:02:23.580> role<00:02:23.880> as<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.180> might

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
course the backer role as you might

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.550 
course the backer role as you might
guess<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.930> first<00:02:25.460> second<00:02:26.460> third

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
guess is first second third

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.540 
guess is first second third
now<00:02:29.310> rather<00:02:29.640> than<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:30.090> going<00:02:31.430> we're<00:02:32.430> going

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
now rather than just going we're going

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.600 
now rather than just going we're going
to<00:02:32.610> turn<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.910> into<00:02:33.030> an<00:02:33.239> eighth<00:02:33.510> note<00:02:33.540> roll

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
to turn this into an eighth note roll

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.040 
to turn this into an eighth note roll
finger<00:02:35.610> pattern<00:02:35.940> through<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.450> forward<00:02:36.720> roll

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
finger pattern through the forward roll

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.070 
finger pattern through the forward roll
three<00:02:37.380> two<00:02:37.620> one<00:02:38.180> hit<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.420> fifth<00:02:39.690> string<00:02:39.930> up

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
three two one hit that fifth string up

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.940 
three two one hit that fifth string up
on<00:02:40.260> top<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.709> short<00:02:40.950> string<00:02:42.680> then<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:43.830> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
on top that short string then do the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.910 
on top that short string then do the
backward<00:02:44.370> roll<00:02:45.019> and<00:02:46.019> end<00:02:46.410> on<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.680> first

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
backward roll and end on the first

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.430 
backward roll and end on the first
string<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.540> have<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.720> forward<00:02:49.110> back<00:02:49.260> it

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
string so you have the forward back it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.890 
string so you have the forward back it
rolls<00:02:49.620> view<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.010> forward<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:51.420> fist<00:02:51.690> ring<00:02:51.810> is

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
rolls view the forward the fist ring is

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.170 
rolls view the forward the fist ring is
your<00:02:52.050> pivot<00:02:52.380> point<00:02:52.650> which<00:02:53.459> lets<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.849> get<00:02:53.970> back

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
your pivot point which lets you get back

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.259 
your pivot point which lets you get back
to<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.420> backward<00:02:54.780> roll<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:56.030> then<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.120> just

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
to the backward roll and then you just

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.490 
to the backward roll and then you just
add<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.540> first<00:02:57.720> string<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.050> fill<00:02:58.230> out<00:02:58.380> the

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
seven eight now we're going to use this

role for boiling cabbage down rather
than<00:03:06.180> having<00:03:06.540> two<00:03:06.900> alternating<00:03:07.500> thumb<00:03:07.680> rules

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
than having two alternating thumb rules

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.300 
than having two alternating thumb rules
for<00:03:08.730> each<00:03:08.880> chord<00:03:09.330> will<00:03:09.900> have<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.860> those<00:03:11.130> are

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
for each chord will have and those are

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.070 
for each chord will have and those are
for<00:03:11.519> note<00:03:11.700> sequences<00:03:12.330> we're<00:03:12.810> going<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.989> have

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
for note sequences we're going to have

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.229 
for note sequences we're going to have
one<00:03:13.290> forward<00:03:13.769> backward<00:03:14.220> roll<00:03:14.370> /<00:03:14.970> chord

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
one forward backward roll / chord

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.620 
one forward backward roll / chord
because<00:03:16.049> it's<00:03:16.739> an<00:03:16.860> eighth<00:03:16.950> note<00:03:16.980> sequence<00:03:17.630> so

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
because it's an eighth note sequence so

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.900 
because it's an eighth note sequence so
you'll<00:03:18.810> have<00:03:18.930> one<00:03:19.140> on<00:03:19.290> g1<00:03:19.769> forward<00:03:20.519> backward

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
you'll have one on g1 forward backward

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:30.130 
you'll have one on g1 forward backward
roll<00:03:21.030> on<00:03:21.349> g1<00:03:23.390> on<00:03:24.470> c1<00:03:26.510> on<00:03:27.510> g

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.260 

107

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.430 

Angie

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.350 

but<00:03:36.800> unsee

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.900 

then<00:03:39.780> you'll<00:03:39.960> split<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.500> between<00:03:40.710> the<00:03:41.610> G&amp;D

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
then you'll split it between the G&amp;D

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.990 
then you'll split it between the G&amp;D
seventh<00:03:42.390> forward<00:03:42.930> on<00:03:43.050> G<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:44.580> first<00:03:44.820> stream

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
seventh forward on G the first stream

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.940 
seventh forward on G the first stream
then<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.270> put<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.600> new<00:03:45.780> seventh<00:03:46.170> down<00:03:46.410> do

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
then you put the new seventh down do

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.890 
then you put the new seventh down do
your<00:03:47.040> backward<00:03:47.250> roll<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:49.170> then<00:03:50.450> less<00:03:51.450> no<00:03:51.630> chi

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
your backward roll and then less no chi

00:03:51.900 --> 00:04:08.920 
your backward roll and then less no chi
so<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.500> whole<00:03:52.650> thing<00:03:52.830> is

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.060 

now<00:04:09.930> just<00:04:10.110> add<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.320> little<00:04:10.380> something<00:04:10.710> to<00:04:10.980> the

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
now just add a little something to the

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.350 
now just add a little something to the
end<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.490> rather<00:04:11.640> than<00:04:11.850> just<00:04:12.030> on<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.270> other

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
end of it rather than just on the other

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.810 
end of it rather than just on the other
third<00:04:12.660> string<00:04:12.990> or<00:04:13.110> some<00:04:13.380> more<00:04:13.500> rolls<00:04:13.820> let's

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
third string or some more rolls let's

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.520 
third string or some more rolls let's
try<00:04:15.000> this<00:04:15.060> just<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.720> expand<00:04:16.109> things<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.410> little

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
try this just to expand things a little

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.470 
try this just to expand things a little
bit<00:04:19.340> did<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.459> third<00:04:20.640> string<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.209> thumb

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
bit did the third string of the thumb

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.590 
bit did the third string of the thumb
and<00:04:21.740> then<00:04:22.740> pinch<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.550> outside<00:04:23.940> string<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.480> the

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
and then pinch the outside string is the

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.560 
and then pinch the outside string is the
1st<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:24.990> 5th<00:04:25.200> strings<00:04:26.240> actually<00:04:27.240> let's<00:04:27.390> go<00:04:27.420> to

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
1st and 5th strings actually let's go to

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.540 
1st and 5th strings actually let's go to
the<00:04:27.660> fourth<00:04:27.930> string<00:04:28.200> next<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:29.070> then<00:04:29.490> the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
the fourth string next and then the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.120 
the fourth string next and then the
pinch<00:04:29.910> again<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:31.140> outside<00:04:31.440> two<00:04:31.590> strings<00:04:31.920> so

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
pinch again the outside two strings so

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:52.420 
pinch again the outside two strings so
do<00:04:32.190> lend<00:04:32.370> with<00:04:34.670> she<00:04:35.670> you've<00:04:35.790> got

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.800 

that<00:04:52.880> really<00:04:53.060> has<00:04:53.150> kind<00:04:53.360> of<00:04:53.420> a<00:04:53.480> bluegrass

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
that really has kind of a bluegrass

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:31.090 
that really has kind of a bluegrass
sound<00:04:54.080> a<00:04:54.200> little<00:04:54.320> stark<00:04:54.710> bitch<00:04:55.670> equality

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.130 

Oh
