00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
thinking about that for the first seven

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.290 
thinking about that for the first seven
years<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.860> their<00:04:33.130> life<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.640> it<00:04:33.729> might<00:04:33.910> take<00:04:34.180> me

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
years of their life and it might take me

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.060 
years of their life and it might take me
that<00:04:34.450> long<00:04:34.479> to<00:04:34.720> work<00:04:34.990> out<00:04:35.320> what<00:04:35.500> you<00:04:35.650> start<00:04:35.890> out

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
that long to work out what you start out

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.450 
that long to work out what you start out
yeah<00:04:36.580> but<00:04:37.060> you<00:04:37.570> know<00:04:37.660> I<00:04:37.900> think<00:04:38.470> fable<00:04:38.860> one<00:04:39.039> it

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
yeah but you know I think fable one it

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.670 
yeah but you know I think fable one it
still<00:04:39.970> has<00:04:40.150> that<00:04:40.180> charm<00:04:40.600> there<00:04:41.260> is<00:04:41.410> always

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
still has that charm there is always

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.080 
still has that charm there is always
that<00:04:41.710> you<00:04:41.979> know<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.250> does<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.520> it<00:04:42.729> does<00:04:42.970> have

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
that you know it does is it does have

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.860 
that you know it does is it does have
the<00:04:43.180> violence<00:04:43.830> but<00:04:44.830> it's<00:04:45.820> probably<00:04:46.270> a<00:04:46.600> little

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
the violence but it's probably a little

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.960 
the violence but it's probably a little
less<00:04:47.080> mature<00:04:47.350> than<00:04:47.530> perhaps<00:04:47.770> fable<00:04:48.220> 2<00:04:48.400> is<00:04:48.550> and

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
less mature than perhaps fable 2 is and

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.460 
less mature than perhaps fable 2 is and
so<00:04:49.120> I<00:04:49.150> think<00:04:49.240> starting<00:04:49.720> start<00:04:50.140> with<00:04:50.260> they<00:04:50.350> were

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
so I think starting start with they were

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.200 
so I think starting start with they were
