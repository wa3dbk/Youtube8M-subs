what I'll do is I'll lay down the
lightest<00:01:25.890> color<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:26.400> I'll<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.700> from

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
lightest color and then I'll go from

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.260 
lightest color and then I'll go from
lightest<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.630> darkest<00:01:28.170> which<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.560> how<00:01:28.860> most<00:01:29.280> of

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
lightest to darkest which is how most of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.569 
lightest to darkest which is how most of
my<00:01:30.420> drawings<00:01:30.479> actually<00:01:31.290> work<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.460> this

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
my drawings actually work but with this

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.219 
my drawings actually work but with this
one<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.790> actually<00:01:32.970> decided<00:01:33.240> okay<00:01:33.930> I'm<00:01:33.960> gonna

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
one I actually decided okay I'm gonna

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.530 
one I actually decided okay I'm gonna
lay<00:01:34.470> down<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.710> mid-tone<00:01:35.189> first<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.329> from

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
lay down a mid-tone first and so from

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.030 
lay down a mid-tone first and so from
there<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.869> create<00:01:37.259> highlights<00:01:37.710> then

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
there I can create highlights then

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.890 
there I can create highlights then
highlight<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.610> those<00:01:38.790> highlights<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.360> then

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
highlight for those highlights and then

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.649 
highlight for those highlights and then
I<00:01:40.110> shade<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.759> that<00:01:41.759> made<00:01:41.939> any<00:01:42.090> sense<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.570> you

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
I shade it in that made any sense to you

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.679 
I shade it in that made any sense to you
good<00:01:42.960> freaking<00:01:43.409> job<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:44.009> anyway<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> laid

good freaking job but anyway so I laid

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.569 
good freaking job but anyway so I laid
mid-tones<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.290> first<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.740> then<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.340> time<00:01:47.549> I

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
mid-tones in first and then this time I

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.010 
mid-tones in first and then this time I
was<00:01:47.759> actually<00:01:47.939> focused<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> light<00:01:48.840> source

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
was actually focused on a light source

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.380 
was actually focused on a light source
which<00:01:49.320> i'll<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.649> honest<00:01:49.979> i<00:01:50.100> don't<00:01:50.220> usually<00:01:50.729> do

coloring outside the lines either dot so

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.790 
coloring outside the lines either dot so
that<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.750> just<00:02:16.930> goes<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.290> show<00:02:17.320> that<00:02:17.500> with

digital<00:02:18.250> art<00:02:18.460> you<00:02:18.580> can<00:02:18.730> forget<00:02:19.000> everything

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
digital art you can forget everything

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.730 
digital art you can forget everything
you've<00:02:19.570> ever<00:02:19.690> known<00:02:19.870> about<00:02:20.230> coloring<00:02:20.530> inside

you've ever known about coloring inside

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.030 
you've ever known about coloring inside
the<00:02:20.920> lines<00:02:22.200> because<00:02:23.200> this<00:02:23.350> is<00:02:23.470> digital<00:02:23.860> art

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.680 
and we don't play by the rules but
anyway<00:02:26.530> um<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.580> guess<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.000> can<00:02:28.150> explain<00:02:28.420> what<00:02:28.660> I

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
anyway um I guess I can explain what I

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.870 
anyway um I guess I can explain what I
do<00:02:28.780> for<00:02:29.050> this<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.800> still<00:02:30.250> clip<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.640> group

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
do for this so I I still clip the group

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.370 
do for this so I I still clip the group
I<00:02:31.030> just<00:02:31.270> have<00:02:31.420> one<00:02:31.540> flat<00:02:31.840> color<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.350> goes

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
I just have one flat color that goes

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.810 
I just have one flat color that goes
over<00:02:32.740> everything<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.310> then<00:02:33.460> I'll<00:02:33.580> shade

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
over everything and then I'll shade

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.000 
over everything and then I'll shade
everything<00:02:33.970> in<00:02:34.360> a<00:02:34.450> group<00:02:34.870> clip<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.470> but

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
everything in a group clip to that but

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.500 
everything in a group clip to that but
then<00:02:36.160> later<00:02:36.340> on<00:02:36.490> when<00:02:36.760> I'm<00:02:36.850> done<00:02:37.030> with<00:02:37.060> all<00:02:37.390> the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
then later on when I'm done with all the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.090 
then later on when I'm done with all the
coloring<00:02:37.870> i'll<00:02:38.020> create<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.350> mask<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.740> its<00:02:38.920> own

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
coloring i'll create a mask of its own

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.680 
coloring i'll create a mask of its own
and<00:02:39.280> that's<00:02:39.850> where<00:02:40.060> i<00:02:40.090> actually<00:02:40.240> like<00:02:40.570> do

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
and that's where i actually like do

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.630 
and that's where i actually like do
color<00:02:40.930> inside<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.290> lines<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.800> then<00:02:42.460> your

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
color inside the lines and then your

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.699 
color inside the lines and then your
best<00:02:43.060> friend<00:02:43.420> which<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:43.750> clipping<00:02:44.170> groups<00:02:44.470> the

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
best friend which is clipping groups the

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.010 
best friend which is clipping groups the
ones<00:02:44.890> i<00:02:45.010> have<00:02:45.190> aforementioned<00:02:45.910> this<00:02:46.750> right

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
ones i have aforementioned this right

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.900 
ones i have aforementioned this right
here<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:47.830> that's<00:02:48.010> making<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.459> mask<00:02:48.700> that's

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
here so that's making the mask that's

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.640 
here so that's making the mask that's
going<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.209> select<00:02:49.360> everything<00:02:49.810> inside<00:02:50.500> the

going to select everything inside the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.110 
going to select everything inside the
hair<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.070> then<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.459> clip<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.030> it's

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
hair and then I clip it and it's

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.570 
hair and then I clip it and it's

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
mice I actually broke like my pencil

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.940 
mice I actually broke like my pencil
side<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.600> executive<00:03:14.260> files<00:03:14.470> or<00:03:14.680> something

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
side the executive files or something

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.830 
side the executive files or something
like<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.100> whenever<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.580> open<00:03:15.670> is<00:03:16.120> just<00:03:16.450> it

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
like that whenever I open is just it

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.140 
like that whenever I open is just it
says<00:03:17.140> it's<00:03:17.320> loading<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:17.709> like<00:03:17.890> hey<00:03:18.130> no<00:03:18.640> then

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
says it's loading it's like hey no then

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.440 
says it's loading it's like hey no then
it<00:03:19.239> just<00:03:19.390> closes<00:03:19.600> in<00:03:19.900> like<00:03:20.019> oh<00:03:20.230> come<00:03:20.709> on<00:03:20.860> yeah<00:03:21.820> I

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
it just closes in like oh come on yeah I

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.960 
it just closes in like oh come on yeah I
mean<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.380> guess<00:03:23.410> if<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:24.190> were<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.519> happen<00:03:24.550> at

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
mean I guess if that were to happen at

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.400 
mean I guess if that were to happen at
any<00:03:25.090> time<00:03:25.180> now<00:03:25.540> would<00:03:25.690> be<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.810> best<00:03:25.930> times<00:03:26.260> we

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
any time now would be the best times we

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.530 
any time now would be the best times we
to<00:03:26.530> happen<00:03:26.800> because<00:03:26.940> I've<00:03:27.940> kind<00:03:28.300> of<00:03:28.360> already

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
to happen because I've kind of already

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.570 
to happen because I've kind of already
gotten<00:03:28.989> used<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.290> using<00:03:29.470> Photoshop<00:03:30.040> anyway<00:03:30.400> I

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
gotten used to using Photoshop anyway I

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.370 
gotten used to using Photoshop anyway I
mean<00:03:30.760> if<00:03:30.880> I<00:03:31.000> lost<00:03:31.420> sign<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:32.080> I<00:03:32.140> had<00:03:32.260> to

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
mean if I lost sign that I had to

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.810 
mean if I lost sign that I had to
transition<00:03:32.709> into<00:03:32.980> Photoshop<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:33.610> learn<00:03:33.790> how

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
transition into Photoshop and learn how

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.729 
transition into Photoshop and learn how
to<00:03:34.030> use<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.300> all<00:03:34.390> over<00:03:34.420> again<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:35.230> be<00:03:35.470> pretty

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
to use it all over again and be pretty

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.540 
to use it all over again and be pretty
bad<00:03:36.010> but<00:03:36.610> no<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.769> decided<00:03:38.769> to<00:03:38.800> self-destruct

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
bad but no it decided to self-destruct

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.190 
bad but no it decided to self-destruct
when<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:39.940> already<00:03:40.180> knew<00:03:40.390> Photoshop<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.110> I'm

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
when I already knew Photoshop and I'm

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.870 
when I already knew Photoshop and I'm
like<00:03:41.350> I<00:03:41.530> guess<00:03:41.739> I<00:03:41.890> can't<00:03:42.130> beat<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.400> focus<00:03:42.760> i

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
like I guess I can't beat the focus i

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.490 
like I guess I can't beat the focus i
would<00:03:43.090> but<00:03:43.660> i<00:03:43.720> can<00:03:43.900> still<00:03:44.019> get<00:03:44.290> both<00:03:44.470> the

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
would but i can still get both the

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.590 
would but i can still get both the
shuffles<00:03:45.010> in<00:03:45.160> which<00:03:45.610> this<00:03:45.970> is<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.209> next<00:03:46.420> best

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
shuffles in which this is the next best
