00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.960
 this we must be the head of the clan 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.840
 let's write down fkm we decided to privatize there 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.379
 lock on the 16 on 16 on which you 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.710

 your strength will increase to 10 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.420
 if you die she will 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.729
 decrease to -10 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.740
 what does she give when you turn 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.310
 spend 11 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.140
 but the division of power that is if you 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.479
 for example the territory 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.939

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.829
 appear players but if they want to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.750

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:06.079
 We get up on any necessary 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.079
 chang of our faction and write this ham 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.270

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.450
 faction member who in our our clan 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:19.620
 can become moss and appear here on 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.780

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.880
 when do you go to your vat or enemies 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.340

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.650
 want to change it f disk cd-r disk and 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.019
 we mark n with to and wrote there every little 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.290
 we rewrote everyone 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.950
 who will enter our lands will 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.780
 Here is such a feguli to appear we 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.160
 we want to see detailed information 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.069
 our plan for this is writing in the show 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.400
 we receive detailed information we 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.160
 want to join valiant 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.310
 some fraction for this we write with ollie 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.220
 and we are volume and peace if it is again a 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.030
 if she also writes bottlenose dolphins and a name 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.820
 your faction 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.730
 then you will be friends accordingly 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:19.049
 want to be the enemy you want to be 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.760
 an enemy faction of some kind with us and a faction 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.720
 don't forget we must 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.150
 be not a member of the faction but head or 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.709
 deputy head you declared war 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.410
 this fraction you can now kill 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.530
 players need to be accustomed to refueling and 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.100
 agitators if you stand for example 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.980
 on their chunks you find out they can beat you 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.430
 or we may, at its because you can and 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.290
 they will not be able to 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.650
 now we want to leave the clan for this 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.440
 write flew we leave our squaw 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.540
 but she is disbanded because we are alone 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.810
 in this fraction therefore she 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.730
 formed automatically if you 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.549
 even though the faction is all rights from the territory 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.410
 drop if you are a member of the faction all rights 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.780
 the territory is fully offered to you 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.859
 opening doors 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.889
 the opening of the chests breaking blocks all this 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:16.289
 you can do if you are composed 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.859
 factions you want to chat in chat 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.699
 faction or alliance you write 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.370
 chat then you go to chat faction 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:28.840
 that is, alliances first go from 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.610
 Alliance there you will correspond 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.860
 by all your friends if you once again 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.259
 write to chat you will go to chat 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.680
 clan you will correspondence so much in 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.110
 clan 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:46.340
 if you write f again chat you 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:48.560
 go to general chat one more big 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.840

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.860
 your stuff falls but you are very very 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.689
 very much mistaken you wanted 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.819
 attack some faction declared war 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:01.490
 attacks happy us things won't fall 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:04.279
 but it was not there if you step on 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.120
 enemy territory that is in a hug 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:08.000
 bath come 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.699
 and a member of the Countâ€™s faction will kill you 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.580
 things fall safely so be 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.469
