that<00:02:23.099> will<00:02:23.220> always<00:02:23.370> be<00:02:23.489> seen<00:02:23.910> then<00:02:24.720> I'm<00:02:24.840> going

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
that will always be seen then I'm going

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.870 
that will always be seen then I'm going
to<00:02:25.019> pull<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> scarf<00:02:25.530> back<00:02:25.739> quite<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.250> fair<00:02:26.670> bit

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
to pull the scarf back quite a fair bit

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.120 
to pull the scarf back quite a fair bit
and<00:02:27.209> create<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.819> triangle<00:02:29.819> shape<00:02:30.060> up<00:02:30.390> here

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
and create a triangle shape up here

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.190 
and create a triangle shape up here
which<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.760> allow<00:02:32.940> for<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.750> scarf<00:02:34.019> to

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
which is going to allow for the scarf to

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.979 
which is going to allow for the scarf to
not<00:02:34.349> fall<00:02:34.920> over<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.940> center<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.360> my<00:02:36.510> face<00:02:36.690> but

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
not fall over the center of my face but

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.070 
not fall over the center of my face but
rather<00:02:37.230> than<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.590> fall<00:02:37.830> sort<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.280> like<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:39.080> my

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
rather than to fall sort of like this my

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.580 
rather than to fall sort of like this my
face<00:02:40.319> so<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:41.630> pull<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.780> scooped<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.200> up<00:02:43.319> and

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
face so I pull the scooped it up and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.070 
face so I pull the scooped it up and
then<00:02:43.799> I'm<00:02:43.920> going<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.190> cause<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.000> fold<00:02:45.870> over

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
then I'm going to cause it to fold over

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.759 
then I'm going to cause it to fold over
on<00:02:46.860> one<00:02:47.069> side<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.670> then<00:02:47.910> create<00:02:48.769> this

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
on one side and then create this

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.380 
on one side and then create this
triangle<00:02:50.549> shape<00:02:50.700> at<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.690> top<00:02:52.940> I'm<00:02:53.940> going<00:02:54.209> to

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
triangle shape at the top I'm going to

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.330 
triangle shape at the top I'm going to

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.229 
more of a contrasting look as opposed to
having<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.620> pins<00:03:22.890> camouflage<00:03:23.549> I'm<00:03:24.030> also

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
having the pins camouflage I'm also

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.640 
having the pins camouflage I'm also
going<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.570> put<00:03:24.720> one<00:03:24.900> more<00:03:24.930> pin<00:03:25.230> at<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.410> front

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
going to put one more pin at the front

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.349 
going to put one more pin at the front
because<00:03:25.859> I<00:03:25.920> want<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.130> make<00:03:26.280> sure<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.700> that

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
because I want to make sure that that

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.750 
because I want to make sure that that
shape<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.959> maintained<00:03:28.470> because<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.459> scarf

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
shape is maintained because the scarf

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
shape is maintained because the scarf
will<00:03:30.090> move<00:03:30.329> around<00:03:30.950> inevitably<00:03:32.570> over<00:03:33.570> time

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
will move around inevitably over time

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.910 
will move around inevitably over time
next<00:03:34.230> I'm<00:03:34.560> going<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:35.040> reach<00:03:35.220> behind<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:36.030> scarf

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
next I'm going to reach behind the scarf

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.240 
next I'm going to reach behind the scarf
over<00:03:37.920> here<00:03:38.130> so<00:03:38.519> not<00:03:38.700> this<00:03:38.850> loop<00:03:39.470> pot<00:03:40.470> over<00:03:40.799> here

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
over here so not this loop pot over here

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.059 
over here so not this loop pot over here
at<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:42.060> front<00:03:42.359> for<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.930> loop<00:03:43.230> part<00:03:43.680> at<00:03:43.950> the

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
at the front for the loop part at the

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.300 
at the front for the loop part at the
back<00:03:44.390> so<00:03:45.390> it's<00:03:45.989> might<00:03:46.170> be<00:03:46.200> slightly<00:03:46.890> trickier

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
back so it's might be slightly trickier

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.610 
back so it's might be slightly trickier
doing<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.609> the<00:03:47.700> first<00:03:47.910> time<00:03:48.090> but<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.319> pull<00:03:49.530> it

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
doing it the first time but you pull it

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.190 
doing it the first time but you pull it
forward<00:03:50.010> like<00:03:50.040> this<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:51.980> then<00:03:53.870> this<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:55.049> going

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
forward like this and then this is going

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.050 
forward like this and then this is going
to<00:03:55.290> give<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.620> neck<00:03:55.739> coverage<00:03:56.130> so<00:03:56.910> what

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
to give you the neck coverage so what

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.550 
to give you the neck coverage so what
you<00:03:57.180> do<00:03:57.359> is<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.989> line<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.410> up

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
you do is you line it up

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.250 
you do is you line it up
and<00:03:58.769> you<00:03:59.069> pin<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.609> so<00:04:00.299> that<00:04:00.569> it's<00:04:00.780> covering

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
and you pin it so that it's covering

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.059 
and you pin it so that it's covering
your<00:04:01.650> neck<00:04:02.030> like<00:04:03.030> this<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:04.530> want<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.799> pin

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
move this top part to the side looking

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.990 
move this top part to the side looking
back<00:04:09.720> into<00:04:10.139> pin<00:04:10.350> this<00:04:10.500> up

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
back into pin this up

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.289 
back into pin this up
here<00:04:11.260> with<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.290> straightedge<00:04:12.980> app<00:04:13.400> it<00:04:16.299> doesn't

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299
