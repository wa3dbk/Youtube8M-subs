ride<00:00:31.009> we<00:00:31.160> were<00:00:31.220> looking<00:00:31.460> at<00:00:31.550> a<00:00:32.020> 2014<00:00:34.060> lowrider

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
ride we were looking at a 2014 lowrider

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.180 
ride we were looking at a 2014 lowrider
now<00:00:35.329> the<00:00:35.390> lowrider<00:00:35.989> was<00:00:36.290> on<00:00:36.440> vacation<00:00:36.950> for<00:00:37.130> a

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
now the lowrider was on vacation for a

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.270 
now the lowrider was on vacation for a
couple<00:00:37.250> years<00:00:37.550> Harley<00:00:38.000> Davidson<00:00:38.420> decided<00:00:38.930> to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
couple years Harley Davidson decided to

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.100 
couple years Harley Davidson decided to
not<00:00:40.280> bring<00:00:40.520> it<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:40.880> lineup<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:41.540> they<00:00:41.750> just

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
not bring it to the lineup so they just

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.610 
not bring it to the lineup so they just
reintroduced<00:00:42.830> it<00:00:43.010> in<00:00:43.100> 2014<00:00:44.090> I<00:00:44.410> guess<00:00:45.410> this

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
reintroduced it in 2014 I guess this

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.290 
reintroduced it in 2014 I guess this
would<00:00:45.770> be<00:00:45.830> a<00:00:45.980> considered<00:00:46.640> a<00:00:46.790> standard

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
would be a considered a standard

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.370 
would be a considered a standard
motorcycle<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:49.720> possibly<00:00:50.720> a<00:00:50.840> little<00:00:51.260> bit

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
motorcycle and possibly a little bit

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.620 
motorcycle and possibly a little bit
above<00:00:51.650> entry-level<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:53.120> somebody<00:00:53.510> was

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
above entry-level so somebody was

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.020 
above entry-level so somebody was
interested<00:00:53.840> in<00:00:54.170> entry-level<00:00:54.620> motor<00:00:55.130> cycle

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
interested in entry-level motor cycle

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.940 
interested in entry-level motor cycle
now<00:00:56.630> one<00:00:57.020> thing<00:00:57.200> I<00:00:57.350> like<00:00:57.560> about<00:00:57.590> this

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
now one thing I like about this

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.160 
now one thing I like about this
motorcycle<00:00:58.280> that<00:00:58.960> sometimes<00:00:59.960> he<00:01:00.079> aggravates

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
motorcycle that sometimes he aggravates

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.380 
motorcycle that sometimes he aggravates
me<00:01:00.770> is<00:01:00.950> I<00:01:00.980> hate<00:01:01.340> when<00:01:01.490> they<00:01:01.610> just<00:01:01.820> put<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.030> single

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
me is I hate when they just put a single

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.670 
me is I hate when they just put a single
front<00:01:02.600> disc<00:01:02.870> because<00:01:03.200> when<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:03.440> hit<00:01:03.530> the

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
front disc because when you hit the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.649 
front disc because when you hit the
brakes<00:01:03.970> the<00:01:04.970> majority<00:01:05.360> of<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.479> weights

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
brakes the majority of the weights

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.330 
brakes the majority of the weights
transfer<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.409> front<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:06.890> that's<00:01:07.159> where

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
transfer to the front and that's where

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.980 
transfer to the front and that's where
your<00:01:07.460> stopping<00:01:07.880> power<00:01:08.060> is<00:01:08.299> so<00:01:08.840> this

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
your stopping power is so this

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.370 
your stopping power is so this
motorcycle<00:01:09.320> does<00:01:09.770> have<00:01:10.070> two<00:01:11.110> front<00:01:12.110> disc

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
motorcycle does have two front disc

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.480 
motorcycle does have two front disc
brakes<00:01:12.679> which<00:01:12.920> is<00:01:13.069> cool

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490
