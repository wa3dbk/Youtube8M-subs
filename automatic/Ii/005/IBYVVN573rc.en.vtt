00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:02.840 

here<00:00:01.349> are<00:00:01.619> a<00:00:01.650> few<00:00:02.129> things<00:00:02.370> you<00:00:02.640> should

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
here are a few things you should

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.620 
here are a few things you should
consider<00:00:03.030> before<00:00:03.360> building<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.470> rock<00:00:04.890> wall<00:00:05.630> one

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:06.630 
consider before building a rock wall one

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.650 
consider before building a rock wall one
of<00:00:06.660> them<00:00:07.020> will<00:00:07.320> be<00:00:07.620> that<00:00:08.160> they<00:00:08.789> can<00:00:08.999> actually

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
of them will be that they can actually

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.470 
of them will be that they can actually
fall<00:00:09.959> over<00:00:10.650> if<00:00:11.369> they<00:00:11.759> are<00:00:12.030> small<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.199> skinny

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
fall over if they are small and skinny

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.779 
fall over if they are small and skinny
and<00:00:15.480> if<00:00:15.959> they<00:00:16.320> are<00:00:16.800> going<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.220> be<00:00:17.340> used<00:00:17.580> as

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
and if they are going to be used as

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.870 
and if they are going to be used as
retaining<00:00:18.300> walls<00:00:19.009> then<00:00:20.009> they<00:00:20.519> can<00:00:20.730> actually

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
retaining walls then they can actually

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.630 
retaining walls then they can actually
be<00:00:21.269> pushed<00:00:21.539> over<00:00:21.750> by<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.140> sore<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:23.039> force<00:00:23.339> of

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
be pushed over by the sore the force of

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.029 
be pushed over by the sore the force of
the<00:00:23.849> soil<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:25.080> here<00:00:25.349> what<00:00:25.500> you're<00:00:25.650> looking<00:00:25.890> at

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
the soil so here what you're looking at

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.739 
the soil so here what you're looking at
here<00:00:26.160> looks<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.490> be<00:00:26.759> something<00:00:27.119> that's<00:00:27.390> about

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:27.749 
here looks to be something that's about

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.890 
here looks to be something that's about
2<00:00:28.439> foot<00:00:28.710> by<00:00:29.039> 2<00:00:29.099> foot<00:00:29.310> two<00:00:29.880> foot<00:00:30.089> wide<00:00:30.150> 2<00:00:30.630> foot

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
2 foot by 2 foot two foot wide 2 foot

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.870 
2 foot by 2 foot two foot wide 2 foot
tall<00:00:31.169> and<00:00:32.510> it<00:00:33.510> goes<00:00:33.720> around<00:00:33.900> an<00:00:34.500> area<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.670> it

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
tall and it goes around an area and it

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.460 
tall and it goes around an area and it
looks<00:00:36.150> like<00:00:36.330> everything's<00:00:36.900> in<00:00:37.080> pretty<00:00:37.320> good

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
looks like everything's in pretty good

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.430 
looks like everything's in pretty good
shape<00:00:38.180> except<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.450> where<00:00:39.660> they<00:00:39.870> poured<00:00:40.200> these

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
shape except for where they poured these

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.740 
shape except for where they poured these
new<00:00:40.710> concrete<00:00:41.370> stairs<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.210> new<00:00:42.420> looks

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
new concrete stairs in this new looks

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.580 
new concrete stairs in this new looks
like<00:00:42.930> walkway<00:00:43.560> and<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:45.210> I'm<00:00:45.570> guessing<00:00:46.290> that

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
like walkway and I I'm guessing that

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.090 
like walkway and I I'm guessing that
whoever<00:00:47.270> worked<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.780> project<00:00:49.020> might<00:00:49.920> have

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
whoever worked on the project might have

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.310 
whoever worked on the project might have
had<00:00:50.310> some<00:00:51.090> heavy<00:00:51.270> equipment<00:00:51.450> and<00:00:51.990> actually

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
had some heavy equipment and actually

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.500 
had some heavy equipment and actually
just<00:00:52.560> pushed<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.070> wall<00:00:53.280> over<00:00:53.550> accidentally

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
just pushed the wall over accidentally

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.440 
just pushed the wall over accidentally
and<00:00:54.690> that's<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.050> my<00:00:55.200> guess<00:00:56.180> but<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.300> actually

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
and that's just my guess but it actually

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.810 
and that's just my guess but it actually
could<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:57.900> fell<00:00:58.080> over<00:00:58.380> for<00:00:58.650> a<00:00:58.680> few<00:00:59.580> other

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
could have fell over for a few other

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.430 
could have fell over for a few other
reasons<00:01:00.360> I<00:01:00.480> mean<00:01:00.630> you<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.810> see<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.260> there's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
reasons I mean you can see here there's

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.310 
reasons I mean you can see here there's
a<00:01:01.530> large<00:01:01.740> crack<00:01:02.870> looks<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.080> there<00:01:04.290> are

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
a large crack looks like there are

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.090 
a large crack looks like there are
squirrels<00:01:05.090> squirrels<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.360> undermined<00:01:07.100> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
squirrels squirrels can undermined the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.960 
squirrels squirrels can undermined the
foundations<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.390> these<00:01:09.690> and<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:11.520> walls<00:01:11.730> can

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
foundations of these and the walls can

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.410 
foundations of these and the walls can
fall<00:01:12.180> over<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.890> again<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.340> cracks<00:01:14.670> you're

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
fall over and again the cracks you're

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.940 
fall over and again the cracks you're
gonna<00:01:15.600> see<00:01:15.900> them<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.440> variety<00:01:16.620> of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
gonna see them for a variety of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.110 
gonna see them for a variety of
different<00:01:17.370> reasons<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:20.130> know<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> them

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
different reasons you know one of them

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.740 
different reasons you know one of them
will<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.720> any<00:01:22.650> type<00:01:22.980> of<00:01:23.010> movement<00:01:23.880> or<00:01:24.180> settling

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
will be any type of movement or settling

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.570 
will be any type of movement or settling
so<00:01:25.200> if<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.370> any<00:01:26.700> type<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.180> soil<00:01:27.600> erosion

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
so if you have any type of soil erosion

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.940 
so if you have any type of soil erosion
cause<00:01:29.580> naturally<00:01:30.450> or<00:01:30.659> by<00:01:31.080> some<00:01:31.740> type<00:01:31.920> of

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
cause naturally or by some type of

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.030 
cause naturally or by some type of
animals<00:01:32.550> like<00:01:32.790> squirrels<00:01:33.180> then<00:01:34.040> eventually

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
animals like squirrels then eventually

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.080 
animals like squirrels then eventually
the<00:01:35.400> soil<00:01:35.670> will<00:01:35.940> settle<00:01:36.270> down<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:38.090> crack

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the soil will settle down and crack

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.260 
the soil will settle down and crack
that's<00:01:39.510> that's<00:01:39.750> not<00:01:39.930> uncommon<00:01:40.380> even<00:01:40.710> in

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
that's that's not uncommon even in

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.469 
that's that's not uncommon even in
building<00:01:42.270> foundations<00:01:43.700> here's<00:01:44.700> another<00:01:45.060> view

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
building foundations here's another view

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.600 
building foundations here's another view
of<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.840> wall<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.440> see<00:01:46.590> where<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.250> soil

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
of the wall you can see where the soil

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.630 
of the wall you can see where the soil
is<00:01:47.880> actually<00:01:48.120> starting<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.900> erode<00:01:49.710> from<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
is actually starting to erode from the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.300 
is actually starting to erode from the
underneath<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.390> wall<00:01:51.890> providing<00:01:52.890> us<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.100> a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
underneath the wall providing us with a

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.010 
underneath the wall providing us with a
pretty<00:01:53.729> good<00:01:53.970> clue<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:54.780> built

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
pretty good clue that this was built

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.480 
pretty good clue that this was built
right<00:01:55.260> on<00:01:55.470> top<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:57.060> ground<00:01:57.650> now<00:01:58.650> there<00:01:59.190> is

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
right on top of the ground now there is

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.640 
right on top of the ground now there is
a<00:01:59.880> solution<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.630> also<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.290> could

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
a solution to that also you could

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.219 
a solution to that also you could
actually<00:02:01.860> dig<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> trench<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.390> start<00:02:03.900> building

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
actually dig a trench and start building

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.520 
actually dig a trench and start building
the<00:02:04.470> wall<00:02:04.710> below<00:02:04.979> ground<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:06.570> who<00:02:07.320> knows

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
the wall below ground and who knows

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.069 
the wall below ground and who knows
maybe<00:02:07.830> this<00:02:08.099> wall<00:02:08.429> was<00:02:08.819> below<00:02:09.179> ground<00:02:09.509> three

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
maybe this wall was below ground three

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.160 
maybe this wall was below ground three
or<00:02:10.170> four<00:02:10.349> inches<00:02:10.590> at<00:02:10.799> one<00:02:10.979> time<00:02:11.249> but<00:02:11.689> no<00:02:12.689> longer

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
or four inches at one time but no longer

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.930 
or four inches at one time but no longer
is

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
is

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.270 
is
there<00:02:15.269> is<00:02:15.480> another<00:02:15.900> solution<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.769> that<00:02:16.799> you

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
there is another solution to that you

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.280 
there is another solution to that you
could<00:02:17.430> actually<00:02:17.760> pour<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> concrete<00:02:18.330> footing

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
could actually pour a concrete footing

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.130 
could actually pour a concrete footing
foundation<00:02:20.220> underneath<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.940> wall<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.569> then

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
foundation underneath the wall and then

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.990 
foundation underneath the wall and then
install<00:02:22.700> rebar<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.659> footing<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:26.430> provide

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
install rebar in the footing to provide

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.970 
install rebar in the footing to provide
you<00:02:27.150> with<00:02:27.180> additional<00:02:27.470> structural<00:02:28.470> support

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
you with additional structural support

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.280 
you with additional structural support
I'm<00:02:29.790> if<00:02:29.909> you're<00:02:30.060> gonna<00:02:30.150> build<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.540> wall<00:02:30.569> 24

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
I'm if you're gonna build a wall 24

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.610 
I'm if you're gonna build a wall 24
inches<00:02:31.530> wide<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:32.159> put<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.879> footing<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:34.110> 24

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
inches wide and put a footing the 24

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.770 
inches wide and put a footing the 24
inches<00:02:34.860> wide<00:02:34.920> maybe<00:02:35.400> 12<00:02:35.730> inches<00:02:35.849> down<00:02:36.299> in<00:02:36.659> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
inches wide maybe 12 inches down in the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.710 
inches wide maybe 12 inches down in the
ground<00:02:37.370> but<00:02:38.370> again<00:02:38.849> this<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.239> all<00:02:39.390> going<00:02:39.599> to

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
ground but again this is all going to

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.140 
ground but again this is all going to
depend<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:40.379> how<00:02:40.860> big<00:02:41.159> the<00:02:41.190> wall<00:02:41.579> is<00:02:41.879> for

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
depend on how big the wall is for

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.559 
depend on how big the wall is for
something<00:02:42.360> like<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.110> think<00:02:43.549> 12<00:02:44.549> inch<00:02:44.819> deep

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
something like this I think 12 inch deep

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.449 
something like this I think 12 inch deep
footing<00:02:46.319> with<00:02:47.120> maybe<00:02:48.120> four<00:02:49.280> pieces<00:02:50.280> of

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
footing with maybe four pieces of

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.069 
footing with maybe four pieces of
half-inch<00:02:50.970> rebar<00:02:51.540> running<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.769> length<00:02:53.370> of

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
half-inch rebar running the length of

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.640 
half-inch rebar running the length of
the<00:02:55.079> footing<00:02:55.709> running<00:02:56.400> horizontal<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.650> or

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
the footing running horizontal to the or

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.449 
the footing running horizontal to the or
parallel<00:02:59.159> to<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.790> to<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.900> wall<00:03:01.109> would<00:03:01.650> would

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
parallel to the to the wall would would

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.670 
parallel to the to the wall would would
be<00:03:02.640> fine<00:03:02.970> but<00:03:03.450> again<00:03:03.510> I'm<00:03:04.019> not<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.200> structural

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
be fine but again I'm not a structural

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.020 
be fine but again I'm not a structural
engineer<00:03:05.190> I'm<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:05.430> kind<00:03:05.579> of<00:03:05.609> throwing<00:03:05.849> that

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
engineer I'm just kind of throwing that

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.119 
engineer I'm just kind of throwing that
out<00:03:06.090> there<00:03:06.349> obviously<00:03:07.349> anything<00:03:07.739> would<00:03:08.099> be

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
out there obviously anything would be

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.580 
out there obviously anything would be
better<00:03:08.250> than<00:03:08.819> nothing<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.510> right<00:03:10.140> now<00:03:10.349> what

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
better than nothing and right now what

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.119 
better than nothing and right now what
we're<00:03:10.739> looking<00:03:10.769> at<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:12.450> rock<00:03:13.079> wall<00:03:13.409> without

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
we're looking at is a rock wall without

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.750 
we're looking at is a rock wall without
anything<00:03:15.500> here's<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.769> biggest<00:03:17.220> problem<00:03:17.669> of

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
anything here's the biggest problem of

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.550 
anything here's the biggest problem of
all<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.299> is<00:03:18.419> of<00:03:18.750> course<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.319> rocks

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
all and that is of course that the rocks

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.849 
all and that is of course that the rocks
actually<00:03:19.889> will<00:03:20.370> fall<00:03:20.730> out<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.709> again<00:03:22.709> I'm<00:03:22.829> not

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
actually will fall out and again I'm not

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.289 
actually will fall out and again I'm not
saying<00:03:23.160> that's<00:03:23.280> going<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.549> happen<00:03:23.700> every<00:03:24.090> time

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
saying that's going to happen every time

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.500 
saying that's going to happen every time
but<00:03:24.720> if<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.079> does<00:03:25.319> you<00:03:25.709> know<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.370> mean<00:03:26.669> it<00:03:27.329> all

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
but if it does you know I mean it all

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.319 
but if it does you know I mean it all
starts<00:03:27.930> with<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.169> foundation<00:03:28.879> if<00:03:29.879> you<00:03:30.120> don't

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
starts with the foundation if you don't

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.180 
starts with the foundation if you don't
have<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.510> foundation<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.379> build<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.680> rock<00:03:31.889> wall

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
have a foundation you build a rock wall

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.979 
have a foundation you build a rock wall
it's<00:03:32.519> too<00:03:32.819> thin<00:03:34.459> it's<00:03:35.459> not<00:03:36.060> if<00:03:36.329> not<00:03:36.540> built<00:03:36.810> in

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
it's too thin it's not if not built in

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.569 
it's too thin it's not if not built in
the<00:03:37.079> right<00:03:37.260> soil<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:37.950> not<00:03:38.129> built<00:03:38.400> and

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
the right soil it's not built and

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.319 
the right soil it's not built and
compacted<00:03:39.209> soil<00:03:40.370> you<00:03:41.370> know<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.790> wall<00:03:41.940> starts

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
compacted soil you know the wall starts

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.059 
compacted soil you know the wall starts
to<00:03:42.480> crack<00:03:42.750> well<00:03:43.049> guess<00:03:43.230> what<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.650> rocks<00:03:43.859> are

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
to crack well guess what the rocks are

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.729 
to crack well guess what the rocks are
going<00:03:44.099> to<00:03:44.280> fall<00:03:44.519> out<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.150> this<00:03:45.810> all<00:03:46.079> depends

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
going to fall out and this all depends

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.949 
going to fall out and this all depends
on<00:03:47.720> how<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.900> was<00:03:49.079> built<00:03:49.790> how<00:03:50.790> white<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.419> and

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
on how it was built how white it is and

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.839 
on how it was built how white it is and
and<00:03:52.169> and<00:03:52.949> so<00:03:53.310> on

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
and and so on

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.119 
and and so on
so<00:03:54.239> really<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.780> sum<00:03:55.019> everything<00:03:55.049> up<00:03:55.680> here<00:03:56.010> if

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
so really to sum everything up here if

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.339 
so really to sum everything up here if
you're<00:03:56.280> gonna<00:03:56.370> build<00:03:56.609> a<00:03:56.730> rock<00:03:56.970> wall<00:03:57.239> make<00:03:58.169> sure

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
you're gonna build a rock wall make sure

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.650 
you're gonna build a rock wall make sure
there's<00:03:58.590> gonna<00:03:58.739> be<00:03:58.919> a<00:03:58.949> little<00:03:59.190> thicker<00:03:59.660> you

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
there's gonna be a little thicker you

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.349 
there's gonna be a little thicker you
know<00:04:00.810> thicker<00:04:01.590> rock<00:04:02.010> walls<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.940> should<00:04:03.180> say

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
know thicker rock walls I should say

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.020 
know thicker rock walls I should say
whiter<00:04:03.720> rock<00:04:04.199> walls<00:04:04.530> are<00:04:05.280> going<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.639> last<00:04:05.819> a

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
whiter rock walls are going to last a

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.650 
whiter rock walls are going to last a
little<00:04:06.209> longer<00:04:06.329> than<00:04:07.260> thinner<00:04:07.650> ones<00:04:08.569> you<00:04:09.569> know

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
little longer than thinner ones you know

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.039 
little longer than thinner ones you know
I've<00:04:09.780> seen<00:04:10.049> people<00:04:10.109> build<00:04:10.650> rock<00:04:11.040> walls<00:04:12.049> eight

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
I've seen people build rock walls eight

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.559 
I've seen people build rock walls eight
inches<00:04:13.500> tall<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:14.099> about<00:04:14.760> eight<00:04:15.150> inches<00:04:15.510> wide

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
inches tall and about eight inches wide

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.439 
inches tall and about eight inches wide
and<00:04:16.400> they<00:04:17.400> just<00:04:17.549> put<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:17.760> right<00:04:17.789> on<00:04:17.910> top<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.269> the

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
and they just put it right on top of the

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.020 
and they just put it right on top of the
dirt<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:18.959> within<00:04:19.560> two<00:04:19.859> or<00:04:19.889> three<00:04:20.070> years<00:04:20.280> this

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
dirt and within two or three years this

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.969 
dirt and within two or three years this
thing<00:04:21.090> is<00:04:21.359> just<00:04:21.510> trashed<00:04:21.930> it's<00:04:22.469> just<00:04:22.800> it's

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
thing is just trashed it's just it's

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.550 
thing is just trashed it's just it's
cracked<00:04:23.340> it's<00:04:23.669> it's<00:04:23.960> lifting<00:04:24.960> up<00:04:25.140> in<00:04:25.320> some

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
cracked it's it's lifting up in some

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.620 
cracked it's it's lifting up in some
areas<00:04:25.979> of<00:04:26.130> tree<00:04:26.520> trees<00:04:26.909> come<00:04:27.210> up<00:04:27.390> and

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
areas of tree trees come up and

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.420 
areas of tree trees come up and
they<00:04:27.900> lift<00:04:28.230> this<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.650> roots<00:04:28.890> of<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.160> trees

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
they lift this the roots of the trees

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.130 
they lift this the roots of the trees
lift<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:29.940> section<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:30.450> wall<00:04:30.660> up<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.050> it's

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
lift a section of the wall up and it's

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.030 
lift a section of the wall up and it's
it's<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:31.500> goner

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
it's a goner

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.770 
it's a goner
and<00:04:32.670> that's<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.970> main<00:04:33.150> reason<00:04:33.360> why<00:04:33.660> I'm

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
and that's the main reason why I'm

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.650 
and that's the main reason why I'm
making<00:04:33.900> this<00:04:34.170> video<00:04:34.850> if<00:04:35.850> you<00:04:36.090> are<00:04:36.240> going<00:04:36.510> to

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
making this video if you are going to

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.080 
making this video if you are going to
build<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.990> rock<00:04:37.200> wall<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:38.250> wouldn't<00:04:38.760> be<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:38.850> bad

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
build a rock wall it wouldn't be a bad

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.240 
build a rock wall it wouldn't be a bad
idea<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.960> build<00:04:40.350> one<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.590> little<00:04:40.920> wider

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
idea to build one a little wider

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.490 
idea to build one a little wider
something<00:04:42.000> like<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.360> might<00:04:42.630> be<00:04:42.660> 24<00:04:43.230> inches

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
something like this might be 24 inches

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.850 
something like this might be 24 inches
wide<00:04:43.970> in<00:04:44.970> about<00:04:45.240> 24<00:04:45.750> inches<00:04:46.050> tall<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.710> it's

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
wide in about 24 inches tall and it's

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.940 
wide in about 24 inches tall and it's
got<00:04:46.980> some<00:04:47.190> large<00:04:47.400> rocks<00:04:47.880> in<00:04:48.210> it<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:49.560> I<00:04:49.650> mean<00:04:49.710> I

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
got some large rocks in it and I mean I

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.980 
got some large rocks in it and I mean I
doubt<00:04:50.010> if<00:04:50.340> this<00:04:50.460> has<00:04:50.700> any<00:04:50.910> structural<00:04:51.450> rebar

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
doubt if this has any structural rebar

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.250 
doubt if this has any structural rebar
in<00:04:52.260> it<00:04:52.460> but<00:04:53.460> and<00:04:54.420> again<00:04:54.540> I'm<00:04:54.810> not<00:04:54.960> suggesting

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
in it but and again I'm not suggesting

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.990 
in it but and again I'm not suggesting
you're<00:04:55.710> going<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:55.890> be<00:04:56.010> able<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:56.250> put<00:04:56.520> a<00:04:56.760> piece

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
you're going to be able to put a piece

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.970 
you're going to be able to put a piece
of<00:04:57.180> rebar<00:04:57.420> in<00:04:57.930> a<00:04:58.640> rock<00:04:59.640> wall<00:05:00.000> like<00:05:00.300> this<00:05:00.980> or

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
of rebar in a rock wall like this or

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.220 
of rebar in a rock wall like this or
even<00:05:02.220> a<00:05:02.280> smaller<00:05:02.640> rock<00:05:03.060> wall<00:05:03.420> and<00:05:03.810> it's<00:05:04.140> going

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
even a smaller rock wall and it's going

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.190 
even a smaller rock wall and it's going
to<00:05:04.290> provide<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:04.800> with<00:05:04.830> any<00:05:05.100> type<00:05:05.400> of

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
to provide you with any type of

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.740 
to provide you with any type of
reinforcement<00:05:07.850> because<00:05:08.850> it's<00:05:09.270> not<00:05:09.480> like

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
reinforcement because it's not like

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.600 
reinforcement because it's not like
solid<00:05:10.230> concrete<00:05:10.470> it's<00:05:11.010> different<00:05:11.430> here<00:05:11.820> so

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
solid concrete it's different here so

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.490 
solid concrete it's different here so
anyway<00:05:14.610> that's<00:05:14.820> it<00:05:15.150> I<00:05:15.180> hope<00:05:15.510> this<00:05:15.720> video<00:05:15.930> helps

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
anyway that's it I hope this video helps

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.490 
anyway that's it I hope this video helps
I<00:05:17.490> could<00:05:18.210> have<00:05:18.330> went<00:05:18.450> on<00:05:18.630> and<00:05:18.900> on<00:05:19.050> like<00:05:19.350> I

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
I could have went on and on like I

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.800 
I could have went on and on like I
normally<00:05:19.560> do<00:05:20.250> but<00:05:20.280> main<00:05:21.030> reason<00:05:21.390> why<00:05:21.480> I<00:05:21.510> made

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
normally do but main reason why I made

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.250 
normally do but main reason why I made
it<00:05:21.960> was<00:05:22.170> just<00:05:22.410> to<00:05:22.590> give<00:05:23.510> you<00:05:24.510> guys<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:24.960> gals<00:05:25.080> a

it was just to give you guys and gals a

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.560 
it was just to give you guys and gals a
little<00:05:25.500> more<00:05:25.620> insight<00:05:26.070> on<00:05:26.430> some<00:05:27.420> of<00:05:27.510> the

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
little more insight on some of the

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.480 
little more insight on some of the
problems<00:05:27.990> you<00:05:28.140> could<00:05:28.290> run<00:05:28.500> into<00:05:28.680> if<00:05:29.040> you<00:05:29.220> don't

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
problems you could run into if you don't

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.810 
problems you could run into if you don't
have<00:05:29.790> a<00:05:29.820> footing<00:05:30.570> and<00:05:30.810> you<00:05:30.990> build<00:05:31.230> it<00:05:31.380> in<00:05:31.560> the

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
have a footing and you build it in the

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.290 
have a footing and you build it in the
wrong<00:05:32.820> type<00:05:33.120> of<00:05:33.300> soil<00:05:33.630> and<00:05:34.640> this<00:05:35.640> this<00:05:35.970> is<00:05:36.030> some

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
wrong type of soil and this this is some

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.290 
wrong type of soil and this this is some
of<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:36.450> stuff<00:05:36.630> that<00:05:36.660> could<00:05:36.840> happen
