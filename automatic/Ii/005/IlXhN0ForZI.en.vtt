00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.930
 Gallen 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.660
 Here is the second German Internet with the special-show special today 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.450
 yes so much special construction rarely clear the next Sunday is more political 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.519
 Desert red day 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.779
 in the final sprint, the parties overtake each other again with election promises 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.329
 For example, the CS has a 100-day immediate program from the 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.310
 Fickle conjured up after 2011 income tax should drop great or something 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:31.460
 Pre-program and already 2011 should do something 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.890
 Nice that election campaign and Oktoberfest coincide again 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.150
 Angela Merkel, however, remains with her old strategy "just do not move 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.440
 and if it turns out to be out of the way please take a look at what's going on there 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.620
 but that over the entire rate 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.620
 Fri. 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.720
 we know their dogs how long we can hold it 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.319
 Clack Clack Clack Clack Clack Clack Clack Clack Clack 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:04.939
 the Chancellor photographed with the arm and the world press 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.090
 these are the very old reflexes m 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.840
 back to the election campaign everywhere duels that fail or no right 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.840
 and in the middle of it are the free Gielow degrees 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.170
 It was an evening that smelled of grand coalition 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.280
 from all pores 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.740
 from every pore 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.090
 and what a big coalition actually smells like after striking 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.910
 male on the ship around 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.640
 Angela Merkel or the fear sweat of frank-walter Steinmeier 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.980
 I do not want to know and with that we are also in the subject matter subjects in 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.560
 You knew a lot about this election campaign. "I want Chancellor 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.330
 all German the empty lecture theaters 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.710
 Yaris is a bit rockier, but maybe 2013 is next 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.440
 and then these things you do not want to know but still in the election campaign 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.100
 get told VW presents why the business magazine imk-chef DF 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.070
 already at noon candidate in Berlin 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.270
 it stands for the nationalization of key industries 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.970
 the self-confessed left is right-handed, he does not have the left car-warden 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.259
 up to 16 percent 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.750
 there may be on the hand the tree is supposed to be long that is not even possible 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.640
 and the investigative colleagues punch out NEN knockers on FDP directly 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.939
 Better earners direct 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.429
 Dirk Niebel is Secretary General of the FDP 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:28.679
 he keeps the minimum wage for maximum sales 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.189
 his dog Herrmann has its own website 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:35.000
 that will decide the choice 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.219
 because on the dogs home plate are very piquant details 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.609
 for example Hunt Herrmann's dislike from the back at MuÃ±oz's expense 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.859
 So if that does not know any important contribution to the election campaign 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.679
 then maybe that's about Hartz 4 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:53.439
 on the arm 16 percent of Aufstocker only increase because the income 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.540
 not enough then that shows that 90 percent 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.670
 not because of insufficient income but because of one and a half 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.850
 Stocks for example part-time or single parent having children alone 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.319
 educating children where do you have we have a hard time 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.909
 they have mostly nominated obs below average income and 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:09.969
 no budget 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.699
 thanks for the information 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.849
 But it is not the only problem that Germany has to nibble on 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.740
 Family Buschi US dollars 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.119
 tells us about the layman 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:21.609
 now a much more serious problem 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.550
 the women who 1020 30 40 years ago the children who were not born 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.339
 that there are no children today 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:33.269
 was not a woman to be born can never have children yes yes who does not 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.019
 I can get pregnant this is like on a school trip 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.129
 Siegmar Gabrielle you know nobody has the intent of a kW too 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.510
 For the spirit of us Ursula, however, has the power to build 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.079
 out of concept 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.620
 mothers who are not born, in fact, are not born women 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.370
 Kinderflohmarkt the following old and new players also a year ago 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.399
 provided in front 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:59.009
 Let us take care of those who are born 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:03.519
 urig euro carry but he has right we do not care enough about the 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:04.939
 Children are born 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.870
 a legitimate question about which one should think in peace but better first 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.690
 After the election, before the election, all born women have children and men 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.220
 I should choose only one free and then there is an answer 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.220
 then she does not know luck my dog â€‹â€‹from behind at cost 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:23.349
 especially since all seats in these parliaments 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.110
 no matter if someone goes there or not and the know-how of the world 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.749
 the minutes of play or not at all wants as she was for example if 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:34.520
 the defensive ranks or rather she also founded it probably the Michelin 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.529
 Do not warn or ask Lahn Stein Merkel 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:40.689
 they have a choice all they have to do is go to a polling station on Sunday 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.910
 to vote and vote 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.050
 join in is worthwhile because among all participants is Red 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.740
 no car from Ostermann 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.630
 a piece of democratic participation and who knows how to win with luck 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.999
 maybe she even 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:55.620
 a grand coalition 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.039
 Lead Lale 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.249
 with that in mind until next Tuesday my name is a wedding ring 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:02.650
 and that's good too 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.580
 Berlin
