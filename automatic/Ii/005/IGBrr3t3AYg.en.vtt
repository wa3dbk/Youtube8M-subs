about to come through another huge shift

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.910 
about to come through another huge shift
point<00:03:07.450> here<00:03:07.690> if<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.140> look<00:03:08.230> at<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.470> astrology

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
point here if you look at the astrology

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.710 
point here if you look at the astrology
today<00:03:09.190> we're<00:03:09.400> kind<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.880> in<00:03:10.000> between<00:03:10.180> shift

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
today we're kind of in between shift

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.080 
today we're kind of in between shift
points<00:03:10.960> again<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:12.250> this<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.610> day<00:03:12.880> where

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
points again and so this is a day where

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.700 
points again and so this is a day where
there's<00:03:13.120> details<00:03:13.750> wrapping<00:03:14.260> up<00:03:14.440> there's

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
there's details wrapping up there's

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.770 
there's details wrapping up there's

learning<00:03:17.710> to<00:03:17.740> move<00:03:18.040> forward<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:18.820> won't<00:03:19.000> be

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
learning to move forward and it won't be

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.300 
learning to move forward and it won't be
I<00:03:19.630> don't<00:03:20.050> think<00:03:20.320> it's<00:03:20.470> kind<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.740> intense<00:03:21.040> as

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
I don't think it's kind of intense as

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.910 
I don't think it's kind of intense as
yesterday<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:21.790> think<00:03:22.090> that<00:03:22.210> there'll<00:03:22.390> be<00:03:22.420> a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
yesterday I think that there'll be a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.320 
yesterday I think that there'll be a
little<00:03:23.920> bit<00:03:24.130> easier<00:03:24.250> energy<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.000> think<00:03:25.210> it

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
little bit easier energy and I think it

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.990 
little bit easier energy and I think it
all<00:03:25.450> leads<00:03:25.750> as<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.710> moon<00:03:26.920> slabs<00:03:27.490> in<00:03:27.880> the

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
all leads as the moon slabs in the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.180 
all leads as the moon slabs in the
tourists<00:03:28.480> later<00:03:29.020> tonight<00:03:29.410> it<00:03:29.590> chills<00:03:29.890> things

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
tourists later tonight it chills things

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.280 
tourists later tonight it chills things
out<00:03:30.400> with<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:30.640> son<00:03:30.820> of<00:03:30.850> virgo<00:03:31.390> and<00:03:31.420> we<00:03:32.020> got<00:03:32.170> you

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.990 
out with the son of virgo and we got you
know<00:03:32.380> Pluto<00:03:32.800> in<00:03:32.950> Capricorn<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.610> think<00:03:33.820> there's

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
know Pluto in Capricorn I think there's

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.640 
know Pluto in Capricorn I think there's
this<00:03:34.150> nice<00:03:34.420> earthly<00:03:34.870> energy<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:35.410> kind<00:03:35.590> of

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
this nice earthly energy that kind of

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.820 
this nice earthly energy that kind of
sets<00:03:35.920> in<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.490> and<00:03:37.270> I<00:03:37.360> think<00:03:37.390> that<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.710> know

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
sets in and and I think that you know

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.390 
sets in and and I think that you know
today<00:03:39.300> there's<00:03:40.300> just<00:03:40.660> wrapping<00:03:41.200> up<00:03:41.320> things

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
today there's just wrapping up things

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.920 
today there's just wrapping up things
finishing<00:03:42.400> details<00:03:42.550> finishing<00:03:43.450> things<00:03:43.660> and

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
finishing details finishing things and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.630 
finishing details finishing things and
and<00:03:44.110> kind<00:03:44.590> of<00:03:44.680> learning<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:45.100> just<00:03:45.280> go<00:03:45.460> with

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
and kind of learning to just go with

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.300 
and kind of learning to just go with
things<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:46.180> think<00:03:46.660> that<00:03:46.780> you'll<00:03:46.900> see<00:03:47.310> things

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
things I think that you'll see things

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.280 
things I think that you'll see things
really<00:03:48.490> kind<00:03:48.850> of<00:03:48.940> go<00:03:49.060> better<00:03:49.300> but<00:03:49.990> I<00:03:50.020> think

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
really kind of go better but I think

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.160 
really kind of go better but I think
where<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.650> hiccup<00:03:50.980> could<00:03:51.220> be<00:03:51.400> as<00:03:51.640> if<00:03:51.880> you

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
where the hiccup could be as if you

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.090 
where the hiccup could be as if you
unpredictably<00:03:53.170> have<00:03:53.920> your<00:03:54.460> emotions<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:56.100> don't

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
unpredictably have your emotions I don't

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.050 
unpredictably have your emotions I don't

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
bigger and see wider I think that this

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.130 
bigger and see wider I think that this
is<00:04:06.820> the<00:04:07.000> day<00:04:07.180> where<00:04:07.360> we<00:04:07.390> must<00:04:07.690> make<00:04:07.960> our

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
is the day where we must make our

you know weird things get to us we're

us I think that there's a need to find

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.750 
us I think that there's a need to find
unique<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.290> new<00:04:23.410> ways<00:04:23.620> to<00:04:23.890> communicate<00:04:24.070> now

and<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:25.420> I<00:04:25.930> think<00:04:26.170> that<00:04:26.290> this<00:04:26.410> is<00:04:26.560> a<00:04:26.590> unique

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
and and I think that this is a unique

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.640 
and and I think that this is a unique
time<00:04:27.400> in<00:04:27.430> our<00:04:27.730> lives<00:04:27.940> as<00:04:28.360> it's<00:04:29.140> really<00:04:29.410> time

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
for us to make big decisions in our

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.690 
for us to make big decisions in our
truth<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.190> they're<00:04:33.460> hard
