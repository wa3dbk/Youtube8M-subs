00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.629
 for a new nail art idea 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.680
 it's gone after putting gel of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.630
 based on world 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.360
 I start by posing my black color 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.550
 with my kind so I'm doing a little 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.340
 curve like those who will go down 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.340
 until the end 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.340
 and 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.439
 I take you back from freezing and I continue 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.189
 so here to draw a line on the line 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.189
 my smile 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.079
 so here we are going to have a shorter side 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.989
 than another but it's done on purpose 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.070
 then I did this so I showed 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.780
 lets you look instead because 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.780
 it's not easy to explain 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.410
 we 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.460
 once it's done I see it all 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.460
 in hand for two minutes 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.950
 I now take my second color 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.250
 and do not apply it like these on the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.250
 left 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.650
 he 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.620
 when it's done separate jean mill 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.620
 for about 10 minutes for that 6 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.930
 I then put the last color 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.150
 and I place a word for two minutes 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.189
 once these amp outputs 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.500
 I apply my construction gel on 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:13.030
 the whole surface of buman 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.030
 we will see at the end of a dominica 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.980
 we 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.959
 when it came out of the amp I 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.959
 degrease and then refined 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.790
 I now believe with the brush and gel 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.770
 finishing I'm applying a suit 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.850
 on the whole surface of the world and that will go 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.850
 vain for three minutes 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.950
 I now stands I love finishing 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.840
 and I see go to the monique break 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.330
 robin so I take a brush of the gel 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.890
 finishing that I only pose where I 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.890
 will want to put my marbles that I 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.800
 grabbed with my old thing and that I 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.690
 want to ask one by one so we try to 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.310
 ensure that all of the Nice 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.790
 same size otherwise your curve is not going 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.790
 to be very clear 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.770
 so once we have placed the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:14.200
 everything but we do not spend two minutes 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.200
 we will make the last curve 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.740
 so that's it's over I'm going back in 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.740
 lamp for two minutes 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.340
 and we're done so here's the result 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.110
 I hope you enjoyed this video

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.420
