changing<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> defense<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.199> think<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.859> can

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
changing the defense I think you can

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.490 
changing the defense I think you can
pass<00:00:32.250> rush<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.730> even<00:00:33.000> better<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.840> think<00:00:34.140> you

pass rush you even better so I think you

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.350 
pass rush you even better so I think you
show<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> difference<00:00:35.280> even<00:00:35.460> more<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.120> that's
