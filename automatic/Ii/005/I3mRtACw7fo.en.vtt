the<00:00:54.160> challenges<00:00:54.670> and<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.989> most<00:00:56.140> importantly

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
the challenges and but most importantly

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.529 
the challenges and but most importantly
I<00:00:56.829> think<00:00:56.949> fun-loving<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:57.760> takes<00:00:58.090> each<00:00:58.269> day<00:00:58.449> as

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
I think fun-loving and takes each day as

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.200 
I think fun-loving and takes each day as
it<00:00:58.660> comes<00:00:59.460> maybe<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.579> little<00:01:00.730> bit<00:01:00.910> like<00:01:01.030> how<00:01:01.179> I

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
it comes maybe a little bit like how I

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.469 
it comes maybe a little bit like how I
am

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.870 

I<00:01:07.509> think<00:01:08.439> the<00:01:08.530> fact<00:01:08.799> that<00:01:09.009> he's<00:01:09.340> completely

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
I think the fact that he's completely

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.810 
I think the fact that he's completely
uninhibited<00:01:11.100> that's<00:01:12.100> something<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:12.610> haven't

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
uninhibited that's something I haven't

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.340 
uninhibited that's something I haven't
seen<00:01:12.969> in<00:01:13.149> any<00:01:13.420> of<00:01:13.509> my<00:01:13.689> other<00:01:13.719> co-stars

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
seen in any of my other co-stars

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.789 
seen in any of my other co-stars
actually<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:15.689> he's<00:01:16.689> never<00:01:16.899> scared<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.619> making

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
actually and he's never scared of making

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:18.630 
actually and he's never scared of making
mistakes

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
mistakes

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.359 
mistakes
he's<00:01:19.570> very<00:01:19.840> okay<00:01:20.289> with<00:01:20.500> being<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:21.159> butt<00:01:21.310> of

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
he's very okay with being the butt of

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.440 
he's very okay with being the butt of
all<00:01:21.579> the<00:01:21.909> jokes<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:23.610> he's<00:01:24.610> just<00:01:24.789> on<00:01:25.000> set<00:01:25.329> to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
have a good time I mean his energy rubs

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.490 
have a good time I mean his energy rubs
off<00:01:27.579> on<00:01:27.789> on<00:01:27.970> everyone<00:01:28.720> he<00:01:28.929> has<00:01:29.020> this<00:01:29.200> amazing

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
off on on everyone he has this amazing

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.499 
off on on everyone he has this amazing
energy<00:01:30.310> when<00:01:30.490> he<00:01:30.610> walks<00:01:30.819> into<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.149> room<00:01:31.210> I've

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
energy when he walks into a room I've

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.330 
energy when he walks into a room I've
said<00:01:31.689> this<00:01:31.780> earlier<00:01:31.929> as<00:01:32.289> well

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
said this earlier as well

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.459 
said this earlier as well
and<00:01:33.670> I<00:01:34.000> think<00:01:34.210> he's<00:01:34.329> a<00:01:34.360> fantastic<00:01:34.569> human<00:01:35.110> being

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
and I think he's a fantastic human being

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:37.800 
and I think he's a fantastic human being
he's<00:01:35.619> extremely<00:01:36.009> sensitive<00:01:36.579> to<00:01:37.240> people<00:01:37.630> to

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
he's extremely sensitive to people to

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.410 
he's extremely sensitive to people to
energies<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:38.500> I<00:01:39.459> think<00:01:39.939> there's<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.149> lot<00:01:40.299> to

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
energies and I think there's a lot to

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.059 
energies and I think there's a lot to
learn<00:01:40.539> from<00:01:40.780> him<00:01:43.200> I've<00:01:44.200> done<00:01:44.500> only<00:01:44.799> a<00:01:44.830> few

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
learn from him I've done only a few

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.449 
learn from him I've done only a few
movies<00:01:45.369> but<00:01:45.909> none<00:01:46.450> like<00:01:46.630> this<00:01:46.689> one<00:01:47.459> everybody

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
movies but none like this one everybody

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.550 
movies but none like this one everybody
who's<00:01:48.819> working<00:01:49.090> on<00:01:49.299> it<00:01:49.450> all<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:50.140> hundred<00:01:50.530> and

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
who's working on it all the hundred and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.010 
who's working on it all the hundred and
ten<00:01:50.770> percent<00:01:50.920> energies<00:01:51.490> are<00:01:51.849> devoted<00:01:52.720> towards

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
ten percent energies are devoted towards

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.990 
ten percent energies are devoted towards
setting<00:01:53.409> up<00:01:53.590> each<00:01:53.799> frame<00:01:54.159> and<00:01:54.429> if<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.789> watch

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
setting up each frame and if you watch

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.520 
setting up each frame and if you watch
the<00:01:55.209> film<00:01:55.360> you'll<00:01:55.599> notice<00:01:55.899> that<00:01:56.020> each<00:01:56.259> frame

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
the film you'll notice that each frame

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.919 
the film you'll notice that each frame
looks<00:01:56.770> grand<00:01:57.220> each<00:01:57.789> frame<00:01:58.209> looks<00:01:58.450> like<00:01:58.630> so

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
looks grand each frame looks like so

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.949 
looks grand each frame looks like so
much<00:01:59.110> has<00:01:59.319> gone<00:01:59.560> into<00:01:59.739> it<00:01:59.890> and<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.689> know<00:02:01.810> when

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
much has gone into it and you know when

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.050 
much has gone into it and you know when
you<00:02:02.049> watch<00:02:02.289> it<00:02:02.319> on<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.829> big<00:02:03.039> screen<00:02:03.220> in<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:03.880> dark

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
you watch it on a big screen in a dark

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.479 
you watch it on a big screen in a dark
room<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.509> impact<00:02:05.289> is<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:06.099> can't<00:02:06.310> put<00:02:06.429> a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:06.489 
room that impact is you can't put a

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:07.770 
room that impact is you can't put a
price<00:02:06.549> on<00:02:06.880> it

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
price on it

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.469 
price on it
so<00:02:08.259> it's<00:02:08.560> really<00:02:08.829> really<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.519> special<00:02:10.090> film<00:02:10.299> and
