00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.730 
falsies eyelashes and you can see I
already<00:05:09.789> use<00:05:10.270> them<00:05:10.510> they're<00:05:10.990> not<00:05:11.289> that<00:05:11.530> great

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
already use them they're not that great

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.170 
already use them they're not that great
but<00:05:11.860> really<00:05:12.220> the<00:05:12.370> only<00:05:12.460> thing<00:05:12.699> I<00:05:12.789> needed<00:05:13.030> was

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
but really the only thing I needed was

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.020 
but really the only thing I needed was
the<00:05:13.360> glue<00:05:13.720> right<00:05:14.080> here<00:05:14.440> because<00:05:15.370> when<00:05:16.000> i

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
the glue right here because when i

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.790 
the glue right here because when i
showed<00:05:16.300> you<00:05:16.330> before<00:05:16.450> was<00:05:16.990> this<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:17.530> i<00:05:17.590> thought

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
showed you before was this and i thought

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.589 
showed you before was this and i thought
it<00:05:18.010> might<00:05:18.190> have<00:05:18.280> been<00:05:18.340> a<00:05:18.490> cool<00:05:18.820> idea<00:05:18.940> to<00:05:19.270> make<00:05:19.570> a

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
it might have been a cool idea to make a

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.900 
it might have been a cool idea to make a
tutorial<00:05:20.020> unlike<00:05:20.979> putting<00:05:21.310> some<00:05:21.490> glitters<00:05:21.789> on

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
tutorial unlike putting some glitters on

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.129 
tutorial unlike putting some glitters on
the<00:05:22.000> side<00:05:22.150> of<00:05:22.180> my<00:05:22.300> eye<00:05:22.389> or<00:05:22.539> something<00:05:22.690> i<00:05:23.080> don't

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
the side of my eye or something i don't

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.570 
the side of my eye or something i don't
know<00:05:23.260> i<00:05:23.320> just<00:05:23.380> had<00:05:23.680> a<00:05:23.710> little<00:05:23.830> idea<00:05:24.250> to<00:05:24.430> do<00:05:24.550> that

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
know i just had a little idea to do that

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.580 
know i just had a little idea to do that
so<00:05:24.940> that's<00:05:25.150> why<00:05:25.330> that's<00:05:26.139> just<00:05:26.229> the<00:05:26.440> main

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
so that's why that's just the main

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.529 
so that's why that's just the main
reason<00:05:26.860> i<00:05:26.950> bought<00:05:27.099> these<00:05:27.280> eyelashes<00:05:27.849> but<00:05:28.030> the

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
reason i bought these eyelashes but the

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.040 
reason i bought these eyelashes but the
eyelashes<00:05:29.200> itself<00:05:29.860> are<00:05:30.070> not<00:05:30.810> amazing<00:05:31.810> but

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
eyelashes itself are not amazing but

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.310 
eyelashes itself are not amazing but
they're<00:05:32.620> not<00:05:32.740> horrible<00:05:33.010> so<00:05:33.660> no<00:05:34.660> but<00:05:34.810> i<00:05:34.960> don't<00:05:35.169> i

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
they're not horrible so no but i don't i

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.440 
they're not horrible so no but i don't i
cut<00:05:35.590> those<00:05:35.800> that's<00:05:36.700> why<00:05:36.880> they're<00:05:37.120> in<00:05:37.210> a<00:05:37.270> weird

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
cut those that's why they're in a weird

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.730 
cut those that's why they're in a weird
shape<00:05:37.720> but<00:05:38.139> i<00:05:38.200> don't<00:05:38.410> know<00:05:38.470> where<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.710> other

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
shape but i don't know where the other

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.040 
shape but i don't know where the other
half<00:05:39.099> is<00:05:39.370> I<00:05:39.669> probably<00:05:39.910> left<00:05:40.330> it<00:05:40.539> at<00:05:40.780> her<00:05:40.840> house

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
half is I probably left it at her house

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.690 
half is I probably left it at her house
but<00:05:41.380> it<00:05:41.560> doesn't<00:05:41.830> really<00:05:41.919> matter<00:05:42.130> because<00:05:42.340> I

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
but it doesn't really matter because I

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.390 
but it doesn't really matter because I
wasn't<00:05:43.330> gonna<00:05:43.419> use<00:05:43.630> of<00:05:43.840> anyways<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:45.160> glue<00:05:45.370> is

wasn't gonna use of anyways the glue is

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.690 
wasn't gonna use of anyways the glue is
