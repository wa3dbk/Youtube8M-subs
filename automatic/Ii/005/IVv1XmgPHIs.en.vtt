going<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.900> sound<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.080> exact<00:00:16.320> same<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.740> it's

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
going to sound the exact same and it's

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.800 
going to sound the exact same and it's
probably<00:00:17.369> not<00:00:17.490> perfect<00:00:17.880> but<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.270> close

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
probably not perfect but it's close

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.849 
probably not perfect but it's close
enough<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.260> think<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:21.140> you<00:00:22.140> need<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> capo<00:00:22.650> on

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
enough I think and you need a capo on

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.279 
enough I think and you need a capo on
the<00:00:23.160> second<00:00:23.670> fret<00:00:26.300> so<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.510> intro<00:00:27.779> you

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the second fret so for the intro you

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.650 
the second fret so for the intro you
hold<00:00:28.500> down<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.730> guess<00:00:30.119> what's<00:00:30.300> technically

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
hold down the I guess what's technically

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.079 
hold down the I guess what's technically
the<00:00:30.869> fourth<00:00:31.349> fret<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.870> G<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:33.989> B<00:00:34.050> string

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:43.700 

and<00:00:39.089> you<00:00:39.449> do<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.780> d

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.030 

then<00:00:44.250> slide<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.730> D<00:00:44.940> up<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.649> 6th

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
then slide the D up to what is the 6th

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.580 
then slide the D up to what is the 6th
fret

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.260 

and<00:00:51.770> this<00:00:52.340> next<00:00:52.460> one<00:00:52.670> don't<00:00:52.850> play<00:00:53.030> for<00:00:53.240> a

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
and this next one don't play for a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.900 
and this next one don't play for a
second<00:00:53.660> but<00:00:54.530> it's<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:56.530> 8th<00:00:57.530> fret<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.100> 27

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
second but it's the 8th fret and 27

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.340 
second but it's the 8th fret and 27
threads<00:01:01.360> and<00:01:02.360> then<00:01:02.510> back<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:02.840> last<00:01:03.110> chord

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
threads and then back to the last chord

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.290 
threads and then back to the last chord
you<00:01:03.470> played<00:01:06.729> and<00:01:07.729> then<00:01:07.850> when<00:01:07.940> you<00:01:08.000> put<00:01:08.150> it<00:01:08.210> all

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
you played and then when you put it all

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.390 
you played and then when you put it all
together<00:01:08.479> it<00:01:09.140> should<00:01:09.350> sound<00:01:09.560> pretty<00:01:09.860> close<00:01:10.130> to

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
together it should sound pretty close to

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
together it should sound pretty close to
the<00:01:10.700> way<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:11.479> sounds<00:01:11.750> on<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.869> record<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:26.270> the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
the way it sounds on the record and the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.820 
the way it sounds on the record and the
only<00:01:26.660> chords<00:01:27.050> you<00:01:27.140> really<00:01:27.320> need<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.560> go<00:01:27.649> for

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
only chords you really need to go for

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:41.320 
only chords you really need to go for
the<00:01:27.920> song<00:01:28.130> um<00:01:28.780> rd<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:33.580> um<00:01:34.580> e<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.850> F<00:01:38.119> sharp<00:01:40.330> B

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
the song um rd a um e and F sharp B

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.290 
the song um rd a um e and F sharp B
minor

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
minor

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.480 
minor
and<00:01:43.870> I<00:01:44.140> think<00:01:44.200> that's<00:01:44.470> it<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.950> for<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.280> bursts

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
and I think that's it so for the bursts

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.480 
and I think that's it so for the bursts
of<00:01:48.640> song<00:01:48.820> let<00:01:49.090> me<00:01:49.210> start<00:01:49.420> with<00:01:49.450> an<00:01:49.600> a<00:01:52.980> I'm<00:01:53.980> Mindy

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
of song let me start with an a I'm Mindy

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:03.300 
of song let me start with an a I'm Mindy
e<00:01:58.500> f-sharp<00:01:59.500> E

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.399 

and<00:02:03.729> if<00:02:03.909> you<00:02:04.060> have<00:02:04.570> trouble<00:02:04.630> borrowing<00:02:05.320> the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
and if you have trouble borrowing the

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.770 
and if you have trouble borrowing the
entire<00:02:05.649> 2nd<00:02:06.009> fret<00:02:06.189> for<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.430> f<00:02:06.549> you<00:02:07.540> can<00:02:07.689> do

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
entire 2nd fret for the f you can do

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.479 
entire 2nd fret for the f you can do
that<00:02:07.899> cheater<00:02:08.200> f<00:02:08.410> thing<00:02:08.649> where<00:02:09.009> you<00:02:09.099> just<00:02:09.130> bar

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
that cheater f thing where you just bar

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.000 
that cheater f thing where you just bar
the<00:02:09.670> bottom<00:02:10.479> three<00:02:10.660> strings<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.260> then<00:02:11.830> hold

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
the bottom three strings and then hold

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.540 
the bottom three strings and then hold
down<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.489> fourth<00:02:12.970> fret<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.520> D

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550

string

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:32.120 

so<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.650> sounds<00:02:20.100> like<00:02:20.130> this<00:02:28.160> will<00:02:29.160> be

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.520 

can<00:03:10.880> you<00:03:11.000> go<00:03:11.090> into<00:03:11.210> the<00:03:11.330> course<00:03:11.600> which<00:03:12.110> is<00:03:12.140> um

can you go into the course which is um

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:35.050 
can you go into the course which is um
be<00:03:12.890> minor<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.870> then<00:03:18.470> d<00:03:18.950> EI<00:03:20.920> f<00:03:21.920> sure

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.510 

and<00:03:36.060> then<00:03:36.300> you<00:03:36.360> go<00:03:36.450> back<00:03:36.480> into<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.840> verse

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
and then you go back into the verse

and then you go back into the verse
there's<00:03:38.520> only<00:03:38.610> wanted<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:38.970> change<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.270> the

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
there's only wanted to change in the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.050 
there's only wanted to change in the
song<00:03:39.600> um<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:40.350> comes<00:03:40.560> after<00:03:40.740> I<00:03:41.310> think<00:03:41.820> like<00:03:41.910> the

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
song um it comes after I think like the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.700 
song um it comes after I think like the
second<00:03:42.360> last<00:03:42.450> course<00:03:42.750> but<00:03:43.440> there's<00:03:43.560> like<00:03:43.650> a

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
second last course but there's like a

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:50.260 
second last course but there's like a
little<00:03:43.890> guitar<00:03:43.950> solo<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.920> change<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.550> just<00:03:47.820> a

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:04:01.280 

and<00:03:51.270> then<00:03:51.930> do<00:03:52.200> not<00:03:52.730> shut<00:03:53.730> so<00:03:54.630> go<00:03:54.780> zone<00:04:00.170> then<00:04:01.170> go

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
and then do not shut so go zone then go

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.540 
and then do not shut so go zone then go
back<00:04:01.440> into<00:04:01.500> count<00:04:01.860> like<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.130> pre-chorus

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
back into count like the pre-chorus

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:15.110 
back into count like the pre-chorus
