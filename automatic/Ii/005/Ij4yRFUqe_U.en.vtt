yeah<00:00:00.210> I<00:00:00.240> think<00:00:00.390> patients<00:00:00.719> was<00:00:01.199> the<00:00:01.350> key

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.970 
yeah I think patients was the key
tonight<00:00:03.200> certainly<00:00:04.200> not<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.500> way<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:04.740> wanted

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.770 
tonight certainly not the way we wanted
to<00:00:05.040> start<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.430> game<00:00:07.400> kind<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.519> 11<00:00:09.240> play<00:00:09.480> broke

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
to start the game kind of 11 play broke

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.419 
to start the game kind of 11 play broke
us<00:00:09.929> down<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.679> we<00:00:10.950> were<00:00:11.010> behind<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.370> eight

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
us down and and we were behind the eight

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.959 
us down and and we were behind the eight
ball<00:00:11.490> but<00:00:12.679> our<00:00:13.679> determination<00:00:14.400> was<00:00:14.549> good<00:00:14.759> we

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
ball but our determination was good we

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.810 
ball but our determination was good we
kept<00:00:15.240> putting<00:00:16.020> them<00:00:16.139> under<00:00:16.289> pressure<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.039> we

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
kept putting them under pressure and we

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.250 
kept putting them under pressure and we
kind<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.119> just<00:00:18.330> got<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.630> sense<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:18.960> if<00:00:19.140> we

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
kind of just got the sense that if we

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.630 
kind of just got the sense that if we
were<00:00:19.350> patient<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.830> kept<00:00:20.039> going<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.520> they

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
were patient and kept going that they

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.859 
were patient and kept going that they
were<00:00:20.730> going<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.910> wear<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.359> sure<00:00:21.840> enough

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869
