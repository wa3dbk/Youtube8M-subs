00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 good hello to all the friends that such 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.580
 How are you going to come with a 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.830
 small tutorial on how to activate this 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.259
 windows 7 with a good little program 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.970
 you usually to the body let's say 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:21.779
 what is Jesus' pirate his windows 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.550
 then when turning on the pc whatever 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.250
 they will leave to activate now or 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.880
 activate later and it's always going to 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.660
 leave the screen like this so all black and 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.790
 it's good that way black so I'm going to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.790
 leave a link in the description 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.180
 to download this little 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.210
 program weighs nothing but the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.700
 they bring 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.700
 then he executes it normally 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:59.549
 this removes and this will then do 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:04.379
 to do then when I restart 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:08.590
 Well, the story will be normal 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:13.110
 it's going to be activated I do not know if I call it 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.110
 to restart t1 I will try 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.130
 so if they see 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.040
 they come out that to restart the one that 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.330
 you need to restart the computer 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.750
 so then I'm going to stop it and right now 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.020
 but restart and they will see 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.890
 well when this restarts the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.370
 computer will no longer leave the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.900
 after that to activate good that no longer 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.450
 it's going to come out and most likely the 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.729
 screen will turn blue then 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.690
 Well now what they only have to 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.470
 do is 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.230
 put a wallpaper and ready and so 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.300
 simple and good is because they know that 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.200
 they liked it they give you like they subscribe and 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.200
