00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 some people have reported over 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.629
 of the time received in your 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.519
 telephone 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.769
 but the morbid thing is that such calls 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.769
 are made by organs 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.920
 as with all things 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.900
 for normal is not always possible 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.450
 prove any of the numerous 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.759
 stories about these phenomena 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.130
 even because in today's world almost everything 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.620
 world has caller ID 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.290
 but that is where the situation begins to 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.200
 strange a person supposedly dead 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.600
 make a phone call and scare the entity 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.090
 that the recipient is usually a 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.250
 family member some happen 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.130
 before the person died and other 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.200
 years later these telephone calls 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.700
 deaths tend to have characteristics 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.860
 similar 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.160
 there are cases where the line only emits a 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.860
 noise like static other 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.380
 involve real speech sounds that sound like the voice 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.960
 of the deceased, however, when one hears 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.689
 usually they are repeated phrases like 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.729
 it's cold here or why you 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.950
 buried with his grandmother 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.110
 this may sound silly but already 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.780
 there were cases where the person before 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.979
 die says it was exactly the same sentence 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.380
 the months 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.869
 the call is a little more coherent but 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.929
 they never last long the line almost 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.109
 always poor or grandparents its very far 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.270
 Thinking this out makes sense in 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.700
 internet in multiple locations 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.340
 there are so many stories about phone calls 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.079
 dead that it is impossible to say if they 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.329
 match reality 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.420
 they are only common because people 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.069
 believe in this until a 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.100
 episode of a fictional series 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:52.069
 scientist called the twilight 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.659
 zone in the episode night col or a 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.909
 history about the phenomenon 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.039
 the main character of the episode in 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.200
 question is a woman who has lost her 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.689
 groom in a car accident that she 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.209
 caused times after it began to 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.300
 receive calls from the dead and thought that 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:10.789
 were telephone jitters she was nervous and 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.069
 I was going to speak to a person and leave her alone. 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.190
 later after investigations discovered 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.890
 that the calls were coming from the tomb 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.439
 from your fiancÃ© that's a little off the 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.049
 reality but it was certainly a beautiful 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.480
 episode in general is easy to find 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.540
 identical stories 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.150
 the number of the dead person brief calls 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.610
 from the dead and even calls 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.970
 that when the roads indicate to the 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.620
 deceased's tomb latter 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.510
 unlikely calls can not be 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.239
 coming directly from dead people 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.319
 but from your phones that are 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.739
 certainly acting unexpectedly 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.349
 inexplicable 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.989
 an example of a real fact on the subject is the 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.540
 following is a train accident 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.049
 in san fernando valley that killed 25 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.420
 people on September 12, 2008 between 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.879
 the dead were charles pec 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.109
 a 49-year-old man with two children 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.299
 adults 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.670
 he died with the impact but his body 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.709
 not found immediately at 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.730
 authorities and then found 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.069
 being guided by 35 phone calls made 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.859
 by the deceased's telephone to his 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.829
 loved ones in the 11 hours following the 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.019
 accident the pec family has never heard of 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.750
 sound of your voice or anything else 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.639
 of static but they kept the belief 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.599
 that he was alive among the 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.730
 wreckage 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.430
 twelve hours later her body was 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.680
 found his phone had stopped 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.530
 to call them an hour earlier but it was 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.690
 tracked by the authorities that helped 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.389
 find the body the researchers 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.389
 but were told not to find the phone 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.630
 What would you do if your loved one 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.489
 deceased call you now 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.419
 simply a malfunction of the 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.090
 telephone 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:04.120
 the spirit tried to communicate 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.069
 only way that they can do it if you 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.790
 liked the video click liked it here 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.879

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.400
 sign up if you're new here until 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.400

 thank you
