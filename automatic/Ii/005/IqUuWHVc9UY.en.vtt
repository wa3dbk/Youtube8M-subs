00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 humanity is increasingly 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.640
 committed to traveling to mars 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.500
 nasa already prepares its next step 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.280
 before taking astronauts to the planet 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.960
 red 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.610
 the program today you will know the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.170
 next vehicle that will explore the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:25.830
 planet that most intrigues beings 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:27.840
 humans while the jeep-robot curious of 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.000
 history the Martian soil the nasa already 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.000
 plan how your new probe will be 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.040
 expected to be launched in 2020 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.980
 if all goes right the more its influence 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.750
 government will take a great stride on a journey 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.520
 human on red planet 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.190
 the vehicle will be the size of a small 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.989
 car and will weigh about a ton 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.640
 its objective will be to deepen 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.590
 knowledge of geology and 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.989
 composition of the red planet 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.090
 determine if there was life on the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.500
 the vehicle shall be equipped with seven 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.750
 scientific instruments that were 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.609
 chosen from 58 proposals 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.539
 presented by world scientists 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.430
 all 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.559
 they were selected for the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.479
 potential of how humans can 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.229
 survive with natural resources of 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.030
 Mars 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.130
 the machine will have tools to 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.619
 analyze the mineral and chemical composition 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.110
 of rocks detect organic compounds 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.860
 monitor the environmental conditions of the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.689
 planet 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.479
 but the coolest experiment that will be 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.909
 made there calls the purpose of the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.549
 experience is to produce oxygen from 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.130
 of carbon dioxide is a gas abundant in 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.960
 art and technology employees systems 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.570
 how they can be used to get 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.700
 the oxygen required to sustain the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.979
 astronauts on the planet in the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.270
 technology can also provide 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.470
 necessary fuel for the journey of 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.780
 back to earth 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.000
 all the equipment will cost 130 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.220
 millions of dollars for the nasa 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.630
 although it seems a high value the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.780
 scientists believe that investment 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.729
 fair and necessary because the vehicle helps 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.070
 to answer questions about the environment 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.899
 that the astronauts faced and tested 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.909
 the technologies necessary for it to be 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.680
 survive on the spot and then 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.880
 still coming back to earth 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.070
 while the nasa prepares the ground 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.320
 We keep the question and you're already 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.119
 prepared to meet Mars confessed 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.140
 that despite seeing the advances I prefer 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.099
 stay right here 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.099
 until the next champions
