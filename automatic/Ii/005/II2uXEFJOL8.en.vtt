00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 well these are two to one lived in 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.250
 three and four o'clock in the morning of sg 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.049
 if I left favorites of his pile and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.630
 good a new teaser teaser 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.040
 trailer we could say black ops 3 or 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.410
 of the next call of duty that still 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.170
 because it has no name and this time it is 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.550
 the fifth teaser no more read me the this 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.840
 video download the video you have it in the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.150
 description and basically it's boiling 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.980
 frames of that video in the video 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.869
 because good this is the one that less clear 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.460
 Well, we can have what is 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.619
 happening what is true is 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.619
 that in many flashazos and others 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.050
 and nothing is basically what we 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.120
 They describe it as a cold forest 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.790
 frozen and others and the one who narrates then 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.010
 keep narrating something so that you do not 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.710
 imagine and others something like we say 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.360
 as a hypnotic regression or something 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.090
 for the style that the patient then 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.489
 is trying because I remember something 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.270
 the style as I say that the game 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.950
 it may well be a prequel or something 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.809
 like that or to know I still do not know 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.610
 knows nothing this is the teaser that less 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.310
 things maybe we could say that we get 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.810
 in clear although they are enough 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.850
 images at the end will be two spots 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.399
 Many reds say that means 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.890
 wow the guards but I do not know no no 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.990
 I believe it the truth I do not know why black 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.890
 ops has more name we could say more 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.390
 fame in that sense and basically 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.220
 going back to what is the snowy forest and 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.770
 other then well been reading a little 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.080
 informing me of more about a battle 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.479
 of the Second World War that 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.810
 freed in the jÃ¼rgen forest jurgen in 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.960
 jurgen and that looks pretty pretty 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.490
 to this forest I do not know if this place me 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.670
 I play World War II 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.220
 is what would happen but good looks 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.680
 of being that forest I do not know if yes it will end 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.290
 being is not the truth still remains 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.850
 much to come back to think and so on and 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.380
 surely this apartment has many 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.110
 hidden things when least things 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.060
 we see more hidden things usually have 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.380
 nor I here because I see little thing so 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.840
 there has to be a lot very much 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.790
 hidden most likely so nothing 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.350
 we will see to see what is going and 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.649
 let's go in the next video will be 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.649
 next
