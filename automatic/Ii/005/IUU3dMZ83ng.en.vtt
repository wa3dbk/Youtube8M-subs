00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.750
 to a merry celebration of death 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.539
 dead we will be back today a little bit 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.140
 later for now let's deal with 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.180
 pepper 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.180
 without it can not do any one thing 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.689
 mexican dish yes what's not there without 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.480
 pepper 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.070
 non mexican no mexico civilization 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.890
 who lived in mexico 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.739
 left behind a lot of mysteries over 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.570
 which argue endlessly scientist but 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.140
 there is one argument that concerns 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.329
 modernity and this sport of 31 states 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.070
 Mexico where the hottest pepper grows 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.030
 people who live in the Yucatan consider 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.079
 that the most burning grows here he 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.449
 called abaner 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.460
 that field you can eat it of course yes on 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.460
 of course there is no hand 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.000
 and touch pen can swallow 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.220
 palestra you can jump and 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.530
 and of course you need tori amos models over 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.540

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.700
 the product burns through here I 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.350
 I feel like he won't be right now 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.020
 list so as not to bore you 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.380
 in medical terms 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:02:00.160
 he will fall out of me now through that place 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:03.479
 who will find it terrible it is terrible they 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.460
 here you thought the whole school of pepper's vitality 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.640
 by which in this chili banner let's 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.070

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.390
 let them ripen 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.239
 generally anyway a mexican 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.930
 takes it very seriously chili a 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.200
 a banner 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:52.930

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.050

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.780
 product controlling can by 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.570
 the origin of both wine and champagne 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.910
 real fear only in samp they are there 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.800
 horses only in the provinces do not know what 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.239
 hotel style is only here in yucatan 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.650
 company vehicles against whom you 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.739
 use this biological weapon 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.040
 against Russians 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:24.900
 joking and kindness by adding it to food 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.850
 make medicines different she just like that 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.100
 Well, the main thing is that the Mexicans are absolutely 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.190
 convinced that chili a banner 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:38.230
 it is a powerful aphrodisiac that strengthens 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.600
 reproductive possibilities if you 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.700
 will you eat this pepper you may be 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:48.160
 at least seven wives, and this glue is he 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:51.570
 of course, and 20 thousand children intel and kotova 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.730
 how to feed the 7 genres team nerve 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.960
 Let us gather in front of a district well 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.300
 wait like he 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.330
 but somehow did not buy all that they love 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.150
 character meaning for value eg laz 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.540

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.910
 On light and report, I must contain them 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.470
 let anemia feed clearly but correctly 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.760
 Why keep my wife even on should 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.980
 contain such torment 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:28.540
 hot as chili and bolero just 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:30.820
 recognizes threw well and you want to know what 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.950
 Russians differ from Mexican M3 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:40.000
 taste take on hit you want mine 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:46.420

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.850

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.800
 peppered my thigh 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.970
 so you get the impression that 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.310
 here you can say without straightening your back 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.650
 second day 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.440
 collect pepper 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.020
 by the way mexico exports this 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.590
 pepper in many countries is part of the harvest 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.540
 for example, was intended for Japan 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.410
 home gourmets, he came very much 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.350
 taste 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.350
 but in general in this country there are up to 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:22.840
 30 different types of peppers each 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.840
 which has its place in the menu 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:33.230
 this habanero pepper is actually 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:36.530
 furious that here for him sorted out 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:40.190
 and packed in boxes is prohibited 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:44.930
 be without a gauze bandage because 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:49.000
 that pepper evaporation is so strong that 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.000
 may harm the respiratory tract 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.900
 I understood everything correctly with the text 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.440
 we select the bad 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:00.790
 well yes with specks and damages course 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.800
 damage is not only not necessary 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.870
 look throwing away almost more 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.630
 than leave well, it is clear on the pepper 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:14.160
 small speck 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.160
 the whole party can go bad 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:22.319
 there is but tell me what is more expensive 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:26.999
 mexican heart you body or in front 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:31.769

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:33.629
