well here's the common information for

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.160 
well here's the common information for
the<00:00:05.490> three<00:00:05.730> hexagonal<00:00:06.450> roofs<00:00:06.660> that<00:00:06.899> you<00:00:06.990> got

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
the three hexagonal roofs that you got

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.549 
the three hexagonal roofs that you got
to<00:00:07.290> do<00:00:07.410> all<00:00:08.160> roofs<00:00:08.639> have<00:00:08.910> 90<00:00:09.210> by<00:00:09.330> 45<00:00:09.809> rafters<00:00:10.410> at

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
to do all roofs have 90 by 45 rafters at

to do all roofs have 90 by 45 rafters at
600<00:00:11.190> centers<00:00:11.550> they've<00:00:11.759> got<00:00:11.940> 140<00:00:12.630> by<00:00:12.780> 35<00:00:13.349> hips

roof<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.279> roof<00:00:33.000> -<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.660> roof<00:00:34.020> three<00:00:34.500> have

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
roof one roof - and roof three have

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.740 
roof one roof - and roof three have
three<00:00:35.969> different<00:00:37.160> configurations<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.750> won't

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
three different configurations I won't

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.209 
three different configurations I won't
go<00:00:39.960> through<00:00:40.260> them<00:00:40.530> but<00:00:40.850> they're<00:00:41.850> there<00:00:41.879> and

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
go through them but they're there and

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:52.400 
go through them but they're there and
here<00:00:44.219> I've<00:00:44.370> got<00:00:45.469> roof<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:47.600> where<00:00:48.600> they<00:00:51.410> that's

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
here I've got roof one where they that's

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.119 
here I've got roof one where they that's
the<00:00:52.590> general<00:00:53.100> look<00:00:54.410> that's<00:00:55.410> looking<00:00:55.829> straight

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the general look that's looking straight

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.770 
the general look that's looking straight
down<00:00:56.160> top<00:01:00.020> that's<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.350> way<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.510> apex<00:01:03.510> is

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
down top that's the way the apex is

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.899 
down top that's the way the apex is
configured<00:01:06.710> there's<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.040> first<00:01:08.250> crown<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
configured there's the first crown and

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.030 
configured there's the first crown and
rafters<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:12.210> second<00:01:12.840> crown<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.500> rafters

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
rafters in the second crown and rafters

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.950 
rafters in the second crown and rafters
in<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.770> third<00:01:17.189> pair<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.820> crown<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.390> rafters

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
in the third pair of crown and rafters

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.249 
in the third pair of crown and rafters
in<00:01:20.780> then<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.990> hips<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:24.920> then<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.100> creepers

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
in then the hips and then the creepers

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:41.950 
in then the hips and then the creepers
so<00:01:28.259> that's<00:01:28.470> roof<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:31.729> here's<00:01:32.729> roof<00:01:33.090> -<00:01:37.549> it<00:01:38.549> had

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.149 

the<00:01:42.960> hips<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.880> first<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.210> no<00:01:45.390> crown<00:01:45.750> ends

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.300 

that's<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.490> way<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.530> hips<00:01:52.530> are<00:01:52.770> configured

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that's the way the hips are configured

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.050 
that's the way the hips are configured
at<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> apex<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:57.329> first<00:01:57.630> pair<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.960> hips<00:01:58.259> in

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
at the apex the first pair of hips in

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.010 
at the apex the first pair of hips in
second<00:02:00.060> pair<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.420> hips<00:02:00.659> in

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
second pair of hips in

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:11.490 
second pair of hips in
third<00:02:02.950> pair<00:02:03.460> of<00:02:03.609> hips<00:02:03.850> in<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:05.399> then<00:02:09.509> at<00:02:10.509> 600

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
third pair of hips in and then at 600

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.270 
third pair of hips in and then at 600
centers<00:02:11.920> evenly<00:02:12.790> spaced<00:02:13.180> from<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.170> center<00:02:14.769> so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
centers evenly spaced from the center so

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.650 
centers evenly spaced from the center so
there's<00:02:15.489> no<00:02:15.640> crown<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.180> rafter<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:19.060> keeps<00:02:19.450> the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
there's no crown and rafter it keeps the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.289 
there's no crown and rafter it keeps the
apex<00:02:20.080> nice<00:02:20.349> and<00:02:20.620> clean

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
apex nice and clean

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.930 
apex nice and clean
there's<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.599> creepers<00:02:22.989> in<00:02:23.170> there<00:02:23.379> and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
there's the creepers in there and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.050 
there's the creepers in there and
there's<00:02:24.940> all<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:25.390> creepers<00:02:25.840> in<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:27.849> was

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
there's all the creepers in so that was

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.559 
there's all the creepers in so that was
roof<00:02:28.560> too<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:30.629> here<00:02:31.629> we've<00:02:31.810> got<00:02:32.730> roof<00:02:33.730> 3<00:02:34.239> which

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
roof too and here we've got roof 3 which

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.870 
roof too and here we've got roof 3 which
is<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:35.170> hips<00:02:35.470> at<00:02:35.709> 30<00:02:35.980> degrees<00:02:36.430> not<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
is the hips at 30 degrees not the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.339 
is the hips at 30 degrees not the
rafters<00:02:37.420> at<00:02:37.599> 30<00:02:37.840> degrees<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.790> we've<00:02:40.030> got

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.009 

looking<00:02:44.349> straight<00:02:44.650> down<00:02:44.680> on<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.099> apex<00:02:46.019> hips

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
looking straight down on the apex hips

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.600 
looking straight down on the apex hips
in<00:02:47.319> first<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:48.010> then<00:02:48.720> crown<00:02:49.720> ends<00:02:50.400> that's<00:02:51.400> a

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
in first and then crown ends that's a

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.150 
in first and then crown ends that's a
bit<00:02:51.760> closer<00:02:52.060> look<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.690> how<00:02:53.650> that's<00:02:53.860> all

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
bit closer look of how that's all

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:02.069 
bit closer look of how that's all
configured<00:02:59.459> hips<00:03:00.459> in<00:03:00.730> first<00:03:01.090> one<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.840> first

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
configured hips in first one the first

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:11.550 
configured hips in first one the first
pair<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:03.400> second<00:03:03.879> pair<00:03:07.889> and<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.780> third<00:03:11.109> pair

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
pair the second pair and the third pair

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:21.509 
pair the second pair and the third pair
and<00:03:13.920> then<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:17.380> crown<00:03:17.709> end<00:03:17.980> rafters<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:20.519> then

and then the crown end rafters and then
the<00:03:22.090> creepers<00:03:23.730> all<00:03:24.730> right<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:25.180> should<00:03:25.480> give

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
the creepers all right that should give

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.720 
the creepers all right that should give
you<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.290> bit<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.940> heads<00:03:27.940> up<00:03:28.180> on<00:03:29.519> where<00:03:30.519> to

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
you a bit of a heads up on where to

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.030 
you a bit of a heads up on where to
start
