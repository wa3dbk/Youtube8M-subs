the biggest number the biggest number is
on<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:43.570> widest<00:01:44.260> gap<00:01:45.030> with<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.060> pasta

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
on the widest gap with the pasta

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.170 
on the widest gap with the pasta
machines<00:01:46.840> put<00:01:47.440> inside<00:01:47.830> start<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.790> Rowley

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
machines put inside start to Rowley

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.920 
machines put inside start to Rowley
then<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:49.810> roll<00:01:49.990> about<00:01:50.170> two<00:01:50.760> three<00:01:51.760> times<00:01:52.030> so

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
then you roll about two three times so

then you roll about two three times so
then<00:01:53.230> you<00:01:53.680> turn<00:01:53.920> again<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.810> smaller<00:01:56.320> but

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
then you turn again to the smaller but

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.030 
then you turn again to the smaller but
not<00:01:56.920> much<00:01:57.130> smaller<00:01:57.630> then<00:01:58.630> again<00:01:58.930> you<00:01:59.590> roll<00:01:59.860> it

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
not much smaller then again you roll it

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.660 
not much smaller then again you roll it
when<00:02:00.910> you<00:02:01.030> roll<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.660> turn<00:02:02.200> them<00:02:02.350> around

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
when you roll it you turn them around

when you roll it you turn them around
you<00:02:03.670> roll<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:05.170> then<00:02:05.230> again<00:02:05.910> you<00:02:06.910> take<00:02:07.180> them

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
you roll it and then again you take them

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.559 
you roll it and then again you take them
around<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:07.930> about<00:02:08.140> three<00:02:09.069> times<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:10.420> then

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
around and about three times and then

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.259 
around and about three times and then
again<00:02:10.929> you<00:02:11.470> close<00:02:11.709> another<00:02:12.010> gap

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
again you close another gap

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.750 
again you close another gap
see<00:02:14.900> at<00:02:15.109> the<00:02:15.200> moment<00:02:15.560> I<00:02:15.890> don't<00:02:16.250> need<00:02:16.519> any

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
see at the moment I don't need any

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.220 
see at the moment I don't need any
flower<00:02:16.879> and<00:02:17.299> then<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.900> turn<00:02:18.170> them<00:02:18.319> around<00:02:20.230> you

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
flower and then you turn them around you

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.500 
flower and then you turn them around you
can<00:02:21.409> do<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:21.680> ever<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.129> quick<00:02:22.430> then<00:02:23.120> again<00:02:23.359> you

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
can do this ever so quick then again you

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.449 
can do this ever so quick then again you
close<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:24.019> again<00:02:25.090> another<00:02:26.090> small<00:02:26.569> gap<00:02:27.459> and

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
close it again another small gap and

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.610 
close it again another small gap and
look<00:02:28.640> at<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:28.900> already<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:32.019> small<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.349> there

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
look at that already I small and there

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.860 
look at that already I small and there
are<00:02:33.829> wide<00:02:34.129> to<00:02:34.430> start<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.790> come<00:02:35.000> very<00:02:35.239> thin<00:02:35.659> on

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
are wide to start to come very thin on

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.179 
are wide to start to come very thin on
the<00:02:35.930> side<00:02:37.209> then<00:02:38.209> turn<00:02:38.450> them<00:02:38.599> around<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:40.069> then

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
the side then turn them around and then

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.520 
the side then turn them around and then
you<00:02:40.370> start<00:02:40.730> again

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
you start again

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.449 
you start again
rolling<00:02:42.530> them<00:02:42.650> around<00:02:42.709> so<00:02:43.129> you<00:02:43.219> want<00:02:43.370> to

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
rolling them around so you want to

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.179 
rolling them around so you want to
almost<00:02:43.639> make<00:02:43.939> it<00:02:44.120> round<00:02:44.719> but<00:02:45.709> in<00:02:45.889> the<00:02:45.980> same

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
almost make it round but in the same

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.710 
almost make it round but in the same
