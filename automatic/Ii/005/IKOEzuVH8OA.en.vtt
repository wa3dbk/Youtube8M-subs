 go well bought then let's go to 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.390
 play this game that kind of 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.159
 super cool play splatter to play 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.140
 with the first premier face audio mode 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.840
 take yourself in this little world it is 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.920
 like the minecraft because now all the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.990
 games are the magna charta comes the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.810
 our cursor reanult robinho only in the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.060
 2000 and shoot these men that point 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.460
 they generate random there is falling 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.860
 the random note for the map 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.390
 sounds easy but it's not for nothing 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.159
 now I'm in normal trouble if not 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.060
 mistake it's really absurd to have it 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.560
 practically with the fuck button with 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.570
 the left button we shoot with the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.820
 gun with the right button we shoot the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.040
 madonna rockets that is truly one 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.890
 cool at the top we have the beauty of 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.649
 life and if they kill us for these so 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.479
 they shoot we die so much we can too 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.100
 run that is a good thing so there 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.409
 we manage to create a good horde 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.259
 behind many dtt sti so that it does not 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.420
 I know how to define them we shoot rockets to 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.700
 don't end up there if we destroy even then 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.380
 the graphics a cool the ninth made is 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.390
 made fucking good in the graphics 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.799
 really gigi that translating we can 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.140
 angel infants and as letters up above 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.060
 ac 130 furniture came up so now 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.280
 to press one is with the right button 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.660
 now I'm going to launch the missiles from the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.340
 sky born hunting 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.020
 you play cool as you make one 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.910
 hand I ask you how to play precisely not 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.350
 be known because the familiar 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.440
 development of this game deserve a 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.660
 fucking because it's really fun 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.980
 ok vajda c130 no just an ass are 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.290
 dead than to approve another mode 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.120
 that the way that I more than is more a 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.280
 I like it because it's practically a tankbot 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.110
 paintball to fable ii not fake them 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.850
 however, the opponent's grill is pretty cool 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.370
 because they practically disintegrate 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.590
 become color that's cool there 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.510
 look at the one with almost stop a little 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.750
 like maybe this a little my mom who 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.610
 beautiful nothing a bomb of color rest 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.760
 here anyway as you soul 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.920
 eating the map will be a total delusion 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.210
 of colors I really love this game is 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.920
 really very cool council of 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.350
 try it all the games of course 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.640
 I'm going to do this series for 92 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.230
 percent free so obviously 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.480
 also put the inter description for 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.010
 you can try it at your home dates 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.780
 look look at that brothel of colors 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.460
 that you are creating absurdly cool 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.830
 that the c130 arrives obviously launches 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.860
 pure color balls 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:14.670
 ok ac 130 iamoci everywhere 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.610
 Oh God look a little tool I launched 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.020
 all the choirs record time enjoys it 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.190
 going on is going very well but me 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.870
 than the first one exploiting very well 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.610
 more than that they become more difficult 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.530
 becomes and framework because precisely the 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.290
 framework can be years ago 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.940
 because precisely it becomes more zoe brothel 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.410
 the madonna tour waits for us not to 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.270
 will offer to no end 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.130
 no I died I did n't see them then I saw 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.030
 they throw behind me to create a horde of 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.620
 Enemies behind oh God asked what everyone is 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.500
 this thing didn't know what bullshit 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.420
 with water out there in this is a 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.800
 great place for astera ie not campers 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.190
 you can die today or maybe you do 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.070
 to die 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.800
 ok maybe a lot more than before i was today 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.540
 one destroyed but no destroyed 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.350
 I had never seen the structure is the 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.360
 christ lord 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.600
 ac 130 ready we do the same thing as 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.600
 before 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:08.690
 madonna madonna madonna that cool 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:11.780
 no I have my 153 top 10 record which 153 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.220
 ok so now we try to redo 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.629
 another game and break the record 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.400
 I do a lot now but I play it 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.919
 tactics guys try to make me a 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.540
 tactically I do not do so 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.360
 wasting bullets using a little bit 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.550
 of the brain 153 kg I will not reach them 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.199
 never because I'm really hard fucking 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.639
 of game we can well because so much the 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.800
 behind they do not arrive can live alone 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.500
 before the maximum is important not 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.870
 make them approach within the firing range 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.270
 ok type they are already shooting is the thing is 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.470

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.360
 becoming fearfully I can skip a 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.070
 empty faq that we run no longer placed 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.410

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.120
 Fucking record is 115 killer 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.010

 unknown games I hope this is it 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.060

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.620
 write it in the comments that I go to 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.940
