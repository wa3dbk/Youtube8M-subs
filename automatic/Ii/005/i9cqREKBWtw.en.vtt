00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.930 
and make as much room at the bottom as
the<00:01:08.120> reason<00:01:08.570> I'm<00:01:08.990> doing<00:01:09.740> this<00:01:10.310> again<00:01:10.610> is

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
the reason I'm doing this again is

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.620 
the reason I'm doing this again is
because<00:01:11.090> I<00:01:11.710> did<00:01:12.710> eventually<00:01:12.980> go<00:01:13.730> swimming<00:01:14.510> in

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
because I did eventually go swimming in

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.780 
because I did eventually go swimming in
a<00:01:14.660> pool<00:01:14.870> and<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:15.800> can<00:01:15.830> still<00:01:16.220> do<00:01:16.400> this

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
a pool and you can still do this

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.880 
a pool and you can still do this
but<00:01:17.300> you<00:01:17.360> might<00:01:17.540> just<00:01:17.570> need<00:01:17.870> to<00:01:17.930> read<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:18.740> your

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
but you might just need to read I your

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.620 
but you might just need to read I your
hair<00:01:19.040> afterward<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.670> be<00:01:19.760> as<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:20.000> will<00:01:20.120> feed<00:01:20.330> a

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
hair afterward to be as it will feed a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.240 
hair afterward to be as it will feed a
lot<00:01:21.230> of<00:01:21.260> people<00:01:21.470> are<00:01:21.530> like<00:01:21.680> oh<00:01:21.860> that's<00:01:21.980> the

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
lot of people are like oh that's the
