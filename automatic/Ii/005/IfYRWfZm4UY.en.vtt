00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.550
 episode of my series on care 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.610
 of the hair in this episode we are going to 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.060
 talk about the products that I use and 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.480
 of my routine hair care routing here os 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.570
 I leave the first episode and the second 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.570
 episode 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.040
 and we're going to start so, like I told you 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.460
 in the other episodes my products do not 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.870
 have neither sulfates nor silicones and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.000
 I meet here in the USA in the 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.309
 supermarkets in target walmart and 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.010
 stores of this type if you do not 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.410
 you have target or walmart I am going to leave you 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.079
 in the description the list of 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.079
 sulfates and silicones that do not 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.940
 They should be in your products like this 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.329
 that you can control the labels of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.399
 our products and also bring this 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.220
 list with you when you go from 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:12.000
 Also, I'm going to leave you in the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.190
 description the link of amazon and ebay 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.450
 of my products so you can 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:22.140
 buy them online and my friend's link 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.229
 sisi who made an article on his blog with 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.550
 a list of brands that carry products 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.310
 without silicones and without sulfates like 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.680
 other brands as well and now 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.220
 let's talk about my products so 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.360
 I use the night shampoo 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.720
 speaks 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.560
 this is the ever clear and this is the ever 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.979
 premium at the beginning I used this because 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.009
 the sulfates of the normal shampoos me 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.860
 they dried the leather very much and had 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.979
 always very dry and lost leather 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.530
 bits of skin and things like that and this one 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.009
 it helped a lot but when my leather 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.630
 I was already hydrated this was a little 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:11.810
 too moisturizing so I started to 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.810
 use this one that is perfect so 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.569
 these two and they smell 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.190
 I love them I love them they smell super super 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.120
 well and then I have two 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.300
 conditioners these two this is from the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.530
 same line of l'orÃ©al 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:35.459
 and this I use it for my tips 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.950
 while he used it for him as 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.290
 for when I want to wash my hair with 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.230
 conditioner and not with the done with the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.230
 shampoo because this is a little bit more 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.290
 and this is a little bit more hydrating and 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.230
 I do not use gelatin mousse lacquer and things 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.370
 well because if you use products without 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.880
 sulfates and silicones your curls go 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.819
 to be super defined and you do not need 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.950
 other products so you're going to save 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.489
 money and the only thing he used 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.130
 when I use the dryer is the spray 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.360
 heat protector and this is also 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.660
 without sulfates and silicones and is bad 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.599
 nape of line 6 candle when I have the 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.650
 leather a little drier I use oil 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:32.310
 olive before washing the hair and 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.099
 when I have the dry ends I use 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.220
 coconut oil or one of these 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.340
 masks 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.560
 and now let's see how I wash and dry 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.860
 the hair as first thing I love you 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.920
 say that I have wavy hair 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:52.640
 I have a lot is very thick and my leather and 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.670
 my skin is dry in general so these 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.340
 tips go very well for people 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.620
 that have these characteristics and we're going 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.620
 to see my head what routine so step 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.200
 number 1 wet super super super hair 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.110
 super good step number 2 I put the 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:13.010
 conditioner at the tips and this what 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:16.400
 I do that because while I put the 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.850
 injury and I wash the leather my ends are gone 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.060
 hydrating step number 3 I put the shampoo 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.420
 in my leather and I wash it very well if you have 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.140
 curly curly hair you do not need 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.690
 wash the tips because the shape of 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.450
 Our hair makes the oil 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:39.290
 Natural hair stays close to 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.540
 the roots and therefore who normally 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.040
 has wavy or curly hair has 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.520
 dry hair 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.160
 and it gets dirty just near the leather like that 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.050
 that if you have the tips dry and are 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.680
 clean you do not have to put the shampoo 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:58.460
 at the tips because you are going to dry it 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.740
 more so I put the injury just about 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.700
 of my leather and wash it very well after 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.550
 step number 4 rinsed very well and step 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:11.240
 number 5 I'm going to put the conditioner 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:15.590
 again at the tips normally from 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:18.500
 my ear down and now is when 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.350
 I comb my hair with this comb that 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.290
 call 15 and I'll leave the link 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:28.160
 in the description and comb from the 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:31.580
 points up after that step 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.250
 number 6 at stake again but after 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.610
 of rinsing your hair you do not have to feel 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.370
 to the soft touch if you do not have it soft 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.790
 you have to put more conditioner and 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:47.180
 wait longer before rinsing 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:50.840
 you leave the shower with your hair 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:55.090
 was contacted after step number 7 I'm going to 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.650
 remove the excess water and I'll 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:01.820
 squeeze a little with my hands 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:05.540
 first very delicately so and then 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:10.520
 I do the same with my 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:13.160
 cotton and water teacher yes very 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.080
 delicately and then I wrap the hair 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.170
 in my cotton teachers 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.470
 I wait a few minutes and last step 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:26.540
 took off the shirt and let my hair dry 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:30.100
 in the air or used the dryer with the 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:33.110
 diffuser and I put cold or warm air 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:36.440
 after that if I want my hair more 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:39.050
 defined and more wavy I use my phone 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.340
 I will leave the link in the 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:46.190

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:52.340
 easy to use and I leave here the

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.960
 corners and at night to keep the 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.810
 defined curls 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.600
 What I do is sleep with a high tail 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.210
