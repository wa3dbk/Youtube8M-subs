design back in the day and in fact it
still<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.150> it's<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.480> very<00:00:21.660> very<00:00:22.199> unusual<00:00:22.500> design

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
still is it's a very very unusual design

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.009 
still is it's a very very unusual design
in<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:25.760> people<00:00:26.760> were<00:00:26.939> getting<00:00:27.330> used<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.810> the

in that people were getting used to the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.130 
in that people were getting used to the
whole<00:00:28.820> economic<00:00:29.960> sort<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.050> pronged<00:00:31.940> design

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
whole economic sort of pronged design

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.540 
whole economic sort of pronged design
with<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> problems<00:00:34.590> at<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.710> sides<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.340> sort

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
with the problems at the sides to sort

with the problems at the sides to sort
of<00:00:35.579> get<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> grip<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.210> deep<00:00:36.750> had<00:00:37.020> their<00:00:37.320> buttons

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
of get a grip on deep had their buttons

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.220 
of get a grip on deep had their buttons
their<00:00:40.430> triggers<00:00:41.430> their<00:00:41.700> all<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:43.050> had

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
their triggers their all of this we had

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.340 
their triggers their all of this we had
seen<00:00:43.440> before<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.160> liked<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.750> were<00:00:45.930> me<00:00:46.140> and

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
seen before and liked if you were me and

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.660 
seen before and liked if you were me and
I<00:00:46.800> was<00:00:47.039> me<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.700> liked<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.670> was

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
I was me so I liked it but this was

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.510 
I was me so I liked it but this was
different<00:00:51.680> because<00:00:52.680> you've<00:00:52.949> got<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> middle

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
different because you've got the middle

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.939 
different because you've got the middle
prong<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:54.390> an<00:00:54.539> analogue<00:00:54.989> goofer<00:00:55.469> there<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
prong with an analogue goofer there and

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.000 
prong with an analogue goofer there and
the<00:00:56.489> trigger<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:57.120> there<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:58.140> was<00:00:58.590> very

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the trigger just there this was very

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.310 
the trigger just there this was very
very<00:00:59.129> different<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.500> I<00:01:02.449> didn't<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.629> it

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.700 

here's<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> thing<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.950> know<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.689> very<00:01:09.720> very

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
here's the thing I know it is very very

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.050 
here's the thing I know it is very very
clever<00:01:11.570> you<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.130> control<00:01:14.790> some

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
clever you can you can control some

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.390 
clever you can you can control some
games<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.710> control<00:01:17.070> some

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
games like that you can control some

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.370 
games like that you can control some
games<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.080> control

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
games like that then you can control

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.670 
games like that then you can control
some<00:01:19.710> games<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:24.530> frequently<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
some games like that and frequently it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.819 
some games like that and frequently it
does<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.040> very<00:01:26.369> well<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.119> sometimes<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.320> just

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
does it very well and sometimes it just

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.359 
does it very well and sometimes it just
makes<00:01:28.979> my<00:01:29.430> brain<00:01:29.759> explode<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.619> nasty<00:01:32.100> kind

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
makes my brain explode in the nasty kind

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.179 
makes my brain explode in the nasty kind
of<00:01:32.490> way<00:01:32.640> which<00:01:33.450> doesn't<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.990> any<00:01:34.259> way<00:01:34.380> make<00:01:34.979> it

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
of way which doesn't in any way make it

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.280 
of way which doesn't in any way make it
a<00:01:35.400> bad<00:01:35.670> pad<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.240> actually<00:01:36.329> think<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.930> really

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
a bad pad I actually think it's a really

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.640 
a bad pad I actually think it's a really
really<00:01:37.590> good<00:01:38.040> pad<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.820> only<00:01:38.970> thing

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
really good pad and the only thing

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.960 
really good pad and the only thing
technically<00:01:40.650> wrong<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:43.880> this<00:01:45.439> it<00:01:46.439> is

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
technically wrong with it is this it is

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.370 
technically wrong with it is this it is
flimsy<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.740> it<00:01:49.740> wears<00:01:49.979> out<00:01:50.329> so<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:52.020> will<00:01:52.170> start

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
flimsy and it wears out so it will start

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.090 
flimsy and it wears out so it will start
squeaking<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.250> sticking<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.329> I've<00:01:55.259> seen<00:01:55.829> so

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
squeaking and sticking and I've seen so

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.280 
squeaking and sticking and I've seen so
many<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.340> these<00:01:56.460> where<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.570> has<00:01:57.750> been<00:01:57.780> broken

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
many of these where this has been broken

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.130 
many of these where this has been broken
off<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.520> got<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> pin<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:02.070> works

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
off and you just got like a pin it works

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.359 
off and you just got like a pin it works
everything<00:02:04.140> about<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.649> works

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
everything about this works

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.350 
everything about this works
I<00:02:05.420> just<00:02:06.420> find<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:09.379> it<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:11.099> too<00:02:11.370> clever<00:02:11.670> it's

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
I just find it it it's too clever it's

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.270 
I just find it it it's too clever it's
too<00:02:12.660> clever<00:02:12.959> for<00:02:13.140> my<00:02:13.560> post<00:02:13.890> you

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
too clever for my post you

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.490 
too clever for my post you
big<00:02:14.400> brain<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.120> I'd<00:02:15.569> rather<00:02:15.750> play<00:02:15.990> with<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.140> ps2

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
big brain and I'd rather play with a ps2

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.059 
big brain and I'd rather play with a ps2
pad<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:17.760> that's<00:02:18.540> that's<00:02:18.990> me<00:02:19.230> there's<00:02:19.620> nothing

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
pad but that's that's me there's nothing

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.040 
pad but that's that's me there's nothing
wrong<00:02:20.250> with<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.580> pad<00:02:20.880> apart<00:02:21.300> from<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.600> it's

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
wrong with this pad apart from this it's

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.199 
wrong with this pad apart from this it's
just<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.560> don't<00:02:22.800> like<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.490> find<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:23.970> too

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
just that I don't like it I find it too

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.600 
just that I don't like it I find it too
too<00:02:24.810> clever<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:26.069> other<00:02:26.190> really<00:02:26.520> cool

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
too clever and the other really cool

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.730 
too clever and the other really cool
thing<00:02:26.970> about<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.330> was<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.750> inclusion<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.410> the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
thing about it was the inclusion of the
