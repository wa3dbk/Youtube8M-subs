00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
have a pretty nice digital camera here

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.080 
have a pretty nice digital camera here
so<00:00:15.030> make<00:00:15.750> sure<00:00:15.780> we<00:00:16.080> can<00:00:16.199> see<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.470> scores<00:00:17.090> this

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
so make sure we can see the scores this

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.670 
so make sure we can see the scores this
time<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.660> frame<00:00:18.900> rates<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.320> whatnot<00:00:19.650> so

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
time and the frame rates and whatnot so

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.910 
time and the frame rates and whatnot so
just<00:00:20.609> my<00:00:20.699> ice<00:00:20.880> cream<00:00:21.119> sandwich<00:00:21.769> lock<00:00:22.769> screen

everything's fresh let's pull up closet
here<00:00:33.649> i'll<00:00:34.649> run<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> full<00:00:35.340> benchmark

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.320 

and<00:00:42.130> get<00:00:42.250> down<00:00:42.430> here<00:00:42.460> so<00:00:42.850> we<00:00:42.940> can<00:00:43.030> see<00:00:43.240> the

and get down here so we can see the

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.450 
and get down here so we can see the
frame<00:00:43.600> rates<00:00:43.870> for<00:00:44.740> the<00:00:44.770> different<00:00:45.130> renders

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
said that if you run twice the score

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.070 
said that if you run twice the score
will<00:01:40.830> turn<00:01:41.040> out<00:01:41.190> better<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.910> let's<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.960> go

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
will turn out better so let's just go

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.820 
will turn out better so let's just go
ahead<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.290> run<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.650> twice<00:01:45.440> as<00:01:46.440> somebody<00:01:46.800> i

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
ahead and run it twice as somebody i

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.490 
ahead and run it twice as somebody i
posted<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> comment<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.990> my<00:01:49.140> first<00:01:49.590> video

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.660 

just<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> side<00:01:55.920> note<00:01:55.979> too<00:01:56.490> i<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.660> a<00:01:58.670> droid

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
just as a side note too i have a droid

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
just as a side note too i have a droid
charge<00:02:00.210> phone<00:02:02.119> that<00:02:03.119> has<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.479> super<00:02:03.780> amoled

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
charge phone that has the super amoled

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.350 
charge phone that has the super amoled
plus<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.100> using<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.520> super<00:02:05.789> amoled

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
plus this is using the super amoled

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.620 
plus this is using the super amoled
pentile<00:02:07.340> display<00:02:08.340> which<00:02:08.640> uses<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.119> two<00:02:09.330> sub

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
pentile display which uses the two sub

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.310 
pentile display which uses the two sub
pixels<00:02:10.080> instead<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.530> three<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:12.690> does<00:02:13.020> make

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
pixels instead of three and it does make

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.900 
pixels instead of three and it does make
a<00:02:13.380> really<00:02:13.800> big<00:02:14.010> difference<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.640> know<00:02:14.730> there's

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
a really big difference I know there's

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.250 
a really big difference I know there's
been<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.060> lot<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.270> talk<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> internet<00:02:16.140> about

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
been a lot of talk on the internet about

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.900 
been a lot of talk on the internet about
how<00:02:16.530> big<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.950> deal<00:02:17.160> that's<00:02:17.459> really<00:02:17.730> going<00:02:17.850> to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
how big of a deal that's really going to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.080 
how big of a deal that's really going to
make<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:19.140> noticed<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.920> huge<00:02:20.340> difference<00:02:20.520> in

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
make but I noticed a huge difference in

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.630 
make but I noticed a huge difference in
quality<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.830> know<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:22.980> can<00:02:23.250> pretty<00:02:23.370> much<00:02:23.489> make

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
quality you know I can pretty much make

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.009 
quality you know I can pretty much make
out<00:02:24.060> every<00:02:24.420> pixel<00:02:24.780> with<00:02:24.959> ease<00:02:25.230> here<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:27.019> you

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
out every pixel with ease here and you

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.930 
out every pixel with ease here and you
know<00:02:28.140> with<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.410> super<00:02:28.830> amoled<00:02:29.220> plus<00:02:29.250> it's

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
know with the super amoled plus it's

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.229 
know with the super amoled plus it's
actually<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.269> lower<00:02:30.540> resolution<00:02:31.519> but<00:02:32.519> things

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
actually a lower resolution but things

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.930 
actually a lower resolution but things
actually<00:02:33.450> look<00:02:33.750> more<00:02:33.780> crisp<00:02:34.500> huh<00:02:35.310> well<00:02:35.880> it

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
actually look more crisp huh well it

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.020 
actually look more crisp huh well it
looks<00:02:36.000> like<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.360> guy<00:02:36.510> was<00:02:36.690> right<00:02:36.900> holy<00:02:37.140> crap

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
looks like that guy was right holy crap

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.009 
looks like that guy was right holy crap
