00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.750
 that's it m15 all the rest to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.540
 except gauges and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.710
 personal design 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.270

 you will have the opportunity to see this boat 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:47.010
 we agree on the water it measures 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:50.149
 about 1 m 40 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.789

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:58.890

 twenty kilos ah yes ok 1 m 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.789
 45 kilos so it's true that for a 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.010
 offshore roof there is a little work 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.820
 still we will pass in the category 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:13.200
 watch with this extraordinary machine 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.500
 entirely designed by the team will 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.390
 boat that exceeds 50 kg is 1.41 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.340
 kilo a good sixty meter 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.040

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.970
 hercules it is the case to say it 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.200

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.700
 if you know the videos of hervÃ© and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.930
 well we are attacking the family of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.400
 giants and the manufacturing quality is 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.400
 exceptional is a reality 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.130

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.250

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.220
 other originality of course this monster 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.320

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.160
 during with a beautiful box and 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.440
 look at the quality of the finish 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.610
 ancestors or drum it's so cute 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.670

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.320
 captain the shoulder and the dogs the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.230
 cats 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.970
 an attention to detail that does not prevent this 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.470
 monster to sail and when I say this 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.010
 monster and we even come the seagull 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.370

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.010

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.790

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.950
 more than kwame 30 1 38 so that's it 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.380
 finished the monster and in attack 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.690
 the little one that was built 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.600
 to accommodate a machine like apple 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.570
 once again artisanal design 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.620
 it's a friend who did that one of a there 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.090
 but there really the machine is very 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.810
 very very beautiful especially she is 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.480
 once again 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.000
 two personal conceptions then the 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.870
 quality look is what you want 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.549
 put me on so two of these 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.370
 boats will be sailing very 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.880
 soon so I'll have the pleasure of 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.239
 do you 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.989
 schaaf oh yeah that was fun 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:14.620
 benefits of these live live videos 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:15.010
 oh there it's beautiful with all the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.080
 details 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.450
 I know that the video would not be 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.299
 necessarily perfect but at least I you 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:28.239
 makes you want to come then it will see 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:33.060
 will pass to saint paul in the oise next 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.060
 from beauvais on saturday and sunday to 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.940
 10:02 said yes but that's it 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.490
 September it's live it's the 5th and 6th 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.770
 and it was done so if you have the 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.140
 chance to see his videos before 7 and 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.280
 September 8th 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.580
 well come see us at beauvais me 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.990
 I 'll be there too with a boat 2 because 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.410
 that there is something to really be done 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.280
 pleasure 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.880
 he might not have a lot of 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.260
 steam but the trap quality had 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:04.709
 initially forgot what I thought was 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.580
 a boat is actually a little app 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.840
 You have to show me the can has 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.670
 chosen show me the fishing rod 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.940
 because even the fishing rod look 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.780
 and functional go on it's normal when 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.510
 we are a fishing rod we can 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.060
 set in length hop and we even have the 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.070
 fish gave up and in it we have 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.010
 a small oscillating machine of 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.040
 personal design with the driver 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.020
 and what is very original is that the 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.870
 hull is actually a library that 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.750
 can buy times in stores 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:38.430
 Breton then in front of the whole family 1st 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.650
 it's all the way down but that's it if you 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.930
 have cabinets to float you 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.729
 fall on talented people and you 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.560
 transforms a wardrobe for maybe 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.970
 by a wardrobe anyway a one 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:54.290
 showcase boat what to dream no to 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.290
 soon friends again
