00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 or the one you put in today is a radio day and 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.350
 I bring a gadget that you will love 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.139
 to make our trips a little bit 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.139
 more test cheer come on let's go 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.660
 comes with the dimension of the analysis of 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.520
 devices that I said easier is 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.520
 the technological momentazo 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.770
 plus the many that before we return to 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.629
 greet 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.120
 carolina denia good afternoon good 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.470
 Evenings today we said it also at the beginning 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.360
 of the program we look at the car in the 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.059
 momentazo and you have brought something that is going to 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.220
 surprise and will leave very good taste 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.480
 of mouth to let you tell it 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.480
 to say the name sometimes I say it well 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:06.550
 we have tried it we liked the trick 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:09.850
 express go yes almost perfect costs 149 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.700
 euros and is a travel espresso machine 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.440
 a coffee machine that also works just 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.479
 with a 12 volt connection with what 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.310
 which is intended to take it from 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.229
 vacations for example or every day 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.619
 Well, if we go in our vehicle and 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.440
 others or for example for caravans for 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.970
 boats for all those places where 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.140
 we can spend the holidays you know 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.440
 that also my holidays you spend in 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.440
 a van 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.560
 exact act company and it's also that 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.420
 practically 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.680
 in all holidays I am not able to 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.360
 have a coffee because there are times when 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.149
 you find the coffee maker or the bear 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.280
 cafeteria or because it just does not block 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.259
 whereupon this is absolutely 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.820
 great for all those who 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.130
 they want to have a fresh coffee 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.740
 good for you to get an idea 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.659
 size of praise I know that you what 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.759
 you are watching but for those who do not see it 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.950
 the size is like that of a bottle of 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.399
 water pint weighs little more 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.439
 that's 880 grams and the only thing 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.130
 you need are some capsules that would be 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:12.430
 some capsules express like those of lead 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.470
 those that if there are a lot of 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.150
 get from coffee makers that use this 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.700
 type of capsules because in this case they are 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.560
 the lavazza like mine are the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.959
 tiny capsules and that cost then 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.660
 12 036 each capsule each capsule so 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.849
 it is a price of coffee makers bad people and 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.799
 current and how this works 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.900
 Well for you to see it work and for 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.819
 so we can also hear me 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.769
 brought a battery with an input of 12 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.810
 volts this of course has nothing 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.060
 what to do with the was with the coffee machine for 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.890
 what are you going 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:48.730
 listening to us live now so that 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:50.970
 you see that true in the study then 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.690
 all we have to do is 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.190
 first fill with water we will need 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.780
 in fact with the coffee maker comes with a 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.550
 little cup which is where we can 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.340
 take our coffee and that also goes to 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.410
 serve as a measure for coffee 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.239
 titans and for the espresso by the way 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.890
 has a hairline so we know which one 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.660
 is the quantity and that in fact only 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.209
 allow to make a coffee at the same time 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.180
 How much do we drink what coffee machine? 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.610
 in the upper part the water and what 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.890
 we have to do also expose the 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.209
 capsule on the top that is 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.099
 unscrew we introduce the capsule 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.340
 we re-screw the part again 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:33.819
 superior and once that's done 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.440
 we close with force and then already what 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.810
 only thing we would have to do is give it 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.880
 to our little ignition button 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.319
 we are in radio that you know that also 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.260
 is making video for then the channel 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.380
 of clips &amp; puntonet this that sounded the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.540
 device that is like a thermos 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.400
 and I also tell you that if any of 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.740
 you run a coffee shop and we 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.360
 the waiter or vice greet 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.510
 Carolina has made coffee and it is 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.160
 starting up while I feel this 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.650
 because in fact normally 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.700
 coffee makers take these are about two 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.590
 minutes a thing like that in doing it and a 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.940
 hammer but it really does more then or 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.250
 less the same sound that could make 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.050
 a coffee machine in our house how much 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.130
 it takes more or less then approximately 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.810
 one minute and two minutes until 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.239
 it takes pressure because the most important thing is 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.710
 that this coffee machine is 16 bars 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.080
 pressure right now full is who has 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.370
 said noise who said that you leave 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.080
 we have it to the frog the coffee maker 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.180
 making a noise that is music 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.590
 heavenly when the problems he sent 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.790
 a bathroom plus carolina attention 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.290
 these look right now what is 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.810
 making the coffee pot is to take the pressure 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.850
 of the candle you press to be able to do the 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.790
 real real espresso because it has a 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.830
 capacity of 16 bar pressure would have 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.300
 finished you see and now you have to 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.270
 wait for it to whistle three times when 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.810
 whistle three times will mean that the 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.360
 pressure has reached the sea 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.419
 now it's increasing until we know 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.310
 in the indicator that reaches the top and 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.050
 when it reaches the top it beats three times and 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.660
 we can pour coffee in swimming 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.610
 because it's not thermos I know that you the other 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.080
 day when I told you about the coffee machine 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.970
 you said but this is like a thermos not 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.620
 once we have finished the coffee 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.330
 now you will see it but we have to tilt 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.050
 the coffee maker and once it's tilted 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.389
 is when the coffee goes to the cup is worth 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.680
 then then since there are a lot of 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.840
 capsules in fact there are different 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.550
 flavors as with any other 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.800
 coffee makers with which you can choose 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.610
 then the aroma that you like most are 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.840
 16 capsules 1.079 in the box and 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.520
 can find certain sites or 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.260
 also online this that always do 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.690
 The copilot 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.610
 because then someone can listen low 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.590
 the podcast sees it on our channel but 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.630
 this has been done in a car by the 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.340
 caught clear in a night for habit the 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.410
 idea the exact idea is not doing it 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.570
 while it is more it can call us the 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.790
 attention of this who is about to 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.190
 whistle of this one the trick 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.440
 express go then look for example 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.540
 It has the perfect size to be able 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.040
 place it in the little hole in the cans and 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.520
 of the bottles with what always 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.520
 we can have 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.610
 and then also that it has a case 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:15.490
 super cute to carry the coffee machine 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.920
 and also the capsules in one part 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:21.810
 alexis and the time you hear all the velcro 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.810
 come out the coffee maker has frog missed 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.620
 we are live if no pita is going to me 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.840
 excuse someone but this has to 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.760
 be have to come to whistle but good 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:35.600
 one last data of the Catholic coffee maker 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:38.660
 Well look at the consumption is 140 watts 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.280
 and in principle, I think that 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.670
 it should be whistling less obvious but 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.380
 well, nothing happens 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.090
 I will put the music that is a gift 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:51.340
 that if we do it to the friends that we 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.340
 follow but let's go to music 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.480
 well it's already here is then the 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.800
 coffee maker once done that we give the 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.230
 return to the coffee machine 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.230
 we press a coffee pilot 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:25.840
 and as you can see, everything is coming out and 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.840
 now when it's finished 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.760
 cha cha cha cha cha 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.689
 we close as soon as the 

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:37.939
 Bubbles 

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:40.099
 we give the other little button and close 

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:42.439
 well what do you think of foam that 

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:46.099
 cross efe that is a coffee that smells 

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:48.229
 divinely wonderful is smoking if 

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:51.390
 I burn screamed but something until warm 

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:54.810
 blow a little bit like that 

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:58.400
 what a great cool 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.400
 I am sugar 

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:04.850
 well nothing with these coffee we 

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.850
 we say goodbye to customers
