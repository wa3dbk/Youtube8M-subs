they insist on putting madi in a tiny
nude<00:00:50.489> leotard<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.780> gets<00:00:51.989> people<00:00:52.559> talking

nude leotard but it gets people talking

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.979 
nude leotard but it gets people talking
which<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.670> probably<00:00:53.940> why<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.660> supposed<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
which is probably why it is supposed to

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.810 
which is probably why it is supposed to
show<00:00:55.170> her<00:00:55.289> more<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.559> her<00:00:55.649> raw<00:00:55.890> form<00:00:56.250> i<00:00:56.430> suppose

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
show her more in her raw form i suppose

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.189 
show her more in her raw form i suppose
but<00:00:57.059> i<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> same<00:00:57.809> thing<00:00:58.020> could<00:00:58.140> be

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
but i think the same thing could be

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.750 
but i think the same thing could be
accomplished<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.949> something<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.399> little<00:00:59.520> less

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
accomplished in something a little less

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.680 
accomplished in something a little less
tight<00:01:00.510> because<00:01:01.170> there's<00:01:01.410> moments<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
tight because there's moments in this

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.719 
tight because there's moments in this
video<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.080> I'm<00:01:04.530> sure<00:01:04.890> are<00:01:05.040> intentional

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
video which I I'm sure are intentional

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.710 
video which I I'm sure are intentional
that<00:01:05.939> there's<00:01:06.180> sort<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.530> non<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.430> well<00:01:09.150> it's

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that there's sort of a non and well it's

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.050 
that there's sort of a non and well it's
intentional<00:01:10.619> but<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.430> intentionally

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
intentional but it's intentionally

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.789 
intentional but it's intentionally
unintentional<00:01:12.720> erotic<00:01:13.140> kind<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.619> energy

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
unintentional erotic kind of energy

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.200 
unintentional erotic kind of energy
between<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.490> two<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.670> them<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.970> don't<00:01:15.150> know

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
between the two of them and I don't know

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.580 
between the two of them and I don't know
if<00:01:15.270> that's<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.630> because<00:01:15.720> Maddie's<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> pretty

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
if that's just because Maddie's a pretty

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.890 
if that's just because Maddie's a pretty
girl<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.100> she<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> more<00:01:18.360> mature<00:01:18.509> looking

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.320 
girl and she is a more mature looking
face<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.560> they're<00:01:20.070> both<00:01:20.220> naked<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.150> not

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330

automatically<00:01:21.990> align<00:01:22.259> goes<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.560> sex<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:22.920> I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
automatically align goes to sex but I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.640 
automatically align goes to sex but I
think<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.220> also<00:01:23.280> implying<00:01:23.970> some<00:01:24.270> sort<00:01:24.479> of

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
think it's also implying some sort of

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.530 
think it's also implying some sort of
sexual<00:01:25.650> relationship<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.939> never<00:01:27.180> talked

about<00:01:27.570> between<00:01:28.140> father<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.770> daughter<00:01:28.979> and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
about between father and daughter and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.190 
about between father and daughter and
how<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.030> relationship<00:01:30.180> between<00:01:30.600> father<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
how the relationship between father and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.620 
how the relationship between father and
daughter<00:01:31.290> forms<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.340> out<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.060> romantic

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
daughter forms the out of romantic

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.840 
daughter forms the out of romantic
relationships<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.439> women<00:01:34.710> often<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.490> so

relationships that women often have so

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.010 
relationships that women often have so
that's<00:01:35.970> what<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> think<00:01:36.390> they<00:01:36.450> were<00:01:36.509> going<00:01:36.869> with

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.620 
video it actually makes the song sound
better<00:01:46.890> than<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.220> does<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.610> song<00:01:47.820> itself<00:01:48.119> is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
better than it does the song itself is

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.240 
better than it does the song itself is
if<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.110> really<00:01:49.380> listen<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:50.070> kind

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
if you really listen to it is like kind

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.270 
if you really listen to it is like kind
of<00:01:50.340> bit<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:51.090> over<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.450> place<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:53.189> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
of bit all over the place and see it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.929 
of bit all over the place and see it
really<00:01:53.490> likes<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.939> scream<00:01:54.390> when<00:01:54.960> she<00:01:55.140> sings<00:01:55.409> I

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
really likes to scream when she sings I

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.889 
really likes to scream when she sings I
guess<00:01:56.939> that's<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.509> right<00:01:58.250> Who<00:01:59.250> am<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
guess that's just that right Who am I to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.510 
guess that's just that right Who am I to
be<00:02:00.899> critical<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.290> her<00:02:01.409> style<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.100> think

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
be critical of her style but I think

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.450 
be critical of her style but I think
chandelier<00:02:03.360> her<00:02:03.659> first<00:02:03.990> hit<00:02:04.920> with<00:02:05.130> Maddie

chandelier her first hit with Maddie

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.670 
chandelier her first hit with Maddie
dancing<00:02:06.030> around<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.540> actually<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> better<00:02:07.259> song

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
dancing around is actually a better song

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.940 
dancing around is actually a better song
