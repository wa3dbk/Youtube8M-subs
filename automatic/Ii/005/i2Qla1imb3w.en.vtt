00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.200
 Hello, girls, I'm Marta Miller. 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.780
 exclusive black range presenter 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.140
 unique you are asking me a lot 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.250
 about the new mascara and how the 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:22.199
 new application before we had this 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.189
 not okay with this what happens is that 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.369
 there were many many false levels that 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.210
 they copied and now we have a patent 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.579
 already outstanding own with the new the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.760
 again basically has better 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.570
 ingredients the brush is very much 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.480
 better the gel you have more control me 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.720
 love the esther brush then and 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.949
 it also leads to what is called abiliti 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.350
 which is one of our products but 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.079
 It's inside the gel that helps you a lot 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.449
 what is the health of the eyelashes 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.850
 then nothing I will tell you how 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.560
 I use right now I 'm wearing just one made 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.140
 I do not know if you can see it 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.970
 I have super short eyelashes and 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.670
 well at least here I have a tab 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.550
 thanks to unique then I have what 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.110
 I use is the mascara and then used 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.540
 what is the brush to separate the 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.540
 tabs in the end I'll show you the 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.430
 way that I do it is pretty 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:28.910
 simple I use basically gel water 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.870
 fiber and then hello again I get 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.720
 gel in all eyes fibers in only what 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.240
 what are the little tips and then the stamps 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.630
 again with the gel, and then with the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.960
 brush less brush well if what if you 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.330
 put many fibers you will appear one 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.150
 spider is worth it seems you have a 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.780
 a lot of problems so I'm not going to 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.090
 show how not to do that what not 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.190
 you can do is put the fibers in all 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.620
 the tab because you're going to be left is not going to 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.060
 look good and you will look like a doll 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.400
 when you take the gel and we start with the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.140
 first tube I have them both 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.800
 open because you want to go pretty 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.530
 fast because if it does not dry then what 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.580
 you remove as well as circular movements 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.670
 not up and down 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.540
 then make sure you take it all 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.640
 all right 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.640
 This is the gel and what you do is 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.550
 you will catch from the root to the top 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.850
 it costs a little here but well I'm going to 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.850
 try out 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.680
 and you see how I'm going to rotate what is the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.680
 brush 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.650
 and this brings a little bit of practice 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.989
 everything when you do it with your mobile 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.989
 so have patience with me 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.490
 the dangers here inside 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.490
 and a little if I do not see it well 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.950
 wrong now I immediately take what are the 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.200
 fibers make sure you do not have many 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.880
 what I do I give a little bit like that 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.560
 so that I fall 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.670
 well and I put it just look at what only 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.670
 I put the tips 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:55.080
 it's worth only the tips once then I'm lame 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.080
 the gel again 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.459
 and we seal them 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.579
 wrong 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.349
 ole 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.000
 well at least now I have tabs 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.000
 because I have so 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.040
 You can see the difference now I 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.760
 there is then what I'm going to do now is 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.520
 let it dry a bit and I use what 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.390
 that has been brushed well and well there are two 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.050
 the eyebrow that good you use 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.050
 here like this 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.000
 and then you have him 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.970
 the brush that is for wii 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.980
 he asked me what is for the eyelashes and 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.980
 what you do is separating 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.870
 without taking your eye if it was 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.570
 and tie and I tell you now what am I doing 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.160
 from your mobile and it costs a little more 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.140
 Now let's say that you want a little 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.940
 more exaggerated to me I like natural as well 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:21.830
 if you want more 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:24.320
 again you take the gel at the tips 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.940
 and the fiber at the tips do not put it on 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.460
 much with everything now since you've done 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.590
 a layer in the second layer only 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.930
 focus on the tips is worth it 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.450
 I do very quickly, let's say this eye 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.030
 I long more good here you do 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:41.150
 very fast because I do not like having the 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.160
 longer in truth I'm bothered by 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.020
 glasses when in the glasses and they touch me 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.670
 eyelashes on the glasses so good ya 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.860
 do you have an idea 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.290
 but I'll fight you a little bit of simulation 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.310
 so you see as we would do to 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:57.300
 put more 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.740
 and I repeat all the grace superimportante 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.710
 is to put 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.710
 what is the fibers at the tips just 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.360
 I repeat to me I like more natural but 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.360
 good 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.599
 and we find them 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.430
 sometimes you see 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.470
 so anything like that is how I eat it 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.320
 applied I each apply it differently to 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.060
 girls that you put the dryer me by the 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.860
 tomorrow if I have to put the dryer 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.780
 of the eyelashes and I have to comb the 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.370
 well and I have enough problem 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.220
 combing it but I know when I had my hair 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.550
 I lack only the tabs so to me 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.680
 like it's natural I take care of my eyelashes 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.890
 much cheaper than extensions if 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.720
