 wonderful income hands this series 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.420
 it's about a group of friends that stops 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.460

 discover some marks on the bodies 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.700
 of the eyebrows and how they walk with clothes 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.770
 well they are removed personally 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.000
 some day I hope to be a cliff that is one 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.409
 of the main characters of this 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.210

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.740
 spicy food file also les 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.970
 I recommend this animal especially the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.159
 Intro is wonderful 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.900
 one of my favorite intros of the year and in 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.299
 the number 3 place we have girl 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.440
 menestra j I had ex obviously the ovas and 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.390
 everything that has to do with Chinese 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.610
 medium pj do not know bad in this series I 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.680
 love because it is apart from as I said 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.580
 I like the series is comical I like them 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.110
 the puppets 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.000
 although the drawing is something old they are 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.590
 fun and it's also pretty 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.150
 I think I fell in love with this series when 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.160
 the first episodes are a little old man 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.070
 saying I do not have the new puppet 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.430
 with soft legs like cotton is like 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.680
 sleep in the clouds boy i stayed wow 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.910
 imagine we have a puppet so 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.310
 have legs lame I did not tell them 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.930
 explosion would need pillows in addition 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.760
 it would not be fun but my planet just 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.680
 of men imagine yourself everywhere 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.200
 there would be progress and wrestling and in the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.790
 put number 2 of these three we have 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.800
 workshop in bani a headquarters in which 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.600
 I recently fell in love especially for 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.340
 donkeys a character that already pleasing 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.590
 what I do not like this series is the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.030
 moral that you leave each character and 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.100
 I put our options 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.360
 this theory is very funny as you know 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.640
 all the animes that I have commented 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.170
 they are comical but they also have the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.180
 profound and a story behind that 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.110
 I hope they get more movies because they do not 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.330
 They are over 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.740
 spoiler answer alert has the post 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.319
 number 1 like you to my heart to 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.090
 this mediation a series that 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.439
 given when I more or less is in 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.780
 high school 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.189
 and that I already saw with me I ate balls and 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.230
 that's why this anime loves so much 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.180
 also have a good plot and I ruminated 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.189
 gotham hashish for me has made a 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.439
 excellence with drawings remind me 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.939
 a lot like and good has put me back to sit 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.099
 with me and they started watching this series 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.780
 We ate lunch or if we did not arrive from 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.609
 school running to see what I do not 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.650
 liked it was that the last part zangetsu 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.659
 He was late in arriving but we were not at 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.829
 final though you predict not to 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.319
 we will say because I do not want to ruin the 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.510
 series but if you like what is action 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.650
 and a little romance 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.480
 then without them I think that 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.260
 They also love that I think that for me 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.260
