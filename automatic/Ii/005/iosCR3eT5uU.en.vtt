00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
when i went to the polls pretty like I

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.020 
when i went to the polls pretty like I

was hot but when you know the feeling

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.220 
was hot but when you know the feeling
when<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.210> want<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.450> go<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> water<00:00:42.960> and
