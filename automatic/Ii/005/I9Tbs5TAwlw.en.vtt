that's pretty good hand if it had two

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.299 
that's pretty good hand if it had two
more<00:00:06.660> lands<00:00:06.960> in<00:00:07.080> it<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:09.139> don't<00:00:10.139> think<00:00:10.309> just

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
more lands in it I don't think just

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.999 
more lands in it I don't think just
going<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.519> do<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.759> it's<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.940> little<00:00:12.150> slow<00:00:12.389> I

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
going to do it it's a little slow I

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.499 
going to do it it's a little slow I
can't<00:00:14.009> hope<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.219> untap<00:00:14.639> on<00:00:14.820> turn<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.210> play<00:00:15.480> a

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
can't hope to untap on turn to play a

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.820 
can't hope to untap on turn to play a
bird<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.080> then<00:00:16.139> maybe<00:00:17.100> win<00:00:17.340> from<00:00:17.550> there<00:00:17.699> so

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
bird and then maybe win from there so

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:38.430 
bird and then maybe win from there so
that's<00:00:19.830> actually<00:00:20.189> much<00:00:20.279> better<00:00:20.539> so

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.540 

get<00:00:39.440> in<00:00:39.530> there<00:00:39.710> Navarro

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
and when vol is pretty good if he

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.729 
and when vol is pretty good if he
doesn't<00:00:49.160> have<00:00:49.840> cells<00:00:50.840> persecution<00:00:51.559> or<00:00:51.710> a

black

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.490 

fear<00:00:54.870> he<00:00:54.990> does<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.870> game<00:00:58.050> ended<00:00:58.320> before

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500

turning<00:03:48.170> on<00:03:48.379> its<00:03:48.530> hierarchs<00:03:48.980> is<00:03:49.099> really<00:03:49.310> that

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
turning on its hierarchs is really that

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.460 
turning on its hierarchs is really that
big<00:03:49.550> of<00:03:49.610> a<00:03:49.700> deal<00:03:49.849> but<00:03:50.780> i'm<00:03:50.900> pretty<00:03:51.050> sure<00:03:51.260> if<00:03:51.349> i

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
big of a deal but i'm pretty sure if i

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.190 
big of a deal but i'm pretty sure if i
