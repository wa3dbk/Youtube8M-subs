hey everyone this is e tech tour

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.090 
hey everyone this is e tech tour
bringing<00:00:03.840> you<00:00:03.990> another<00:00:04.110> look<00:00:04.470> at<00:00:04.620> assassin's

bringing you another look at assassin's

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.190 
bringing you another look at assassin's
creed<00:00:05.310> brotherhood<00:00:05.750> this<00:00:06.750> time<00:00:06.990> we're

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
creed brotherhood this time we're

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.129 
creed brotherhood this time we're
working<00:00:07.230> on<00:00:07.799> cluster<00:00:08.280> number<00:00:08.490> three<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.990> is

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
working on cluster number three this is

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.690 
working on cluster number three this is
another<00:00:10.349> one<00:00:10.559> that's<00:00:10.740> not<00:00:10.920> too<00:00:10.950> difficult<00:00:11.160> as

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
another one that's not too difficult as

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.910 
another one that's not too difficult as
long<00:00:11.849> as<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.120> know<00:00:12.300> what<00:00:12.480> you're<00:00:12.660> doing<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.290> we

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
long as you know what you're doing so we

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:25.640 
long as you know what you're doing so we
will<00:00:14.130> just<00:00:14.280> activate<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.000> puzzle<00:00:15.389> now<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:24.900> so

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
will just activate the puzzle now and so

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.070 
will just activate the puzzle now and so
this<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.430> you're<00:00:27.269> basically<00:00:27.720> doing<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
this one you're basically doing a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.659 
this one you're basically doing a
decoding<00:00:28.970> so<00:00:29.970> you'll<00:00:30.119> be<00:00:30.330> using<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.560> glyph<00:00:32.309> to

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
decoding so you'll be using a glyph to

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.150 
decoding so you'll be using a glyph to
match<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.719> some<00:00:34.230> correct<00:00:34.590> codes<00:00:34.860> after

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
match up some correct codes after

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.080 
match up some correct codes after
finding<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.820> coordinate<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.129> picture<00:00:38.129> so

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
finding a coordinate in the picture so

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.440 
finding a coordinate in the picture so
here<00:00:39.660> we<00:00:39.809> go<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.969> picture<00:00:42.329> that

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
here we go this is the the picture that

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.930 
here we go this is the the picture that
you're<00:00:42.600> kind<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.960> scanning<00:00:43.530> through<00:00:46.789> I've<00:00:47.789> got

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you're kind of scanning through I've got

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.270 
you're kind of scanning through I've got
a<00:00:47.969> few<00:00:48.239> different<00:00:48.270> things<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.829> spend

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280

a few different things now you can spend
some<00:00:50.430> time<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.329> around<00:00:51.449> scanning<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
some time and go around scanning and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.619 
some time and go around scanning and
find<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.489> bunch<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.789> cool<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.239> hidden

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
find a bunch of cool little hidden

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
find a bunch of cool little hidden
things<00:00:54.899> throughout<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> entire<00:00:55.890> picture

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
things throughout the entire picture

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.330 
things throughout the entire picture
like<00:00:57.350> it'll<00:00:58.350> give<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> different<00:00:58.770> text

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
like it'll give you different text

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.160 
like it'll give you different text
things<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.940> everything<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.660> around<00:01:00.870> here

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
things and everything going around here

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.630 
things and everything going around here
the<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:01.710> we're<00:01:01.890> looking<00:01:02.160> for<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.460> actually

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the one we're looking for is actually

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.740 
the one we're looking for is actually
right<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.260> assassins<00:01:05.090> flag<00:01:06.090> so

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
right here it's the assassins flag so

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.170 
right here it's the assassins flag so
you<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:06.990> hit<00:01:07.310> circle<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.640> gives<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.119> as

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
you just hit circle that gives you as

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.340 
you just hit circle that gives you as
you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.420> see<00:01:09.630> right<00:01:09.780> there<00:01:09.840> correct

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
you can see right there correct

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.710 
you can see right there correct
coordinates<00:01:10.619> found<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.549> now<00:01:12.060> basically<00:01:12.600> what

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
coordinates found and now basically what

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.130 
coordinates found and now basically what
you're<00:01:12.869> doing<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.320> matching<00:01:14.780> some<00:01:15.780> numbers

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
you're doing is matching some numbers

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.580 
you're doing is matching some numbers
and<00:01:16.970> digits<00:01:17.970> by<00:01:18.390> using<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.229> pin<00:01:19.409> wheel

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and digits by using the the pin wheel

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.480 
and digits by using the the pin wheel
here<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.790> basically<00:01:21.509> where<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:21.990> says<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:23.280> is

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
here so basically where it says this is

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.640 
here so basically where it says this is
I<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:23.970> hard<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.420> nine<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
I know it's hard to see nine is that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.830 
I know it's hard to see nine is that
weird<00:01:25.979> zero<00:01:26.310> with<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:28.229> line<00:01:28.560> through<00:01:28.979> it

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
weird zero with the the line through it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.990 
weird zero with the the line through it
basically<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.369> match<00:01:32.970> up

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
basically then you just have to match up

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.200 
basically then you just have to match up
the<00:01:33.509> pin<00:01:33.750> wheel<00:01:34.100> I've<00:01:35.100> already<00:01:35.369> done<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:35.759> we

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the pin wheel I've already done it so we

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.100 
the pin wheel I've already done it so we
know<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:38.880> will<00:01:39.119> actually<00:01:39.360> give<00:01:39.869> you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
know that that will actually give you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.100 
know that that will actually give you
the<00:01:41.780> weird<00:01:42.780> little<00:01:43.140> symbol<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:45.110> next

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the weird little symbol like this next

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.670 
the weird little symbol like this next
one<00:01:46.470> will<00:01:46.710> give<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.659> now<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.590> get

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
one will give you now this can get

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.929 
one will give you now this can get
confusing<00:01:50.130> because<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.670> make<00:01:50.820> sure

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
confusing because you have to make sure

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.120 
confusing because you have to make sure
you<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.420> zero<00:01:51.630> with<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:51.960> cross<00:01:52.770> across

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
you get the zero with the cross across

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.490 
you get the zero with the cross across
it<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> right<00:01:53.640> way<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.840> first<00:01:55.079> time<00:01:55.320> it's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
it the right way so the first time it's

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.649 
it the right way so the first time it's
the<00:01:55.619> right<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> left<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
the right going to the left and then the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.450 
the right going to the left and then the
next<00:01:57.960> one<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.439> left<00:01:58.649> going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> right

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
next one is the left going to the right

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.320 
next one is the left going to the right
and<00:01:59.759> then

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
and then

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:10.560 
and then
of<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:03.310> one<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:05.320> there<00:02:06.220> we<00:02:06.370> go<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:09.570> access

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
of this one and there we go so access

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.570 
of this one and there we go so access
granted<00:02:11.110> gives<00:02:11.590> you<00:02:11.740> some<00:02:11.890> more<00:02:12.040> text<00:02:12.490> that

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
granted gives you some more text that

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.640 
granted gives you some more text that
you<00:02:12.730> can<00:02:12.880> ring<00:02:13.060> either<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.990> you<00:02:17.380> got<00:02:17.530> another

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
you can ring either and you got another

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.870 
you can ring either and you got another
trust<00:02:18.100> problem

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
trust problem

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.630 
trust problem
so<00:02:19.240> saying<00:02:19.920> concession<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.070> small<00:02:21.340> piece<00:02:21.610> of

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
so saying concession the small piece of

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.460 
so saying concession the small piece of
sacrifice<00:02:22.300> for<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.600> greater<00:02:22.690> good<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.230> come
