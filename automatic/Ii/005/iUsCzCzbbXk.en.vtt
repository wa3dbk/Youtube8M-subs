00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
into that emphasis on creation I mean

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.000 
into that emphasis on creation I mean

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.690 
some of the Marvel games for example
it's<00:04:15.590> obviously<00:04:16.010> got<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.160> same<00:04:16.430> gameplay

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
it's obviously got the same gameplay

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.090 
it's obviously got the same gameplay
elements<00:04:17.270> but<00:04:17.660> it's<00:04:17.930> about<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.350> ratio<00:04:18.620> of

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100
