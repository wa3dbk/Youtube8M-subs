00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.720 
sure when the game was played 2001 2002
something<00:02:11.920> like<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:13.120> really<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:15.370> kind

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
something like that so really the kind

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.949 
something like that so really the kind
of<00:02:16.860> Bronze<00:02:17.860> Age<00:02:18.310> not<00:02:19.000> really<00:02:19.299> Stone<00:02:19.599> Age<00:02:19.810> but

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
Bronze Age of StarCraft I guess and if

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.080 
Bronze Age of StarCraft I guess and if
you<00:02:23.440> look<00:02:23.590> at<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.799> game<00:02:23.950> plan<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.609> a<00:02:24.730> p.m.<00:02:25.060> and

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
you look at the game plan to a p.m. and

you look at the game plan to a p.m. and
everything<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:26.230> game<00:02:26.349> has<00:02:26.410> evolved<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.069> much

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
everything the game has evolved so much

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
this is really the the dangerous part

blue one marine he's going for the tank
right<00:05:21.390> now<00:05:21.419> that's<00:05:21.750> what<00:05:21.870> he<00:05:22.080> should<00:05:22.110> have

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
right now that's what he should have

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.170 
right now that's what he should have
done<00:05:22.350> and<00:05:22.919> he<00:05:23.040> does<00:05:23.250> man<00:05:23.430> should<00:05:23.700> get<00:05:23.790> out<00:05:23.970> of

tank and this is important because the
killing<00:05:27.780> this<00:05:27.900> first<00:05:28.169> tank<00:05:28.410> will<00:05:28.590> slow<00:05:28.950> down

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
killing this first tank will slow down

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:14.089 
realized it did a smart move he built

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:16.329 
realized it did a smart move he built
that<00:06:14.620> engineering<00:06:15.620> they<00:06:15.740> very<00:06:15.949> close<00:06:16.189> to

that engineering they very close to
belongs<00:06:16.639> base<00:06:16.909> so<00:06:17.149> he<00:06:17.180> could<00:06:17.389> float<00:06:17.629> it<00:06:17.749> in

00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:17.839 
belongs base so he could float it in

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:19.540 
belongs base so he could float it in
immediately<00:06:18.139> and<00:06:18.559> get<00:06:18.649> that<00:06:18.830> quick<00:06:19.069> scouting

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
immediately and get that quick scouting

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.040 
immediately and get that quick scouting
and<00:06:19.699> information<00:06:20.509> that<00:06:20.599> you<00:06:20.749> so<00:06:20.960> much<00:06:21.139> needs

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
and information that you so much needs

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.570 
and information that you so much needs
so<00:06:24.050> good<00:06:24.199> move<00:06:24.349> from<00:06:24.499> him<00:06:24.649> there<00:06:24.830> I<00:06:25.009> believe

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
so good move from him there I believe

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.689 
so good move from him there I believe
you<00:06:25.879> know<00:06:25.999> we're<00:06:26.449> just<00:06:26.599> gonna<00:06:26.719> see<00:06:26.930> a<00:06:26.960> normal

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:27.699 
you know we're just gonna see a normal

you know we're just gonna see a normal
turret<00:06:28.699> push<00:06:29.569> with<00:06:29.779> the<00:06:29.899> tanks<00:06:30.259> just<00:06:30.860> moving

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159 
turret push with the tanks just moving

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:34.179 
turret push with the tanks just moving
turrets<00:06:31.520> and<00:06:31.729> moving<00:06:32.270> in<00:06:32.419> and<00:06:32.949> this<00:06:33.949> is<00:06:34.069> the

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:34.189 
turrets and moving in and this is the

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:36.790 
turrets and moving in and this is the
good<00:06:34.339> thing<00:06:35.149> in<00:06:35.300> a<00:06:35.389> way<00:06:35.419> for<00:06:35.870> a<00:06:35.899> girl<00:06:36.319> who<00:06:36.559> can't

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
good thing in a way for a girl who can't

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.320 
good thing in a way for a girl who can't
defend<00:06:36.889> his<00:06:37.219> base<00:06:37.370> easily<00:06:37.610> there's<00:06:38.029> only<00:06:38.180> this

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
defend his base easily there's only this

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.480 
defend his base easily there's only this
one<00:06:38.389> ramp<00:06:38.719> but<00:06:38.869> then<00:06:39.409> again<00:06:39.529> if<00:06:39.830> I<00:06:39.949> understand

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
one ramp but then again if I understand

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.779 
one ramp but then again if I understand
this<00:06:40.550> map<00:06:40.759> well<00:06:41.270> and<00:06:41.569> and<00:06:42.439> I<00:06:42.639> understood<00:06:43.639> you

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
this map well and and I understood you

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.909 
this map well and and I understood you
know<00:06:43.849> how<00:06:44.089> it's<00:06:44.479> built<00:06:44.689> it's<00:06:45.139> probably<00:06:45.800> gonna

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 
know how it's built it's probably gonna

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:49.179 
know how it's built it's probably gonna
also<00:06:46.249> be<00:06:46.430> a<00:06:46.689> big<00:06:47.689> problem<00:06:47.959> for<00:06:48.289> him<00:06:48.409> because

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:49.189 
also be a big problem for him because

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:51.489 
also be a big problem for him because
then<00:06:49.370> he<00:06:49.550> can<00:06:49.759> simply<00:06:50.419> get<00:06:50.719> sealed<00:06:51.050> in<00:06:51.259> by

00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:51.499 
then he can simply get sealed in by

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:54.100 
then he can simply get sealed in by
boxer<00:06:51.979> and<00:06:52.129> boxer<00:06:52.909> can<00:06:53.059> just<00:06:53.270> look<00:06:53.449> to<00:06:53.659> bring

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
boxer and boxer can just look to bring

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.619 
boxer and boxer can just look to bring
in<00:06:54.259> so<00:06:54.529> many<00:06:54.680> tanks<00:06:55.129> that<00:06:55.699> Ghulam<00:06:56.330> will<00:06:56.509> not

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:56.629 
in so many tanks that Ghulam will not

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:00.759 
in so many tanks that Ghulam will not
have<00:06:56.809> a<00:06:56.839> chance<00:06:57.169> you<00:06:58.659> know<00:06:59.659> anytime<00:07:00.229> soon<00:07:00.620> to

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:00.769 
have a chance you know anytime soon to

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:03.189 
have a chance you know anytime soon to
get<00:07:00.919> out<00:07:01.069> of<00:07:01.189> there<00:07:01.370> and<00:07:01.639> to<00:07:02.449> expand<00:07:02.839> anywhere

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 
get out of there and to expand anywhere

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.860 
get out of there and to expand anywhere
else<00:07:03.349> and<00:07:03.559> Ghulam<00:07:04.219> is<00:07:04.399> I<00:07:04.580> believe<00:07:04.939> looking<00:07:05.419> to

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
else and Ghulam is I believe looking to

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.980 
else and Ghulam is I believe looking to
go<00:07:06.800> past<00:07:07.159> these<00:07:07.459> these<00:07:08.180> troops<00:07:08.509> maybe<00:07:08.719> attack
