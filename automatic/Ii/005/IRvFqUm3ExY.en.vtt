00:00:15.575 --> 00:00:17.575
 Hello dear friends with you again I - Slava Ivanov and my channel Ps3 with Slava. 

00:00:17.575 --> 00:00:18.075
 And today I will talk about the anti-crisis solution and answer your questions. 

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:20.976
 And if you watch this video to the end, then I will tell you how to win 200 rubles 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.860
 So about the anti-crisis solution 

00:00:29.314 --> 00:00:31.314
 In connection with the financial situation in the country 

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.015
 and higher prices for games 

00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:37.075
 They are not available for everyone. 

00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:39.334
 And what do we do in this situation 

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:42.394
 The easiest 

00:00:43.354 --> 00:00:45.354
 This is to throw off the game with friends 

00:00:45.354 --> 00:00:45.854
 And then play with them one by one. 

00:00:48.374 --> 00:00:50.374
 Tag you can share discs 

00:00:50.374 --> 00:00:51.554
 which you have 

00:00:51.594 --> 00:00:53.594
 And you can subscribe to PS Plus 

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:57.654
 And you will have the opportunity to play 24 games a year. 

00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:05.494
 There are also sales and you can 

00:01:06.994 --> 00:01:08.994
 Buy good games for 100 rubles 

00:01:12.717 --> 00:01:14.717
 Follow the sales and you 

00:01:14.717 --> 00:01:15.217
 You can replenish your collection and save 

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.534
 You can also share your accounts. 

00:01:18.562 --> 00:01:20.562
 with games with your friends 

00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:24.235
 But I do not advise buying these accounts in the social. networks and sites 

00:01:25.354 --> 00:01:27.354
 sweeping it masheniki or thieves 

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:31.279
 Firstly, you may be left without money 

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:34.834
 And secondly, it will lower your karma 

00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:37.835
 How easy it is to find Ps3 owners 

00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:44.231
 Yes, very simple. Come for example in VKontakte 

00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:44.731
 Find popular Ps3 groups there 

00:01:48.854 --> 00:01:50.854
 go to group members, write your city there 

00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:54.154
 And look kt ovam more like 

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:56.615
 meet and start making friends 

00:01:58.308 --> 00:02:00.308
 And then exchange games and accounts with them. 

00:02:02.294 --> 00:02:04.294
 Also do not forget that in the collection of Ps3 

00:02:05.514 --> 00:02:07.514
 there are 7 free games 

00:02:10.914 --> 00:02:12.914
 They are not very good quality. 

00:02:12.914 --> 00:02:13.414
 But when there is nothing to play and you will be pleased with it. 

00:02:13.414 --> 00:02:15.274
 We now turn to questions 

00:02:16.534 --> 00:02:18.534
 User Sku Den asks which is better 

00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:20.594
 ps 3 \ xbox 360 \ ps4 / xbox one 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.790
 what can I say 

00:02:28.272 --> 00:02:30.272
 The choice is yours, but know what's on the console 

00:02:31.014 --> 00:02:33.014
 A new generation is still not enough games 

00:02:36.494 --> 00:02:38.494
 And the owners of the consoles themselves, too. 

00:02:39.815 --> 00:02:41.815
 In addition, the price of the console is still high 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:48.039
 Ps3 owners have the opportunity to play many games. 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.539
 The library has more than 4,000 games. 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.959
 Now about choosing between consoles of the old generation 

00:02:55.013 --> 00:02:57.013
 They are mainly distinguished by exclusives. 

00:02:57.013 --> 00:02:58.915
 The inside characteristics are the same. 

00:03:01.096 --> 00:03:03.096
 And when choosing, you should give preference to that console 

00:03:05.674 --> 00:03:07.674
 which is closer to you exclusives 

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.898
 If you want to flash your console 

00:03:11.898 --> 00:03:13.053
 To play pirated games 

00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:16.693
 It is better to choose Ps3 Slim 

00:03:17.988 --> 00:03:19.988
 It is more reliable and easier to flash. 

00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:23.038
 Now user Radmir Islamundil 

00:03:25.074 --> 00:03:27.074
 ask advise tv for ps3 

00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:30.574
 There are a lot of TV models right now. 

00:03:31.936 --> 00:03:33.936
 I advise you to contact the seller and 

00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:36.951
 take your console and literally connect it 

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:42.095
 to each TV .and on that body vizor 

00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:42.595
 On which a more acceptable image and take one 

00:03:43.674 --> 00:03:45.674
 If the seller is normal - he will not refuse you. 

00:03:48.692 --> 00:03:50.692
 The console itself issues a resolution of 1900 pi 

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.734
 And the picture is processed by the TV. 

00:03:58.515 --> 00:04:00.515
 User Artem Fireev, asks 

00:04:00.515 --> 00:04:01.015
 Do I need to clean the console from dust? 

00:04:04.835 --> 00:04:06.835
 Like any electrical device 

00:04:06.835 --> 00:04:07.335
 Console attracts dust 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.129
 Every two years, it is desirable to open 

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.834
 vacuum and change thermo paste 

00:04:15.076 --> 00:04:17.076
 If you are afraid yourself, it is better to turn to 

00:04:17.076 --> 00:04:18.287
 a specialist 

00:04:18.287 --> 00:04:19.834
 Artem Metelsky asks: which disk 

00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:20.334
 suitable for console Ps3 

00:04:20.334 --> 00:04:22.096
 and how to insert it 

00:04:22.213 --> 00:04:24.213
 If hard disk space is not enough 

00:04:24.213 --> 00:04:24.713
 many users change it to more roomy 

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:30.434
 This is very easy to do. 

00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:33.975
 Any Sata2 disk with a height not exceeding 9.5 mm will do. 

00:04:33.975 --> 00:04:34.475
 and at a speed of not more than 7500 rpm 

00:04:38.355 --> 00:04:40.355
 For this we take a flash drive or external drive 

00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:46.025
 copy all data (bad count in settings) 

00:04:47.294 --> 00:04:49.294
 which is on your console 

00:04:49.294 --> 00:04:50.734
 Before this, it is desirable to remove all unnecessary 

00:04:53.634 --> 00:04:55.634
 Pull out the old drive 

00:04:57.736 --> 00:04:59.736
 Insert a new one, format it 

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:01.454
 and insert a USB flash drive or hard drive with data 

00:05:01.673 --> 00:05:03.673
 And upload them to the console 

00:05:04.173 --> 00:05:06.173
 Depending on how many files you had 

00:05:06.173 --> 00:05:06.673
 unarchiving can take a whole day 

00:05:11.418 --> 00:05:13.418
 Still Ruslan Anbaritsky, asks 

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:15.713
 How can I display an image from Ps3 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.070
 If you want to take a screenshot or shoot a video 

00:05:22.634 --> 00:05:24.634
 from the game. You will need a capture card. 

00:05:24.634 --> 00:05:26.353
 It costs about: 4000 rubles 

00:05:29.176 --> 00:05:31.176
 Connect it and follow the instructions. 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:34.629
 User Mark Mikhailov asks 

00:05:37.114 --> 00:05:39.114
 Why can not I go to the Ps Store 

00:05:39.608 --> 00:05:41.608
 Recently, many users have complained of such a problem. 

00:05:44.293 --> 00:05:46.293
 This is due to the fact that the service every day 

00:05:46.293 --> 00:05:47.860
 subjected to hacker attacks 

00:05:54.233 --> 00:05:56.233
 Now there is a service where you can 

00:05:56.233 --> 00:05:56.733
 at any moment find out if the Store itself is working 

00:05:56.733 --> 00:05:57.600
 Reinstalling the Ps Store itself can help. 

00:06:02.494 --> 00:06:04.494
 If you urgently need to buy 

00:06:04.494 --> 00:06:05.855
 what a game and you're afraid to miss the sale 

00:06:13.171 --> 00:06:15.171
 then you can enter the Ps Store from a computer or your smartphone 

00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:16.953
 User Danil Tikhonov, asks 

00:06:16.953 --> 00:06:18.914
 How to watch movies from a flash drive 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.720
 Ps3 console plays almost all formats 

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:28.353
 But the fact is that she sees flash drives that are configured for FAT 32 

00:06:29.293 --> 00:06:31.293
 To console saw your flash drive 

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.933
 look at what file system it is set up 

00:06:33.933 --> 00:06:35.315
 and format it
