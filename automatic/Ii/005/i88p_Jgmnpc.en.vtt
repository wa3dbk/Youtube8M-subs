00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.299
 in this empty video I explain you 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.220
 Construction and function of the photo systems and 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.870
 thus the light-collecting fall 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.880
 a very important role in the framework 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.820
 the light reactions of photosynthesis 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.670
 first play a photo to build 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.840
 system consists of several hundred 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.510
 dye molecules and a central 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.460
 located proteins along the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.960
 ghanaer tagoe membranes of 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.570
 chloroplasts are located 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.820
 thereby forming chlorophyll and carotenoids 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.260
 Collect the light, drop a chlorophyll a 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.930
 and a protein make that up 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.910
 Reaction center for all chlorophyll 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.800
 and carotenoids are concerned 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.930
 light absorbing molecules 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.730
 that means when one ray of light 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.649
 certain wavelength and therefore with 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.750
 a certain energy on the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.090
 will meet a part of the pigments 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.800
 visible light absorbs them 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.350
 energy is from electrons of the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.000
 Dye molecules are not included 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.160
 absorbed wavelengths are 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.320
 however, reflects and gives the for 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.449
 us visible color of the segment and 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.180
 thus in sum the color of the whole 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.799
 leaf again briefly to the electrons 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.570
 because they play a central role 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.729
 in the light reactions of 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.920
 photosynthesis you have to be like that 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.409
 imagine that electron in short time 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.630
 if a higher energy level pass 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.880
 they are stimulated by the radiation 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.799
 This is mainly possible 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.720
 if so-called conjugated double 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.600
 bonds in the pigment molecules 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.490
 conjugated here means that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.619
 easy bindings and double 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.990
 bonds alternate as you here on 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.450
 chlorophyll and beta carotene 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.950
 Then the electrons can fall 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.869
 back in their low-energy 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.400
 be returned to the original state 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.189
 adjacent lower lying 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.950
 molecules stimulated here a lesser 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.960
 need stimulation energy in turn 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.869
 your electrons for a short time 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.009
 energetically raise 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.020
 thus is a continuous one 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.110
 energy transfer to the very bottom 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.090
 to the reaction center 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.590
 back to the photo system the incoming 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.840
 light from above first hits 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.390
 Carotenoids the uppermost layer of the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.060
 light-collecting trap these molecules are 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.860
 also antennae pigments called from view 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.690
 the photosystem is natural 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.120
 meaningful as broad a spectrum as possible 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.190
 the light energy and thus the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.890
 energetic to incoming wavelengths 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.370
 Reuse Molecules complement each other 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.600
 different absorption maxima 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.430
 Carotenoids are responsible for light 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.740
 to absorb in the yellow green area 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.450
 the wavelengths red blue area 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.370
 on the other hand, especially the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.230
 Use chlorophyll particularly well 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.970
 about the already mentioned electrons 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.640
 cascade gets a certain amount of energy 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.790
 amount down to the centrally located 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.070
 protein which as an electron 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.380
 accepts the central chlorophyll a 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.930
 so there's an electron on that 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.270
 protein and at the same time withdraw one 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.150
 neighboring electron donors like 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.490
 water an electron around its neutral 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.200
 to regain the charge state 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.900
 protein for its part are from the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.910
 chlorophyll a obtained electron to the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.280
 Rescue chain from principle 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.000
 one differentiates with the photosystems 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.140
 between 680 and p7 100 where the numbers 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.440
 just the wavelength of the 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.310
 excitation energy 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.920
 in summary, the function of the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.700
 photos systems easy in it 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.260
 physical energy of the light 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.090
 to detect radiation so 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.890
 catch it and put it to one 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.080
 rescue system 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.790
 Water molecules serve as 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.220
 electron donors so as 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.750
 Suppliers of electrons if you 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.070
 this video would have helped 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.030
 I write about a rating as well 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.680
 very happy 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.300
 Thank you for that and see you next 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.300
