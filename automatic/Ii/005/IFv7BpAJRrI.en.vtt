00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.680
 Professor Cecil B Heimerdingerin's diary 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.800
 Optimal weather conditions in Bandle 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.500
 Atmospheric pressure is ideal for today's experiment 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.440
 Tridinyumobilatör's 5th attempt to perform this evening 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.120
 Fine adjustment required 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.200
 Burnt my mustache 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.760
 I need to adjust the energy output capacity again 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.140
 Tridinyumobilatör still cannot maintain energy efficiency at the desired level 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.700
 I need more accounts 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.540
 In the meantime, I discovered something very interesting 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.040
 Back home after today's tests 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.640
 A sphere-shaped object 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.760
 I passed by a group of young yordlenin throwing at each other 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.960
 used a very simple concept 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.760
 the object is being thrown and the other one takes a yordelye (yordelye) and this process was repeated 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.920
 but the wrong calculation of the yordlilerinin gave many errors 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.620
 this object they call a ball is always the same 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.360
 and hit at the hit level and often fall 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.640
 there are many ways to improve this process 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.020
 based on my accounts and the data I collected from the participants of the action 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.360
 if the ball is overrun with a constant speed and curve 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.180
 an increase in the amount of entertainment by 44.75 percent (%) will be observed 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.080
 let me think about this evening 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.340
 I found it !! 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.640
 I designed a solution 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.660
 I invented the automatic ball shooter 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.560
 code name for now H28G 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.320
 consistently providing the same speed and route of departure 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.820
 counter 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.020
 if there are more than one yordle in the vicinity 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.800
 directing to the nearest 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.400
 ensuring that everyone can catch the ball in turn 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.920
 i will show my invention to young yordlelere 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.020
 in a 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.000
 I poured toxic acid on my shoes in the morning 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.000
 annoying 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.380
 today I tried the automatic shooter 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.000
 didn't go as planned 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.140
 young people welcomed my invention 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.920
 but it turned out to be overly powerful when I ran the machine 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.760
 when he was brought to the lowest setting, he knew the number of shots 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.520
 I obviously miscalculated the power used by young people in shooting 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.420
 after a while, I'm going to go back and make adjustments. 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.260
 but for now the priority is Tridinium 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.400
 have problems before lunch 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.780
 after making it desirable I have to test elsewhere 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.860
 the city of bandle is inadequate for field research 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.020
 apparently a giant into the city entered a very annoying anomaly 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.260
 noises outside my research 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.080
 should check the aquarium today 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.460
 hasn't heard the voice for a while 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.060
 strange 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.720
 I learned that many yordlans were injured because of the turmoil created by the giant 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.120
 if this job does not end within a short period of time, intervention will be necessary 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.080
 I hope H28G is not broken 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.720
 I will lose a lot of time 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.540
 still calm 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.140
 apparently devin came to his senses and ran away 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.300
 I need to pick up H28G after tomorrow gets more urgent 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.460
 I've almost perfected the tridinium 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.200
 this day 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.240
 someone stole my door 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.320
 I was really surprised 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.540
 the whole town was gathered in front of my house 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.940
 normally such crowds come to report their unrelated complaints about my work. 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.120
 but this time they were congratulating me 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.640
 what is interesting is that a young yordle 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.800
 found the prototype of H28G that I left behind and used it in a useful way 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.000
 invented my invention into a makeshift turret 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.300
 what is interesting is that it has become too strong to miss a huge giant 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.620
 well done smart bida 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.460
 I hope to work together with this young and creative dima 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.580
 i have big plans 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.860
 it can help me a lot 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.300
 but will have to leave bandle 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.980
 the depth of my plans need a larger trial space 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.040
 the whole of the world is sufficient
