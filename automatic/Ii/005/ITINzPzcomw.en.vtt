design<00:00:47.660> it's<00:00:48.660> been<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.050> look<00:00:49.200> at<00:00:49.380> designs

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
design it's been one to look at designs

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.340 
design it's been one to look at designs
and<00:00:50.100> see<00:00:50.250> how<00:00:50.400> can<00:00:50.579> make<00:00:50.730> them<00:00:50.850> better<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
and see how can make them better and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.540 
and see how can make them better and
when<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.380> got<00:00:52.560> my<00:00:52.650> helicopter<00:00:52.860> license<00:00:53.400> I

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
when I got my helicopter license I

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.030 
when I got my helicopter license I
realized<00:00:53.880> that<00:00:54.530> helicopter<00:00:55.530> has<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.680> design

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
realized that helicopter has a design

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.440 
realized that helicopter has a design
has<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> lot<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.670> improvements<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.210> need<00:00:57.270> to

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
has a lot of improvements that need to

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.810 
has a lot of improvements that need to
be<00:00:57.540> made<00:00:57.720> and<00:00:57.950> one<00:00:58.950> of<00:00:59.040> them<00:00:59.130> is<00:00:59.220> safety<00:00:59.460> and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
be made and one of them is safety and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.150 
be made and one of them is safety and
reliability<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:01.079> mean<00:01:01.620> they're<00:01:01.739> very<00:01:01.890> complex

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
reliability I mean they're very complex

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.719 
reliability I mean they're very complex
machines<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.619> yeah<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:04.829> my<00:01:04.949> goal<00:01:05.129> was<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.369> see

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
machines and yeah but my goal was to see

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.760 
machines and yeah but my goal was to see
where<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.420> could<00:01:06.540> strip<00:01:06.810> away<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.229> complexity

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
where we could strip away the complexity

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.200 
where we could strip away the complexity
and<00:01:07.799> increase<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> safety<00:01:08.819> and<00:01:08.999> that's

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
and increase the safety and that's

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.190 
and increase the safety and that's
basically<00:01:09.630> where<00:01:09.869> they<00:01:10.020> were<00:01:10.079> working<00:01:10.229> from

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
basically where they were working from

rota<00:02:32.460> strike<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.000> major<00:02:33.270> issue<00:02:33.510> in

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
rota strike is a major issue in

rota strike is a major issue in
helicopters<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.830> here<00:02:35.040> eliminates<00:02:35.520> rota

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
helicopters this here eliminates rota

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.130 
helicopters this here eliminates rota
strike<00:02:36.090> by<00:02:36.240> protecting<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> rail<00:02:36.990> and

is is in Harriman complex the hover bike
is<00:02:45.030> very<00:02:45.150> simple<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.110> from<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.160> complexity

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
is very simple so from the complexity
