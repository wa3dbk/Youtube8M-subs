at dog problems calm we use the clicker
for<00:00:34.579> training<00:00:35.540> tricks<00:00:35.870> we<00:00:36.110> do<00:00:36.230> not<00:00:36.500> use<00:00:36.710> the

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
behavior modification I feel that the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.610 
behavior modification I feel that the
clicker<00:00:41.510> is<00:00:41.840> actually<00:00:42.230> a<00:00:42.260> very<00:00:42.500> dangerous

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
clicker is actually a very dangerous

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.770 
clicker is actually a very dangerous
thing<00:00:43.190> because<00:00:43.610> it<00:00:43.970> undermines<00:00:44.420> the

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
thing because it undermines the

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.290 
thing because it undermines the

the dog hammer and the dog because it

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.540 
the dog hammer and the dog because it
encourages<00:00:50.329> a<00:00:50.720> relationship<00:00:51.440> based<00:00:52.280> on

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
encourages a relationship based on

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.520 
encourages a relationship based on
cookie<00:00:53.030> bribery<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:54.079> that<00:00:54.260> is<00:00:54.350> not<00:00:54.470> a

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
cookie bribery and that is not a

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.049 
cookie bribery and that is not a
positive<00:00:54.770> thing<00:00:55.100> it's<00:00:55.489> like<00:00:55.640> if<00:00:55.790> you<00:00:55.910> were

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
positive thing it's like if you were

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.750 
positive thing it's like if you were
trying<00:00:56.270> to<00:00:56.540> raise<00:00:57.140> your<00:00:57.290> kid<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:57.890> only<00:00:58.309> reward

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
him when he did something the right way

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.799 
him when he did something the right way
with<00:01:00.410> a<00:01:00.890> cookie<00:01:01.540> proponents<00:01:02.540> of<00:01:02.600> clicker

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
with a cookie proponents of clicker

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.509 
with a cookie proponents of clicker
training<00:01:03.079> say<00:01:03.380> that<00:01:03.590> clicker<00:01:03.800> training<00:01:04.070> is<00:01:04.309> or

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
training say that clicker training is or

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.520 
training say that clicker training is or
the<00:01:04.729> clicker<00:01:04.940> training<00:01:05.150> method<00:01:05.570> methodology

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
the clicker training method methodology

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.890 
the clicker training method methodology
I<00:01:06.710> should<00:01:06.920> say<00:01:07.100> is<00:01:07.729> better<00:01:08.540> than<00:01:08.750> traditional

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
I should say is better than traditional

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.070 
I should say is better than traditional
training<00:01:09.549> because<00:01:10.549> they<00:01:10.850> don't<00:01:11.000> use<00:01:11.240> fear<00:01:11.870> to

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
training because they don't use fear to

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.460 
training because they don't use fear to
to<00:01:13.010> to<00:01:13.880> punish<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.390> dog<00:01:14.570> they<00:01:14.960> don't<00:01:15.140> punish

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
to to punish the dog they don't punish

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.710 
to to punish the dog they don't punish
the<00:01:15.650> dog<00:01:15.799> at<00:01:15.950> all<00:01:16.070> well<00:01:16.760> we<00:01:17.060> don't<00:01:17.210> punish<00:01:17.510> the

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
the dog at all well we don't punish the

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.690 
the dog at all well we don't punish the
dog<00:01:17.840> either<00:01:18.020> we<00:01:18.260> correct<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.830> dog<00:01:19.070> lead<00:01:19.490> us

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
dog either we correct the dog lead us

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.190 
dog either we correct the dog lead us
something<00:01:20.000> wrong<00:01:20.150> and<00:01:20.390> then<00:01:20.780> we<00:01:20.900> give<00:01:21.049> them

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
something wrong and then we give them

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.680 
something wrong and then we give them
the<00:01:21.320> opportunity<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:22.610> do<00:01:22.729> it<00:01:22.850> again<00:01:23.119> now

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
the opportunity to do it again now

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.390 
the opportunity to do it again now
there's<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:24.020> difference<00:01:24.350> between<00:01:24.400> correcting

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
there's a difference between correcting

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.550 
there's a difference between correcting
someone<00:01:25.909> or<00:01:26.150> in<00:01:26.390> this<00:01:26.510> case<00:01:26.570> something<00:01:27.229> a<00:01:27.350> dog

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
someone or in this case something a dog

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.580 
someone or in this case something a dog
and<00:01:28.150> punishing<00:01:29.150> something<00:01:29.630> we<00:01:29.960> never<00:01:30.110> punish

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
and punishing something we never punish

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.770 
and punishing something we never punish
dogs<00:01:30.799> we<00:01:31.010> correct<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.610> dog<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.330> then<00:01:32.479> we<00:01:32.600> let

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
dogs we correct the dog and then we let

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.920 
dogs we correct the dog and then we let
him<00:01:33.400> try<00:01:34.400> to<00:01:34.460> behavior<00:01:34.820> again<00:01:35.119> if<00:01:35.360> he<00:01:35.630> makes

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
him try to behavior again if he makes

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.200 
him try to behavior again if he makes
the<00:01:36.140> right<00:01:36.260> decision<00:01:36.770> he<00:01:37.280> gets<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.610> praise<00:01:37.880> or

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
the right decision he gets the praise or

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.120 
the right decision he gets the praise or
the<00:01:38.299> positive<00:01:38.780> if<00:01:39.080> she<00:01:39.290> does<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.619> wrong<00:01:39.799> thing

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
the positive if she does the wrong thing

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.859 
the positive if she does the wrong thing
you<00:01:40.580> gets<00:01:40.760> a<00:01:40.880> correction<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.600> then<00:01:41.750> the

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
you gets a correction and then the

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.260 
you gets a correction and then the
opportunity<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.740> do<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:42.979> again<00:01:43.189> this<00:01:43.939> is<00:01:44.119> the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
opportunity to do it again this is the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.480 
opportunity to do it again this is the
way<00:01:44.390> mother<00:01:44.689> nature<00:01:44.810> works<00:01:45.350> if<00:01:46.040> we<00:01:46.100> throw<00:01:46.430> a

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
way mother nature works if we throw a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.969 
way mother nature works if we throw a
ball<00:01:46.670> into<00:01:46.970> a<00:01:47.060> rosebush<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:48.110> dog<00:01:48.350> might<00:01:48.680> jump

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
into the rosebush the first time maybe

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.050 
into the rosebush the first time maybe
the<00:01:50.840> second<00:01:51.200> time

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
the second time
