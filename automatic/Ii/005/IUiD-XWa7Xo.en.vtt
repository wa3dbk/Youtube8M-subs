something<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.659> actually<00:01:42.899> makes<00:01:43.409> sense<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
something that actually makes sense to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.370 
something that actually makes sense to
me<00:01:44.240> once<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:46.070> download<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.579> my<00:01:47.720> computer<00:01:48.720> so

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
me once I download it to my computer so

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.499 
me once I download it to my computer so
it<00:01:49.470> has<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:50.100> some<00:01:50.430> essentials<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.299> there

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
it has to have some essentials in there

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.539 
it has to have some essentials in there
so<00:01:52.200> at<00:01:52.640> least<00:01:53.640> put<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:55.200> champion<00:01:55.890> name<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
so at least put in the champion name the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.429 
so at least put in the champion name the
game<00:01:56.850> mode<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.420> that's<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.810> million<00:01:58.520> 5v5<00:01:59.520> 3v3

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
game mode so that's the million 5v5 3v3

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.350 
game mode so that's the million 5v5 3v3
something<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.340> can<00:02:02.490> also<00:02:02.700> add<00:02:03.060> if

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
something like that you can also add if

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.420 
something like that you can also add if
you're<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.750> skype<00:02:04.079> with<00:02:04.320> someone<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.250> say

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
that I know which game it is after I

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.470 
that I know which game it is after I
saved<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:15.090> my<00:02:15.239> hard<00:02:15.569> disk<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:17.430> next<00:02:17.670> up<00:02:17.879> you

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
saved it to my hard disk so next up you

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.660 
saved it to my hard disk so next up you
attach<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.200> an<00:02:19.560> email<00:02:19.650> which<00:02:20.280> should<00:02:20.519> be

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
attach it to an email which should be

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.550 
attach it to an email which should be
easy<00:02:20.939> enough<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.719> get<00:02:21.989> plenty<00:02:22.379> of

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
easy enough but I get plenty of

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.740 
easy enough but I get plenty of
questions<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:23.370> how<00:02:23.579> to<00:02:23.640> do<00:02:23.879> that<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.450> I'll

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
questions on how to do that so I'll

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.199 
questions on how to do that so I'll
describe<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.590> little<00:02:25.950> bit<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.519> this<00:02:26.939> case

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
describe that a little bit in this case

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.580 
describe that a little bit in this case
for<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.079> hotmail<00:02:28.790> mail<00:02:29.790> client<00:02:30.439> although<00:02:31.439> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
for the hotmail mail client although the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.429 
for the hotmail mail client although the
same<00:02:31.799> principle<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.549> true<00:02:32.819> for<00:02:33.439> virtually

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
same principle is true for virtually

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.589 
same principle is true for virtually
every<00:02:34.680> male<00:02:35.250> client<00:02:35.670> out<00:02:35.819> there<00:02:36.060> because<00:02:36.569> of

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
every male client out there because of

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.860 
every male client out there because of
standardization<00:02:37.409> it<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.909> very<00:02:39.180> simple<00:02:39.540> you

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
standardization it is very simple you

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.059 
standardization it is very simple you
just<00:02:40.489> create<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.519> new<00:02:41.760> email<00:02:41.969> and<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:43.590> see<00:02:43.799> the

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
just create a new email and you see the

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.910 
just create a new email and you see the
little<00:02:44.400> attach<00:02:44.879> icon<00:02:45.209> with<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.079> paperclip<00:02:46.650> it

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
little attach icon with the paperclip it

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.990 
little attach icon with the paperclip it
is<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.879> same<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.359> virtually<00:02:48.930> every<00:02:49.109> email

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
is the same in virtually every email

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.759 
is the same in virtually every email
program<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.870> shouldn't<00:02:52.200> be<00:02:52.260> too<00:02:52.439> hard<00:02:52.470> to

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
program so it shouldn't be too hard to

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.819 
program so it shouldn't be too hard to
find<00:02:52.889> and<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.849> click<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.530> after<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.620> click

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
find and you click that after you click

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.119 
find and you click that after you click
that<00:02:55.889> you<00:02:56.790> will<00:02:56.970> get<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.510> pop-up<00:02:57.930> window<00:02:58.439> which

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
that you will get a pop-up window which

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.080 
that you will get a pop-up window which
has<00:02:59.579> select<00:03:00.680> well<00:03:01.680> whatever<00:03:02.310> file<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.760> want

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
to attach you search on your harness for

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.509 
to attach you search on your harness for
the<00:03:06.150> replay<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:07.530> click<00:03:07.769> that<00:03:07.829> you<00:03:08.310> click

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
the replay and you click that you click

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.229 
the replay and you click that you click
OK<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.139> that's<00:03:10.139> it<00:03:10.349> you<00:03:10.919> now<00:03:11.340> attach<00:03:11.819> it<00:03:12.060> to
