00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.269
 so it was very quiet and was made of 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.900
 start a registration to this register 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.609
 approved very quickly and through 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.029

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.340

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.979
 really the way it was declared 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.280

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.190
 greater security without generally 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.899
