 larvae are insatiable 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.750
 a scout flies away so 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.750
 locate a source of fresh flesh

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.620
 these bees are a species imported to 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.490
 japan they were introduced during 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.170
 last century 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:30.030
 because they produce more honey 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.500
 and are less aggressive but like them 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.360
 did not evolve at the same time as 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.730
 giant hornets they did not develop 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.060
 no defense against his 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.060
 attackers 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.780
 the only thing she can do 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.780
 is to massage at the entrance to the hive 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.769
 once there they are ready to go 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.769
 beat to death 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.960
 the hornets are five times bigger than 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.650
 the bees is firmly decided to in 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.650
 kill as much as possible 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.510
 in silence the monsters and the 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.510
 attacks 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.379
 their courage seems very derisory and 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.400
 yet the bees refuse to 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.400
 to make or to flee 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.730
 certainly they will manage to kill one or 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.440
 hornets but no matter a hornet 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.830
 dead when so many others are well 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.100
 alive savoring the death of thousands 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.100

 carnage intensifies the outcome is 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:39.410
 predictable the end is near 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:39.410
 [Applause] 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.220
 in the space of a few hours twenty or 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.350
 thirty hornets are able to exterminate 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.459
