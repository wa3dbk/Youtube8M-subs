round<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.610> blue<00:01:27.330> route<00:01:27.540> which<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
round the blue route which is the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.160 
round the blue route which is the
easiest<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:30.060> group<00:01:30.270> kind<00:01:30.510> of<00:01:30.570> split<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.990> bit

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
easiest the group kind of split up a bit

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.140 
easiest the group kind of split up a bit
I<00:01:31.290> took<00:01:31.350> some<00:01:31.830> guys<00:01:32.010> around<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.880> bit<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.090> a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
I took some guys around a bit of a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.910 
I took some guys around a bit of a
gentler<00:01:33.540> route<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.900> was<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.530> still<00:01:34.800> good

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
gentler route it was it was still good

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.410 
gentler route it was it was still good
though<00:01:35.100> there's<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> lot<00:01:35.730> of<00:01:35.760> a<00:01:35.970> lot<00:01:36.330> of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
though there's like a lot of a lot of

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.230 
though there's like a lot of a lot of
berms<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.840> jumps<00:01:37.230> and<00:01:37.410> no<00:01:37.590> crashes<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.430> few

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
berms and jumps and no crashes and a few

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.060 
berms and jumps and no crashes and a few
close<00:01:39.450> calls<00:01:39.480> I<00:01:39.900> think<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.380> think<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:40.950> were
