00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.370 
and some construction and he's the trick
was<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.120> line<00:02:17.329> up<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.630> dowels<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.049> get<00:02:18.260> the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
was to line up the dowels and get the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.440 
was to line up the dowels and get the
doors<00:02:18.590> end<00:02:18.829> to<00:02:19.040> end<00:02:19.220> with<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.400> good<00:02:19.610> adhesive

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.580 

there's<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.510> pretty<00:02:24.750> simple<00:02:25.170> construction

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
there's a pretty simple construction

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.590 
there's a pretty simple construction
once<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.520> doors<00:02:26.700> were<00:02:26.850> put<00:02:27.030> on<00:02:27.180> den<00:02:27.360> and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
once the doors were put on den and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.240 
once the doors were put on den and
dabbled<00:02:27.930> together<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.470> top<00:02:28.650> was<00:02:28.920> skinned

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
dabbled together the top was skinned

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.670 
dabbled together the top was skinned
with<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.580> peg<00:02:29.970> board<00:02:30.000> then<00:02:30.930> was<00:02:31.110> covered<00:02:31.500> with<00:02:31.650> a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
with a peg board then was covered with a

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
green all-weather carpet the hard part

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.080 
green all-weather carpet the hard part
is<00:02:34.410> decorating<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.100> layout<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:35.640> make<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.910> look

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
is decorating the layout to make it look

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.910 
is decorating the layout to make it look
like<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.510> landscape<00:02:36.930> seat<00:02:37.350> something<00:02:37.830> I

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
like a landscape seat something I

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.320 
like a landscape seat something I
promised<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.490> would<00:02:38.640> never<00:02:38.670> do

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
promised I would never do

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.810 
promised I would never do
I<00:02:39.360> used<00:02:39.990> concrete<00:02:40.230> paint<00:02:40.820> certain

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
I used concrete paint certain

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.750 
I used concrete paint certain
accessories<00:02:42.330> from<00:02:42.780> train<00:02:43.200> layouts<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.520> put

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
accessories from train layouts and I put

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.199 
accessories from train layouts and I put
a<00:02:44.790> few<00:02:45.060> little<00:02:45.300> plastic<00:02:46.020> ladies<00:02:46.380> on<00:02:46.590> as<00:02:46.770> well

a few little plastic ladies on as well

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.580 
a few little plastic ladies on as well
because<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.360> track<00:02:48.600> was<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:48.780> big<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.350> had<00:02:49.500> to

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
because the track was so big I had to

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.990 
because the track was so big I had to
figure<00:02:49.890> out<00:02:50.010> what<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.280> do<00:02:50.400> with<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.640> furniture

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
figure out what to do with the furniture

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.430 
figure out what to do with the furniture
