00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
we'll probably do some more here as soon

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.599 
we'll probably do some more here as soon
as<00:02:36.470> he<00:02:36.560> calms<00:02:36.920> down

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609

managed I just don't I barely do
actually<00:03:08.629> I<00:03:08.690> probably<00:03:08.900> don't<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:10.450> do<00:03:11.450> my<00:03:11.810> best

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500
