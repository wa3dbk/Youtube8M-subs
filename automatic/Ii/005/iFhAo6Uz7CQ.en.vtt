product which is very very good the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.870 
product which is very very good the
problem<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.719> that<00:01:44.960> this<00:01:45.350> one<00:01:45.729> costs<00:01:46.729> about

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
problem is that this one costs about

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.289 
problem is that this one costs about
eight<00:01:47.630> pounds<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:48.829> if<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.460> purchase<00:01:49.939> it<00:01:50.060> in

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
eight pounds and if you purchase it in

eight pounds and if you purchase it in
Italy<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:50.840> costs<00:01:51.409> over<00:01:51.799> 12<00:01:52.549> euros<00:01:53.179> so<00:01:54.170> it's<00:01:54.380> not

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
Italy it costs over 12 euros so it's not

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.520 
Italy it costs over 12 euros so it's not
exactly<00:01:54.740> cheap<00:01:55.460> I<00:01:55.729> mean<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:56.210> lasts<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.869> quite<00:01:57.500> a

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
exactly cheap I mean it lasts a quite a

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.999 
exactly cheap I mean it lasts a quite a
long<00:01:57.890> time<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:59.470> it's<00:02:00.470> very<00:02:00.649> very<00:02:00.799> good

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
long time and it's very very good

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.749 
long time and it's very very good
because<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.670> scent<00:02:01.970> is<00:02:02.179> not<00:02:02.420> particularly

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
because the scent is not particularly

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.940

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
it so I'm keeping it about 15

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.420 
it so I'm keeping it about 15
centimeters<00:03:41.480> from<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.109> area<00:03:42.920> where<00:03:43.160> you<00:03:43.280> want

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
centimeters from the area where you want

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.759 
centimeters from the area where you want
to<00:03:43.609> use<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:44.389> leave<00:03:44.989> it<00:03:45.079> on<00:03:45.259> for<00:03:45.320> two

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
to use it you leave it on for two

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.530 
to use it you leave it on for two
minutes<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:46.459> then<00:03:46.519> base<00:03:46.940> you

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
minutes and then base you

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.339 
minutes and then base you
 off<00:03:47.900> the<00:03:48.829> difference<00:03:49.250> is<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:50.349> compared

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
 off the difference is that compared

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.520 
 off the difference is that compared
to<00:03:51.379> the<00:03:51.469> Koran<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:52.159> that<00:03:52.370> this<00:03:52.640> does<00:03:52.969> not

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
to the Koran is that this does not

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.610 
to the Koran is that this does not
deposit<00:03:54.530> any<00:03:54.769> kind<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.489> white<00:03:56.390> powder

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
deposit any kind of white powder

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.649 
deposit any kind of white powder
so<00:03:58.159> basically<00:03:58.430> totally<00:03:58.969> not<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.269> be<00:03:59.390> invisible

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
so basically totally not to be invisible

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.440 
so basically totally not to be invisible
and<00:04:00.170> also<00:04:00.530> is<00:04:00.650> much<00:04:00.859> lighter<00:04:01.280> compared<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.329> the

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
and also is much lighter compared to the

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.710 
and also is much lighter compared to the
Koran<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.799> only<00:04:04.010> thing<00:04:04.250> is<00:04:04.489> that<00:04:04.519> the<00:04:05.150> scent

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
Koran the only thing is that the scent

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.259 
Koran the only thing is that the scent
of<00:04:05.930> this<00:04:06.319> one<00:04:06.709> is<00:04:06.950> much<00:04:07.370> stronger<00:04:07.849> than<00:04:08.090> the

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
of this one is much stronger than the

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.649 
of this one is much stronger than the
Koran<00:04:08.840> luckily<00:04:09.230> once<00:04:10.099> you<00:04:10.670> basically<00:04:11.299> have

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
doesn't leave any residue in a sense

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.040 
doesn't leave any residue in a sense
that<00:04:46.099> it's<00:04:46.340> extremely<00:04:46.669> light<00:04:47.389> and<00:04:47.419> because

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050

hair<00:04:51.979> if<00:04:52.490> it<00:04:52.699> keeps<00:04:52.909> my<00:04:53.240> hair<00:04:53.810> light<00:04:54.169> is

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
hair if it keeps my hair light is

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.980 
hair if it keeps my hair light is
something<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:54.949> do<00:04:55.010> strongly<00:04:55.669> appreciate<00:04:56.360> and

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
something I do strongly appreciate and

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.740 
something I do strongly appreciate and
also<00:04:57.770> this<00:04:57.979> is<00:04:58.159> basically<00:04:58.699> have<00:04:59.030> more<00:04:59.599> than

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
also this is basically have more than

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.320 
also this is basically have more than
50%<00:05:00.169> cheaper<00:05:00.860> than<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.370> Quran<00:05:01.729> so<00:05:02.030> at<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.270> end

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
50% cheaper than the Quran so at the end

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.550 
50% cheaper than the Quran so at the end
of<00:05:02.510> the<00:05:02.599> day<00:05:02.780> who<00:05:03.199> cares<00:05:03.820> about<00:05:04.820> the<00:05:05.409> basic<00:05:06.409> the

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
of the day who cares about the basic the

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.230 
of the day who cares about the basic the
brand<00:05:06.889> I<00:05:07.099> mean<00:05:07.250> this<00:05:07.370> is<00:05:07.490> fundamentally

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
brand I mean this is fundamentally

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.390 
brand I mean this is fundamentally
L'Oreal<00:05:08.750> because<00:05:09.139> garni<00:05:09.590> is<00:05:09.710> manufactured<00:05:10.370> by

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
L'Oreal because garni is manufactured by

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.450 
L'Oreal because garni is manufactured by
L'Oreal<00:05:11.030> so<00:05:11.659> do<00:05:12.229> I<00:05:12.260> care<00:05:12.620> whether<00:05:12.889> it<00:05:13.190> is

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
L'Oreal so do I care whether it is

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.520 
L'Oreal so do I care whether it is
Lauria<00:05:14.330> whether<00:05:14.570> it<00:05:14.750> is<00:05:14.900> a<00:05:14.930> chlorine<00:05:15.260> or

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
Lauria whether it is a chlorine or

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.580 
Lauria whether it is a chlorine or
whether<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:15.860> is<00:05:16.010> a<00:05:16.419> Procter<00:05:17.419> &amp;<00:05:17.570> Gamble<00:05:18.050> no<00:05:18.349> as

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
whether it is a Procter &amp; Gamble no as

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.070 
whether it is a Procter &amp; Gamble no as
long<00:05:18.620> as<00:05:18.889> it<00:05:19.220> does<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.580> job<00:05:19.789> and<00:05:20.210> especially

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
long as it does the job and especially

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.810 
long as it does the job and especially
if<00:05:21.139> it<00:05:21.320> does<00:05:21.470> the<00:05:21.620> job<00:05:21.800> at<00:05:22.039> a<00:05:22.099> fraction<00:05:22.370> of<00:05:22.669> the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
if it does the job at a fraction of the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.649 
if it does the job at a fraction of the
price

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
price

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:25.510 
price
so<00:05:24.020> I<00:05:24.050> strongly<00:05:24.380> recommend<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:25.070> have<00:05:25.220> a<00:05:25.280> look

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
so I strongly recommend to have a look

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.020 
so I strongly recommend to have a look
