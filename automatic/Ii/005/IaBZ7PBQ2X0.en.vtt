00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.099
 very good to everyone again how is it 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.590
 you are welcome to the channel I am mickey 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.650
 good call of duty 4 all against all 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.900
 I was sixteen driver map many os 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.910
 you will ask why because the title 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.930
 of the video the title of the video thugs in 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.400
 the network of truth is that there could be 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.650
 been any other no or could it be 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.040
 to have been perfectly the bad one 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.480
 I'm behind my keyboard for example and 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.510
 it's something that really worries me 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.930
 a little bit and I would like to raise awareness 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.750
 a little bit about this topic 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.000
 nowadays we all move through networks 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.910
 social networks is already something very 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.760
 common in all of this this life already 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.130
 our environment and I find that there 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.660
 people that maybe seem a bit of what 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.570
 what is education or the meaning of 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.090
 that is ridiculous even borders on the absurd 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.280
 not many times is a small example 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.150
 maybe it's the lightest of all but 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.210
 good given a small example 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.160
 when some youtuber asia either 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.650
 anyone uploads a video because you always 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.030
 You can find a comment on the 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.190
 first person who sees the video the 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.320
 second the third that puts first and 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.810
 then you're at 15 or 20 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.540
 to 30 that recriminates him in that comment 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.619
 it does not make sense to the end of the day no 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.020
 has put nothing but first in the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.579
 disrespect to anyone has shown its 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.799
 illusion or your joy for being the first 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.659
 to comment a video that difference does not 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.640
 has done nothing wrong the bad that the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.530
 people who insult him who reproaches him 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.229
 put first disrespecting to 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.960
 times quite seriously as they are 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.560
 there is a point that is sometimes exceeded in 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.869
 this matter 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.079
 With this I want to go I want to go to 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.060
 of good throughout the day all as 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.579
 I said we entered tuenti on twitter 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.079
 facebook this type of networks in the 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.530
 which are very exposed 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:03.250
 exposed forgiveness to the rest of users not 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.929
 one way or another and there it is 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.630
 he also comes to see this kind of thing 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.230
 not harassment or cyberbullying or cyber 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.670
 bullying our lack of respect that 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.160
 Tell you beforehand what good 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.930
 As you all know, they all put your 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.760
 disposition a tool or several 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.670
 tools that is blocking 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.350
 another that is the one of the denunciation another that 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.600
 is to eliminate that kind of 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.459
 comments and I think that more than 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.720
 times get into the rag and give them you 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.870
 will impose the importance that neither 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.209
 they deserve we should use the fact to 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.010
 Sometimes receiving an insult from someone 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.140
 that all he's looking for is a little bit of 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.290
 protagonism then the simplest thing then 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.970
 is that not catch block delete and 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.260
 boy, you lose the time that I do not even 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.440
 is or I see be eyes that do not see heart 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.110
 he does not feel it is not that simple 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.320
 I really do not know how much I can 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.940
 worry more if the people who start 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:00.270
 is satisfied or the people who follow them 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.540
 the thread, I do not think that the best thing is 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.800
 the most interesting thing is ignorant we do not 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.840
 worry about those convenience we 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.480
 you complicate life, you ignore it 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.700
 directly and without, we have all 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.410
 received at some point some kind of 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.190
 message missing us about it 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.300
 threatening us and a thousand more stories if that 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.430
 sometimes he answers 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.860
 who then answers if you leave it 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.770
 ironing you have to do it right sometimes 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.210
 but good thing is that they do not tell me no 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.810
 they make me our time they do not deserve that 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.910
 time that was dedicated to answer him 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.710
 that person has created an account but 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.060
 and 25 minutes in which is an account to 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.190
 you lose 10 seconds in 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.150
 block it and you'll see that it makes up for it 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.070
 in terms of time and in terms of 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.070
 tranquility if by not entering that type 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.860
 of fights so that one does not pay 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.890
 absolutely for nothing 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.080
 what I said before for example in 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.160
 facebook tuenti twitter equal not so much 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.500
 but it's also done climb 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.510
 photographs we upload images and crave 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.870
 be ours with colleagues from 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.910
 beach party anything 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.320
 Well, we like to teach, do not be 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.090
 this type of images keep in mind 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.620
 one thing when the climb before anything 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.020
 when you have created that account you have 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.210
 accepted the terms that have letters 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.560
 little girls sometimes we do not read and it's 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:17.120
 that sometimes many many many times 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.930
 the content that we share in 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.210
 that network becomes the property of 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.240
 user before us and sometimes even 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.650
 with us we delete that material from the 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.600
 network they have their database 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.770
 even sometimes there may be something left 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.480
 is very careful with the kind of 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.570
 files that we upload because they can 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.580
 be available to third parties and 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.520
 which can manipulate at will 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:45.169
 You can use them for mounts 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.270
 of performances and so on that's a subject 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.620
 very very complicated sometimes and how good 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.880
 that at your disposal because you have the 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.950
 option to accept does not accept those 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.110
 terms at least there would be material for 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.350
 not give them that opportunity from that margin 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.700
 do not 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.680
 Really 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.390
 there are people who are dedicated solely to 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.880
 search for people photos or search for videos 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.590
 of people and make adaptations antÃ³n 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.390
 of mockery for example if it happens to you in 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.100
 youtube this can be done you can 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.550
 catch and there is a tool that is the 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.950
 denounce for reasons and can 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.690
 closing the channel can eliminate the 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.850
 video and I do not know if you can reach 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.280
 pretty much maybe yes but good as 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.870
 we all know today the subject of 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.430
 network is sometimes complicated to trace 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.470
 an account or an email account that 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.050
 the people then invent people believe 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:32.560
 for that occasion and that 's it but 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.690
 really even css you appreciate the 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.910
 effort of some to insult you because 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.340
 can be tactical reasons have you 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.170
 put there you have thought of me and so 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.670
 seen is an important part not in your 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.710
 lifetime 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:48.190
 regardless of that I think that 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.320
 than as a community in quotation marks that 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.870
 we are always able to be above 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.790
 we can not show that respect and 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.320
 I respect that passion is that sounds to us 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:00.120
 which are the games is always by 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.550
 not over and that makes us a little he 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.990
 in the image , I decided to look at the people 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.699
 that uploads to youtube the people that go up 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.710
 Youtube video games is respected 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:11.040
 them or the people who surf the internet 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:14.310
 in networks forgiveness comes out respects the 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.050
 rest not or when you're a user of 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.690
 something you always liked if I always 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.389
 you like that in that community it is 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.160
 with respect not but that you also 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.860
 you have to use that same respect 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.080
 towards others not 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.030
 Do not do to anyone what you do not 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.689
 like that you do that what really 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:35.110
 it's like this has no more trying to 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:36.730
 equal to all 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.980
 that there is always a little bit of good 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:42.620
 roll there is no need to try that 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.600
 to be seen or shown to be 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.000
 community or as people who are dedicated 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.940
 to a hobby because we are capable of 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.920
 perfectly respect both the taste of 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.590
 the others so much the opinions of the 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.300
 others without insulting without reaching 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.280
 threaten those messages that sometimes 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.320
 receive with threats that I already tell you are 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.140
 basically they are only in a probe after a 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.000
 other text because in the end no 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.550
 I think no one to waste time in going 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.850
 to look for that other someone and show him his 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:13.220
 displeasure in quotes face to face in 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.680
 the network is like that there is not much much 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.360
 bravery behind a keyboard and there's 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.550
 as much courage as cowardice to life 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.290
 creating so guys keep in mind 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.940
 that the important thing is the respect of 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.730
 agreement simply the scope for 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.290
 raise awareness of that a greeting to all 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.620
 See you in the next video and up 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.620
 then
