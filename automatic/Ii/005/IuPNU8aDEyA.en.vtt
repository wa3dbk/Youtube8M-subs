three<00:01:15.830> of<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.070> day<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:16.370> I<00:01:16.610> hope<00:01:16.940> you<00:01:17.000> heard

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
three of the day so I hope you heard

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.500 
three of the day so I hope you heard
about<00:01:17.240> that

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
about that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.600 
about that
I'm<00:01:18.350> definitely<00:01:18.740> not<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.250> I<00:01:19.280> think<00:01:19.370> we<00:01:19.490> get

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
I'm definitely not so I think we get

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.060 
I'm definitely not so I think we get
penalty<00:01:19.970> two<00:01:20.150> there<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.800> I'm<00:01:21.800> quite

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
penalty two there and I'm quite

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.410 
penalty two there and I'm quite
surprised<00:01:22.460> when<00:01:22.610> he<00:01:22.730> had<00:01:22.850> two<00:01:23.000> penalties

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
surprised when he had two penalties

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.899 
surprised when he had two penalties
considering<00:01:23.900> I<00:01:24.020> think<00:01:24.530> I've<00:01:24.650> seen<00:01:24.890> more<00:01:25.190> of<00:01:25.700> an

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
considering I think I've seen more of an

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.490 
considering I think I've seen more of an
apocalypse<00:01:26.330> in<00:01:26.510> this<00:01:26.659> race<00:01:26.870> than<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:27.170> have<00:01:27.320> seen

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
apocalypse in this race than I have seen

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.060 
apocalypse in this race than I have seen
in<00:01:27.740> most<00:01:28.430> apocalypse<00:01:28.970> movies<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:29.659> yeah<00:01:30.620> we're

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
in most apocalypse movies and yeah we're

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.060 
in most apocalypse movies and yeah we're
gonna<00:01:31.159> try<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:31.550> get<00:01:31.700> Vern<00:01:32.210> now<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:33.070> hopefully

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
gonna try and get Vern now and hopefully

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.649 
gonna try and get Vern now and hopefully
DNF<00:01:34.550> and<00:01:34.730> obviously<00:01:35.000> because<00:01:35.330> that's<00:01:35.450> the

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
DNF and obviously because that's the

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.960 
DNF and obviously because that's the
whole<00:01:35.780> point<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.200> this<00:01:36.409> series<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:37.040> look<00:01:37.880> at

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
whole point of this series and look at

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.460 
whole point of this series and look at
that<00:01:38.060> tally<00:01:38.330> in<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.510> top<00:01:38.720> left<00:01:38.930> corner<00:01:38.990> we<00:01:39.320> can

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
that tally in the top left corner we can

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.980 
that tally in the top left corner we can
see<00:01:39.620> we've<00:01:39.770> already<00:01:40.010> DNF<00:01:40.520> four<00:01:40.729> cars<00:01:40.940> so<00:01:41.750> we're

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
see we've already DNF four cars so we're

and then Verne goes past the one with
Magnussen<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.140> think<00:02:38.320> it<00:02:38.410> was<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.770> then<00:02:39.220> we

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
Magnussen I think it was and then we

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.490

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.750 
finished it yeah he finished so yeah six
cars<00:03:05.440> in<00:03:05.560> bad<00:03:05.770> you<00:03:06.070> can<00:03:06.190> see<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.370> bit<00:03:06.520> of<00:03:06.550> pattern

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
cars in bad you can see a bit of pattern

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.760 
cars in bad you can see a bit of pattern
emerging<00:03:07.270> because<00:03:07.420> we've<00:03:07.540> got<00:03:07.660> six<00:03:08.560> in

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
emerging because we've got six in

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.800 
emerging because we've got six in
Australia<00:03:09.400> nine<00:03:09.670> in<00:03:09.880> Malaysia<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.390> now<00:03:10.510> six

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
Australia nine in Malaysia and now six

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.690 
Australia nine in Malaysia and now six
in<00:03:10.960> Bahrain<00:03:11.320> so<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:12.010> might<00:03:12.160> get<00:03:12.340> nine<00:03:12.550> in

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
in Bahrain so you might get nine in

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.760 
in Bahrain so you might get nine in
China<00:03:12.940> if<00:03:13.210> we<00:03:13.510> do<00:03:13.660> that's<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.170> pattern<00:03:14.320> so<00:03:14.680> you

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
China if we do that's the pattern so you

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.250 
China if we do that's the pattern so you
maybe<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.400> can<00:03:15.520> guess<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.150> see<00:03:16.360> so

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
maybe you can guess that and see so

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.370 
maybe you can guess that and see so
that's<00:03:17.860> yeah<00:03:18.370> not<00:03:18.820> bad<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.270> mean<00:03:19.660> six<00:03:19.870> cars<00:03:20.110> is

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
that's yeah not bad I mean six cars is

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.500 
that's yeah not bad I mean six cars is
all<00:03:21.010> right<00:03:21.190> for<00:03:21.550> Bahrain<00:03:21.850> we<00:03:21.970> know<00:03:22.090> we<00:03:22.180> do<00:03:22.300> I

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
all right for Bahrain we know we do I

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.210 
all right for Bahrain we know we do I
think<00:03:22.750> in<00:03:23.080> previous<00:03:23.440> seasons<00:03:23.800> of<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.190> series

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
think in previous seasons of the series

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.260 
think in previous seasons of the series
we've<00:03:24.580> actually<00:03:24.700> doing<00:03:24.940> pretty<00:03:25.090> well<00:03:25.150> in

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
we've actually doing pretty well in

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.570 
we've actually doing pretty well in
Bahrain<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:26.050> don't<00:03:26.650> know<00:03:26.710> not<00:03:26.950> slim<00:03:27.460> to

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
Bahrain so I don't know not slim to

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.190 
Bahrain so I don't know not slim to
compare<00:03:27.850> it<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:27.970> but<00:03:28.210> we<00:03:28.420> can<00:03:28.570> see<00:03:28.780> how<00:03:28.930> we<00:03:28.990> do

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
compare it to but we can see how we do

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.830 
compare it to but we can see how we do
