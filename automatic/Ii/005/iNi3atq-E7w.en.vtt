00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.250
 and it must sound 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.690

 and maybe one or the other feels like getting out without a guitar 

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:33.309
 important to mention for 200 euros approximately in the UK I think so 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:35.949
 almost unbeatable in the market 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.460
 this price performance comparison so come 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.030
 or as I said, but it's a bit of fun to do that 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.210
 I'll be back soon
