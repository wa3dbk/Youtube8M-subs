00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.090
 video when a car is going to try to 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.770
 getting away from you is going to leave a 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.200
 petrol trail no more have to 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.319
 shoot him and then the car will explode and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.800
 all not in the third good the third 

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:19.940

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.040
 six enemies with one shot in the head 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.800
 guys are going to notice that every time 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.640
 kill someone if they give you exactly the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.370
 head will come out like an X in 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.390
 red and then that means you have been 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.150
 given a sixth and fourth and last that 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.510
 they need to have accurate shooting 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.280
 minimum of 70% so they will not be 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.720
 like crazy shooting on either side 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.090
 and then let's start the action 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.020
 boys here cut the scene 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.939
 and then let's cover ourselves with 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.140
 our gun we are going to grab first 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.490
 we cover ourselves with gravel and then as you 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.170
 I say boys I do not know what they are about 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.719
 hit the head since we want 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.910
 get one of the requirements that is 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:11.299
 kill six assholes in the head 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.590
 here quiet boys 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.209
 once they have gone down to two or three 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.260
 people boys go running to 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.640
 this side of the orange truck and then 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.670
 they will calmly leave him 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.519
 these eggs -1 here quiet there they go to 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.379
 see another caught me what one under 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.319
 is on the second floor and there is another one in the 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.939
 third floor so with that and you 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.500
 boys are going to be able to get the 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.659
 requirement that is to have killed six 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.439
 people in the head here is the 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.560
 next requirement that is to shoot at 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:45.380
 good gasoline the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.720
 it's good that he claims to have the trail of 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.910
 the gas 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.860
 there they go down this boy egg and 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.110
 quickly so as not to waste time and 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.420
 take out the other requirement that is to do it 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.840
 in less than 6 minutes with 30 is to go 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.110
 running and boys very, very, very, very 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.120
 important when the 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.980
 motorcyclist and try to give him no 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.770
 matter whether in the head or chest 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.670
 but try to kill him because if you guys 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.890
 they let him run because they are going to lose 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.230
 a lot of time and they will not be able to fulfill the 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.090
 requirement that is to do it in less than 6 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.580
 30 minutes 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.470
 another very important data boys the 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.349
 scenes that appear here for example 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.530
 at the beginning they appear franklin speaking 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:32.600
 with his boss that I cut him 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:37.480
 the scenes that appear 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:41.180
 in all missions they count as that is 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.870
 those scenes the seconds that happen all 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.580
 that adds up to the total time that you 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.300
 You'll do the legwork so try 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.490
 issue it with the X and so they are going to 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.100
 save more time 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.130
 other data boys also good already 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.230
 we have fulfilled the requirements we have 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.990
 fulfilled the time since I have done it 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.400
 okay fast if bad at the end they will see 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.760
 this 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.439
 in the results, shoot at the expense of 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.220
 gas already we did already saw in the 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:15.349
 part where I got off these assholes that 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.120
 they were escaping in the blue car and 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:21.010
 kill six enemies in the head already 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.410
 is and well I hope you got the 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.570
 the minimum shot accuracy of 70 per 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.470
 cent is very easy boys the 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.060
 first missions but later 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.910
 I really advise you to try 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.140
 practice a lot since the missions more 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.300
 forward they will be more but more 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.790
 difficult and then here were boys 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.760
 we have met all the requirements 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.550
 I hope you liked this this 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.230
 gameplay and do not forget to see the next 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.330
