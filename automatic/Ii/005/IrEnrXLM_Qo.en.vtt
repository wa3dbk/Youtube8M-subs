00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and I just need to make it worth it to

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.249 
and I just need to make it worth it to
me<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:06.030> course<00:02:06.090> for<00:02:06.420> my<00:02:06.509> team<00:02:06.689> because<00:02:06.840> i

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
me and of course for my team because i

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.089 
me and of course for my team because i
really<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:08.489> i<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:09.030> love<00:02:09.179> them<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.899> lot<00:02:10.830> of

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
really like i really love them a lot of

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.100 
really like i really love them a lot of
people<00:02:11.220> were<00:02:11.760> saying<00:02:12.120> there's

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
people were saying there's

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.210 
people were saying there's
perhaps<00:02:13.290> part<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.650> reason<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.070> guys

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
perhaps part of the reason that you guys

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.890 
perhaps part of the reason that you guys
dropped<00:02:14.490> off<00:02:14.640> was<00:02:15.000> because<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.690> coach

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
dropped off was because of the coach

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.990 
dropped off was because of the coach
swap<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.530> middle<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.860> season<00:02:17.010> how

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
swap in the middle of the season how

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.530 
swap in the middle of the season how
much<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.210> Sammy<00:02:18.960> departing<00:02:19.470> was<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.420> factor<00:02:21.420> in

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
much of Sammy departing was a factor in

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.000 
much of Sammy departing was a factor in
like<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.930> dip<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.500> guys<00:02:22.650> saw<00:02:22.830> at<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
like the dip that you guys saw at the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.320 
like the dip that you guys saw at the
end<00:02:23.810> um<00:02:26.570> it's<00:02:27.570> really<00:02:27.720> hard<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.200> say<00:02:28.440> because

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
end um it's really hard to say because

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.550 
end um it's really hard to say because
everything<00:02:30.330> intangible<00:02:30.960> like<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.350> is

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
everything intangible like that is

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.970 
everything intangible like that is
really<00:02:31.830> hard<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.100> say<00:02:32.340> any<00:02:32.580> kind<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.910> influence

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
really hard to say any kind of influence

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.790 
really hard to say any kind of influence
you<00:02:34.980> can't<00:02:35.280> really<00:02:35.840> tell<00:02:36.840> because<00:02:37.320> there's<00:02:37.650> no

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
you can't really tell because there's no

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.790 
you can't really tell because there's no
like<00:02:38.520> definitive<00:02:39.060> number<00:02:39.420> or<00:02:39.600> anything<00:02:39.780> but<00:02:40.560> I

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
like definitive number or anything but I

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.920 
like definitive number or anything but I
think<00:02:42.110> how<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.170> do<00:02:44.209> at<00:02:45.209> least<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.480> decent<00:02:45.660> amount

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
think how to do at least a decent amount

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.800 
think how to do at least a decent amount
with<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.500> because<00:02:46.860> because<00:02:47.420> without<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.600> like<00:02:48.780> a

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
with it because because without a like a

was<00:03:33.090> never<00:03:34.549> expressed<00:03:35.549> but<00:03:35.820> I<00:03:35.880> feel<00:03:36.150> like<00:03:36.180> our

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
was never expressed but I feel like our

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.830 
was never expressed but I feel like our
scrims<00:03:37.850> we're<00:03:38.850> being<00:03:39.060> taken<00:03:39.480> as<00:03:39.630> seriously

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
scrims we're being taken as seriously

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.690 
scrims we're being taken as seriously
it's<00:03:40.440> kind<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.680> hard<00:03:40.890> it's<00:03:41.010> kind<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.400> hard<00:03:41.610> to

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
it's kind of hard it's kind of hard to

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.180 
it's kind of hard it's kind of hard to
say<00:03:42.290> maybe<00:03:43.290> it's<00:03:43.500> just<00:03:43.560> maybe<00:03:43.890> I'm<00:03:44.070> just

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
say maybe it's just maybe I'm just

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.940 
say maybe it's just maybe I'm just
imagining<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.790> but<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.000> felt<00:03:45.840> like<00:03:45.930> we<00:03:46.799> weren't

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
imagining it but I felt like we weren't

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.710 
imagining it but I felt like we weren't
getting<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.340> most<00:03:47.519> out<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.820> scrims<00:03:48.209> yeah<00:03:48.600> we

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
getting the most out of scrims yeah we

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.670 
getting the most out of scrims yeah we
were<00:03:48.810> practicing<00:03:49.110> new<00:03:49.290> stuff<00:03:49.500> we<00:03:49.620> were

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
were practicing new stuff we were

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.960 
were practicing new stuff we were
practicing<00:03:51.230> comm<00:03:52.230> set<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:53.220> team<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.700> broken

truck<00:03:54.120> could<00:03:54.269> both<00:03:54.480> agree<00:03:54.570> on<00:03:54.750> but<00:03:55.019> I<00:03:55.080> feel

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
truck could both agree on but I feel

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.660 
truck could both agree on but I feel
like<00:03:57.140> you<00:03:58.140> know<00:03:58.260> win<00:03:58.650> or<00:03:58.680> lose<00:03:58.799> after<00:03:59.280> any

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
like you know win or lose after any

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.420 
like you know win or lose after any
scrim<00:04:00.090> we<00:04:00.930> weren't<00:04:01.140> getting<00:04:01.440> much<00:04:01.860> out<00:04:02.070> of<00:04:02.130> it

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
scrim we weren't getting much out of it

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.970 
scrim we weren't getting much out of it
it's<00:04:02.760> kind<00:04:02.910> of<00:04:03.140> awkward<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:06.080> as<00:04:07.080> so<00:04:07.350> as<00:04:07.799> you

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
it's kind of awkward and as so as you

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.949 
it's kind of awkward and as so as you

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
mean like I felt I felt we were like

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.490 
mean like I felt I felt we were like
almost<00:04:51.060> world-class<00:04:51.600> team<00:04:52.050> in<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:52.320> first

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
almost world-class team in the first

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.070 
almost world-class team in the first
like<00:04:52.800> three<00:04:53.280> like<00:04:54.150> when<00:04:54.330> healers<00:04:54.660> came<00:04:54.810> in<00:04:54.930> and

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
like three like when healers came in and

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.360 
like three like when healers came in and
we<00:04:55.170> played<00:04:55.320> for<00:04:55.470> that<00:04:55.590> first<00:04:55.950> weekend<00:04:56.250> with

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
we played for that first weekend with

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.150 
we played for that first weekend with
Helios<00:04:56.640> I<00:04:56.820> felt<00:04:57.060> like<00:04:57.420> we<00:04:57.600> drew<00:04:57.780> effort<00:04:58.230> it<00:04:59.010> was

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
Helios I felt like we drew effort it was

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.560 
Helios I felt like we drew effort it was
like<00:04:59.310> an<00:04:59.430> amazing<00:04:59.670> feeling<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.270> I<00:05:00.390> just

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
like an amazing feeling and I just

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.730 
like an amazing feeling and I just
really<00:05:00.780> want<00:05:00.930> to<00:05:00.960> get<00:05:01.080> there<00:05:01.290> and<00:05:01.440> I<00:05:01.470> think<00:05:01.680> if

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
really want to get there and I think if

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.740 
really want to get there and I think if
we<00:05:01.830> can<00:05:01.950> bear<00:05:02.220> realistically<00:05:02.790> we<00:05:02.970> can<00:05:03.120> easily

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
we can bear realistically we can easily

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.260 
we can bear realistically we can easily
get<00:05:04.080> two<00:05:04.170> worlds<00:05:04.530> like<00:05:04.680> ninety<00:05:05.070> percent<00:05:05.270> but

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
get two worlds like ninety percent but

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.050 
get two worlds like ninety percent but
right<00:05:06.390> now<00:05:06.800> say<00:05:07.800> we<00:05:07.920> don't<00:05:08.010> find<00:05:08.220> a<00:05:08.280> way<00:05:08.400> part

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
right now say we don't find a way part

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.340 
right now say we don't find a way part
of<00:05:09.120> like<00:05:09.210> ten<00:05:09.360> percent<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:09.810> know<00:05:09.840> just<00:05:10.170> kind

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
of like ten percent you know just kind

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.730 
of like ten percent you know just kind
of<00:05:10.380> flipped<00:05:10.560> it<00:05:10.680> around<00:05:10.740> so<00:05:12.110> it<00:05:13.110> just<00:05:13.440> depends

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
of flipped it around so it just depends

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.170 
of flipped it around so it just depends
if<00:05:13.890> we<00:05:13.980> can<00:05:14.100> get<00:05:14.220> through<00:05:14.430> this<00:05:14.820> you<00:05:15.090> know<00:05:17.180> kind

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
if we can get through this you know kind

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.050 
if we can get through this you know kind
of<00:05:18.240> downfall<00:05:19.040> what<00:05:20.040> does<00:05:20.160> that<00:05:20.310> look<00:05:20.520> like<00:05:20.580> for
