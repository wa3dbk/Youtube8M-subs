00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
guessing that's just all the DLC that

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.399 
guessing that's just all the DLC that
came<00:00:59.850> with<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.290> can

see it's also compatible with the
PlayStation<00:01:09.240> Move<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.439> don't<00:01:10.740> have<00:01:10.890> that
