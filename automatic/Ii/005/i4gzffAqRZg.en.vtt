 also one of the surprises of the event was the presence of more rooms and 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.770
 through a live videoconference from japan 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.770
 nothing less than the producer and maximum responsible for the creation of villa de 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.660
 leyva who showed us some of the challenges that the development team 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.660
 has faced when producing the game 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.160
 perfect 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 thus 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.120
 As you already know about previous advances miller lite is an action game that 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.170
 puts us in the skin of pig or water 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.990
 a young man already belonging to a special elite force and who will have 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.259
 mission to save the city of Tokyo from destruction after it has 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.909
 been invaded by an entire army of terrifying mutant creatures 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.310
 being the gameplay very similar to the view in the framework of the meeting allen 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.420
 although also taking some other elements of great games like those of 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.420
 the rooms when bon jovi minister 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.529
 ee 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.529
 d these 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.299
 during the course of the act there was the star 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.209
 the doctor x then presented was kind enough to answer some of 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.209
 our questions about who speaks 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:45.809
 why would you recommend millán the ida the users x the 3 60 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.839
 the newly admitted 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:52.839
 but there was a farm 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.329
 envy of greatness and new jersey jon otegi 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.859
 He reiterated that the most important thing in a mess is that you shit 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.649
 I played the charges really well 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:03.249
 back home has meant on web 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.249
 and that's what we experienced here when we put dissolve 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:10.009
 that not only collects the best from me 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.019
 the genders but that life a very efficient way of risk 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.829
 therefore I believe that all users 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:18.979
 engage 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:20.929
 I understood that need to play again 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:22.809
 because you're left wanting more 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.809
 that's what makes it worthy 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:31.919
 can you tell us about the guilt of the internet 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.919
 I do not think so 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:36.729
 another person 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.229
 that collects the fruits 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:41.279
 when are you going to lose 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.649
 which includes excluded 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:45.629
 the autobots 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.289
 things of the humble neighborhood 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:51.279
 some moments we have between sides 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:54.489
 here in civilian jumping from one side to another 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.939
 so I was very inspired by the m 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.939
 the pp is therefore I protect 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.899
 and well done 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:04.179

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:06.839
 per cent what they have done with 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:09.129
 Betxí wave makes it so spectacular 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.889
 are incorporated not only end objectives innocent facets will affect 4 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:14.790
 4 5 g 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.229
 it is a disgrace after the transaction 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.620
 each of them is the 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.629
 immediately one of you speaks to us 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.469
 the development of the works 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:26.489
 there will be times when I have to pick up machine guns points of what 

00:04:26.489 --> 00:04:27.240
 expected

 you are waiting for a fight with qatar as well as 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.969
 certainly of the regime among others firing a machine gun considered 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.800
 but I think it should also be noted that as never told montero to 

00:04:38.799 --> 00:04:41.799
 thematic for all 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.879
 with these players they buy less have 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.879
 smoker does not remove an iota of its gameplay 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.909
 without data you would highlight the technical realization of the game 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.110
 Well, something that lives a lot of people do not know 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.599

 mexico a pine 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.740
 chile has been 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.460
 so that they participate without big soundtracks like 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.710
 There was a very famous hotel 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.700

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:28.460
