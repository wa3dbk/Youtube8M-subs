this map is very interesting i'm sure by

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.209 
this map is very interesting i'm sure by
now<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:49.320> all<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.129> actually

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
now you all know that you can actually

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.490 
now you all know that you can actually
see<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:51.000> hijacked<00:00:51.570> boat<00:00:51.809> off<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.050> coast<00:00:52.199> of

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
see the hijacked boat off the coast of

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.750 
see the hijacked boat off the coast of
this<00:00:52.620> map<00:00:52.860> which<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.219> pretty<00:00:53.340> neat<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
this map which is pretty neat and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.580 
this map which is pretty neat and
visually<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.510> think<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.870> map<00:00:55.079> looks<00:00:55.320> great

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
visually I think this map looks great

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.410 
visually I think this map looks great
but<00:00:56.039> gameplay<00:00:56.430> wise<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.820> took<00:00:57.030> some<00:00:57.210> time<00:00:57.239> for

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
but gameplay wise it took some time for

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.450 
but gameplay wise it took some time for
me<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.840> really<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.140> used<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.340> can

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
me to really get used to it as you can

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.220 
me to really get used to it as you can
see<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.760> map<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.000> basically<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> big<00:01:00.989> circle

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
see this map is basically a big circle

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.139 
see this map is basically a big circle
and<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.620> means<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.010> spawns<00:01:02.309> are<00:01:02.579> constantly

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and this means the spawns are constantly

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.549 
and this means the spawns are constantly
flipping<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.840> these<00:01:03.960> pawns<00:01:04.140> are<00:01:04.320> actually

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
flipping and these pawns are actually

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.560 
flipping and these pawns are actually
really<00:01:04.710> bad<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.549> have<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.820> run<00:01:06.030> around<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
really bad and you have to run around a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.210 
really bad and you have to run around a
lot<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.990> mistake<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:07.680> making<00:01:07.830> for

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
lot the mistake that I was making for

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.560 
lot the mistake that I was making for
the<00:01:08.340> first<00:01:08.580> few<00:01:08.790> times<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.240> played<00:01:09.450> this

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the first few times that I played this

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.510 
the first few times that I played this
map<00:01:09.750> was<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.290> was<00:01:10.740> trying<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.100> run<00:01:11.220> around<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
map was I was trying to run around the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.219 
map was I was trying to run around the
outside<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.090> map<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.540> flank<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:13.080> way

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
outside of the map and flank just way

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.109 
outside of the map and flank just way
too<00:01:13.290> much<00:01:13.619> usually<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.610> always<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> good<00:01:15.060> idea

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
too much usually it's always a good idea

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.880 
too much usually it's always a good idea
to<00:01:15.390> stay<00:01:15.659> out<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> middle<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> map<00:01:16.680> but

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
to stay out of the middle of the map but

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.620 
to stay out of the middle of the map but
for<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.130> map<00:01:17.369> at<00:01:17.580> least<00:01:17.759> for<00:01:17.909> me<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.270> had<00:01:18.570> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
for this map at least for me I had to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.120 
for this map at least for me I had to
start<00:01:18.869> being<00:01:19.049> more<00:01:19.290> aggressive<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.770> pushing

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
start being more aggressive and pushing

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.859 
start being more aggressive and pushing
straight<00:01:20.369> through<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.759> down<00:01:20.939> area<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.509> order

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
straight through be down area in order

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.109 
straight through be down area in order
to<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.229> successful<00:01:22.520> also<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
to be successful also if you are on the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.429 
to be successful also if you are on the
outskirts<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> map<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.200> wanted<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
outskirts of the map I just wanted to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.020 
outskirts of the map I just wanted to
point<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.830> there<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.490> space<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.790> about

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
point out that there is a space of about

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.580 
point out that there is a space of about
two<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.479> three<00:01:27.509> feet<00:01:27.659> depending<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.350> where<00:01:28.500> you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
two to three feet depending on where you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.350 
two to three feet depending on where you
are<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.430> map<00:01:29.610> where<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.270> actually

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
are on the map where you can actually

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.149 
are on the map where you can actually
walk<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> water<00:01:31.200> without<00:01:31.350> dying<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
walk in the water without dying but it

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.740 
walk in the water without dying but it
slows<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.579> character<00:01:32.970> down<00:01:33.119> tremendously

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
slows your character down tremendously

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.660 
slows your character down tremendously
so<00:01:34.020> keep<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.409> mind<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.890> you're<00:01:35.400> trying<00:01:35.579> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
so keep that in mind if you're trying to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.920 
so keep that in mind if you're trying to
flank<00:01:35.909> around<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.360> chase<00:01:36.540> down<00:01:36.689> an<00:01:36.810> enemy

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
flank around or chase down an enemy

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.569 
flank around or chase down an enemy
something<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.549> mentioned

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
something like that so as I mentioned

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.850 
something like that so as I mentioned
these<00:01:39.030> bonds<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.689> map<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:40.110> not<00:01:40.409> ideal

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
these bonds on this map are not ideal

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.499 
these bonds on this map are not ideal
and<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.130> feel<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:41.310> these<00:01:41.520> bonds<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.030> both<00:01:42.180> Cove

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
and I feel like these bonds on both Cove

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.080 
and I feel like these bonds on both Cove
and<00:01:42.750> rush<00:01:43.259> are<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.590> bit<00:01:44.220> different<00:01:44.250> than<00:01:44.909> what

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
and rush are a bit different than what

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
and rush are a bit different than what
we<00:01:45.240> are<00:01:45.479> used<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.810> seeing<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.229> other<00:01:46.380> maps<00:01:46.590> from

actually got killed on a 29 gunstreak by

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.399 
actually got killed on a 29 gunstreak by
my<00:01:53.549> own<00:01:53.729> escort<00:01:54.060> drone<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> couple<00:01:54.869> days<00:01:54.990> ago<00:01:55.020> so

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
my own escort drone a couple days ago so

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.410 
my own escort drone a couple days ago so
that<00:01:55.530> was<00:01:55.649> really<00:01:55.680> frustrating<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:56.939> as<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.270> was

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that was really frustrating but as I was

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.969 
that was really frustrating but as I was
saying<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> seems<00:01:57.990> like<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.439> enemies<00:01:58.799> will

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
saying it seems like the enemies will

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.249 
saying it seems like the enemies will
start<00:01:59.189> spawning<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.700> both<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.149> ANC<00:02:00.960> spawns

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
start spawning on both the ANC spawns

while
we're<00:02:13.560> takin<00:02:13.860> see<00:02:14.100> but<00:02:14.580> then<00:02:14.730> they<00:02:14.850> will

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
we're takin see but then they will

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.850 
we're takin see but then they will
actually<00:02:15.270> start<00:02:15.480> spawning<00:02:15.750> at<00:02:16.080> sea<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.680> both

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
actually start spawning at sea on both

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.440 
actually start spawning at sea on both
on<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.370> know<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.640> right<00:02:17.790> side<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.150> left<00:02:18.240> side

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
on you know the right side the left side

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.720 
on you know the right side the left side
of<00:02:18.480> see<00:02:18.810> as<00:02:19.050> our<00:02:19.500> team<00:02:19.740> is<00:02:19.890> capturing<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.460> even

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
of see as our team is capturing it even

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.510 
of see as our team is capturing it even
though<00:02:20.910> they<00:02:21.390> might<00:02:21.600> have<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:22.080> or<00:02:22.320> even<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.280> B

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
though they might have a or even a and B

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.610 
though they might have a or even a and B
so<00:02:23.730> it's<00:02:23.880> very<00:02:24.030> strange<00:02:24.480> with<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> full<00:02:25.350> team<00:02:25.560> I

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
so it's very strange with a full team I

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.200 
so it's very strange with a full team I
actually<00:02:25.920> started<00:02:26.340> using<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:27.060> my

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
actually started using this to my

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.640 
actually started using this to my
advantage<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.810> kind<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.080> killing<00:02:28.260> them<00:02:28.440> as

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
advantage and kind of killing them as

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.890 
advantage and kind of killing them as
they<00:02:28.830> were<00:02:28.920> spawning<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.550> actually<00:02:30.540> for<00:02:30.690> rush

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
they were spawning and actually for rush

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.140 
they were spawning and actually for rush
there<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> pretty<00:02:31.950> sweet<00:02:32.310> spawn<00:02:32.670> trap<00:02:32.940> as

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
there is a pretty sweet spawn trap as

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.910 
there is a pretty sweet spawn trap as
well<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.900> will<00:02:34.140> share<00:02:34.350> with<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.530> guys<00:02:34.620> in

well that I will share with you guys in

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.370 
well that I will share with you guys in
a<00:02:35.010> future<00:02:35.340> video<00:02:36.110> unfortunately<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.260> this

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
a future video unfortunately in this

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.530 
a future video unfortunately in this
game<00:02:37.620> played<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.980> enemies<00:02:38.280> as<00:02:38.580> usual<00:02:39.180> started

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
game played the enemies as usual started

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.240 
game played the enemies as usual started
backing<00:02:39.720> out<00:02:39.990> towards<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.380> end<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.860> first

backing out towards the end of the first

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.190 
backing out towards the end of the first
round<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.210> probably<00:02:42.450> would<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:42.870> got<00:02:43.080> the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
round and I probably would have got the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.050 
round and I probably would have got the
nuclear<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:43.740> this<00:02:43.890> first<00:02:44.100> round<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.850> was

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
nuclear in this first round if that was

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.970 
nuclear in this first round if that was
not<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.360> case<00:02:45.540> i<00:02:45.750> believed<00:02:46.020> i<00:02:46.320> ended<00:02:46.710> up<00:02:46.800> on

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
not the case i believed i ended up on

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.650 
not the case i believed i ended up on
like<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.160> 26<00:02:47.730> gunstreak<00:02:48.090> at<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.360> end<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.570> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
like a 26 gunstreak at the end of the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.660 
like a 26 gunstreak at the end of the
first<00:02:48.870> round<00:02:48.990> but<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.920> enemy<00:02:50.280> started

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
first round but the enemy started

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.580 
first round but the enemy started
backing<00:02:50.880> out<00:02:51.120> with<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.600> minute<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.560> half

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
backing out with a minute and a half

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.590 
backing out with a minute and a half
left<00:02:52.920> in<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.250> first<00:02:53.520> round<00:02:53.640> I'm<00:02:54.180> not<00:02:54.390> sure<00:02:54.510> if

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
left in that first round I'm not sure if

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.390 
left in that first round I'm not sure if
it's<00:02:54.690> just<00:02:54.930> because<00:02:54.990> these<00:02:55.380> maps<00:02:55.680> were<00:02:55.920> new<00:02:56.160> or

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
it's just because these maps were new or

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.730 
it's just because these maps were new or
I<00:02:56.490> was<00:02:56.820> just<00:02:56.970> having<00:02:57.120> some<00:02:57.540> really<00:02:58.050> bad<00:02:58.350> luck

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
I was just having some really bad luck

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.440 
I was just having some really bad luck
this<00:02:58.980> past<00:02:59.070> week<00:02:59.550> but<00:03:00.030> I've<00:03:00.120> been<00:03:00.270> getting

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
this past week but I've been getting

this past week but I've been getting
into<00:03:00.720> these<00:03:00.840> lobbies<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.290> end<00:03:01.620> up<00:03:01.800> leaving

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
into these lobbies that end up leaving

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.880
