00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.379
 table tennis helmet competition tent in 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.630
 We will take a look at this video 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:15.570
 For example , try and try this 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.039
 to analyze so then we look 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.810
 The ball there exactly 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.430
 So I 'm the backhand first 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.320
 through then comes a bale mine 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.550
 change zones I decide for the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.109
 Forehand wants to run and has to 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.510
 also a bit of space but here 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.640
 comes the first mistake of the ball meeting 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.579
 four is far too close to the body 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.710
 it results in me having one 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.420
 turn the upper body down 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.840
 has to make me smaller 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.780
 and most importantly what happens here 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.190
 Stick goes down and I only have 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.590
 another poor move up 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.989
 and if we look at the trajectory of 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.100
 look here for here 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.600
 then you see there is no bow in the ball 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.520
 that's just because I'm here 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.840
 no wrist has any more use 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.609
 and no lever at all 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.890
 because if we look at the forearm 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.170
 view it now here in a kink 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.360
 also not replaced by my body 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.330
 but he sees quite well he is sitting on the top right 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.509
 on the elbow and here is still 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.799
 a click that means I have no 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.479
 lever action from the forearm and can 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.470
 so do not create a spin 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.830
 Here you can only see if you are exactly 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.630
 so backhand if she comes now 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.750
 ball and here is too tight 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.640
 Here we go from the upper body 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.320
 shoulders are going down my now 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.729
 quickly goes down and the hand pulled it 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.710
 up to you a little bit more 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.439
 I have you here to explain more exactly 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.329
 my graphics are made so left looks 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.619
 he the wrong variant there if that 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.740
 bat sheet is open 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.720
 and we start from bottom to top like that 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.549
 we do not get on train over train 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.280
 pure and no curve at all 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.829
 You have to beat the bat in a beating way 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.159
 You have to distance up to the ball 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.320
 have and so in this weird too over 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.719
 to come to the ball 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.690
 right here namely diagonally forward 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.730
 we have to come, I'll show you now 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.600
 I have another ball change 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.570
 better times 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:25.150
 when changing from me where it comes from 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:27.880
 I know better class often says 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.190
 So we see earlier here 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.530
 now I have a much bigger one here 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:39.520
 so let's have a look here 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:42.850
 can be between son here is the contribution 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.220
 ball is the ball 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.030
 and here is my body is so good 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.860
 half a meter 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.650
 I can go much further up this way 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.810
 start and ultimately come more 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.760
 you can still go forward over the near future 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.390
 start higher and flatter over the 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.040
 balcony 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.080
 but you can see that already 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.100
 much better chur we generate than at 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.820
 the first variant 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.440
 so think about it when yours 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.660
 Ball with the forehand from the transition zone 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.940
 plays do not start too low down 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.980
 that usually results from you 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.590
 too little space and too tight on the body 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.990
 therefore always plays the step too 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.360
 into the backhand in the 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.400
 also swing properly freely 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.070
 can and the ball also next to the 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.670
 body to meet and in front of the body too 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.770
 to meet 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.180
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.840
 if your result is still a thumbs up 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.840
 up but not our channel can 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.840
 up close
