00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.589
 H 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 the 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.219
 they graduate 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.780
 Kaboom welcome us to my roots 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.050
 Call of Duty 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.670
 yes we way it is today this is not a model Hoffer 1 synonymous wenns I believe the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.660
 most would have thought that it would be given to 1 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.550
 but actually that started to be expected I got or too 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.890
 Club boss on the edge wants to get 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.610
 Percent has played correctly is not now 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.490
 I was a bit busy but my 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.520
 proper entry into Connecticut the first two had been goal 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.700
 and therefore, today also gets a wanted word to see the clip 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.680
 I know that in front of the camp but again so can the guest 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.640
 Not many tips are waiting for you there 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.920
 I would like to use it for individuals 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.999
 so as to highlight the changes that came with the time 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.360
 and personally I did not like it so much 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.360
 maybe that's for you 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.560
 nagut started 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.430
 Yakin but before that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.860
 two of them come straight to mind 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.500
 for one thing what the part of coal who earn not least 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.420
 frustrated had Aachen at least obese ab as the driving force 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.680
 and on the other hand what also the part of the files for the row calm I say 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.240
 I could keep my performance the most constant then I had Migros of customer 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.190
 Of course I have to think about it 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.250
 what was the Oderbruch van Wyk what was different in the successor club like 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.919
 Modern Warfare 2 in the box 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.809
 that the quartet has changed for me 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:18.619
 that different feel for the game, or all of that changes the web in mine 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.510
 Eyes or they are in my eyes justified by three 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.669
 big tractors 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.669
 the first Modern Warfare 2 or respectively the Pope came 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:29.029
 the first big factor is in my eyes 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:31.389
 and where the biggest hit has been 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:35.279
 PREGAS who gives one faction in full force and the other 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:37.349
 Faction for Jerry still decided 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.069
 unchanged that was the counterpart to cope with as a man no longer had 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.639
 Weapons beat gave more health 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.349
 and on top of that, most people sold that with them 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.979
 played and just there was very noticeable that they are finally there too 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.279
 the art was used with a great deal 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.589
 I have it very urgently also directly to the second major factor 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.519
 because somewhere there must be a reason why most people are 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.609
 at that time for that has already decided me 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.680
 the reason was probably that the maps were much smaller 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.030
 I know that, of course, important Kate Moss also gave cards 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.489
 comparable to wireless LAN so the world 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.689
 but on average, the cards were rather small and already on such a 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.769
 Level as I said "Make protein or coward little 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.659
 Branded look that was the first 4 the first time in the month 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.329
 In addition, the maps also expect a lot of connections and there were many 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.909
 Beds and you could work that perfectly from cover to cover 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.439
 you could wash a lot better and you can do 1 point faster 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:37.589
 been cracked 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:41.129
 and the bottom line is whoever mastered the map surprised 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.409
 yes always good and the whole leads me directly to the third factor 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:49.019
 because if you could record such a few successes you knew his 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.019
 Some customers on flights knew the Metzner common 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.239
 then, of course, the topic will be rewarded a little bit bigger 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.659
 and at that point came the change in Modern Warfare 2 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:04.899
 in my eyes a lot of before but also really x-treme the Xtreme 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:07.649
 Has disadvantages 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:10.759
 I can only speak for myself and not for the sake of God 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:11.540
 undeserved 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.810
 I am also happy about a nice round the road with firmer then 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.650
 the hallway or whatever 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.349
 but you can really speak of rewards 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.249
 I get to the point 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:26.909
 DICE now in Cat or Modern Warfare 2 all shooting rewards 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.819
 that means I want for almost 11% e-commerce platform on so what 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.819
 it's really just about the shooting gallery rewards or the round 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.139
 On the other hand, you can say that the reward is only one billion won 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.210
 Huge down a pounding bump did you do well 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.570
 the reward is not in addition to good and beautiful Vienna war creates and 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:49.559
 the customer is the animal key treats 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.639
 it showed, according to this in quotes Leckerli in Modern 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.550
 Warfare 2 in Vancouver 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.669
 it will open as my new kills derive an 8 points then gets the 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:04:59.849
 Have pursuers 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.710
 and the reward for those 8 or 9 missing is another ten percent or 15 

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:05.999
 20 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:10.339
 every player has to be different depending on the cash register 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.879
 the 20 kids will be much more 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:16.189
 you can still speak of pilots and such matters 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.659
 is that justifiable? I mean my hand on the heart I want it 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:21.550
 really really do not paralyze 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.870
 I'm always happy when I'm not on the one hand with the children on the one hand 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.849
 Face says he does it every time and does not have this either 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:28.789
 conscience 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.339
 but still, I'm wondering, that's not a reasonable trillion queen 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:36.639
 do more with my reward now 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.919
 which I need you to get there to reward 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.919
 and in my eyes does not like at all 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.099
 but alright i always come back to farther ahead 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.110
 there had been on the same done on paper has always been so 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.889
 been 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.370
 on the run had been so irritated 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.590
 Dr number of kills made the number of members Modern Warfare 2 so times 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.460
 If you only make an animal then you also do it with it then you do it too 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.069
 no time there 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:05.379
 with it all before 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:08.680
 and on the seven wounded but the dogs have 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.590
 Percent in Madrid where he drowned second bite was missing and you could say 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.529
 actually relatively easy to measure 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:20.069
 there was also in the preliminary round only the round future should be extremely low 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:20.960
 were 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.150
 a few more the five six or seven kills warning signs do not really work 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.990
 counts because missing and on average worse claim 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.419
 to the round 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.039
 four five six money was actually made in the aggravation 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:40.279
 Well Home Works I'm always that's a Yaris there 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:43.539
 so it sounded a bit Freeman initially limited time is said again 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:45.330
 it should not come over like that 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.060
 but the message should actually be that 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.320
 Walter Tumor playing the track was decided by a playful performance 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:54.939
 This is really the case in most cases 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:59.180
 Only the player or team won, which was better 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.170
 There was no command in the sense that there is almost nothing at all 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:03.899
 tube 

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:08.219
 There were no rewards here, either, this is for me now, here it came 

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:12.099
 just focus on precision reaction time and especially the re 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:14.490
 the best ways we had that is 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.039
 I and my weapon do not exist anymore 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:20.810
 Well that's what first with my little wanted where excursion 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:21.789
 and yes 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:24.909
 if you want that Wolf said that Wolfgang Vettel I was up 

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:26.889
 the whole amount of money gets up to 10 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:31.299
 I just do not know about the St six years as I said let me know 

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:33.599
 so thats it 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:37.619
 I would really appreciate it if we are under value maybe 

00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:41.019
 as well as any losses express numbers also tells everyone 

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:42.990
 Stapleton foresee rewards 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.469
 and also with Henkel our channel opposes if this did not make 

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:48.039
 in this sense 

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:48.919
 Until next time
