battery compartment I don't know my

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.340 
battery compartment I don't know my
opinion<00:05:17.890> it<00:05:18.010> doesn't<00:05:18.340> feel<00:05:18.520> very<00:05:18.580> sturdy<00:05:19.350> but

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
opinion it doesn't feel very sturdy but

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.219 
opinion it doesn't feel very sturdy but
well<00:05:21.010> maybe<00:05:21.970> when<00:05:22.180> I<00:05:22.210> get<00:05:22.360> a<00:05:22.480> lens<00:05:22.720> on<00:05:22.960> it'll

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
well maybe when I get a lens on it'll

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:30.690 
well maybe when I get a lens on it'll
feel<00:05:23.410> more<00:05:23.680> more<00:05:26.280> like<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.430> camera<00:05:27.850> a<00:05:29.700> heavier

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
feel more more like the camera a heavier

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.760 
feel more more like the camera a heavier
of<00:05:30.820> camera<00:05:31.660> it's<00:05:31.900> definitely<00:05:32.229> a<00:05:32.260> professional

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
of camera it's definitely a professional

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.530 
of camera it's definitely a professional
camera<00:05:33.130> but<00:05:33.280> I<00:05:33.310> guess<00:05:33.850> I<00:05:34.030> expected<00:05:34.450> it<00:05:34.570> to<00:05:34.690> be<00:05:34.840> a

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
camera but I guess I expected it to be a

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.110 
camera but I guess I expected it to be a
an<00:05:37.540> alloy<00:05:38.050> but<00:05:38.680> it<00:05:38.830> feels<00:05:39.010> like<00:05:39.280> plastic<00:05:39.580> some

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
an alloy but it feels like plastic some

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.530 
an alloy but it feels like plastic some
kind<00:05:40.390> of<00:05:40.540> space-age<00:05:41.050> plastic<00:05:41.710> what<00:05:42.669> there<00:05:43.510> you
