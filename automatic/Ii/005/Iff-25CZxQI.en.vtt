00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.770
 hello grÃ¼ezi with then the first pink 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.200
 Panther and I have a camera 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.210
 bought and wants to stop my little 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.760
 while I say pink panther plays 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:18.020
 take me in and the whole as a small 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.720
 insert image content in the video with 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.700
 That's why I got the idea why 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.130
 you can not do that either so I give you 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.260
 Show yes that you take up 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.320
 while you say either pink panther 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.599
 play with me or while you do that 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.940
 video looks so that would be quite 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.469
 Funny then I cut the most beautiful 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.710
 things together and do it to us 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.800
 special video so that will certainly yes 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.109
 really funny to another if you 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.629
 have ideas what I say in pink panthers 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.159
 should ask or what else is there 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.710
 could play and so on 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:55.069
 then it sends me either as a video 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.299
 or as pn whatever I try 

00:00:55.069 --> 00:01:00.920
 then just install the 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:02.899
 and then you can basically just 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.879
 take influence on the whole game and 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.689
 then is accordingly 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.189
 funny 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.560
 on the other hand i got a picture 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.110
 I'll show you the same I think that 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.659
 totally great has the pink panther 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.670
 just say a picture has taken that 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.950
 all worked a bit and so on 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.200
 continue and if you have something like that 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.469
 then I will send that too 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.939
 of course, because that's all 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:33.469
 for you and with you and therefore 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.679
 I think that's a great idea right now 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:40.219
 connection is still an info to pink 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.600
 panther says in battlefield and there 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.450
 just a little bit explains how 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.609
 the whole thing should be done and on friday 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.130
 is there again a real info 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.679
 video and on saturday we will ours 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.590
 make first test 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.450
 ok then a lot of fun in connection to 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.609
 then 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.700
 Hello, I welcome you to the first info 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:04.100
 video to battlefield 3 pink panther says 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.719
 I have four volunteers here whom we have 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.249
 help now we will be so 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.530
 try a few things 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:12.110
 So it will not be easy for her 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.300
 See there we are now introduces you 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.400
 There are actually 60 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.380
 that's a really long row i 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.340
 I'll probably go between three 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.230
 and then there are six edmonds 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.300
 stand directly in this row and 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.850
 either ten or twenty people 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.310
 just have an eye and if so what 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.710
 then they are wrong 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.210
 also shot command to otherwise you go 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.350
 just not because it's just too much 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.220
 Many people are not me at all 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.530
 can overlook 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.300
 I will not be able to see the names 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.840
 just like these three here 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.540
 that's a teammate and team 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.950
 shelling will be out because otherwise there 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.780
 it just over and over one 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.260
 A grenade throws five people down 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.970
 around and there we are then 20 times the 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.380
 restart all and that would be 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.810
 really take over hours 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.970
 and that's why the whole thing is right 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.650
 be clever that something like that does not stop 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.070
 but one thing can happen to you 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.290
 I will promise 70 to 80 people in the 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.260
 Record ts 60 then stop in the 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.320
 be a channel and then a crap 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.690
 then the admin will do that 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.730
 as of ts there is also a server 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.120
 admin will be the people immediately 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.620
 banned immediately thrown out and the 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.930
 Names are noted so that's not 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.120
 can join again because that works 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.370
 only with discipline if all 60 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.040
 actually participate properly and like it 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.880
 then all together create one 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.390
 set a world record that eg 60 people 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.489
 directly execute a command and only so 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.310
 it works 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:49.900
 we are testing this with four people and now 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:56.540
 pink panther says sit down 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:58.930
 pink panther says lay down with it eg 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:06.040
 one who did not do it 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:13.780
 pink panther bag sit there once more 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:16.470
 a pink peter says get up now 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.370
 he's on kill because sitecore is on 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.990
 and so we would have to, for example 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.310
 our winner and yes I can you 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.410
 Unfortunately, now is not holding hands because 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.270
 the way was too far that's why I'm sending 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.280
 you a hand and she then about 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:35.169
 So yes, so from now on 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.210
 Friday will come an info video 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.220
 So I'm already busy 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.580
 extensively designed as the whole 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.949
 and then we'll see each other on friday 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.830
 again where explicitly stated when 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:52.449
 we meet where we meet together 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.669
 ip from ts and you have as said 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.220
 comes in numbers because we need 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.710
 about 70 to 80 people with us 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.660
 Replacement players have of course 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.349
 there again who first since times 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.510
 First we have to look who's there 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.639
 that can be reasonably speaking in ts 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.080
 that's very important for you 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.630
 actually can speak in ts 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.210
 or to hear how you can 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.099
 in detail theirs either quietly or 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.960
 you have to be muted 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.090
 stop to see how loud is then whether the 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.860
 people can pull together because there 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.900
 not really all that 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.820
 works and that is really one 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.070
 epic thing if that's actually 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.620
 works then we have a video 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.770
 something together never did it 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.169
 has therefore supported me 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:42.690
 Thank you for watching 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.690
 until friday pink panther
