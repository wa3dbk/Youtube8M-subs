okay<00:00:04.830> what<00:00:05.040> we<00:00:05.160> have<00:00:05.190> here<00:00:05.400> is<00:00:05.940> what<00:00:06.210> we<00:00:06.299> call<00:00:06.540> a

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
okay what we have here is what we call a

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.200 
okay what we have here is what we call a
product<00:00:06.870> simulation<00:00:07.649> device<00:00:07.970> this<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.120> the

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
product simulation device this is the

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.560 
product simulation device this is the
type<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.420> product<00:00:09.780> we<00:00:10.050> would<00:00:10.170> install<00:00:10.559> after

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
type of product we would install after

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.480 
type of product we would install after
multi<00:00:12.570> vac<00:00:12.809> type<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.290> machine<00:00:13.650> or<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.040> vacuum

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
multi vac type of machine or a vacuum

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.760 
multi vac type of machine or a vacuum
pack<00:00:14.910> type<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.360> machine<00:00:15.690> most<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.680> these

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
pack type of machine most of these

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.279 
pack type of machine most of these
machines<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.460> product<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.060> come<00:00:18.270> out<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.779> a

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
machines have product that come out of a

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.700 
machines have product that come out of a
mold<00:00:19.850> and<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.939> mold<00:00:21.119> creates<00:00:21.750> multiple

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
mold and the mold creates multiple

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.380 
mold and the mold creates multiple
packages<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.430> each<00:00:23.609> sequence

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
packages in each sequence

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.189 
packages in each sequence
so<00:00:25.170> what<00:00:25.410> exits<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.010> machine<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.609> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.910> be

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
so what exits the machine is going to be

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.200 
so what exits the machine is going to be
possibly<00:00:28.199> four<00:00:28.470> or<00:00:28.769> six<00:00:29.070> or<00:00:29.310> multiples<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.060> two

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
possibly four or six or multiples of two

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.229 
possibly four or six or multiples of two
or<00:00:30.390> three<00:00:31.040> different<00:00:32.040> size<00:00:32.250> packages<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.180> a

they'll<00:00:35.880> be<00:00:36.059> next<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.510> each<00:00:36.690> other<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.200> what

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
they'll be next to each other and what

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.280 
they'll be next to each other and what
we're<00:00:38.100> trying<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.460> do<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.719> product

stop and start this belt is based on the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.710 
stop and start this belt is based on the
product<00:02:17.760> sides<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.210> you<00:02:18.240> enter<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
product sides that you enter in the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.010 
product sides that you enter in the
software<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.790> could<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.330> done<00:02:21.540> based<00:02:21.750> on

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
software so that could be done based on

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.980 
software so that could be done based on
time<00:02:22.400> so<00:02:23.400> we<00:02:23.520> let<00:02:23.730> each<00:02:23.850> one<00:02:24.420> run<00:02:24.720> for<00:02:24.960> a

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
time so we let each one run for a

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.170 
time so we let each one run for a
certain<00:02:25.170> amount<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.530> time<00:02:25.770> before<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.280> stop<00:02:26.550> or

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
certain amount of time before we stop or

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.930 
certain amount of time before we stop or
it<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.570> be<00:02:27.720> based<00:02:28.050> off<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.320> distance<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.760> if<00:02:29.820> we

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
it can be based off of distance so if we

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.730 
it can be based off of distance so if we
know<00:02:30.090> our<00:02:30.240> package<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:30.780> eight<00:02:30.960> inches<00:02:31.260> long<00:02:31.320> we

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
know our package is eight inches long we

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.290 
know our package is eight inches long we
can<00:02:31.890> actually<00:02:32.070> let<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:32.550> belt<00:02:32.820> run<00:02:33.090> eight

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
can actually let this belt run eight

can actually let this belt run eight
inches<00:02:33.690> pause<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.590> let<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.040> run<00:02:35.160> another

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460

inches pause it and let it run another
eight<00:02:35.670> inches<00:02:36.030> before<00:02:36.210> we<00:02:36.540> engage<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.260> next

running faster than this one by doing
that<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.360> will<00:02:45.510> create<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:46.170> small<00:02:46.860> natural<00:02:47.190> gap

here<00:03:00.870> we<00:03:01.020> can<00:03:01.200> create<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.500> small<00:03:01.860> gap<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.880> next

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
here we can create a small gap the next
