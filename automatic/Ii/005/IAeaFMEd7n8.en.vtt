00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.300 

well<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:17.940> mean<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.330> don't<00:00:18.510> know<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.660> know<00:00:19.310> what

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
well I mean I don't know you know what

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
well I mean I don't know you know what
you're<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:23.630> now<00:00:24.630> nice<00:00:28.910> just<00:00:29.910> sort<00:00:30.300> of

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
you're just now nice just sort of

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.639 
you're just now nice just sort of
getting<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.720> hang<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.260> picking<00:00:33.649> all

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
getting the hang of this picking all

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.510 
getting the hang of this picking all
spool<00:00:35.219> dimple<00:00:35.790> locks<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.829> what<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> found<00:00:38.219> is

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
spool dimple locks and what I found is

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
spool dimple locks and what I found is
that<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:38.850> you're<00:00:39.030> tensioning<00:00:40.340> in<00:00:41.540> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
that if you're tensioning in the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.529 
that if you're tensioning in the
clockwise<00:00:43.500> direction<00:00:46.280> if<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.210> hung<00:00:48.420> up

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
clockwise direction if you get hung up

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.069 
clockwise direction if you get hung up
in<00:00:48.719> false<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.379> virtually<00:00:49.800> impossible<00:00:50.070> to

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
in false it's virtually impossible to

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.189 
in false it's virtually impossible to
set<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> pins<00:00:52.469> because<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:54.149> direction<00:00:54.930> of

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
set the pins because the direction of

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.430 
set the pins because the direction of
your<00:00:55.410> tension<00:00:56.149> is<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.809> same<00:00:58.109> as<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
your tension is the same as the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.549 
your tension is the same as the
direction<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.460> you<00:01:00.300> are<00:01:00.539> trying<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.350> turn

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
direction that you are trying to turn

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.969 
direction that you are trying to turn
your<00:01:01.770> pick<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.969> tightens<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.619> lip<00:01:04.830> of

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
your pick so it tightens on the lip of

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.609 
your pick so it tightens on the lip of
the<00:01:05.159> spool<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.869> if<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.170> change<00:01:07.500> your

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the spool so if you change your

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.929 
the spool so if you change your
attention<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:09.180> counter<00:01:09.600> clockwise<00:01:10.820> when<00:01:11.820> you

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
attention to counter clockwise when you

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.270 
attention to counter clockwise when you
go<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> set<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> spool<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.799> will<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> be

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
go to set the spool you will it be

go to set the spool you will it be
actually<00:01:14.790> turning<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> key<00:01:15.630> way<00:01:15.780> back<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
actually turning the key way back and

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.390 
actually turning the key way back and
allowing<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> lip<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> spool<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.060> slip

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
allowing the lip of the spool to slip

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.310 
allowing the lip of the spool to slip

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
this one is keyed differently so you get

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.750 
this one is keyed differently so you get
two<00:06:58.800> locks<00:06:59.070> in<00:06:59.310> one<00:06:59.490> which<00:07:00.330> is<00:07:00.360> just<00:07:00.840> a<00:07:01.230> huge

two locks in one which is just a huge
amount<00:07:02.760> of<00:07:03.500> of<00:07:04.500> learning<00:07:05.070> you<00:07:05.280> can<00:07:05.430> get<00:07:05.580> out<00:07:05.730> of
