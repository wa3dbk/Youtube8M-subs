00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.150
 this weekend we spread out board on a 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.980
 otherwise absolutely beautiful circuit 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.140
 beautifully landscaped it's quad 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.279
 in the quad country program today 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.410
 what is the quad country 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.169
 an endurance race that takes place in 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.119
 in a space said natural seiler 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.619
 with so- called natural obstacles 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.030
 which we will add obstacles 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.950
 artificial like it's a race 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.350
 of traditional endurance the terrain and 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.940
 any high school all prepared a track done 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.219
 consistently 5 meters wide 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.020
 there we have natural difficulties with 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.000
 narrower passages of the climbs 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.910
 very pleasant very accentuated 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.190
 dizzying descents and that's it 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.450
 the difficulty is all the wealth of 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.420
 this sport makes the qualities 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.620
 particular it's a good agility to 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.110
 endurance because it's a race 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.760
 which will last three hours and then 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.870
 then and adapt perfectly 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.460
 What land because indeed 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.199
 as I said a moment ago 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.850
 a lot of difficulties throughout 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.060
 of the race thierry kid to revive 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.740

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.490
 that is, we have six or six 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.439
 seven events this year already 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.030

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.320
 how many drivers registered this weekend 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.570

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.960
