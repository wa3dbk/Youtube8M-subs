00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.080 
portion and then it also picks it up
from<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.510> bottom<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.320> picks<00:00:40.530> up<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:41.850> frame

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.750 
from the bottom so it picks up the frame
of<00:00:42.270> my<00:00:42.420> chair<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.340> everything<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.460> done<00:00:44.579> by

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
of my chair and everything is done by

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
this remote in my hand and then I think

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.690 
this remote in my hand and then I think
about<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.379> lift<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.129> adjustable

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
about this lift is that it's adjustable

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.139 
about this lift is that it's adjustable
for<00:00:51.000> any<00:00:51.420> kind<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.809> manual<00:00:52.199> chair<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.030> then

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
for any kind of manual chair and so then

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.510 
for any kind of manual chair and so then
I<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.390> put<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.780> remote<00:00:55.260> back<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.309> door

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
I just put the remote back and the door

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.910 
I just put the remote back and the door
is<00:00:56.640> not<00:00:56.820> automatic<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.260> close<00:00:58.890> it

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
is not automatic so I have to close it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
is not automatic so I have to close it
myself<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.870> then<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.440> also<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.219> transfer

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.810 
myself and then I also have a transfer
seat<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.539> put<00:01:03.899> into<00:01:04.080> my<00:01:04.260> car<00:01:04.700> so<00:01:05.700> that

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
seat that I put into my car so that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.160 
seat that I put into my car so that
comes<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.600> makes<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> transfer

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
comes out so it makes the transfer

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.649 
comes out so it makes the transfer
easier<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:08.100> also<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.060> handlebar<00:01:09.630> that

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.929 
easier I also have this handlebar that
comes<00:01:10.020> down<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.130> I'm<00:01:11.250> ever<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.610> steep
