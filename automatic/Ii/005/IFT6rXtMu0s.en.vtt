00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.279
 the classic never goes out of fashion 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.480
 it is a phrase made but that is well suited 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.040
 the new honda the cb1100 the elements 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.380
 all there are traditional 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.450
 metal tank an engine 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.300
 air cooled and oil frame a 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.920
 double cradle and double shock absorber 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.870
 however the technology is as modern as it is 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.690
 modern is the guide 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.530
 the engine is a full and elastic fairy tale 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.719
 is an example of linearity and sweetness but 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.750
 You can be aggressive you are teases 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.690
 the red area looking for it long takes 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.670
 turn quickly but never scares the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.180
 real pleasure though is the low to medium 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.130
 black velvet riding regimes 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.650
 disengaged appreciates good work 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.110
 comfortable but not suspension 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.710
 mollaccione tire sizes 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.240
 thin and mounted on wheels of 18 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.610
 reflect the style perfectly 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.650
 70 of the civil one hundred 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.010
 and ask for a honda car guide not 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.370
 aggressive which is not lacking but this one 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.050
 it's not a knee-to-floor bike 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.000
 also the perfect riding position 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.000
 handlebar and footrests are the right one 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.790
 distance tire and guarantee the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.920
 maximum control to the pilot to put it 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.979
 all does not even seem to be in 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.680
 saddle an 1100 at a compact average e 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.780
 light and two to the data sheet says 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.640
 than with a full tank of gas 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.290
 we have two tons between the legs e 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.030
 half of metal 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.300
 you wouldn't say everything is so easy 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.360
 also the saddle in this 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.850
 not well padded and shaped helps 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.009
 after so far from the ground it is so easy 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.979
 rest both feet even if not 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.870
 you are the developments 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.510
 excellent brakes for power e 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.000
 modulation braking is type 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.980
 combined ie who already of the pedal of 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.860
 rear brakes slightly also 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.800
 in front so the bike remains more composed 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.810
 the intervention of the standard biesse yes 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.040
 warns only on funds particularly 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.000
 slippery the big flaws the cb1100 not 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.100
 it has 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.110
 to be picky we will put in the list 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.320
 yes and side stand is the one 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.360
 central not practical to use and one 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.880
 poor ground light with which you risk 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.190
 to collide collectors under the world e 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.280
 on the most pronounced bumps or going down 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.340
 from the sidewalks but otherwise quality 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.510
 constructive engine and drive this honda 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.510
 it deserves praise
