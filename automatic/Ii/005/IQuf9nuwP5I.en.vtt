00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.209
 it's 8 o'clock the weather is gloomy and 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:07.700
 the temperature rather cool 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:10.610
 yet Michel Jobard walks the beach 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.500
 the rake by hand they trace measure 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.230
 rake the sand that time a 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.590
 tide becomes a medium on which he 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.760
 give free rein to his imagination you 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.300
 can see it is that big 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.100
 canvas of fine sand so it takes 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.600
 pretty big tools so I made 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.580
 composts works with strings 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.920
 to adapt a little to this great 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.199
 canvas by the fit I worked 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.179
 with a compact I realized so it has 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.100
 itself develop and manufacture these 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:39.019
 tools it does so draw circles 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.909
 more than 4 meters 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.920
 a minimum knowing that some of his 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:48.949
 works can reach 200 m from 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.449
 the shadow between 4 and 5 am are 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.879
 necessary to carry out each 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.370
 project a titan job the most 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.929
 often made at the run and who 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.569
 will only have a very short lifetime 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.819
 since this ephemeral work is dedicated to 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:05.030
 disappear as soon as the tide is August 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:06.140
 in our materialistic world that's it 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.570
 learns a lot about detachment 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:14.329
 just do it and then after seeing 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.430
 the fresco is washed away by the sea 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.049
 learn detachment each release of 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.240
 michel jobard on our beaches arouses 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.070
 always a lot of curiosity the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.350
 questions fuse and the performance and 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.969
 often it's him that a moment privileges 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.460
 that few artists have the chance to 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.960
 to know it is true when one has to 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.620
 the emotion of the live audience and on its 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.260
 hazards 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.200
 it's the most beautiful of the awards 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.120
 beautiful but after it will be here it's okay 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.010
 not be destroyed no no no it's not 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.760
 destroyed is carried away for me it's a 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.400
 big difference it intrigues people 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.720
 it did not happen to me 2 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.660
 that people also applauded in 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.740
 the buildings we really have it's 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.270
 really a reward and a very 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.020
 nice reward because it's also 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.870
 to share 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.460
 of course it's for geoffron evening at all 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.140
 the world 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.090
 always on the run michel jobard 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.070
 will immortalize the event by taking a 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.330
 series of photos before the sea ​​does 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.580
 take back his rights 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.500
 the day after the beach will be blank 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.070
 any trace is ready to welcome a 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.070
 new work
