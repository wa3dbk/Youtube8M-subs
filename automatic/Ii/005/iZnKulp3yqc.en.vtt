which wheels are popular in the foreign
country<00:00:05.180> a<00:00:05.330> lot<00:00:05.930> of<00:00:06.080> imitation<00:00:06.440> also<00:00:06.920> appeared

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
country a lot of imitation also appeared

next<00:00:16.670> -<00:00:16.970> imitation<00:00:17.210> wheels<00:00:17.960> in<00:00:18.320> the<00:00:18.560> same

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
next - imitation wheels in the same

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.170 
next - imitation wheels in the same
shell<00:00:20.200> because<00:00:21.200> imitation<00:00:22.010> RS<00:00:22.250> cheaper<00:00:22.730> the

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
shell because imitation RS cheaper the

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.860 
shell because imitation RS cheaper the
original<00:00:23.720> wheels<00:00:24.250> but<00:00:25.250> we<00:00:25.850> want<00:00:26.180> you<00:00:26.450> to

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:26.870 
original wheels but we want you to

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.960 
original wheels but we want you to
recognize<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:27.710> buying<00:00:28.010> such<00:00:28.370> an<00:00:28.400> imitation

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
recognize the buying such an imitation

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.870 
recognize the buying such an imitation
might<00:00:29.510> take<00:00:29.810> some<00:00:30.050> risk

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
might take some risk

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.450 
might take some risk
why<00:00:31.880> is<00:00:32.149> imitation<00:00:32.809> cheap<00:00:33.200> there<00:00:33.980> are<00:00:34.100> some

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
why is imitation cheap there are some

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.450 
why is imitation cheap there are some
reason<00:00:34.910> why<00:00:35.270> it's<00:00:35.480> cheap<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:36.590> most<00:00:36.860> important

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
reason why it's cheap the most important

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.240 
reason why it's cheap the most important
point<00:00:37.730> is<00:00:37.880> safety<00:00:38.240> because<00:00:39.200> imitation<00:00:39.980> wheels

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
point is safety because imitation wheels

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.970 
point is safety because imitation wheels
still<00:00:40.850> pressed<00:00:41.450> their<00:00:41.810> production<00:00:42.500> costs<00:00:42.860> as

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
still pressed their production costs as

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.729 
still pressed their production costs as
low<00:00:43.400> as<00:00:43.430> possible<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:44.720> wheel<00:00:45.140> tests<00:00:45.530> are

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
low as possible and the wheel tests are

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.220 
low as possible and the wheel tests are
not<00:00:45.980> severe<00:00:46.489> like<00:00:46.790> Japan<00:00:47.210> either<00:00:47.450> they<00:00:48.200> are

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
not severe like Japan either they are

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.040 
not severe like Japan either they are

various loaded condition it can be

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.920 
various loaded condition it can be
hearing<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:51.560> car<00:00:51.800> or<00:00:52.100> other<00:00:52.930> contingency

hearing the car or other contingency

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.040 
hearing the car or other contingency
happens<00:00:54.470> might<00:00:54.770> be<00:00:54.950> okay<00:00:55.340> we<00:00:56.149> don't<00:00:56.300> think<00:00:56.600> the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
happens might be okay we don't think the

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.380 
happens might be okay we don't think the
wheels<00:00:57.350> have<00:00:57.710> enough<00:00:58.040> to<00:00:58.399> correspond<00:00:59.180> these
