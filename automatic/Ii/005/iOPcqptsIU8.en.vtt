00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.590
 downloaded on a pc that consists of going 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.170
 to the temporary forest 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.950
 to capture a celebrated language to 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.030
 level 70 and for this we have to go to 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.030
 green forest like I said 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.490
 to then later access the forest 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.580
 temporary 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.020

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.020
 heading north 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.690
 and dive into the green forest 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.720
 we will have to here and there will be 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.060
 a cave 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.049

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.960

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:26.840
 and through it access to the forest 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.399
 temporary where we will be waiting for a 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.970
 wild cedevis at level 70 and beige in 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.630
 the poster 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.560
 temporary forest 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:44.200
 and this route was only activated 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.200
 formerly through an event 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.040
 that was pretty much split up 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.520
 enough years and here it will be 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.340
 waiting 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.340

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.810
 be at level 70 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.590
 and good, I always recommend you 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.980
 save the game before fighting 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.410
 against a legendary pokÃ©mon yet pokemon 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.690
 that you want to capture but well I do not 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.120
 I keep it because I'm going to use the master bar 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.060
