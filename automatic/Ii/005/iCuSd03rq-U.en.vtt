00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
useful I've used these a good bit

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.810 
useful I've used these a good bit
cutting<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.890> down<00:01:17.100> my<00:01:17.189> hand<00:01:17.400> never<00:01:17.580> gets

tired the Master Hunter is a little
thinner<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.270> that's<00:01:21.750> going<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.960> make<00:01:22.170> it

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
thinner and that's going to make it

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.399 
thinner and that's going to make it
easier<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.159> slice<00:01:23.460> meat<00:01:23.790> with<00:01:24.000> also<00:01:24.960> when<00:01:25.290> you

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
