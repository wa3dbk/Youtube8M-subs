00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260 
and since I had the golf club out
wondered<00:02:50.980> if<00:02:51.070> people<00:02:51.250> would<00:02:51.550> believe<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:52.000> a

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
wondered if people would believe that a

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.500 
wondered if people would believe that a
gorilla<00:02:52.690> had<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.930> decent<00:02:53.260> swing

golfing<00:03:01.790> was<00:03:01.940> hard<00:03:02.180> work<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:02.930> thought<00:03:03.170> I'd

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
golfing was hard work so I thought I'd

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.699 
golfing was hard work so I thought I'd
reward<00:03:03.620> myself<00:03:03.830> with<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.340> scratch<00:03:05.440> do<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:06.530> get

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
to be much of a scratch I thought

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.960 
to be much of a scratch I thought
they're<00:03:09.440> due<00:03:09.590> for<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.769> feed<00:03:10.069> actually<00:03:10.459> soon
