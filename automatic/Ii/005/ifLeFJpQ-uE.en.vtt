00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.199
 hello from nonsoloanima.tv we are here at a conference in food fraternity 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.630
 chronic inflammation in Milan with us is Antonio Traverso naturapata 

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:36.010
 iridologist herbalist of bionatural disciplines good morning 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.940
 good morning 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.140
 the heart of his speech today considering that you have entitled 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.470
 bioenergetic determination of personal nutritional situation 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.110
 not being able to understand 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.900
 through an extracted tooth such as the best feed 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.740
 for a person we say that each of us has his own diet 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.720
 so try to understand 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.540
 I eat well because I was born in Lombardy by Lombard parents oh se 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.930
 I eat well because they were born in Lombardy from parents 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.010
 Lombard and Ligurian 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.730
 the power supply must be my genetic equipment that you left me 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.200
 my parents who sent me 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.409
 and that I then pass on to my children the determination of the diet 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.990
 every one of us own personal power supply mine is definitely 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.470
 different from his but maybe 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.929
 just because I have to eat spelled 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.880
 and she must eat kamut 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.850
 then we can eat the turkey all the same 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.200
 in all this roan heart of blood type 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 we have inherited the barolo sanguine from our parents 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.240
 partly from the father partly from the mother 50% 50% 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.750
 each of us has a blood type in this blood group 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.620
 professor d'adamo understood that there are food levels 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.050
 who can create 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.300
 intolerances 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.239
 are those so-called lectins 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.810
 involve in ours 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.869
 in our 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.700
 body like polyamines there is something that hurts us 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.869
 so the two of us must exclude 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.869
 can cause intestinal level 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.909
 then you move the so-called 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.409
 intestine with GruyÃ¨re cheese 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.080
 so if I delete these foods from food 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.560
 and then later I put them back after 3 4 months but in very very limited doses 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.039
 they don't hurt us anymore 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:42.209
 for group 0 wheat wheat the food that bel group zero is 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.789
 worse 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:49.429
 because the group 0 the first man who arrived on earth the hunter 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:51.729
 what the hunter ate 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:54.809
 we have to imagine 80 million years ago 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:56.009
 that is fruit 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.369
 vegetable 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.029
 there were berries there were tubers 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:00.890
 and therefore 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.839
 the group 0 took to the energy we say that the group 0 l 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:06.169
 virtually 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.799
 a vegetarian 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.669
 as an option for meat for dogs because with that energy it was successful 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.499
 learn an animal 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:17.249
 he had to eat it all because it wasn't in the refrigerators so if 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:18.029
 he took 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:19.050
 a rabbit 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.020
 he ate it all became a gay carnivore because he ate 800 grams 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.159
 a kilo you have day of meat and then 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.409
 this good 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.169
 possibility though 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.589
 starting is a vegetarian 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:37.179
 therefore the wheat the pasta the spaghetti then there were no group 0 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:40.439
 still fails today 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.259
 most celiac people enzo new group 0 I have a group that 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.929
 group that comes immediately from 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:51.239
 but therefore a diet based on the canary the absence 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:55.549
 calorie-based diet can be a diet 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:56.939
 this is a theme. 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.810
 has a hospitalized person 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.070
 therefore I must also take into account the calories 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.589
 a person who is in a bed 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:07.839
 that doesn't burn me calories when I need casoria 

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:12.159
 a diet based more than anything else on food combinations 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.560
 on what the food glycemic index is 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.049
 on what 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.380
 I can assimilate that it does me good or hurts me 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.599
 what has my caf decor 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.719
 of my parents of my grandparents certainly but 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.639
 suitable for all people 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.990
 the person who lives to eat 1200 calories must continue to eat 1200 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.750
 calories because he eats 1002 50 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.289
 after you get fat 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.060
 it doesn't cause me problems 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.430
 at the intestinal level 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.430
 these will experience life and weight gain problems 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.680
 we can keep nutrients from the integral foods in some way 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.759
 it is definitely necessary to integrate something here 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:57.780
 let's say that 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.370
 integration our foods are too distorted saints 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.559
 8 processed 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:04.990
 have not been made 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.500
 work with georgie m 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.879
 there are the 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:12.849
 the pesticides that act in the country therefore definitely an integration that can 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.289
 be a complex b as can be the lactobacilli that for me are the thing 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.429
 more important, that is, all those who are the lactobacilli who work on 

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:25.650
 intestinal flora surely the person who does not take lactobacilli always has 

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:27.020
 of the problems 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.150
 intestinal 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.830
 which can be a yogurt that can be as fair as it can be 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.110
 lancilotti dust 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.700
 which can be healthy varios 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.370
 you always need to 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.650
 take them all games 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.759
 with this that the lactobacilli 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.370
 so the probiotics are those that we 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.370
 we use 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.150
 directly in the diet or we buy in the pharmacy or in herbal medicine 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.349
 these here 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.459
 they don't hurt us, they are in excess if I eat between them and then 

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:54.180
 does not happen 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.839
 absolutely not 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:58.900
 it is a cretin but because probiotics are so important 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.379
 because they are responsible for the news 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:05.569
 of the good functioning of the intestine is the hidden organ a 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:06.570
 organ that us 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.629
 we do not know 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:10.020
 we know the heart we know 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.910
 the liver the brain 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.869
 but we do not know the flora in 

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:15.939
 intestinal bacterial 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:19.199
 about a kilogram in ours 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:21.419
 the menu of ours 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.949
 while a brain is a killer 2 the heart only 800 grams so it's a lot 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:28.249
 intestinal bacterial flora is important 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:30.000
 is perhaps the most important thing 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.020
 that we have 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.930
 our second brain 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.750
 not only soul tv thank you for being with t
