00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
testify to that we move down here this

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.690 
testify to that we move down here this
is<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.319> other<00:03:00.590> very<00:03:00.950> new<00:03:01.160> thing<00:03:01.190> that<00:03:01.430> we're

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
is the other very new thing that we're

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.449 
is the other very new thing that we're
doing<00:03:01.730> with<00:03:02.660> TRX<00:03:03.530> we<00:03:04.370> wanted<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.760> do<00:03:05.060> us<00:03:05.810> oh

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
doing with TRX we wanted to do us oh

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.970 
doing with TRX we wanted to do us oh
okay<00:03:07.459> we<00:03:07.850> wanted<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.180> do<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.989> line<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.560> symbols

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
okay we wanted to do a line of symbols

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.319 
okay we wanted to do a line of symbols
that<00:03:10.040> would<00:03:10.190> be<00:03:10.280> more<00:03:10.489> affordable<00:03:10.820> more

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
that would be more affordable more

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.080 
that would be more affordable more
accessible<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.079> even<00:03:12.799> younger<00:03:13.100> young<00:03:13.730> players

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
accessible to even younger young players

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.569 
accessible to even younger young players
and<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:15.730> CRX<00:03:16.730> is<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.840> chinese-made<00:03:18.769> symbol

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
and so CRX is a chinese-made symbol

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.030 
and so CRX is a chinese-made symbol
rather<00:03:20.180> than<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.480> Turkish<00:03:20.930> made<00:03:21.140> symbol<00:03:21.620> we

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
rather than a Turkish made symbol we

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.699 
rather than a Turkish made symbol we
still<00:03:22.340> use<00:03:22.519> be<00:03:22.790> 20<00:03:23.239> bronze<00:03:23.510> so<00:03:23.989> it's<00:03:24.170> very<00:03:24.410> high

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
still use be 20 bronze so it's very high

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.729 
still use be 20 bronze so it's very high
quality<00:03:24.980> material<00:03:25.700> but<00:03:26.660> because<00:03:27.380> it's<00:03:27.560> made

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
quality material but because it's made

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.979 
quality material but because it's made
in<00:03:27.950> China<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.730> process<00:03:29.180> they<00:03:29.359> use<00:03:29.540> is<00:03:29.780> much

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
in China the process they use is much

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.500 
in China the process they use is much
less<00:03:30.260> expensive<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:31.700> it's<00:03:31.910> about<00:03:32.060> half<00:03:32.480> the

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
less expensive so it's about half the

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.789 
less expensive so it's about half the
price<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:34.100> TRX<00:03:34.609> line<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:36.019> we<00:03:36.260> still<00:03:36.560> have

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
price of the TRX line and we still have

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.400 
price of the TRX line and we still have
our<00:03:36.829> dark<00:03:37.280> medium<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:37.940> bright<00:03:38.410> sound

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
our dark medium and bright sound

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.910 
our dark medium and bright sound
spectrum<00:03:40.180> within<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.389> we<00:03:42.109> call<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.500> instead

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
spectrum within the we call it instead

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.800

of<00:03:42.980> dark<00:03:43.250> medium<00:03:43.549> bright<00:03:43.760> we<00:03:43.880> call<00:03:44.090> it<00:03:44.239> classic

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
of dark medium bright we call it classic

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.530 
of dark medium bright we call it classic
rock<00:03:45.319> and<00:03:45.650> extreme<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:47.049> that's<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:48.319> CRC<00:03:49.100> RX

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540

classic rock extremist CRX okay

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.929 
classic rock extremist CRX okay
and<00:03:53.239> again<00:03:53.840> within<00:03:54.650> each<00:03:55.010> range<00:03:55.430> there's<00:03:55.879> a

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
and again within each range there's a

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.050 
and again within each range there's a
full<00:03:56.299> selection<00:03:56.989> of<00:03:57.470> rides<00:03:57.799> crash<00:03:58.670> rides

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
full selection of rides crash rides

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.350 
full selection of rides crash rides
crashes<00:03:59.840> China's<00:04:00.829> even<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.579> vented<00:04:01.970> symbols

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
crashes China's even the vented symbols

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.479 
crashes China's even the vented symbols
are<00:04:02.540> available<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:03.140> so<00:04:03.829> this<00:04:04.010> I<00:04:04.220> think<00:04:04.280> is

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
are available and so this I think is

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.759 
are available and so this I think is
something<00:04:04.909> very<00:04:04.939> new<00:04:05.450> for<00:04:06.260> younger<00:04:06.500> players

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
something very new for younger players

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.610 
something very new for younger players
to<00:04:07.549> have<00:04:07.700> access<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.569> this<00:04:08.750> variety<00:04:09.319> of<00:04:09.349> sounds

very<00:04:27.860> colorful<00:04:29.289> why<00:04:30.289> is<00:04:30.350> that<00:04:30.560> well<00:04:31.520> I<00:04:31.760> think

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
very colorful why is that well I think

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.670 
very colorful why is that well I think
they<00:04:32.419> make<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.750> cymbal<00:04:33.080> sound<00:04:33.289> so<00:04:33.500> much

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
they make the cymbal sound so much

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.610 
they make the cymbal sound so much
better<00:04:34.360> it's<00:04:35.360> like<00:04:35.600> your<00:04:35.780> symbol<00:04:36.139> is<00:04:36.260> riding

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
better it's like your symbol is riding

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.740 
better it's like your symbol is riding
on<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:36.770> cushion<00:04:37.010> of<00:04:37.310> air<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:38.120> we<00:04:38.360> notice<00:04:38.720> that

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
on a cushion of air and we notice that

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.370 
on a cushion of air and we notice that
it's<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.940> symbol<00:04:40.940> as<00:04:41.060> much<00:04:41.330> fuller<00:04:41.690> sounding

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
it's a symbol as much fuller sounding

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.180 
it's a symbol as much fuller sounding
much<00:04:42.590> more<00:04:42.889> resonant<00:04:43.520> longer<00:04:43.850> DK<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:45.830> colored

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
much more resonant longer DK the colored

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.520 
much more resonant longer DK the colored
ones<00:04:46.220> i<00:04:46.760> think<00:04:47.030> sim<00:04:47.510> pads<00:04:47.750> new<00:04:48.020> colors<00:04:48.380> are

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
ones i think sim pads new colors are

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.080 
ones i think sim pads new colors are
purple<00:04:48.740> and<00:04:48.949> red<00:04:49.070> this<00:04:49.370> year<00:04:49.610> they've<00:04:49.789> had<00:04:49.820> the

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
other orange and blue ones for a while

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.950 
other orange and blue ones for a while
they<00:04:52.130> have<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.370> black<00:04:52.610> ones<00:04:52.940> so<00:04:53.599> we're<00:04:53.930> very
