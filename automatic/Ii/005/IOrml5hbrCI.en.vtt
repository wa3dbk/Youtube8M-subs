is the 35 millimeter f/2 the f-14 was
really<00:03:08.299> several<00:03:08.599> years<00:03:08.900> after<00:03:09.319> after<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.859> f2

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
really several years after after the f2

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.000 
really several years after after the f2
let's<00:03:11.599> take<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.810> look<00:03:12.019> at<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.410> relative<00:03:12.680> size
