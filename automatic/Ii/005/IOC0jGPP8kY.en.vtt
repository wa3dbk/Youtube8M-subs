 his company today has 500 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.420
 consulting engineers

 larger companies and among these 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.270
 high level specialists 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.520

 twice as high as at the exit of

 engineering schools women are very 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.520
 appreciated since it brings a 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.530
 opening a different approach in 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.940
 the engineering profession but it's 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.370
 find out very early in schools 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.780
 of engineers and therefore we see 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.270
 also we at our customers 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.829
 so here not only is there no 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.750
 difference in wages no 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.940
 only the board of directors around

 of the CEO is composed of four men and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.870
 four women but in addition the company 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.540
 strives to reconcile work and 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.250
 hiring maternity explained that 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.890
 I was a young mother I wanted 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.010
 resume a new activity and we have 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.570
 indicated that the company was in favor 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.700
 precisely the modulation of the schedules 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.759
 working 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.380
 if necessary or if constraint with the child 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.759
 I was lucky to be able to work 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.259
 from home also to do some 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.560
 telecommuting while having confidence 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.600
 of my managers who let me handle 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.729
 this daily activity supports 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.189

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.340
 we always ask a little more 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.210
 women maybe better welcome after 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.500
 we have to show that we are serious and 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.759
 it may be a little bit more 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.770
 difficult when one is a woman to be 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.350
 taken seriously and hinders giving 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.969
 proof that for 30 years and the first 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.360
 legislation on parity men 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.790
 women 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.119
