I just worry about the second the second
set<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.650> crystals<00:00:11.099> after<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.120> rotation<00:00:12.719> is

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
set of crystals after the rotation is

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.519 
set of crystals after the rotation is
done<00:00:14.210> yeah<00:00:15.210> free<00:00:15.540> someone<00:00:15.900> up<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.139> case<00:00:16.350> we

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
now cuz we can we take the whole crystal

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.100 
now cuz we can we take the whole crystal
it's<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.430> every<00:01:56.850> other<00:01:56.969> crystal<00:01:57.539> we<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.960> pump

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
it's the every other crystal we can pump

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.520 
it's the every other crystal we can pump
or<00:01:58.320> go<00:01:58.469> down<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.960> up<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.110> mean<00:02:01.289> you<00:02:01.439> can

do with two soakers even if both are
taking<00:02:05.610> both<00:02:05.759> crystals<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.509> just<00:02:06.720> need<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:07.049> get

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
taking both crystals we just need to get
