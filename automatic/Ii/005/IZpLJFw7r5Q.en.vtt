00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599 
advanced mechanical trick this has been

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.929 
advanced mechanical trick this has been
known<00:00:19.930> for<00:00:20.260> a<00:00:20.289> while<00:00:20.380> but<00:00:20.949> I<00:00:21.220> actually<00:00:21.580> want<00:00:21.849> to

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
known for a while but I actually want to

known for a while but I actually want to
make<00:00:22.060> a<00:00:22.090> video<00:00:22.300> in<00:00:22.630> September<00:00:23.380> but<00:00:23.650> I<00:00:23.800> didn't

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
make a video in September but I didn't

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.200 
make a video in September but I didn't
really<00:00:24.189> get<00:00:24.369> around<00:00:24.460> to<00:00:24.759> it<00:00:24.789> I<00:00:24.910> thought<00:00:25.060> it<00:00:25.150> was

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
really get around to it I thought it was

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.609 
really get around to it I thought it was
stupid<00:00:25.360> to<00:00:25.539> make<00:00:25.630> a<00:00:25.660> video<00:00:25.869> but<00:00:26.079> here's<00:00:26.560> a

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
stupid to make a video but here's a

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.409 
stupid to make a video but here's a
video<00:00:26.860> so<00:00:27.340> basically<00:00:27.730> i<00:00:27.759> call<00:00:28.000> it<00:00:28.090> the<00:00:28.119> flash

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
video so basically i call it the flash

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.450 
video so basically i call it the flash
dash<00:00:28.720> bump<00:00:29.110> because<00:00:29.890> essentially<00:00:30.220> what

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
dash bump because essentially what

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.769 
dash bump because essentially what
you're<00:00:30.550> doing<00:00:30.849> with<00:00:30.970> this<00:00:31.119> is<00:00:31.360> you're<00:00:31.630> going

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
you're doing with this is you're going

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.180 
you're doing with this is you're going
to<00:00:31.869> do<00:00:31.989> your<00:00:32.140> dash<00:00:32.290> and<00:00:32.770> then<00:00:32.950> you're<00:00:33.040> going<00:00:33.130> to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
to do your dash and then you're going to

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.290 
to do your dash and then you're going to
flash<00:00:33.399> with<00:00:33.579> someone<00:00:33.910> and<00:00:34.000> you're<00:00:34.090> going<00:00:34.239> to

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
flash with someone and you're going to

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.180 
flash with someone and you're going to
try<00:00:34.450> and<00:00:34.480> bump<00:00:34.809> into<00:00:35.110> them<00:00:35.230> with<00:00:35.410> that<00:00:35.440> flash<00:00:35.800> I

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
try and bump into them with that flash I

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.920 
try and bump into them with that flash I
will<00:00:36.550> demonstrate<00:00:36.670> an<00:00:37.059> example<00:00:37.540> of<00:00:37.630> what<00:00:37.840> it

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
will demonstrate an example of what it

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.979 
will demonstrate an example of what it
should<00:00:37.960> look<00:00:38.140> like<00:00:39.480> there<00:00:40.480> you<00:00:40.600> go<00:00:40.750> please

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
should look like there you go please

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.660 
should look like there you go please
will<00:00:41.440> remember<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:41.950> name<00:00:42.070> of<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:42.250> range<00:00:42.460> of

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
will remember the name of the range of

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.910 
will remember the name of the range of
your<00:00:42.820> flash<00:00:43.090> and<00:00:43.300> dash<00:00:43.480> and<00:00:43.870> also<00:00:44.440> don't<00:00:44.649> flash

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
your flash and dash and also don't flash

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.709 
your flash and dash and also don't flash
at<00:00:45.249> the<00:00:45.339> end<00:00:45.519> of<00:00:45.609> your<00:00:45.730> dash<00:00:45.940> as<00:00:46.269> a<00:00:46.359> can

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
at the end of your dash as a can

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.720 
at the end of your dash as a can
backfire<00:00:47.140> this<00:00:47.649> obviously<00:00:47.829> takes<00:00:48.309> like<00:00:48.519> one

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
backfire this obviously takes like one

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.279 
backfire this obviously takes like one
or<00:00:48.879> three<00:00:48.999> tries<00:00:49.269> to<00:00:49.539> get<00:00:49.660> used<00:00:49.870> to<00:00:50.019> and<00:00:50.170> then

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
or three tries to get used to and then

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.560 
or three tries to get used to and then
once<00:00:50.499> you<00:00:50.620> get<00:00:50.769> used<00:00:50.949> to<00:00:51.010> it<00:00:51.100> easy<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:52.030> get<00:00:52.480> the

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
once you get used to it easy to get the

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.029 
once you get used to it easy to get the
hang<00:00:52.659> of<00:00:52.749> it<00:00:52.870> now<00:00:53.050> let's<00:00:53.289> answer<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.620> question

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
hang of it now let's answer the question

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.250 
hang of it now let's answer the question
why<00:00:54.489> would<00:00:54.699> you<00:00:54.850> ever<00:00:55.030> want<00:00:55.449> to<00:00:55.539> do<00:00:55.839> this<00:00:56.079> in

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
why would you ever want to do this in

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.930 
why would you ever want to do this in
the<00:00:56.289> first<00:00:56.350> place<00:00:56.620> model<00:00:57.010> just<00:00:57.219> flash<00:00:57.579> and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
the first place model just flash and

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.119 
the first place model just flash and
then<00:00:58.359> dash<00:00:58.629> and<00:00:59.050> get<00:00:59.350> more<00:00:59.469> accuracy<00:00:59.829> doing

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
then dash and get more accuracy doing

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.250 
then dash and get more accuracy doing
that<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.699> main<00:01:00.850> sole<00:01:01.120> reason<00:01:01.329> is<00:01:01.690> because<00:01:02.019> the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
that the main sole reason is because the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.560 
that the main sole reason is because the
enemy<00:01:02.379> cannot<00:01:02.859> react<00:01:03.249> to<00:01:03.489> it<00:01:03.519> a<00:01:03.789> person<00:01:04.449> will

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
enemy cannot react to it a person will

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.850 
enemy cannot react to it a person will
see<00:01:04.690> you<00:01:04.809> dashing<00:01:05.019> from<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.440> distance<00:01:05.800> that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
see you dashing from a distance that

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.469 
see you dashing from a distance that
won't<00:01:06.130> reach<00:01:06.340> them<00:01:06.610> so<00:01:07.000> in<00:01:07.150> their<00:01:07.270> mind

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
won't reach them so in their mind

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:08.760 
won't reach them so in their mind
they'll<00:01:07.659> be<00:01:07.750> like<00:01:07.870> they<00:01:08.200> can't<00:01:08.440> hit<00:01:08.590> me

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
they'll be like they can't hit me

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.649 
they'll be like they can't hit me
they're<00:01:08.979> too<00:01:09.100> far<00:01:09.280> away<00:01:09.430> but<00:01:10.120> when<00:01:10.180> you<00:01:10.420> flash

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
they're too far away but when you flash

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.570 
they're too far away but when you flash
you<00:01:11.020> can<00:01:11.170> catch<00:01:11.350> them<00:01:11.500> off<00:01:11.650> guard<00:01:11.680> now<00:01:12.280> let's

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
you can catch them off guard now let's

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.890 
you can catch them off guard now let's
look<00:01:12.729> at<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:12.940> contrast<00:01:13.390> where<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:13.750> did<00:01:13.870> a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
look at the contrast where you did a

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.050 
look at the contrast where you did a
flash<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:14.560> then<00:01:14.740> dash<00:01:14.979> good<00:01:15.640> players<00:01:15.909> will

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
flash and then dash good players will

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.520 
flash and then dash good players will
see<00:01:16.180> that<00:01:16.300> when<00:01:16.420> you<00:01:16.540> flash<00:01:16.780> first<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.439> then

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
see that when you flash first and then

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.620 
see that when you flash first and then
dash<00:01:17.770> they<00:01:18.490> can<00:01:18.640> react<00:01:18.909> it<00:01:19.030> apart<00:01:19.329> where<00:01:19.509> you

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
dash they can react it apart where you

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.209 
dash they can react it apart where you
dashing<00:01:19.899> by<00:01:20.229> just<00:01:20.439> flashing<00:01:20.829> out<00:01:20.920> of<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.070> way

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
dashing by just flashing out of the way

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.950 
dashing by just flashing out of the way
one<00:01:21.670> disadvantage<00:01:21.820> about<00:01:22.509> this<00:01:22.689> trick<00:01:22.930> is

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
one disadvantage about this trick is

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.170 
one disadvantage about this trick is
that<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.619> does<00:01:23.829> cover<00:01:24.130> less<00:01:24.490> distance<00:01:24.939> than<00:01:25.149> a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
that it does cover less distance than a

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.590 
that it does cover less distance than a
flash<00:01:25.509> dash<00:01:25.840> as<00:01:26.200> contrary<00:01:27.100> to<00:01:27.270> dashing<00:01:28.270> and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
flash dash as contrary to dashing and

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.899 
flash dash as contrary to dashing and
then<00:01:28.750> flashing<00:01:29.289> now<00:01:30.219> this<00:01:30.340> trick<00:01:30.520> works<00:01:30.700> on

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
then flashing now this trick works on

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.550 
then flashing now this trick works on
most<00:01:31.119> champions<00:01:31.570> who<00:01:31.750> have<00:01:32.079> an<00:01:32.229> animation

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
most champions who have an animation

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.980 
most champions who have an animation
where<00:01:32.979> they<00:01:33.159> are<00:01:33.490> dashing<00:01:34.450> and<00:01:34.570> have<00:01:34.689> to<00:01:34.840> bump

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
where they are dashing and have to bump

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.510 
where they are dashing and have to bump
into<00:01:35.140> someone<00:01:35.380> this<00:01:35.829> trick<00:01:36.039> should<00:01:36.219> be<00:01:36.310> used

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
into someone this trick should be used

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.010 
into someone this trick should be used
with<00:01:36.670> champions<00:01:37.149> who<00:01:37.270> have<00:01:37.420> some<00:01:37.570> crowd

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
with champions who have some crowd

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.929 
with champions who have some crowd
control<00:01:38.049> to<00:01:38.500> their<00:01:38.619> dashing<00:01:38.979> ability<00:01:39.369> here's

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
control to their dashing ability here's

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.160 
control to their dashing ability here's
a<00:01:40.030> list<00:01:40.240> of<00:01:40.329> champions<00:01:40.719> who<00:01:40.810> are<00:01:40.899> most<00:01:41.079> useful

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
a list of champions who are most useful

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.050 
a list of champions who are most useful
with<00:01:41.560> this<00:01:41.710> trick<00:01:42.009> first<00:01:42.430> off<00:01:42.579> let's<00:01:42.759> go<00:01:42.909> over

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
with this trick first off let's go over

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.020 
with this trick first off let's go over
a<00:01:43.149> Shen<00:01:43.390> Shen<00:01:43.990> has<00:01:44.170> a<00:01:44.200> 1.5<00:01:44.590> second<00:01:45.100> stun<00:01:45.340> his

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
a Shen Shen has a 1.5 second stun his

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.639 
a Shen Shen has a 1.5 second stun his
dash<00:01:46.270> also<00:01:46.600> doesn't<00:01:46.869> stop<00:01:47.109> when<00:01:47.259> he<00:01:47.320> collides

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
dash also doesn't stop when he collides

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.440 
dash also doesn't stop when he collides
with<00:01:47.740> an<00:01:47.829> enemy<00:01:48.070> so<00:01:48.700> example<00:01:49.090> he<00:01:49.149> can<00:01:49.270> start

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
with an enemy so example he can start

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.300 
with an enemy so example he can start
dashing<00:01:49.659> and<00:01:50.170> then<00:01:50.380> he<00:01:50.469> gets<00:01:50.649> hit<00:01:50.799> someone<00:01:51.159> and

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
dashing and then he gets hit someone and

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.770 
dashing and then he gets hit someone and
they<00:01:51.490> can<00:01:51.640> flash<00:01:51.789> them<00:01:51.939> to<00:01:52.030> someone<00:01:52.180> else<00:01:52.420> the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
they can flash them to someone else the

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.919 
they can flash them to someone else the
second<00:01:53.140> would<00:01:53.200> be<00:01:53.729> gragas<00:01:54.729> I'd<00:01:55.479> say<00:01:55.659> this<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:55.899> a

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
second would be gragas I'd say this is a

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.510 
second would be gragas I'd say this is a
pretty<00:01:56.170> crucial<00:01:56.380> skill<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.829> Lance<00:01:57.009> if<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:57.369> does

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
pretty crucial skill to Lance if it does

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.279 
pretty crucial skill to Lance if it does
a<00:01:57.549> lot<00:01:57.729> of<00:01:57.789> damage<00:01:58.090> since<00:01:58.359> what<00:01:58.570> Gragas<00:01:58.929> is<00:01:59.049> our

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
a lot of damage since what Gragas is our

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.230 
a lot of damage since what Gragas is our
AP<00:01:59.679> and<00:01:59.859> it's<00:02:00.070> an<00:02:00.219> important<00:02:00.700> part<00:02:00.939> of<00:02:01.090> his

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
AP and it's an important part of his

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.880 
AP and it's an important part of his
brush<00:02:01.450> combo<00:02:01.899> and<00:02:02.079> since<00:02:02.469> the<00:02:02.560> enemy<00:02:02.799> is

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
brush combo and since the enemy is

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.139 
brush combo and since the enemy is
slowed<00:02:03.100> he<00:02:03.219> could<00:02:03.340> land<00:02:03.520> his<00:02:03.670> skill<00:02:03.909> shots

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
slowed he could land his skill shots

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.330 
slowed he could land his skill shots
like<00:02:04.329> this<00:02:04.450> QR<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.320> third<00:02:05.530> would<00:02:05.740> be<00:02:05.770> cedrone

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
like this QR the third would be cedrone

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.969 
like this QR the third would be cedrone
as<00:02:06.700> your<00:02:06.939> dash<00:02:07.149> is<00:02:07.539> about<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.110> 1<00:02:08.350> second<00:02:08.830> knock

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
as your dash is about a 1 second knock

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:09.749 
as your dash is about a 1 second knock
up

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
up

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.009 
up
and<00:02:09.849> after<00:02:10.119> that<00:02:10.239> she<00:02:10.299> can<00:02:10.599> follow<00:02:10.810> up<00:02:10.989> with

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
and after that she can follow up with

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.199 
and after that she can follow up with
many<00:02:11.319> spells<00:02:11.709> like<00:02:11.980> her<00:02:12.159> ultimate<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.909> slow

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
many spells like her ultimate and slow

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.179 
many spells like her ultimate and slow
so<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.780> feel<00:02:14.019> that's<00:02:14.110> pretty<00:02:14.349> good<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.739> at

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
so I feel that's pretty good and at

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:16.860 
so I feel that's pretty good and at
fourth<00:02:15.430> place<00:02:15.489> we<00:02:15.760> have<00:02:15.849> Jarvan<00:02:16.299> the<00:02:16.599> reason

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
fourth place we have Jarvan the reason

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.240 
fourth place we have Jarvan the reason
Jarvan<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.260> probably<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.590> last<00:02:17.769> one<00:02:18.069> is

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
Jarvan is probably the last one is

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.399 
Jarvan is probably the last one is
because<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.790> damage<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.269> not<00:02:19.299> applied<00:02:19.870> when

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
because the damage is not applied when

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:21.929 
because the damage is not applied when
he<00:02:20.500> knock<00:02:20.680> someone<00:02:21.010> up<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:21.430> only<00:02:21.519> applied

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
he knock someone up it's only applied

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.210 
he knock someone up it's only applied
when<00:02:22.120> his<00:02:22.239> spear<00:02:22.629> hits<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.470> that<00:02:23.680> last<00:02:23.920> place

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
when his spear hits and that last place

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.190 
when his spear hits and that last place
we<00:02:24.400> have<00:02:24.519> tryndamere<00:02:25.390> because<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:26.049> only

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
we have tryndamere because the only

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.050 
we have tryndamere because the only
thing<00:02:26.319> he<00:02:26.680> applies<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.400> damaged<00:02:27.849> and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
thing he applies this is damaged and

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.399 
thing he applies this is damaged and
here's<00:02:28.480> at<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.690> end<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:28.959> video<00:02:29.140> hope<00:02:29.319> you
