today I'm looking at the Lili pc5

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.250 
today I'm looking at the Lili pc5
aluminum<00:00:22.590> case<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.640> case<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.180> all<00:00:24.630> aluminum

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
aluminum case this case is all aluminum

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.109 
aluminum case this case is all aluminum
except<00:00:25.680> for<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.100> front<00:00:26.400> piece<00:00:26.670> right<00:00:27.090> here

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
except for the front piece right here

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.679 
except for the front piece right here
which<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.110> plastic<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.730> case<00:00:30.000> weighs<00:00:30.360> in

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
which is plastic in this case weighs in

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.110 
which is plastic in this case weighs in
at<00:00:30.810> around<00:00:30.960> 11<00:00:31.919> pounds<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:32.700> extremely

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
at around 11 pounds so it's extremely

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
at the back of the case at the very top

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.740 
at the back of the case at the very top
is<00:01:26.160> where<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.580> power<00:01:26.850> supply<00:01:27.120> gets<00:01:27.510> installed

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
is where the power supply gets installed

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.930 
is where the power supply gets installed
now<00:01:28.050> there's<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.560> power<00:01:28.860> supply<00:01:29.070> plate<00:01:29.640> here

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
now there's a power supply plate here

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.150 
now there's a power supply plate here
and<00:01:30.120> what<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.350> plate<00:01:31.710> which<00:01:31.920> gets

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
and what that is is a plate which gets

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.940 
and what that is is a plate which gets
installed<00:01:32.460> onto<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.210> power<00:01:33.480> supply<00:01:33.690> first<00:01:34.380> then

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
installed onto a power supply first then

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.800 
installed onto a power supply first then
you<00:01:35.040> go<00:01:35.190> ahead<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.520> place<00:01:35.910> it<00:01:36.090> back<00:01:36.330> in<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
you go ahead and place it back in and

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
you go ahead and place it back in and
screw<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.380> into<00:01:37.560> place<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.820> to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
screw it into place that is just to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.450 
screw it into place that is just to
allow<00:01:39.270> easier<00:01:39.960> installation<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.250> power

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
allow easier installation of the power

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.850 
allow easier installation of the power
supply<00:01:41.730> we<00:01:42.360> also<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:43.200> fan<00:01:43.500> you're<00:01:43.710> in

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
supply we also have one fan you're in

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.710 
supply we also have one fan you're in
the<00:01:43.980> back<00:01:44.190> exhausting<00:01:45.120> here<00:01:45.330> so<00:01:45.540> you've<00:01:45.690> got

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the back exhausting here so you've got

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.960 
the back exhausting here so you've got
two<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.380> front<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.580> at<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.820> back

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
two in the front and one at the back

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.790 
two in the front and one at the back
that's<00:01:48.300> going<00:01:48.660> to<00:01:48.840> allow<00:01:48.960> good<00:01:49.530> circulation

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
that's going to allow good circulation

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.430 
that's going to allow good circulation
of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.550> air<00:01:50.700> through<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.480> case<00:01:51.750> also

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
of the air through the case also

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.350 
of the air through the case also
included<00:01:52.800> is<00:01:52.920> an<00:01:53.130> i/o<00:01:53.340> shield<00:01:53.550> plate<00:01:54.150> and

protrude through once you have the
motherboard<00:02:01.080> installed<00:02:01.890> you'll<00:02:02.340> also<00:02:02.610> notice

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
motherboard installed you'll also notice

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.300 
motherboard installed you'll also notice
that<00:02:03.240> thumb<00:02:03.720> screws<00:02:04.080> are<00:02:04.320> theme<00:02:04.890> throughout

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
that thumb screws are theme throughout

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.730 
that thumb screws are theme throughout
the<00:02:05.580> case<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.360> makes<00:02:06.660> it<00:02:06.840> very<00:02:07.080> easy<00:02:07.200> to

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the case and that makes it very easy to

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.249 
the case and that makes it very easy to
remove<00:02:08.250> for<00:02:08.550> example<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.360> side<00:02:09.629> panels<00:02:10.110> on

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
remove for example the side panels on

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.589 
remove for example the side panels on
the<00:02:10.560> case<00:02:10.769> now<00:02:11.400> let<00:02:11.580> me<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:11.700> show<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.150> how

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
the case now let me just show you how

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.140 
the case now let me just show you how

actually works first of all remove the
plate<00:02:17.340> then<00:02:17.940> you'll<00:02:18.120> need<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.450> install<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.989> on

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
plate then you'll need to install it on

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.280 
plate then you'll need to install it on
the<00:02:19.620> power<00:02:19.830> supply<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.489> once<00:02:21.269> installed<00:02:21.900> go

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
the power supply and once installed go

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.770 
the power supply and once installed go
ahead<00:02:22.560> then<00:02:22.590> slip<00:02:23.340> all<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.850> cables<00:02:24.300> from<00:02:24.570> the

ahead then slip all the cables from the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.730 
ahead then slip all the cables from the
power<00:02:24.960> supply

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
power supply

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.300

go<00:02:26.100> through<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.670> back<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.450> case<00:02:27.720> and

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
go through the back of the case and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.060 
go through the back of the case and
carefully<00:02:29.310> insert<00:02:30.150> power<00:02:31.020> supply<00:02:31.530> like<00:02:31.770> so

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
carefully insert power supply like so

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.370 
carefully insert power supply like so
once<00:02:32.580> you've<00:02:32.760> done<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.000> then<00:02:33.450> go<00:02:33.870> ahead<00:02:34.050> take

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
once you've done that then go ahead take

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.640 
once you've done that then go ahead take
these<00:02:34.650> four<00:02:35.100> thumb<00:02:35.550> screws<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.210> just<00:02:37.170> mount
