can<00:01:38.409> go<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.619> it's<00:01:39.220> useful<00:01:39.700> for<00:01:39.729> sniping<00:01:40.659> parts

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
can go and it's useful for sniping parts

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.800 
can go and it's useful for sniping parts
no<00:01:41.950> here<00:01:42.460> on<00:01:43.149> my<00:01:43.360> position<00:01:44.080> here<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:46.479> want<00:01:46.689> to
