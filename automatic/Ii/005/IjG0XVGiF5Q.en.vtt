attention during survivor 2299 but I

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.620 
attention during survivor 2299 but I

where there was so much going on that
was<00:02:22.400> so<00:02:22.520> exciting<00:02:22.910> about<00:02:22.970> fallout<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.540> day

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.960 
was so exciting about fallout that day
that<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:24.590> was<00:02:24.860> just<00:02:25.070> swept<00:02:25.580> under<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.880> rug

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970

you look very closely you can see a map

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.270 
you look very closely you can see a map
in<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.020> background<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:33.500> was<00:02:33.590> like<00:02:33.710> no<00:02:33.950> no<00:02:33.980> I

wrinkles then I looked very closely and
you<00:02:38.270> actually<00:02:38.420> see<00:02:38.690> distinct<00:02:39.170> lines<00:02:39.380> cutting

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
you actually see distinct lines cutting

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.950 
you actually see distinct lines cutting
off<00:02:39.980> separate<00:02:40.430> parts<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:40.880> map<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.360> was<00:02:41.840> like

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
off separate parts of the map I was like

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.610 
off separate parts of the map I was like
holy<00:02:42.520> shit<00:02:43.630> I'm<00:02:44.630> not<00:02:44.840> gonna<00:02:44.990> overthink<00:02:45.290> this

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
holy shit I'm not gonna overthink this

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.930 
holy shit I'm not gonna overthink this
one<00:02:45.830> though<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.400> only<00:02:46.550> thing<00:02:46.790> what

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
one though this is the only thing what

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.430 
one though this is the only thing what
Ted<00:02:47.180> skeptical<00:02:47.780> about<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.170> could<00:02:48.320> have<00:02:48.410> just

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
Ted skeptical about that could have just

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.680 
Ted skeptical about that could have just
been<00:02:48.620> minor<00:02:49.340> inconvenience<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:50.120> make<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:50.480> just

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
been minor inconvenience to make it just

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.330 
been minor inconvenience to make it just
look<00:02:50.870> like<00:02:50.900> it's<00:02:51.260> old<00:02:51.500> or<00:02:51.830> something<00:02:52.100> like

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
look like it's old or something like

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.090 
look like it's old or something like
that<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:53.030> yeah<00:02:53.240> as<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:53.450> see<00:02:53.630> i<00:02:53.950> disregarded<00:02:54.950> it

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
that so yeah as you see i disregarded it

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.160 
that so yeah as you see i disregarded it
and<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.610> didn't<00:02:55.910> even<00:02:55.970> think<00:02:56.270> twice<00:02:56.510> about<00:02:56.630> this

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
and I didn't even think twice about this

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.810 
and I didn't even think twice about this
could<00:02:57.350> be<00:02:57.500> some<00:02:58.010> pretty<00:02:58.160> big<00:02:58.400> evidence

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
could be some pretty big evidence

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.250 
could be some pretty big evidence
because<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.090> all<00:02:59.240> happened<00:02:59.570> on<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.660> big<00:02:59.870> day<00:03:00.050> and

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
because it all happened on a big day and

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.410 
because it all happened on a big day and
it<00:03:00.350> didn't<00:03:00.620> come<00:03:00.860> from<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.520> survivor<00:03:01.910> 2299

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
it didn't come from the survivor 2299

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.650 
it didn't come from the survivor 2299
website<00:03:03.320> people<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:04.130> came<00:03:04.550> from<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:05.210> big<00:03:05.420> boys

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660

at<00:03:05.990> home<00:03:06.200> but<00:03:06.440> des<00:03:06.680> des<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:07.490> that's<00:03:07.760> one<00:03:07.940> of

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
at home but des des so that's one of

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.130 
at home but des des so that's one of
those<00:03:08.120> things<00:03:08.180> where<00:03:08.450> I<00:03:08.570> was<00:03:08.750> just<00:03:08.870> kind<00:03:09.110> of

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
those things where I was just kind of

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.740 
those things where I was just kind of
like<00:03:09.320> I<00:03:09.560> know<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.340> um<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:11.270> know<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.600> it

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
like I know that um you know that it

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.690 
like I know that um you know that it
sounds<00:03:12.290> far-fetched<00:03:12.590> but<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.220> same<00:03:13.430> thing

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
sounds far-fetched but the same thing

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.970 
sounds far-fetched but the same thing
it's<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:14.090> cryptic<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.870> interesting<00:03:15.470> you

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
it's so cryptic and interesting you

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.160 
it's so cryptic and interesting you
almost<00:03:16.130> want<00:03:16.520> it<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.760> be<00:03:16.940> something<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:18.050> it

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
almost want it to be something and it

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.750 
almost want it to be something and it
looks<00:03:18.470> like<00:03:18.709> something<00:03:19.010> when<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.400> once<00:03:19.640> again

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
looks like something when you once again

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.940 
looks like something when you once again
look<00:03:20.030> at<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.209> side-by-side<00:03:20.530> comparison<00:03:21.530> I'm

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
look at the side-by-side comparison I'm

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.800 
look at the side-by-side comparison I'm
not<00:03:22.280> really<00:03:22.430> stretching<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.120> when<00:03:23.270> I<00:03:23.300> say<00:03:23.600> it

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
not really stretching it when I say it

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.570 
not really stretching it when I say it
does<00:03:24.020> look<00:03:24.230> like<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.590> map<00:03:24.739> of<00:03:24.890> Boston<00:03:25.100> in<00:03:25.489> the

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
does look like the map of Boston in the

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.640 
does look like the map of Boston in the
background<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.209> once<00:03:26.810> again<00:03:26.900> as<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.500> will

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
background and once again as I will

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.910 
background and once again as I will
repeat<00:03:28.040> myself<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:29.300> came<00:03:29.630> from<00:03:29.840> Bethesda<00:03:30.590> so

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
repeat myself it came from Bethesda so

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.800 
repeat myself it came from Bethesda so
it's<00:03:31.370> one<00:03:31.520> of<00:03:31.580> those<00:03:31.700> things<00:03:31.760> where<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.150> think

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
it's one of those things where I think

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.140 
it's one of those things where I think
this<00:03:32.959> is<00:03:33.110> honestly<00:03:33.580> fallout<00:03:34.580> 4<00:03:34.610> is<00:03:34.850> most

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
this is honestly fallout 4 is most

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.229 
this is honestly fallout 4 is most
mysterious<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:36.080> unanswered<00:03:36.920> rumor<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.730> it's

mysterious and unanswered rumor and it's
one<00:03:38.390> of<00:03:38.480> those<00:03:38.540> things<00:03:38.600> that<00:03:38.810> just<00:03:38.900> kind<00:03:39.170> of

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
one of those things that just kind of

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.600 
one of those things that just kind of
gets<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.530> me<00:03:39.709> because<00:03:39.860> it's<00:03:40.070> like<00:03:40.130> I<00:03:40.340> want
