so I'm following Anna's plans
I've<00:01:28.310> made<00:01:28.640> some<00:01:28.940> drill<00:01:29.270> holes<00:01:29.600> in<00:01:29.900> my<00:01:30.170> piece

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
I've made some drill holes in my piece

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.530 
I've made some drill holes in my piece
if<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:31.280> have<00:01:31.370> a<00:01:31.430> crack<00:01:31.670> jag<00:01:31.940> you<00:01:32.150> could<00:01:32.330> use

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
if you have a crack jag you could use

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.600 
if you have a crack jag you could use
that<00:01:32.780> during<00:01:33.110> this<00:01:33.320> time<00:01:33.620> but<00:01:34.370> what<00:01:34.490> we're

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
that during this time but what we're

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.210 
that during this time but what we're
gonna<00:01:34.730> do<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.360> after<00:01:36.170> I've<00:01:36.350> made<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.650> drill

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
gonna do is after I've made the drill

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.580 
gonna do is after I've made the drill
holes<00:01:37.490> just<00:01:37.910> take<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.090> nail<00:01:38.410> poke<00:01:39.410> it<00:01:39.560> through

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
holes just take a nail poke it through

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.370 
holes just take a nail poke it through
the<00:01:39.950> hole<00:01:40.160> so<00:01:40.190> that<00:01:40.580> you<00:01:40.729> know<00:01:41.000> exactly<00:01:41.380> where

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
the hole so that you know exactly where

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.250 
the hole so that you know exactly where
you<00:01:42.979> want<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.430> make<00:01:43.640> your<00:01:43.850> next<00:01:44.150> drill<00:01:44.750> point

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
you want to make your next drill point

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.940 
you want to make your next drill point
so<00:01:45.920> I<00:01:45.979> make<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.160> little<00:01:46.340> indentation<00:01:46.790> on<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:48.590> my

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
so I make a little indentation on to my

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.380 
so I make a little indentation on to my
board<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:49.490> now<00:01:49.580> I<00:01:49.610> know<00:01:49.729> exactly<00:01:50.150> where<00:01:50.360> to

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
board and now I know exactly where to

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.609 
board and now I know exactly where to
drill<00:01:52.030> once<00:01:53.030> you've<00:01:53.240> made<00:01:53.450> all<00:01:53.750> of<00:01:53.810> your<00:01:54.229> drill

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
drill once you've made all of your drill

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.200 
drill once you've made all of your drill
holes<00:01:54.920> you're<00:01:55.100> going<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.310> use<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.520> wood<00:01:55.790> screws

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
holes you're going to use a wood screws

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.910 
holes you're going to use a wood screws
to<00:01:56.510> attach<00:01:56.630> your<00:01:57.200> wood<00:01:57.410> pieces<00:01:57.680> together<00:02:02.920> so
