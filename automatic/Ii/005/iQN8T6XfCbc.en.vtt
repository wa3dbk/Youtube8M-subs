00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.059
 read on the forum and in the group 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.860
 Pandavas last 3 months 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.440
 the administration of the pandavas is if 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.270
 generalized working with the project in all 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:51.290
 and tightly engaged in the development of the core on

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:59.780
 this very both t-54 8s what 's here 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.170
 especial is of course starting from the 90th 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.800
 level as you see in this post 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.810
 things are still relevant pvp season 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.610
 actual thing and dad season can 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.220
 buy for free 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.190
 various a-currency available when creating 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.900
 the character was also buried behind the characters 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.330
 a t-54 2 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.939
 I also have a couple of them 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.430
 characters so don't be surprised 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.549
 no commands unavailable 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.189
 arena teams are implied as well 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.009
 after completing the experience this real will 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.090
 disabled now let's see how 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.310
 connect 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.490
 if someone did not understand then you 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.579
 a good example let's start point by point 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.790
 first you need to make a copy of the current 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.979
 client in a new folder because it plays 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.009
 from one client on two versions not 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.159
 recommended there may be problems due 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.700
 differences in them let's start with this 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.829
 of the moment 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.990
 go to our folder where we have 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.480
