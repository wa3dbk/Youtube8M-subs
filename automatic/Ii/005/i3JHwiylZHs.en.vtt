right heavy Zuka hooker strategy I'm

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.700 
right heavy Zuka hooker strategy I'm
only<00:00:23.550> using<00:00:23.730> two<00:00:24.029> boats<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.570> heavies<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
only using two boats of heavies and the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.470 
only using two boats of heavies and the
rest<00:00:25.920> zookas<00:00:26.310> because<00:00:26.519> i<00:00:26.580> need<00:00:26.760> firepower<00:00:27.029> for

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
rest zookas because i need firepower for

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.620 
rest zookas because i need firepower for
this<00:00:27.630> that's<00:00:27.900> all<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.170> need<00:00:28.670> my<00:00:29.670> heavies<00:00:30.300> are

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
this that's all we need my heavies are

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.190 
this that's all we need my heavies are
level<00:00:31.380> level<00:00:32.369> 9<00:00:32.579> I've<00:00:33.480> only<00:00:33.630> got<00:00:33.780> standard

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
level level 9 I've only got standard

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.049 
level level 9 I've only got standard
boost<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.680> from<00:00:35.070> what<00:00:35.190> my<00:00:35.280> statues<00:00:35.730> are<00:00:35.910> which

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
boost on from what my statues are which

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.720 
boost on from what my statues are which
is<00:00:36.180> very<00:00:36.420> low<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.930> they're<00:00:37.800> level<00:00:38.040> 9<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.610> my

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
is very low so they're level 9 and my

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.610 
is very low so they're level 9 and my
zookas<00:00:39.120> are<00:00:39.360> level<00:00:39.809> 8<00:00:39.960> they're<00:00:40.290> also

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
zookas are level 8 they're also

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.700 
zookas are level 8 they're also
obviously<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.520> slight<00:00:41.760> statue<00:00:42.210> boost<00:00:42.710> my

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
obviously the slight statue boost my

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.619 
obviously the slight statue boost my
boosts<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.780> 16%<00:00:45.780> damage<00:00:46.550> 11%<00:00:47.550> health<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.059> 9%

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
boosts are 16% damage 11% health and 9%

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.959 
boosts are 16% damage 11% health and 9%
damage<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.800> there's<00:00:50.160> not<00:00:50.309> really<00:00:50.489> much<00:00:50.670> boost

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
damage so there's not really much boost

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.630 
damage so there's not really much boost
to<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.270> honest<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.920> I'm<00:00:53.129> going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.280> go<00:00:53.370> straight

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
to be honest so I'm going to go straight

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.970 
to be honest so I'm going to go straight
in<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.660> Skype<00:00:55.590> mount<00:00:55.829> first<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:58.050> what<00:00:58.620> my<00:00:58.739> theory

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
in a Skype mount first so what my theory

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.299 
in a Skype mount first so what my theory
is

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
is

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.360 
is
is<00:00:59.520> that<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.690> basically<00:01:01.010> take<00:01:02.010> out<00:01:02.219> these

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
is that I can basically take out these

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.500 
is that I can basically take out these
two<00:01:02.430> boom<00:01:02.820> mines<00:01:03.059> here

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
two boom mines here

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.080 
two boom mines here
send<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> heavies<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.549> will<00:01:05.700> take<00:01:05.880> out

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
send the heavies in it will take out

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.179 
send the heavies in it will take out
those<00:01:06.270> phone<00:01:06.659> throws<00:01:06.960> take<00:01:07.530> out<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> cannons

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
those phone throws take out the cannons

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.859 
those phone throws take out the cannons
then<00:01:08.610> I'm<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:08.909> straight<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> H<00:01:09.479> cube

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
then I'm going straight on the H cube

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.420 
then I'm going straight on the H cube
and<00:01:10.140> I'm<00:01:10.320> gonna<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.560> shocking<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.010> Rockets

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
and I'm gonna be shocking the Rockets

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.820 
and I'm gonna be shocking the Rockets
and<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.150> should<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.780> all<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.020> need<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
and that should be all I need to do to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.859 
and that should be all I need to do to
take<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.670> let's<00:01:15.299> see<00:01:15.659> how<00:01:15.720> this

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
take this out so let's see how this

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.980 
take this out so let's see how this
theory<00:01:16.140> goes<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> say<00:01:18.259> boom<00:01:19.259> boom

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
theory goes so like I say boom boom

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.070 
theory goes so like I say boom boom
take<00:01:21.740> them<00:01:21.890> out<00:01:22.040> now<00:01:22.450> we<00:01:23.450> drop<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:23.720> heavies

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
take them out now we drop the heavies

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.080 
take them out now we drop the heavies
and<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.470> zookas<00:01:24.830> they<00:01:25.490> should<00:01:25.700> go<00:01:25.790> straight

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
and the zookas they should go straight

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.300 
and the zookas they should go straight
to<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.300> flamethrowers<00:01:26.900> I<00:01:27.260> don't<00:01:28.070> want<00:01:28.250> the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
to the flamethrowers I don't want the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.670 
to the flamethrowers I don't want the
heavies<00:01:28.550> taking<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:28.910> little<00:01:29.180> hit<00:01:29.300> first<00:01:29.680> it's

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
heavies taking a little hit first it's

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.480 
heavies taking a little hit first it's
not<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:30.890> problem

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
not a problem

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.070 
not a problem
all<00:01:32.180> those<00:01:32.390> take<00:01:32.720> them<00:01:32.870> out<00:01:32.990> 40<00:01:33.380> quickly<00:01:35.080> so

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
all those take them out 40 quickly so

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.430 
all those take them out 40 quickly so
now<00:01:36.229> they're<00:01:36.680> going<00:01:36.830> to<00:01:36.920> be<00:01:37.010> going<00:01:37.220> for<00:01:38.440> the

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
now they're going to be going for the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.690 
now they're going to be going for the
cannons<00:01:41.590> we<00:01:42.590> need<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:42.800> be<00:01:42.890> going<00:01:43.100> straight<00:01:43.490> for

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
cannons we need to be going straight for

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.580 
cannons we need to be going straight for

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
the HQ now so keep the rocket shocked

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.850 
the HQ now so keep the rocket shocked
and<00:01:49.180> HQ<00:01:50.180> is<00:01:50.240> going<00:01:50.450> down<00:01:50.770> absolutely<00:01:51.770> it's

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860
