been left on and need to be dead headed
and<00:00:34.140> you're<00:00:34.829> gonna<00:00:34.920> hear<00:00:35.190> deadheading<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.030> lot

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
and you're gonna hear deadheading a lot

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.910 
and you're gonna hear deadheading a lot
on<00:00:36.450> these<00:00:36.930> different<00:00:37.440> videos<00:00:37.649> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
on these different videos and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.610 
on these different videos and
deadheading<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.270> simply<00:00:39.629> removing<00:00:40.170> dead

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
deadheading is just simply removing dead

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.389 
deadheading is just simply removing dead
flowers<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:42.239> flat<00:00:42.870> plant<00:00:43.290> blooms<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:44.070> new

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
flowers the flat plant blooms on new

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.970 
flowers the flat plant blooms on new
growth<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:45.989> want<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.320> do<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.710> lower

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
growth so what we want to do is lower

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.660 
growth so what we want to do is lower
the<00:00:47.430> canopy<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.020> plant<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.680> get<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.430> ready

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the canopy of the plant and get it ready

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.939 
the canopy of the plant and get it ready
for<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.210> spring<00:00:51.510> flush<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.199> growth<00:00:52.230> which

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
for the spring flush of growth which

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.690 
for the spring flush of growth which
will<00:00:53.160> become<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.850> new<00:00:54.149> bloom<00:00:54.629> cycle

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.240 

also<00:00:59.600> I<00:00:59.630> want<00:00:59.840> to<00:00:59.899> point<00:00:59.989> out<00:01:00.320> that<00:01:00.559> in<00:01:00.739> colder

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
also I want to point out that in colder

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.729 
also I want to point out that in colder
winter<00:01:01.670> areas<00:01:02.120> where<00:01:02.420> there's<00:01:02.690> frost<00:01:03.170> a<00:01:03.559> lot

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
winter areas where there's frost a lot

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.600 
winter areas where there's frost a lot
of<00:01:03.890> these<00:01:03.980> perennial<00:01:04.670> type<00:01:05.570> shrubs<00:01:06.610> look

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
of these perennial type shrubs look

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.580 
of these perennial type shrubs look
pretty<00:01:07.940> sparse<00:01:08.450> during<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:08.990> winter<00:01:09.380> so

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
pretty sparse during the winter so

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.290 
pretty sparse during the winter so
that's<00:01:09.770> what<00:01:10.010> you're<00:01:10.130> seeing<00:01:10.430> here<00:01:10.580> but<00:01:11.150> as

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
that's what you're seeing here but as

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.780 
that's what you're seeing here but as
you<00:01:11.330> see<00:01:11.659> in<00:01:11.780> this<00:01:11.960> close-up<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:12.860> see<00:01:13.520> a<00:01:13.550> lot

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
you see in this close-up you see a lot

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.600 
you see in this close-up you see a lot
of<00:01:13.820> new<00:01:14.180> growth<00:01:14.479> starting<00:01:15.050> to<00:01:15.140> pop<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:15.770> that's

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
of new growth starting to pop and that's

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.660 
of new growth starting to pop and that's
why<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:17.060> like<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.450> go<00:01:17.660> in<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.410> do<00:01:18.920> its<00:01:19.100> pruning

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
why I like to go in and do its pruning

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.480 
why I like to go in and do its pruning
right<00:01:19.880> before<00:01:20.300> it<00:01:20.390> pops<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.470> that<00:01:21.830> all<00:01:22.070> of<00:01:22.369> the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
right before it pops so that all of the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.680 
right before it pops so that all of the
new<00:01:22.700> growth<00:01:22.970> is<00:01:23.210> going<00:01:23.570> where<00:01:23.750> I<00:01:23.780> want<00:01:23.869> it<00:01:24.229> to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
new growth is going where I want it to

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.870 
new growth is going where I want it to
these<00:01:26.690> plants<00:01:27.200> end<00:01:27.409> up<00:01:27.650> being<00:01:27.950> around<00:01:28.250> four<00:01:28.700> to

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
these plants end up being around four to

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.969 
these plants end up being around four to
four<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:29.210> a<00:01:29.270> half<00:01:29.330> feet<00:01:29.720> high<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:30.470> when<00:01:30.619> I<00:01:30.649> do<00:01:30.800> a

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
four and a half feet high so when I do a

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.940 
four and a half feet high so when I do a
dead<00:01:31.310> heading<00:01:31.580> I<00:01:31.880> like<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.660> cut<00:01:33.110> them<00:01:33.350> down<00:01:33.649> to

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
dead heading I like to cut them down to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.050 
dead heading I like to cut them down to
about<00:01:34.340> 30<00:01:34.789> inches<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:36.170> 36<00:01:36.740> inches<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.369> then

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
about 30 inches to 36 inches and then

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.630 
about 30 inches to 36 inches and then
when<00:01:38.330> they<00:01:38.479> push<00:01:38.780> back<00:01:38.810> up<00:01:39.110> they'll<00:01:40.009> end<00:01:40.280> up<00:01:40.430> at

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
when they push back up they'll end up at

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.730 
when they push back up they'll end up at
that<00:01:40.670> four<00:01:41.300> to<00:01:41.539> four<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:41.869> a<00:01:41.930> half<00:01:41.990> foot<00:01:42.350> height

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
that four to four and a half foot height

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.150 
that four to four and a half foot height
so<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:43.429> see<00:01:44.030> me<00:01:44.240> cutting<00:01:44.600> below<00:01:45.259> the

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
so you see me cutting below the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.359 
so you see me cutting below the
deadheads<00:01:47.000> but<00:01:47.479> also<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:47.960> see<00:01:48.170> me<00:01:48.619> trying<00:01:49.130> to

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
deadheads but also you see me trying to

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.580 
deadheads but also you see me trying to
do<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.850> different<00:01:50.330> heights<00:01:50.630> some<00:01:51.080> of<00:01:51.259> them<00:01:51.410> are

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
do it different heights some of them are

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.730 
do it different heights some of them are
down<00:01:51.800> as<00:01:52.009> low<00:01:52.220> as<00:01:52.250> two<00:01:52.670> feet<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.380> some<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.560> them

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
down as low as two feet and some of them

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.609 
down as low as two feet and some of them
are<00:01:54.950> up<00:01:55.130> around<00:01:55.340> three<00:01:55.910> feet<00:01:55.940> high<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:56.810> do<00:01:57.200> this

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
are up around three feet high I do this

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.940 
are up around three feet high I do this
so<00:01:58.070> that<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.429> get<00:01:58.610> a<00:01:58.640> more<00:01:58.910> regular<00:01:59.539> or

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
so that you get a more regular or

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.850 
so that you get a more regular or
natural-looking<00:02:01.810> appearance<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.320> plant

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
natural-looking appearance to the plant

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.210 
natural-looking appearance to the plant
and<00:02:04.220> so<00:02:04.970> it<00:02:05.150> doesn't<00:02:05.390> look<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.140> shaved<00:02:06.650> off<00:02:06.920> on

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
and so it doesn't look so shaved off on

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.850 
and so it doesn't look so shaved off on
top<00:02:10.750> this<00:02:11.750> deadheading<00:02:12.440> should<00:02:12.709> have

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
top this deadheading should have

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.830 
top this deadheading should have
occurred<00:02:13.250> at<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.640> end<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:14.000> fall<00:02:14.299> when<00:02:14.660> these

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
occurred at the end of fall when these

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.810 
occurred at the end of fall when these
blooms<00:02:15.170> were<00:02:15.470> done<00:02:15.769> and<00:02:16.070> lost<00:02:16.280> their<00:02:16.519> color

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
blooms were done and lost their color

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.780 
blooms were done and lost their color
and<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.900> would<00:02:18.110> do<00:02:18.500> this<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.950> same<00:02:19.220> way<00:02:19.519> at<00:02:19.730> the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
and I would do this the same way at the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.000 
and I would do this the same way at the
end<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.360> summer<00:02:20.660> bloom<00:02:21.079> so<00:02:21.470> whenever

end of the summer bloom so whenever

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.080 
end of the summer bloom so whenever
these<00:02:22.780> bloom<00:02:23.780> cycles<00:02:24.350> happen<00:02:24.799> for<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.400> feel

I've sent seen this plant in coastal
areas<00:03:02.900> like<00:03:03.380> Monterey<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.420> Southern

areas like Monterey and Southern
California<00:03:05.450> where<00:03:06.440> they<00:03:07.040> do<00:03:07.099> not<00:03:07.430> get<00:03:07.790> as<00:03:08.090> cold

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
California where they do not get as cold

California where they do not get as cold
of<00:03:08.780> winter<00:03:09.190> temperatures<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.849> plant

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
of winter temperatures and the plant

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.200 
of winter temperatures and the plant
doesn't<00:03:11.450> do<00:03:11.780> this

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
doesn't do this

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.480 
doesn't do this
I<00:03:12.270> back<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.990> matter<00:03:13.470> of<00:03:13.650> fact<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.040> looks<00:03:14.250> more

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
I back a matter of fact it looks more

I back a matter of fact it looks more
like<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:14.970> photo<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:15.450> see<00:03:15.870> here<00:03:16.260> where<00:03:16.440> it's

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
like this photo you see here where it's

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.190

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
nice and green all year long and it gets

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.820 
nice and green all year long and it gets
much<00:03:19.470> larger<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.130> saw<00:03:20.490> the<00:03:20.550> plant<00:03:21.000> as<00:03:21.270> high<00:03:21.480> as

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
much larger I saw the plant as high as

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.640 
much larger I saw the plant as high as
six<00:03:22.830> feet<00:03:23.070> tall<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:24.080> just<00:03:25.080> follow<00:03:25.350> the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
six feet tall so just follow the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.740 
six feet tall so just follow the
