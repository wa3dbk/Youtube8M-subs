00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
so finally done now on to math this

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.000 
so finally done now on to math this
should<00:03:09.930> be<00:03:10.020> more<00:03:10.140> time<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.470> can't<00:03:10.740> write<00:03:10.890> the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
should be more time I can't write the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.400 
should be more time I can't write the
number<00:03:11.250> me<00:03:11.370> very<00:03:11.580> well<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.090> in<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.900> formulas

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
number me very well so in the formulas
