00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.440
 hello everyone, b3 world we play 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.650
 a toy called shorts and 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.710
 such an interesting walker 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.099
 I passed the first mission of which we 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.880
 told about all the features of the game 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:32.270
 I came to such a portal here 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.990
 location in which 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.340
 A fork and a few portal is located 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.809
 this 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.899
 demo and we are constantly here 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.329
 offer to unlock as it were on 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:51.410
 full version to be opened after all 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.410
 other moves and other game features 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.739
 let's go to this mission 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.320
 slide pretty interesting missions I 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.870
 not yet fully passed 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.480
 even in the demo rides turn around like 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.470
 says and climb on explore what 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:14.689
 This is a very nice graphics in the game. 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:18.000
 in such an interesting quality made 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:23.520
 we play for the kind of girl who 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.869
 has the ability of telekinesis or something 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.869
 she has such a cool costume 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.689
 which here it stands and can shift 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:36.270
 platforms but naturally you fingers them and 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:41.790
 move this platform move and 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:45.740
 move on so here we need 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:53.420
 think a little bit and how best to move 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:02:04.649
 to go eat further 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:05.570
 we shift here no immediately in my like this 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:12.650
 here yes 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:15.950
 press the button need opened the door 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.950
 come back 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.250
 we go senor also meet us on the way 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.580
 these are the type of tower 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.360
 analytic which act like 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:37.260
 checkpoints and well i mean if you die 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:42.150
 then resurrected resurrection and seeds on this 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:49.040
 the tower so the platform shift here appeared 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:53.730
 we have the first enemies run here and 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:58.290
 try to destroy these enemies from i 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:04.109
 missed the cash stage and he raw me 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:06.239
 killed kills one butt here as if but 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:09.510
 it is possible to destroy enemies by tap 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.140
 but it works a little 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:17.220
 crooked that is but it is not 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:21.720
 one hundred percent chance to kill the enemy missed 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.940
 did not have time to double tap our character 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.100
 can such a firefly turn and 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.609
 move quickly ie we have it 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.329
 now 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:37.019
 and using time managed again that is 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:41.609
 The essence of what is right now I just wanted 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:44.790
 take to approach the Greeks of our enemy 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:48.290
 you are now double taped moved 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:53.130
 to the tower yes it is and the tower destroys 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:58.380
 opponents, that is, you can as yourself 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.700
 to fight like that and with the help of the tower to demolish 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.239
 opponents 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:07.690
 In principle, for each opponent their 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.690
 The options are the best ie these 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:15.940
 let's say they are fast and best 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:18.120
 use the tower so the gate opened 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:24.730
 beetles appeared 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:30.810
 here they are these bugs destroy them by force 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:38.740
 thoughts important of course get there 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:41.020
 I'll live the last you split them up like 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.979
 see for every such quick 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.020
 moving 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:51.729
 energy is spent which costs 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.220
 make up so here we are in such 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:58.000
 a place where again has a little bit 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:03.660
 think and think how best 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.660
 these platforms on move 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:14.830
 she liked this toy 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.830
 relaxing said 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:29.950
 relaxes here so we are better here I 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.950
 I think probably so 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:40.889
 yes there really have to break 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:45.210
 head as these platforms better put 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:48.979
 to go so thought I thought wondered 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:54.720
 I wondered and something like start getting 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:58.919
 so here is the type of how to go had them 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.949
 shuffle shuffle and now we 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:05.120
 got here is a place where again we 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.530
 have to play tag and a 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.430
 shuffle these platforms to somehow 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:14.699
 go through it like this 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.789
 game with nice graphics and calm 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.659
 music is not some kind of action 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.419
 cool 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.110
 at least there are enemies there are meat 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.250
 blood and 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:29.219
 murder but still it's a little different 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.979
 the game that I advise you necessarily 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:33.659
 play the word cheerful world 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:36.240
 subscribe to the channel 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:38.960
 play only good games for everyone 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.960
 until
