00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hi / video now you know the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.309
 title what he says then of his trafficking 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.070
 get two wigs one that for the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.450
 shakira style that is new that 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.839
 I was in the bag, I think that's why 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.270
 it's like chewed but says that 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.590
 these can be resistant to 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.590
 nail clips 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:30.119
 well says that because please do not 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.809
 they come out in the video I do not know where 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.590
 they left this one that was looking for the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.420
 I got the little hand here in front 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.610
 for when I put it on it, it shows more 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.219
 obvious natural this here is cut out 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.870
 with scissors as close as they can 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.870
 to make it look natural 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.670
 so here it is in the asean and there is the 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.920
 thing for the referral but if you see here 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.260
 what you see is because it's very little 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.379
 hair then maybe in a future I 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.340
 I'm going to buy more hair and I'm going to 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.950
 add but doing to the root I doubt 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.200
 that you get to see 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.060
 well I'm not afraid then what 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.930
 I'm going to do is going to be in the part of 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.909
 opposite first with this down there 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.940
 it's a bit 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.840
 this is a little bit of that time I can not 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.990
 lose the 49 of that class wig should 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.670
 educated themselves they have a park that comes 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:43.860
 being dahlia 6-3 3-6 says in the 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:46.869
 corner that is resistant up to 341 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.259
 almost nothing ever works for the 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.900
 art and this from here the one that the bead 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.470
 here I made a gel down 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.960
 applied this show and you see coffee but the 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.340
 20 and everything and the next day he had 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.410
 as reddish 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.290
 so I'm going to do it with the 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.530
 Mount Temple 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:13.060
 and I hope that this says it is 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:16.540
 cecilia way knicks what is called the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.310
 numbering 5 17 14 same as I'm going to put 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.060
 the description below so that you 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.720
 see and let's start with this doing 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.700
 it's also the external tip and the other 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.920
 tip is the one I'm going to use and now 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.739
 I got the downs with discount 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.450
 because force you already know how the great 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.540
 millionaire in the shocks to see if 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.239
 they reach to settle and it is that they have left 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.130
 the back but only if the nails 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.130
 painted as well as added 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.910
 do not play the mix to do it right 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.000
 because if not, here is a 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.420
 consigned and the ball does not want it 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.420
 spoil 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.450
 watch out 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.040
 ah 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.910
 ah 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.280
 I did not finish it because we are more and there 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.980
 something here let me show you how much is 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.440
 to place in a visit this one serves 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.380
 then what you are going to regret is all 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.680
 the root 1 below also depends on the 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.650
 artist the slogan trick if only 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.170
 they want to do this very deep for 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.450
 you or whatever only in the 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.980
 party zone there are wigs 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.200
 they are divided 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.330
 if I'm recording in the forms of 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.040
 match that they will want in the match and 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.350
 in front the entire area opposite 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.810
 So this is what they are going to do in 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.050
 change what the garment is for the 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:45.380

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:48.800
 doing is doing it in all the hair 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:53.300
 I was not going like that the game is going 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.370

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.810

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.970
