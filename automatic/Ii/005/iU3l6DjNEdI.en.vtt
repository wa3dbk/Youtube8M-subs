wanted to let you in on my progress the
current<00:00:06.810> build<00:00:07.080> 2<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.620> just<00:00:08.069> about<00:00:08.400> done<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.970> few

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
current build 2 is just about done a few

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.390 
current build 2 is just about done a few
more<00:00:10.040> parts<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.219> put<00:00:11.460> on<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.670> but<00:00:12.030> here<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.750> is

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
more parts to put on it but here it is

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.820 
more parts to put on it but here it is
so<00:00:14.400> got<00:00:14.880> six<00:00:15.240> fan<00:00:15.450> controller<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.560> I've<00:00:16.650> got

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
so got six fan controller and I've got

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.570 
so got six fan controller and I've got
six<00:00:17.070> fans<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.520> here<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.910> each<00:00:18.720> one<00:00:18.990> can<00:00:19.199> be<00:00:19.580> set

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
six fans in here and each one can be set

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.000 
six fans in here and each one can be set
separate<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.270> therefore<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.380> kind<00:00:22.949> of

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
separate and therefore you can kind of

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.240 
separate and therefore you can kind of
control<00:00:23.189> what<00:00:23.850> you'd<00:00:24.000> like<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.240> do<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:24.779> there's

one two three and there we go four five

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.860 
one two three and there we go four five
six<00:00:33.690> everything<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.800> UV<00:00:35.130> reactive<00:00:35.660> got<00:00:36.660> some

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
six everything is UV reactive got some

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
all the cabling is cabled and red I

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.840 
all the cabling is cabled and red I
figure<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> board<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:52.980> black<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.460> red<00:00:53.640> so

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
figure the board was black and red so

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.220 
figure the board was black and red so
I'd<00:00:53.940> go<00:00:54.180> red<00:00:54.449> g.skill<00:00:55.410> ripjaws<00:00:56.149> 16<00:00:57.149> gigs<00:00:57.770> 1866

I'd go red g.skill ripjaws 16 gigs 1866

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.399 
I'd go red g.skill ripjaws 16 gigs 1866
okay<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.289> let's<00:01:02.219> go<00:01:02.370> over<00:01:02.399> here<00:01:02.820> d5<00:01:03.329> pump<00:01:03.660> with

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
all right into the ret into the rat out

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.520 
all right into the ret into the rat out
of<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> rad<00:01:17.000> into<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> cpu<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.990> water<00:01:19.229> block

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
of the rad into the cpu the water block

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.910 
of the rad into the cpu the water block
is<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.890> coolant<00:01:20.520> 370<00:01:21.330> out<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.560> CPU<00:01:23.390> GPU<00:01:24.920> all

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
is a coolant 370 out of the CPU GPU all

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.830 
is a coolant 370 out of the CPU GPU all
right<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.220> I've<00:01:26.310> got<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.520> EK<00:01:27.030> water<00:01:27.299> block<00:01:27.600> on

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
right and I've got the EK water block on

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.760 
right and I've got the EK water block on
there<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.500> EK<00:01:30.110> back<00:01:31.110> play<00:01:31.380> down<00:01:31.590> there

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
there with the EK back play down there

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.130 
there with the EK back play down there
as<00:01:31.979> well<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.490> i<00:01:33.150> put<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> couple<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.720> LEDs

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
as well and i put a couple of LEDs

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.840 
as well and i put a couple of LEDs
inside<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.770> water<00:01:34.950> block<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.579> it'll

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
inside the water block so that it'll

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.149 
inside the water block so that it'll
really<00:01:36.420> give<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> nice<00:01:36.930> effect<00:01:37.640> okay<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:40.100> out<00:01:41.100> of

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
really give a nice effect okay so out of

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.770 
really give a nice effect okay so out of
the<00:01:41.340> water<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:42.649> GPU<00:01:43.649> block<00:01:44.090> down<00:01:45.090> into<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the water the GPU block down into the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.539 
the water the GPU block down into the
reservoir<00:01:46.759> frozen<00:01:47.759> q<00:01:48.200> out<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.470> rez<00:01:49.649> back

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
reservoir frozen q out of the rez back

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.060 
reservoir frozen q out of the rez back
into<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> pump<00:01:51.210> i<00:01:51.509> also<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> bleed<00:01:52.799> line

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
into the pump i also have a bleed line

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.399 
into the pump i also have a bleed line
here<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:53.520> well<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:54.899> used<00:01:55.200> for

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
here as well and that can be used for

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.950 
here as well and that can be used for
draining<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.250> course<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:57.450> why<00:01:57.689> that's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
draining of course and that's why that's

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.670 
draining of course and that's why that's
there<00:01:58.759> okay

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.440 

that's<00:02:03.680> what<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:03.890> looks<00:02:04.010> like<00:02:04.400> so<00:02:04.850> let<00:02:05.180> me<00:02:05.210> just

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
that's what it looks like so let me just

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.469 
that's what it looks like so let me just
put<00:02:05.630> this<00:02:06.640> let<00:02:07.640> me<00:02:07.729> put<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:07.970> cover<00:02:08.179> on<00:02:08.300> a

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
put this let me put the cover on a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:23.340 
put this let me put the cover on a
second<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.729> show<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:12.380> looks<00:02:12.620> like

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.720 

there<00:02:23.860> we<00:02:23.980> go<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.590> here<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.310> we're<00:02:27.640> going

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
there we go and here it is we're going

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.870 
there we go and here it is we're going
to<00:02:27.820> turn<00:02:27.910> off<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.150> light<00:02:28.270> hoping<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.880> that'll

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
to turn off a light hoping that that'll

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.480 
to turn off a light hoping that that'll
still<00:02:31.210> be<00:02:31.240> clear<00:02:31.600> I<00:02:32.100> can't<00:02:33.100> get<00:02:33.220> too<00:02:33.340> close

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
still be clear I can't get too close

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:42.040 
still be clear I can't get too close
again<00:02:34.590> need<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.650> better<00:02:35.800> camera

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.990 

wonder<00:02:42.740> what<00:02:42.890> will<00:02:43.040> happen<00:02:43.220> if<00:02:43.490> i<00:02:43.610> close<00:02:43.790> the

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
wonder what will happen if i close the
