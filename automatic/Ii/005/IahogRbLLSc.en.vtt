carbon fiber you don't find that in many
cases<00:00:50.640> at<00:00:51.270> all<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> was<00:00:52.829> very<00:00:53.010> excited<00:00:53.160> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
cases at all so I was very excited to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.619 
cases at all so I was very excited to
receive<00:00:53.760> these<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.360> review<00:00:56.210> carbon<00:00:57.210> fibers

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
packaging guys set that off to the side

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.950 
packaging guys set that off to the side
here<00:01:47.960> now<00:01:50.299> what<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.329> want<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.630> guys<00:01:51.750> all<00:01:51.810> to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
here now what I want you guys all to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.499 
here now what I want you guys all to
know<00:01:52.320> about<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.740> case<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.420> like<00:01:54.420> I've

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
know about this case is like I've

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.490 
know about this case is like I've
already<00:01:54.630> mentioned<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> hundred<00:01:55.380> percent

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
already mentioned is a hundred percent

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.719 
already mentioned is a hundred percent
real<00:01:56.399> carbon<00:01:56.820> fiber<00:01:57.240> case<00:01:58.219> you<00:01:59.219> know<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.520> not

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
real carbon fiber case you know it's not

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.190 
real carbon fiber case you know it's not
a<00:01:59.759> cheap<00:02:00.240> case<00:02:00.930> by<00:02:01.170> any<00:02:01.409> means<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:03.600> retails<00:02:04.079> for

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
a cheap case by any means it retails for

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.219 
a cheap case by any means it retails for
4999<00:02:05.990> US<00:02:06.990> dollars<00:02:08.179> but<00:02:09.179> i<00:02:09.450> mean<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
4999 US dollars but i mean the the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.110 
4999 US dollars but i mean the the
reason<00:02:11.069> for<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.730> carbon<00:02:12.150> fibers<00:02:12.540> expand

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
reason for that is carbon fibers expand

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.080 
reason for that is carbon fibers expand
so<00:02:13.330> right<00:02:13.840> i<00:02:13.870> mean<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.819> pretty<00:02:16.810> expensive

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
so right i mean it's a pretty expensive

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.300 
so right i mean it's a pretty expensive
material<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:20.049> in<00:02:20.290> each<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.739> these<00:02:20.860> each<00:02:21.159> of

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
material so in each of these each of

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.240 
material so in each of these each of
these<00:02:21.400> cases<00:02:21.970> are<00:02:22.299> handcrafted<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:25.170> using

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
these cases are handcrafted and using

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.420 
these cases are handcrafted and using
200,000<00:02:27.250> carbon<00:02:27.670> fiber<00:02:28.569> strands<00:02:29.080> these<00:02:30.069> thin

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
200,000 carbon fiber strands these thin

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.690 
200,000 carbon fiber strands these thin
strands<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.090> this<00:02:31.269> case<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:32.799> UV<00:02:33.930> protectant

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
strands in this case it is UV protectant

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.630 
strands in this case it is UV protectant
so<00:02:36.700> little<00:02:37.000> doll<00:02:37.299> or<00:02:37.510> anything<00:02:37.870> like<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.640> and

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
so little doll or anything like that and

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.949 
so little doll or anything like that and
just<00:02:40.090> they<00:02:40.780> use<00:02:40.930> really<00:02:41.409> good<00:02:41.620> materials

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
just they use really good materials

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.589 
just they use really good materials
scratch<00:02:43.980> resistant<00:02:45.420> everything<00:02:46.420> like<00:02:46.569> that

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
scratch resistant everything like that

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.330 
scratch resistant everything like that
so<00:02:46.780> you'll<00:02:47.470> see<00:02:47.650> on<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.829> inside<00:02:47.980> here<00:02:48.519> it's

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
so you'll see on the inside here it's

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.240 
so you'll see on the inside here it's
they've<00:02:51.340> got<00:02:51.609> a<00:02:51.640> nice<00:02:51.940> glossy<00:02:52.629> coating<00:02:53.250> Mon

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
they've got a nice glossy coating Mon

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.039 
they've got a nice glossy coating Mon

thin<00:03:07.959> it's<00:03:08.109> almost<00:03:08.409> paper<00:03:08.680> thin<00:03:08.890> like<00:03:09.329> it's<00:03:10.329> a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
thin it's almost paper thin like it's a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.569 
thin it's almost paper thin like it's a
nice<00:03:10.720> thin<00:03:11.049> case<00:03:11.230> but<00:03:11.440> it's<00:03:11.560> really<00:03:12.129> durable

a thin case like this and you know most

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.289 
a thin case like this and you know most
of<00:03:17.829> time<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.069> advise<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.519> run<00:03:18.730> away<00:03:18.849> from<00:03:19.000> it

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
of time I advise you to run away from it

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.670 
of time I advise you to run away from it
but<00:03:19.989> this<00:03:20.169> one<00:03:20.230> guys<00:03:20.620> is<00:03:20.889> extremely<00:03:22.680> durable

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
but this one guys is extremely durable

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.839 
but this one guys is extremely durable
case<00:03:24.569> so<00:03:25.569> that's<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.959> inside<00:03:26.380> there<00:03:26.849> the

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
case so that's the inside there the

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.330 
case so that's the inside there the
sides<00:03:28.180> are<00:03:28.540> just<00:03:29.019> nice<00:03:29.349> and<00:03:29.410> smooth<00:03:30.069> black<00:03:31.060> and

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
sides are just nice and smooth black and

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.890 
sides are just nice and smooth black and
here<00:03:33.340> is<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.669> back<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.930> case<00:03:36.629> so<00:03:37.629> you<00:03:37.690> got

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
here is the back of the case so you got

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.229 
here is the back of the case so you got
your<00:03:37.930> camera<00:03:38.290> cut<00:03:38.709> out<00:03:38.889> and<00:03:39.370> your<00:03:39.579> LED<00:03:39.910> flash

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
your camera cut out and your LED flash

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.659 
your camera cut out and your LED flash
now<00:03:41.049> this<00:03:42.989> there's<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.260> texture<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.280> so

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
now this there's the texture to it so

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.170 
now this there's the texture to it so
you<00:03:46.480> know<00:03:47.349> it's<00:03:47.530> not<00:03:47.709> as<00:03:47.949> thick<00:03:48.370> of<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.609> coating

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
you know it's not as thick of a coating

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.830 
you know it's not as thick of a coating
over<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:49.959> carbon<00:03:50.500> fiber<00:03:50.769> as<00:03:51.069> on<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.400> inside

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
over the carbon fiber as on the inside

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.129 
over the carbon fiber as on the inside
to<00:03:52.840> allow<00:03:53.079> you<00:03:53.709> know<00:03:53.829> same<00:03:54.069> feel<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.519> texture

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
to allow you know same feel the texture

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.409 
to allow you know same feel the texture
pretty<00:03:56.139> cool<00:03:56.319> touch<00:03:56.560> I<00:03:57.220> don't<00:03:58.180> know<00:03:58.269> if<00:03:58.359> I

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
pretty cool touch I don't know if I

00:03:58.419 --> 00:03:59.460

carbon<00:04:06.310> fiber<00:04:07.980> I've<00:04:08.980> seen<00:04:09.190> like<00:04:09.430> stick<00:04:09.790> on

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
carbon fiber I've seen like stick on

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.520 
carbon fiber I've seen like stick on
ones<00:04:10.269> that<00:04:10.449> they<00:04:10.540> try<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.780> pass<00:04:11.019> as<00:04:11.230> carbon

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
ones that they try to pass as carbon

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.559 
ones that they try to pass as carbon
fiber<00:04:11.709> but<00:04:11.980> no<00:04:12.160> this<00:04:12.790> one<00:04:13.000> you<00:04:13.120> can<00:04:13.150> tell<00:04:13.389> it's

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
fiber but no this one you can tell it's

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.839 
fiber but no this one you can tell it's
high<00:04:13.690> quality<00:04:13.720> it's<00:04:14.620> it's<00:04:15.190> definitely<00:04:15.549> carbon

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
high quality it's it's definitely carbon

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.800 
high quality it's it's definitely carbon
fiber<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:17.729> let's<00:04:18.729> get<00:04:18.880> my<00:04:19.000> phone<00:04:19.299> in<00:04:19.479> it<00:04:19.599> guys

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
fiber so let's get my phone in it guys
