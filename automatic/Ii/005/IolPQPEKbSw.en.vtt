00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.750
 In the first two episodes, we built the command center 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.880
 Collect materials from the collector and transfer them to the storage 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.780
 Now we have to refine the raw materials into products. 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.740
 For market trading or subsequent production 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.140
 We will build two basic industrial facilities first. 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.850
 Placed close to the storage and separate the conveyor belts 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.540
 Now look at the chart 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.760
 Production of biofuels in an industrial facility 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.750
 Another production of rare metals 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.490
 Select the processing plan in the table and click "Configure" 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.580
 Now the product window pops up, you need to specify the transmission line 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.540
 We set up a conveyor belt to the storage 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.770
 Now both industrial facilities can transfer products to the storage. 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.910
 Simply transfer the raw materials to the industrial facility and start refining. 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.090
 Ok, choose storage facilities 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.400
 You see, we have received the first batch of raw materials. 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.710
 If you click on "Transport Belt" 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.290
 Can see the raw materials transferred into the storage and transfer the product 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.290
 Open the repository again 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.530
 Transfer carbon compounds and precious metals to the corresponding industrial facilities 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.090
 It can be seen that the raw materials are transported into industrial facilities and the products are transferred. 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.190
 The production cycle of the basic industrial facility is approximately 30 minutes. 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.550
 Match the collection period of the collector we configured 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.720
 Mentioned before 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.950
 We can use a variety of refined products 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.770
 Production of bio-batteries in advanced industrial facilities 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.110
 Build an advanced industrial facility and link to the storage 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.270
 Choose advanced industrial facilities and choose products as "biobatteries" 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.000
 Configuration production plan 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.090
 This time set the destination as the launch platform 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.560
 Then build a conveyor belt between biofuels and rare metals and industrial facilities 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.530
 The repository is now empty 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.180
 Click on the conveyor again 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.830
 Transfer of input materials to advanced industrial facilities 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.380
 The line of advanced industrial facilities is configured 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.480
 After the raw materials are collected and refined in the basic industrial facilities 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.080
 Will be transferred to advanced industrial facilities for final production 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.340
 High-tech factory we have not used yet 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.360
 It can synthesize advanced materials into high-tech products 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.170
 Such as self-coordinating energy core, wet parts host, etc. 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.640
 This location is fully configured and will continue to produce bio-batteries. 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.670
 Until the end of the collection cycle, the storage material is used up 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.600
 The principle of collecting and producing on other planets is exactly the same. 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.090
 In the next episode, I will talk about how to launch the product into space and how to get it. 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.630
 See you at the time, have fun.
