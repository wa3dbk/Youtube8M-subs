00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
we know that we're targeting just the P

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.300 
we know that we're targeting just the P
that's<00:02:19.430> inside<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.060> footer<00:02:20.270> here<00:02:20.570> like<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.310> so

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
that's inside the footer here like so so

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.130 
that's inside the footer here like so so
now<00:02:22.430> we<00:02:22.490> have<00:02:22.580> our<00:02:22.700> special<00:02:22.940> name<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.630> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
now we have our special name and the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.800 
now we have our special name and the
next<00:02:24.380> step<00:02:24.530> in<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.610> process<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:26.240> final<00:02:26.600> step

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
next step in the process the final step

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.220 
next step in the process the final step
is<00:02:27.020> to<00:02:27.350> ask<00:02:27.560> what<00:02:28.070> CSS<00:02:28.460> code<00:02:29.000> can<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.720> use<00:02:29.960> to

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
is to ask what CSS code can you use to

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.490 
is to ask what CSS code can you use to
make<00:02:30.410> this<00:02:30.590> change<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:32.420> again<00:02:32.720> we<00:02:33.230> want<00:02:33.410> to

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
make this change so again we want to

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.010 
make this change so again we want to
change<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.920> alignment<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.760> footer<00:02:35.120> to

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
change the alignment of the footer to

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.280 
change the alignment of the footer to
display<00:02:36.500> on<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.800> right<00:02:37.070> side<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:38.660> we<00:02:38.870> want<00:02:39.110> to

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
display on the right side and we want to

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.100 
display on the right side and we want to
find<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.710> CSS<00:02:40.190> code<00:02:40.460> that<00:02:41.360> will<00:02:41.480> help<00:02:41.750> us<00:02:41.900> do

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
find the CSS code that will help us do

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.780 
find the CSS code that will help us do
that<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:42.920> let's<00:02:43.100> go<00:02:43.250> back<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.600> firefox<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:46.400> the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
that so let's go back to firefox to the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.560 
that so let's go back to firefox to the
culture<00:02:47.300> code<00:02:47.480> CSS<00:02:47.990> reference<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:49.570> again

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
culture code CSS reference and again

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.590 
culture code CSS reference and again
this<00:02:50.990> might<00:02:51.260> be<00:02:51.730> layout<00:02:52.730> but<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.060> don't<00:02:53.360> really

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
this might be layout but I don't really

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.620 
this might be layout but I don't really
think<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.290> think<00:02:54.440> it's<00:02:54.800> more<00:02:55.150> with<00:02:56.150> text

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
think so I think it's more with text

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.580 
think so I think it's more with text
maybe<00:02:56.810> it's<00:02:57.020> with<00:02:57.200> spacing<00:02:57.770> there<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:58.940> yep

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
maybe it's with spacing there it is yep

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.040 
maybe it's with spacing there it is yep
so<00:03:00.590> what<00:03:00.920> we<00:03:01.010> want<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.310> use<00:03:01.550> it<00:03:01.820> is<00:03:02.330> under<00:03:02.660> text

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
so what we want to use it is under text

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.320 
so what we want to use it is under text
and<00:03:03.200> s<00:03:03.290> under<00:03:03.560> spacing<00:03:04.010> here<00:03:04.280> we'll<00:03:05.030> see<00:03:05.300> a

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
and s under spacing here we'll see a

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.800 
and s under spacing here we'll see a
text<00:03:05.660> alignment<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:07.400> will<00:03:07.640> allow<00:03:08.600> us<00:03:08.630> to

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
text alignment and this will allow us to

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.380 
text alignment and this will allow us to
specify<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.830> horizontal<00:03:10.670> alignment<00:03:11.090> of

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
specify the horizontal alignment of

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.780 
specify the horizontal alignment of
lines<00:03:11.690> of<00:03:11.870> text<00:03:12.110> left<00:03:12.740> right<00:03:13.190> center<00:03:13.250> or

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
lines of text left right center or

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.880 
lines of text left right center or
justify<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:15.160> again<00:03:16.160> we<00:03:16.280> wanted<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:16.610> use<00:03:16.700> right

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
justify and again we wanted to use right

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.199 
justify and again we wanted to use right
so<00:03:20.230> text<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.320> line<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:21.860> right<00:03:22.490> let's<00:03:22.850> try<00:03:23.060> that

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
so text a line and right let's try that

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.340 
so text a line and right let's try that
in<00:03:23.420> our<00:03:23.570> CSS<00:03:24.080> code<00:03:26.230> text<00:03:27.230> hyphen<00:03:27.980> align<00:03:28.760> I

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
in our CSS code text hyphen align I

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.230 
in our CSS code text hyphen align I
colon<00:03:30.350> space<00:03:30.860> we<00:03:31.400> want<00:03:31.580> it<00:03:31.670> to<00:03:31.700> be<00:03:32.000> on<00:03:32.150> the

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
colon space we want it to be on the

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.430 
colon space we want it to be on the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
right semicolon we've done that let's

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.080 
right semicolon we've done that let's
move<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.740> pages<00:03:37.070> for<00:03:37.190> other<00:03:37.430> way<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:37.880> now

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
move the pages for other way and now

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.240 
move the pages for other way and now
you'll<00:03:38.240> see<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.350> footer<00:03:39.590> has<00:03:39.800> moved<00:03:40.040> to

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.890 
the right and that's exactly what we
wanted<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:41.959> do<00:03:42.520> so<00:03:43.520> it<00:03:43.910> took<00:03:44.060> us<00:03:44.240> a<00:03:44.450> little<00:03:44.720> bit

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
wanted to do so it took us a little bit

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.470 
wanted to do so it took us a little bit
of<00:03:44.959> time<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.410> find<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.770> exact<00:03:46.010> CSS<00:03:46.459> code<00:03:46.730> but
