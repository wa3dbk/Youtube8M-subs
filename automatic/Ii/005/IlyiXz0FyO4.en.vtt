me<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.150> numbers<00:03:22.450> going<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.660> come<00:03:22.870> down<00:03:23.049> a

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
me so that numbers going to come down a

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.900 
me so that numbers going to come down a
little<00:03:23.350> bit<00:03:23.560> as<00:03:23.829> they<00:03:24.160> adjust<00:03:24.250> the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
little bit as they adjust the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.849 
little bit as they adjust the
differences<00:03:25.329> I<00:03:25.510> still<00:03:26.019> think<00:03:26.260> tebow<00:03:26.650> is

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
differences I still think tebow is

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.080 
differences I still think tebow is
better<00:03:27.310> because<00:03:27.579> as<00:03:28.000> Meryl<00:03:28.690> says<00:03:29.940> he<00:03:30.940> can

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
better because as Meryl says he can

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.830 
better because as Meryl says he can
operate<00:03:31.209> as<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:32.019> lead<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:33.090> he<00:03:34.090> caused<00:03:34.630> the

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
operate as the lead and he caused the

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.349 
operate as the lead and he caused the
differences<00:03:35.320> teams<00:03:35.680> if<00:03:36.459> they<00:03:36.700> narrow<00:03:36.970> out<00:03:37.180> the

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
differences teams if they narrow out the

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:38.720 
differences teams if they narrow out the
plate<00:03:37.570> into<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.959> next<00:03:38.200> runner

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730

org<00:03:41.099> ahem<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.360> think<00:03:42.390> he<00:03:42.780> in<00:03:42.959> 251<00:03:43.650> half

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
org ahem and so I think he in 251 half

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.149 
org ahem and so I think he in 251 half
if<00:03:44.610> he<00:03:44.790> does<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.000> yes<00:03:45.560> TenPoint<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.739> years<00:03:46.950> I

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
if he does that yes TenPoint the years I

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.130 
if he does that yes TenPoint the years I
may<00:03:47.670> not<00:03:47.849> sound<00:03:48.030> like<00:03:48.150> much<00:03:48.299> i'm<00:03:48.750> not<00:03:48.870> saying

you heard the debate between like my

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.040 
you heard the debate between like my

other kind of but then you got on the

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.820 
other kind of but then you got on the
feedback<00:04:40.440> from<00:04:40.949> this<00:04:41.130> idea<00:04:41.280> I<00:04:42.830> figures

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
feedback from this idea I figures

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.620 
feedback from this idea I figures
there's<00:04:44.250> people<00:04:44.610> on<00:04:44.729> both<00:04:44.849> sides<00:04:44.910> I<00:04:45.419> mean

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
there's people on both sides I mean

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.779 
there's people on both sides I mean
obviously<00:04:46.139> the<00:04:46.410> traditional<00:04:47.160> thing<00:04:47.340> is<00:04:47.580> it's

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
obviously the traditional thing is it's

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.100 
obviously the traditional thing is it's
not<00:04:47.940> gonna<00:04:48.090> happen<00:04:48.210> I<00:04:48.510> think<00:04:48.539> that's<00:04:48.900> probably

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
not gonna happen I think that's probably

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.930 
not gonna happen I think that's probably
true<00:04:49.320> first<00:04:49.770> of<00:04:49.889> all<00:04:50.010> I<00:04:50.190> don't<00:04:50.250> think<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.669> Jets

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
true first of all I don't think the Jets

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.159 
true first of all I don't think the Jets
are<00:04:51.090> listening<00:04:51.419> to<00:04:51.570> me<00:04:51.750> so<00:04:52.410> let's<00:04:52.680> be<00:04:52.830> honest<00:04:53.130> I

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
are listening to me so let's be honest I

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.930 
are listening to me so let's be honest I
do<00:04:55.169> think<00:04:55.590> people<00:04:55.710> tend<00:04:56.010> to<00:04:56.160> look<00:04:56.280> at<00:04:56.430> downside

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
do think people tend to look at downside

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.339 
do think people tend to look at downside
more<00:04:57.180> than<00:04:57.300> upside<00:04:57.660> i<00:04:57.840> think<00:04:58.080> for<00:04:58.229> the<00:04:58.320> first

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
more than upside i think for the first

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.650 
more than upside i think for the first
three<00:04:58.800> quarters<00:04:59.070> of<00:04:59.190> a<00:04:59.340> gain<00:04:59.520> or<00:04:59.550> so<00:04:59.880> it's<00:05:00.450> all

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
three quarters of a gain or so it's all

three quarters of a gain or so it's all
about<00:05:00.690> point<00:05:01.260> accumulation<00:05:01.889> we<00:05:02.280> tend<00:05:02.729> to

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
about point accumulation we tend to

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.700 
about point accumulation we tend to
think<00:05:02.849> in<00:05:03.120> terms<00:05:03.180> of<00:05:03.479> threes<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:03.840> sevens<00:05:04.260> but

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
think in terms of threes and sevens but

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.770 
think in terms of threes and sevens but
you<00:05:04.830> don't<00:05:04.979> know<00:05:05.099> the<00:05:05.220> future<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.820> it<00:05:06.510> rarely

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
you don't know the future and it rarely

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.540 
you don't know the future and it rarely

teams get google they get safeties and

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.150 
teams get google they get safeties and
get<00:05:10.830> miss<00:05:11.039> Jules<00:05:11.340> and<00:05:11.760> so<00:05:12.770> if<00:05:13.770> you<00:05:13.830> have<00:05:14.099> a

game was over that would be the only
game<00:05:47.759> we're<00:05:48.119> doing<00:05:48.509> it<00:05:48.659> one<00:05:48.839> way<00:05:48.959> or<00:05:48.989> they

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 
game we're doing it one way or they

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:50.540

would<00:05:49.469> have<00:05:49.499> impacted<00:05:50.039> it<00:05:50.159> would<00:05:50.369> have

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
would have impacted it would have

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.669 
would have impacted it would have
actually<00:05:50.699> impacted<00:05:51.449> positive<00:05:52.019> but<00:05:52.349> you<00:05:52.499> can't

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:52.679 
actually impacted positive but you can't

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:55.939 
actually impacted positive but you can't
predict<00:05:52.979> that<00:05:53.129> and<00:05:53.610> so<00:05:53.969> my<00:05:54.509> sense<00:05:54.779> is<00:05:54.959> if<00:05:55.739> you

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
predict that and so my sense is if you

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.829 
predict that and so my sense is if you
can<00:05:56.129> do<00:05:56.309> it<00:05:56.429> introverted<00:05:56.879> fifty<00:05:57.300> percent<00:05:57.569> they

00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:57.839 
can do it introverted fifty percent they

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:00.229 
can do it introverted fifty percent they
should<00:05:58.169> because<00:05:58.679> they'll<00:05:59.399> increase<00:06:00.029> their

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:00.239 
should because they'll increase their

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:02.239 
should because they'll increase their
chances<00:06:00.269> that<00:06:00.659> they<00:06:00.809> get<00:06:01.019> more<00:06:01.139> positive<00:06:01.649> all

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:02.249
