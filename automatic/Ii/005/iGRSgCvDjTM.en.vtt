00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.740 

hey<00:00:04.250> this<00:00:04.399> is<00:00:04.549> mr.<00:00:04.819> Buffington<00:00:05.149> we're<00:00:05.479> going

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
hey this is mr. Buffington we're going

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.799 
hey this is mr. Buffington we're going
to<00:00:05.870> look<00:00:06.109> at<00:00:06.319> prime<00:00:07.010> and<00:00:07.340> composite<00:00:07.809> numbers

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
to look at prime and composite numbers

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.990 
to look at prime and composite numbers
again<00:00:09.769> another<00:00:10.070> word<00:00:10.340> that<00:00:10.370> I<00:00:10.580> say<00:00:10.820> a<00:00:10.850> little

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
again another word that I say a little

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.960 
again another word that I say a little
bit<00:00:11.240> differently<00:00:11.660> i<00:00:11.750> used<00:00:12.019> to<00:00:12.260> say<00:00:12.500> I'm

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:12.970 
bit differently i used to say I'm

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.850 
bit differently i used to say I'm
composite<00:00:13.970> numbers<00:00:14.390> but<00:00:14.720> apparently<00:00:15.620> that

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
composite numbers but apparently that

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.450 
composite numbers but apparently that
showed<00:00:16.730> my<00:00:16.939> accent<00:00:17.539> where<00:00:18.140> I'm<00:00:18.349> from<00:00:18.740> so<00:00:18.890> if

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
showed my accent where I'm from so if

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.790 
showed my accent where I'm from so if
you're<00:00:19.670> used<00:00:19.850> to<00:00:20.000> hearing<00:00:20.180> it<00:00:20.510> as<00:00:20.800> composite

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
you're used to hearing it as composite

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.060 
you're used to hearing it as composite
numbers<00:00:22.520> then<00:00:22.880> I<00:00:23.570> guess<00:00:24.050> you're<00:00:24.740> from<00:00:24.980> a

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
numbers then I guess you're from a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.950 
numbers then I guess you're from a
different<00:00:25.100> part<00:00:25.550> of<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:25.730> world<00:00:25.789> and<00:00:26.210> I'm<00:00:26.630> used

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
different part of the world and I'm used

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.010 
different part of the world and I'm used
to<00:00:27.020> hearing<00:00:27.199> it<00:00:27.410> as<00:00:27.590> composite<00:00:27.980> but<00:00:28.490> hey<00:00:29.020> we'll

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
to hearing it as composite but hey we'll

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.540 
to hearing it as composite but hey we'll
switch<00:00:30.289> back<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:30.500> forth<00:00:30.740> interchangeably

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
switch back and forth interchangeably

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.500 
switch back and forth interchangeably
either<00:00:32.059> way<00:00:32.359> a<00:00:33.219> prime<00:00:34.219> number<00:00:34.250> is<00:00:34.820> a<00:00:35.180> number

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
either way a prime number is a number

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.960 
either way a prime number is a number
that<00:00:35.690> is<00:00:35.930> only<00:00:36.200> divisible<00:00:36.710> by<00:00:36.980> itself<00:00:37.520> in<00:00:37.760> one

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
that is only divisible by itself in one

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.490 
that is only divisible by itself in one
it<00:00:38.120> must<00:00:38.300> be<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:38.450> whole<00:00:38.720> number<00:00:38.899> that's<00:00:39.290> greater

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
it must be a whole number that's greater

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.860 
it must be a whole number that's greater
than<00:00:39.770> one<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:40.420> let's<00:00:41.420> look<00:00:41.600> at<00:00:41.780> a<00:00:41.809> couple

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
than one so let's look at a couple

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.590 
than one so let's look at a couple
examples<00:00:42.260> of<00:00:42.829> prime<00:00:43.190> numbers<00:00:43.219> numbers<00:00:44.210> that

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
examples of prime numbers numbers that

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.840 
examples of prime numbers numbers that
can<00:00:44.750> only<00:00:45.050> be<00:00:45.260> evenly<00:00:46.100> divisible<00:00:46.520> by

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
can only be evenly divisible by

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.830 
can only be evenly divisible by
themselves<00:00:47.809> and<00:00:48.200> one<00:00:48.559> so<00:00:49.250> too<00:00:49.879> for<00:00:50.360> example<00:00:50.780> it

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
themselves and one so too for example it

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.279 
themselves and one so too for example it
can<00:00:50.930> only<00:00:51.079> be<00:00:51.320> divisible<00:00:51.649> by<00:00:51.890> 2<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:52.640> 12<00:00:53.420> /<00:00:53.930> 1<00:00:54.170> is

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
can only be divisible by 2 and 12 / 1 is

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.529 
can only be divisible by 2 and 12 / 1 is
1<00:00:54.469> 1<00:00:54.680> divided<00:00:55.070> or<00:00:55.250> 2<00:00:55.430> divided<00:00:55.820> by<00:00:55.850> 2<00:00:55.940> is<00:00:57.309> 12<00:00:58.309> /<00:00:58.579> 1

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
1 1 divided or 2 divided by 2 is 12 / 1

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
1 1 divided or 2 divided by 2 is 12 / 1
is<00:00:59.719> 2<00:00:59.920> 3<00:01:00.920> is<00:01:01.039> another<00:01:01.340> 13<00:01:01.789> /<00:01:02.149> 1<00:01:02.420> is<00:01:02.570> 3<00:01:02.750> 3<00:01:03.230> divided

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
is 2 3 is another 13 / 1 is 3 3 divided

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.219 
is 2 3 is another 13 / 1 is 3 3 divided
by<00:01:03.620> 3<00:01:03.860> is<00:01:03.890> 1<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:04.729> has<00:01:04.939> no<00:01:05.180> other<00:01:05.449> factors

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
by 3 is 1 it has no other factors

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.559 
by 3 is 1 it has no other factors
basically<00:01:07.039> is<00:01:07.609> another<00:01:07.880> way<00:01:08.029> to<00:01:08.090> think<00:01:08.209> of<00:01:08.450> it

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:08.569 
basically is another way to think of it

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:12.550 
basically is another way to think of it
13<00:01:09.340> 17<00:01:10.340> you<00:01:10.999> might<00:01:11.209> think<00:01:11.420> that<00:01:11.539> wow<00:01:11.959> they<00:01:12.319> are

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
13 17 you might think that wow they are

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.580 
13 17 you might think that wow they are
only<00:01:12.799> divisible<00:01:13.279> by<00:01:13.549> 1<00:01:13.999> and<00:01:14.270> itself<00:01:15.170> then

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
only divisible by 1 and itself then

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.969 
only divisible by 1 and itself then
there<00:01:15.829> might<00:01:15.950> be<00:01:16.009> some<00:01:16.429> you<00:01:17.090> know<00:01:17.499> there<00:01:18.499> may

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
there might be some you know there may

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.459 
there might be some you know there may
be<00:01:19.009> not<00:01:19.490> as<00:01:19.759> many<00:01:20.359> big<00:01:20.659> numbers<00:01:21.020> but<00:01:21.259> some

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
be not as many big numbers but some

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.219 
be not as many big numbers but some
really<00:01:21.859> large<00:01:22.039> numbers<00:01:22.579> are<00:01:22.849> still<00:01:23.240> only

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
really large numbers are still only

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.370 
really large numbers are still only
divisible<00:01:24.770> by<00:01:25.009> themselves<00:01:25.639> and<00:01:25.939> by<00:01:26.270> one<00:01:26.569> so

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
divisible by themselves and by one so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.999 
divisible by themselves and by one so
here<00:01:27.679> are<00:01:27.770> some<00:01:27.829> examples<00:01:28.490> of<00:01:28.609> prime<00:01:29.090> numbers

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
here are some examples of prime numbers

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.499 
here are some examples of prime numbers
not<00:01:31.009> all<00:01:31.249> of<00:01:31.429> them<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.729> course<00:01:31.759> but<00:01:32.029> there's

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
not all of them of course but there's

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.839 
not all of them of course but there's
just<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.959> list<00:01:33.259> of<00:01:33.469> some<00:01:33.799> of<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:34.159> prime<00:01:34.429> numbers

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:34.849 
just a list of some of the prime numbers

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:39.879 
just a list of some of the prime numbers
a<00:01:36.279> composite<00:01:37.279> number<00:01:37.310> is<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:39.020> number<00:01:39.499> or

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:39.889 
a composite number is a number or

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:41.859 
a composite number is a number or
composite<00:01:40.369> number<00:01:40.849> is<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.149> number<00:01:41.539> that<00:01:41.840> has

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
composite number is a number that has

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.789 
composite number is a number that has
factors<00:01:42.679> other<00:01:42.889> than<00:01:43.249> itself<00:01:44.029> and<00:01:44.329> one<00:01:44.560> so<00:01:45.560> an

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
factors other than itself and one so an

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.300 
factors other than itself and one so an
example<00:01:45.919> is<00:01:46.520> 88<00:01:47.479> has<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.989> factors<00:01:48.380> of<00:01:48.409> one<00:01:48.829> two

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
example is 88 has the factors of one two

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.289 
example is 88 has the factors of one two
four<00:01:49.789> and<00:01:49.939> eight<00:01:50.799> okay<00:01:51.799> it<00:01:52.130> can<00:01:52.489> be<00:01:52.609> divided<00:01:52.999> by

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
four and eight okay it can be divided by

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.529 
four and eight okay it can be divided by
any<00:01:53.569> of<00:01:53.689> these<00:01:53.929> four<00:01:54.289> numbers<00:01:54.369> so<00:01:55.369> again<00:01:55.759> if<00:01:55.969> it

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
any of these four numbers so again if it

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.589 
any of these four numbers so again if it
were<00:01:56.689> only<00:01:56.749> divisible<00:01:57.439> by<00:01:57.739> 1<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:58.459> itself<00:01:58.999> then

00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599 
were only divisible by 1 and itself then

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.409 
were only divisible by 1 and itself then
it<00:02:00.109> would<00:02:00.289> be<00:02:00.409> prime<00:02:00.709> but<00:02:01.189> it<00:02:01.309> also<00:02:01.489> has<00:02:01.849> the

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:02.419 
it would be prime but it also has the

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:06.569 
it would be prime but it also has the
factors<00:02:02.929> of<00:02:03.109> 2<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:03.439> 4<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:04.459> make<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.880> into<00:02:05.539> a

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
factors of 2 and 4 to make it into a

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.150 
factors of 2 and 4 to make it into a
composite<00:02:07.579> number<00:02:07.660> composite<00:02:08.660> number<00:02:09.009> 36<00:02:10.009> is

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
composite number composite number 36 is

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.429 
composite number composite number 36 is
an<00:02:10.340> example<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.239> number<00:02:11.420> that<00:02:11.689> has<00:02:11.870> lots<00:02:12.140> of

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439 
an example of a number that has lots of

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:16.480 
an example of a number that has lots of
factors<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.040> has<00:02:13.159> 1<00:02:13.430> 2<00:02:13.700> 3<00:02:13.730> 4<00:02:14.180> 6<00:02:14.810> 9<00:02:15.049> 12<00:02:15.079> 18<00:02:15.739> 30

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
factors it has 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 30

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.290 
factors it has 1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 30
date<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:17.450> 36<00:02:17.990> is<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.470> number<00:02:19.070> it's<00:02:19.520> definitely<00:02:19.820> a

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
date so 36 is a number it's definitely a

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.750 
date so 36 is a number it's definitely a
composite<00:02:21.230> number<00:02:21.260> it's<00:02:21.620> got<00:02:21.830> tons<00:02:22.340> of

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
composite number it's got tons of

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.020 
composite number it's got tons of
factors<00:02:23.240> look<00:02:23.510> at<00:02:23.630> all<00:02:23.750> these<00:02:23.870> factors<00:02:24.380> 36<00:02:25.340> all

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
factors look at all these factors 36 all

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.570 
factors look at all these factors 36 all
right<00:02:26.180> many<00:02:26.840> factors<00:02:27.410> other<00:02:27.590> than<00:02:27.860> just<00:02:28.220> one

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
right many factors other than just one

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.160 
right many factors other than just one
end<00:02:28.850> itself<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.760> what<00:02:32.450> we're<00:02:32.630> going<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.990> do

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
end itself so what we're going to do

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.190 
end itself so what we're going to do
next<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.830> something<00:02:34.580> called<00:02:34.730> prime

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
next is something called prime

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.930 
next is something called prime
factorization<00:02:36.200> that's<00:02:36.410> when<00:02:37.250> we<00:02:37.400> take<00:02:37.730> a

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
factorization that's when we take a

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.960 
factorization that's when we take a
number<00:02:38.870> that's<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.500> composite<00:02:40.220> number<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.700> we

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
number that's a composite number and we

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.840 
number that's a composite number and we
find<00:02:41.360> all<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:42.470> prime<00:02:42.980> numbers<00:02:43.550> that<00:02:43.760> would

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
find all the prime numbers that would

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.960 
find all the prime numbers that would
multiply<00:02:44.270> together<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:45.050> give<00:02:45.290> us<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:46.070> prime

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
multiply together to give us that prime

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.510 
multiply together to give us that prime
factor<00:02:47.420> we<00:02:47.930> usually<00:02:48.080> find<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.740> using<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:49.130> factor

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
factor we usually find it using a factor

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.970 
factor we usually find it using a factor
tree<00:02:49.700> which<00:02:49.970> is<00:02:50.000> not<00:02:50.420> only<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.950> know

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
tree which is not only you know

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.940 
tree which is not only you know
effective<00:02:52.820> it's<00:02:52.970> also<00:02:53.120> kind<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.540> fun<00:02:53.690> and

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
effective it's also kind of fun and

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.090 
effective it's also kind of fun and
basically<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.790> way<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:55.970> break<00:02:56.240> down

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
basically this is a way to break down

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.350 
basically this is a way to break down
composite<00:02:58.100> numbers<00:02:58.490> into<00:02:59.000> their<00:02:59.120> prime

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
composite numbers into their prime

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.550 
composite numbers into their prime
factors<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:01.430> here's<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.180> sample<00:03:02.930> question<00:03:03.320> find

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
factors so here's a sample question find

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.000 
factors so here's a sample question find
the<00:03:03.680> prime<00:03:03.920> factorization<00:03:03.980> of<00:03:04.970> 72<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.710> we<00:03:06.830> look

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
the prime factorization of 72 so we look

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.970 
the prime factorization of 72 so we look
at<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.250> number<00:03:07.520> 72<00:03:08.240> and<00:03:08.660> we<00:03:08.810> can<00:03:08.990> pick<00:03:09.230> any<00:03:09.470> two

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
at the number 72 and we can pick any two

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.260 
at the number 72 and we can pick any two
factors<00:03:10.670> of<00:03:10.880> 72<00:03:11.510> we<00:03:11.690> could<00:03:11.900> say<00:03:12.080> 2<00:03:12.140> x<00:03:12.620> 36<00:03:13.310> or<00:03:13.520> you

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
factors of 72 we could say 2 x 36 or you

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.180 
factors of 72 we could say 2 x 36 or you
know<00:03:14.390> break<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:14.960> down<00:03:14.990> to<00:03:15.320> basically<00:03:15.830> anything

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
know break it down to basically anything

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.460 
know break it down to basically anything
that<00:03:16.370> we<00:03:16.610> want<00:03:16.640> but<00:03:17.570> what<00:03:17.720> I'm<00:03:17.840> going<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.170> do<00:03:18.320> is

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
that we want but what I'm going to do is

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.050 
that we want but what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:03:18.590> going<00:03:18.770> to<00:03:18.920> use<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.220> factors<00:03:19.610> of<00:03:19.640> eight

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
I'm going to use the factors of eight

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.990 
I'm going to use the factors of eight
and<00:03:20.090> nine<00:03:20.570> I<00:03:20.870> know<00:03:21.080> eight<00:03:21.470> times<00:03:21.800> nine<00:03:21.980> is<00:03:22.160> 72

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
and nine I know eight times nine is 72

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.210 
and nine I know eight times nine is 72
so<00:03:23.600> I'm<00:03:23.690> going<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:23.990> put<00:03:24.050> eight<00:03:24.470> over<00:03:24.830> here<00:03:25.070> on

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
so I'm going to put eight over here on

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.950 
so I'm going to put eight over here on
the<00:03:25.370> left<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:25.820> nine<00:03:26.030> over<00:03:26.390> here<00:03:26.570> on<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.780> right

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
the left and nine over here on the right

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.810 
the left and nine over here on the right
eight<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.250> nine<00:03:28.520> are<00:03:28.910> both<00:03:29.290> still<00:03:30.820> composite

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
eight and nine are both still composite

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.390 
eight and nine are both still composite
numbers<00:03:32.210> so<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.810> I<00:03:33.200> can<00:03:33.560> actually<00:03:33.890> go<00:03:34.010> one<00:03:34.250> step

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
numbers so I I can actually go one step

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.450 
numbers so I I can actually go one step
further<00:03:34.760> with<00:03:35.000> both<00:03:35.240> of<00:03:35.270> them<00:03:35.600> 8<00:03:36.200> is<00:03:36.500> 4<00:03:36.800> times<00:03:37.040> 2

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
further with both of them 8 is 4 times 2

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.720 
further with both of them 8 is 4 times 2
and<00:03:37.700> 9<00:03:37.850> is<00:03:38.120> 3<00:03:38.390> times<00:03:38.660> 3<00:03:38.920> now<00:03:39.920> this<00:03:40.100> is<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.340> first

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
and 9 is 3 times 3 now this is the first

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.400 
and 9 is 3 times 3 now this is the first
time<00:03:41.000> where<00:03:41.270> I've<00:03:41.360> actually<00:03:41.510> hit<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:41.960> couple<00:03:42.200> of

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
time where I've actually hit a couple of

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.070 
time where I've actually hit a couple of
prime<00:03:42.680> numbers<00:03:43.450> when<00:03:44.450> i<00:03:44.480> hit<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.780> prime<00:03:45.050> number

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
prime numbers when i hit a prime number

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.410

so<00:04:06.860> now<00:04:07.370> I<00:04:07.400> have<00:04:07.850> all<00:04:08.120> of<00:04:08.210> the<00:04:08.750> prime<00:04:09.080> numbers

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
so now I have all of the prime numbers

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.560 
so now I have all of the prime numbers
they<00:04:10.040> could<00:04:10.250> multiply<00:04:10.580> together<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.300> give<00:04:11.450> me

prime factorization in both ways some

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:51.820 
prime factorization in both ways some
people<00:04:50.270> consider<00:04:50.689> one<00:04:50.990> way<00:04:51.169> more<00:04:51.439> correct

than the other some people really like

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.659 
than the other some people really like
writing<00:04:54.199> it<00:04:54.409> with<00:04:54.559> exponents<00:04:55.099> and<00:04:55.490> that's

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
writing it with exponents and that's

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.399 
writing it with exponents and that's
fine<00:04:56.949> but<00:04:57.949> basically<00:04:58.759> both<00:04:59.149> answers<00:04:59.749> could<00:05:00.349> be

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.409 
fine but basically both answers could be

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:02.109 
fine but basically both answers could be
a<00:05:00.589> way<00:05:00.830> of<00:05:00.979> writing<00:05:01.339> the<00:05:01.430> prime<00:05:01.639> factorization

00:05:02.109 --> 00:05:02.119 
a way of writing the prime factorization

a way of writing the prime factorization
I've<00:05:02.569> seen<00:05:02.779> more<00:05:02.990> final<00:05:03.529> answers<00:05:03.889> written<00:05:04.219> in

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
I've seen more final answers written in

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.459 
I've seen more final answers written in
this<00:05:04.729> format<00:05:05.270> though<00:05:05.569> all<00:05:06.139> right<00:05:06.289> so

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:06.469 
this format though all right so

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:08.559 
this format though all right so
typically<00:05:06.919> you<00:05:07.159> will<00:05:07.339> write<00:05:07.610> it<00:05:07.819> using<00:05:08.360> the

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
typically you will write it using the

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.049 
typically you will write it using the
exponent<00:05:09.409> form<00:05:09.709> all<00:05:10.459> right<00:05:10.580> so<00:05:10.729> there's<00:05:10.909> the

00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:11.059 
exponent form all right so there's the

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:15.309 
exponent form all right so there's the
prime<00:05:11.330> factorization<00:05:11.899> of<00:05:12.439> 72<00:05:13.869> so<00:05:14.869> just<00:05:15.199> a
