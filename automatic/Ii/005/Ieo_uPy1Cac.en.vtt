00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:58.209 
transform it supposed to look like a

00:05:58.209 --> 00:06:02.489 
transform it supposed to look like a
city<00:05:58.829> little<00:05:59.829> space<00:06:00.249> city<00:06:00.909> vehicle<00:06:01.869> transport

city little space city vehicle transport

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:06.449 
city little space city vehicle transport
line<00:06:03.159> I<00:06:03.189> guess<00:06:03.749> so<00:06:04.749> that's<00:06:04.989> it<00:06:05.259> for<00:06:05.799> the<00:06:06.189> set

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:06.459 
line I guess so that's it for the set

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:11.489 
line I guess so that's it for the set
really<00:06:07.029> good<00:06:07.689> and<00:06:08.610> on<00:06:09.610> to<00:06:09.909> the<00:06:10.269> ratings<00:06:11.199> for

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:11.499 
really good and on to the ratings for

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:14.449 
really good and on to the ratings for
many<00:06:11.739> figures<00:06:12.009> give<00:06:12.819> them<00:06:12.999> a<00:06:13.119> 7<00:06:13.719> out<00:06:13.839> of<00:06:13.869> 10

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:14.459 
many figures give them a 7 out of 10

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:16.469 
many figures give them a 7 out of 10
because<00:06:15.459> they<00:06:15.729> don't<00:06:15.879> really<00:06:16.089> like<00:06:16.269> the<00:06:16.419> space

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
because they don't really like the space

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.409 
because they don't really like the space
