apparatus I use this pump to pump water
through<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.889> tubing<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.519> out<00:00:11.880> into<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.450> tank

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
through the tubing and out into the tank

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.400 
through the tubing and out into the tank
so<00:00:12.870> what's<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.799> problem<00:00:14.040> here<00:00:14.370> well<00:00:15.410> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
so what's the problem here well the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.300 
so what's the problem here well the
problem<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.100> look<00:00:17.970> at<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.449> tubing<00:00:19.310> black

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
problem is look at this tubing black

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.880 
problem is look at this tubing black
look<00:00:21.119> at<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.230> supposed<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.740> be

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
look at that this is supposed to be

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.160 
look at that this is supposed to be
clear<00:00:23.250> tubing<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.300> what's<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> point<00:00:24.990> of

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
clear tubing so what's the point of

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.410 
clear tubing so what's the point of
today's<00:00:25.439> video<00:00:25.650> well<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.910> point<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.300> to

model<00:02:07.300> in<00:02:07.420> this<00:02:07.990> fantastic<00:02:08.470> secure<00:02:09.160> and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
model in this fantastic secure and

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.289 
model in this fantastic secure and
masculinity<00:02:09.820> pink<00:02:10.150> color

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.729 

now<00:02:14.299> what<00:02:14.689> you'll<00:02:14.840> do<00:02:14.989> is<00:02:15.110> you'll<00:02:15.260> just<00:02:15.439> simply

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
now what you'll do is you'll just simply

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.319 
now what you'll do is you'll just simply
add<00:02:15.860> your<00:02:16.040> hydrogen<00:02:16.340> peroxide<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.150> water

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
add your hydrogen peroxide to the water

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.619 
add your hydrogen peroxide to the water
now<00:02:17.659> there's<00:02:18.110> no<00:02:18.439> exact<00:02:19.010> amount<00:02:19.430> more<00:02:20.030> is<00:02:20.209> okay

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
now there's no exact amount more is okay

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.229 
now there's no exact amount more is okay
but<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:20.989> recommend<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:22.099> used<00:02:22.549> about<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.790> cup<00:02:23.060> for

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
but I recommend I used about a cup for

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.569 
but I recommend I used about a cup for
this<00:02:23.360> five<00:02:23.569> gallon<00:02:23.959> bucket<00:02:24.349> honestly<00:02:25.189> less<00:02:25.400> is

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
this five gallon bucket honestly less is

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.399 
this five gallon bucket honestly less is
fine<00:02:25.760> as<00:02:26.000> well<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.480> like<00:02:26.930> i<00:02:26.959> say<00:02:27.200> more

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
fine as well and like i say more

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:31.860 
fine as well and like i say more
certainly<00:02:27.829> won't<00:02:27.950> hurt<00:02:28.159> anything

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.470 

then<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.890> simply<00:02:33.069> plug<00:02:33.489> in<00:02:33.670> your<00:02:33.760> pump<00:02:34.000> let

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
then you simply plug in your pump let

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.610 
then you simply plug in your pump let
the<00:02:34.599> water<00:02:34.780> start<00:02:35.080> moving<00:02:35.349> in

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
the water start moving in

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:49.290 
the water start moving in
voila

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.440 

now<00:02:50.300> don't<00:02:50.600> forget<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.350> most<00:02:51.590> crucial<00:02:52.190> step

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
now don't forget the most crucial step

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.050 
now don't forget the most crucial step
set<00:02:53.450> your<00:02:53.660> Hello<00:02:53.900> Kitty<00:02:54.290> timer<00:02:54.620> for<00:02:55.070> around<00:02:55.460> 30

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
set your Hello Kitty timer for around 30

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.130 
set your Hello Kitty timer for around 30
minutes<00:02:58.240> now<00:02:59.240> you<00:02:59.300> can<00:02:59.540> also<00:02:59.690> do<00:02:59.930> this<00:03:00.080> with

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
minutes now you can also do this with

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.560 
minutes now you can also do this with
gravel<00:03:00.680> box<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.370> just<00:03:01.400> need<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.730> second<00:03:02.300> bucket

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
gravel box you just need a second bucket

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.960 
gravel box you just need a second bucket
and<00:03:02.870> then<00:03:03.410> simply<00:03:03.800> siphon<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.250> hydrogen

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
and then simply siphon the hydrogen

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.090 
and then simply siphon the hydrogen
peroxide<00:03:05.450> water<00:03:05.690> mix<00:03:05.990> from<00:03:06.260> one<00:03:06.440> bucket<00:03:06.680> to

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
peroxide water mix from one bucket to

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.770 
peroxide water mix from one bucket to
the<00:03:07.130> other<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.430> couple<00:03:07.640> times<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.300> then<00:03:08.360> let

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
the other a couple times and then let

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.630 
the other a couple times and then let
your<00:03:08.900> grapple<00:03:09.380> vac<00:03:09.530> air<00:03:09.770> dry<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.100> there<00:03:10.520> you

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
your grapple vac air dry and there you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.140 
your grapple vac air dry and there you
have<00:03:10.820> it

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.120 

now<00:03:14.150> back<00:03:14.420> in<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.690> Batcave<00:03:15.140> we<00:03:15.530> still<00:03:15.920> have

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
now back in the Batcave we still have

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.400 
now back in the Batcave we still have
the<00:03:16.280> water<00:03:16.460> pump<00:03:16.760> going<00:03:17.210> now<00:03:17.870> this<00:03:18.050> is<00:03:18.170> between

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
the water pump going now this is between

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.960 
the water pump going now this is between
about<00:03:18.650> five<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:19.100> ten<00:03:19.280> minutes<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:19.730> you<00:03:19.850> can

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
about five to ten minutes and you can

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.820 
about five to ten minutes and you can
already<00:03:20.240> see<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.660> black<00:03:20.990> gunk<00:03:21.320> starting<00:03:21.740> to

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
already see the black gunk starting to

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:30.130 
already see the black gunk starting to
break<00:03:22.100> up<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.550> come<00:03:22.760> out<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.090> tubing

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.070 

and<00:03:30.700> you<00:03:31.700> can<00:03:31.850> see<00:03:32.120> as<00:03:32.240> I<00:03:32.360> kind<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.660> manipulate

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
and you can see as I kind of manipulate

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.510 
and you can see as I kind of manipulate
this<00:03:33.230> thing<00:03:33.290> around<00:03:33.680> parts<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.160> tubing

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
this thing around parts of the tubing

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.680 
this thing around parts of the tubing
are<00:03:34.670> starting<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.180> look<00:03:35.270> a<00:03:35.360> little<00:03:35.450> bit

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
are starting to look a little bit

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.870 
are starting to look a little bit
clearer<00:03:36.020> but<00:03:36.680> still<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.040> little<00:03:37.280> ways<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.459> go

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.490 

so<00:03:42.880> here<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:43.150> is<00:03:43.240> after<00:03:43.450> about<00:03:43.750> 10<00:03:43.990> to<00:03:44.110> 50

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
so here it is after about 10 to 50

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.680 
so here it is after about 10 to 50
minutes<00:03:44.800> I<00:03:45.040> stopped<00:03:45.790> it<00:03:45.970> just<00:03:46.240> to<00:03:46.450> kind<00:03:46.570> of

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
minutes I stopped it just to kind of

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.340 
minutes I stopped it just to kind of
show<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:47.400> Young's<00:03:48.400> do

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.730 

finally<00:03:53.350> we<00:03:53.530> have<00:03:53.800> it<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:54.820> finished<00:03:55.090> project

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
finally we have it the finished project

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.530 
finally we have it the finished project
for<00:03:56.740> me<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:57.040> tubing<00:03:57.430> still<00:03:58.150> looks<00:03:58.330> a<00:03:58.420> little

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
for me the tubing still looks a little

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.030 
for me the tubing still looks a little
bit<00:03:58.750> dark<00:03:58.990> right<00:03:59.200> when<00:03:59.380> I<00:03:59.410> take<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.770> out<00:03:59.860> of<00:03:59.950> the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
bit dark right when I take it out of the

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.340 
bit dark right when I take it out of the
water<00:04:00.270> but<00:04:01.270> then<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.540> let<00:04:01.750> it<00:04:01.780> air<00:04:02.050> dry

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
water but then I let it air dry

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.280 
water but then I let it air dry
I'm<00:04:02.620> usually<00:04:03.340> overnight<00:04:03.640> and<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.750> hydrogen

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
I'm usually overnight and the hydrogen

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.350 
I'm usually overnight and the hydrogen
peroxide<00:04:05.500> bleaches<00:04:06.370> out<00:04:06.520> whatever<00:04:06.790> residue

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
peroxide bleaches out whatever residue

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.720 
peroxide bleaches out whatever residue
is<00:04:07.450> left<00:04:07.660> inside<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.140> tubing<00:04:08.520> so<00:04:09.520> while<00:04:09.700> not

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
is left inside the tubing so while not

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.480 
is left inside the tubing so while not
all<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.960> the<00:04:11.140> kind<00:04:11.410> of<00:04:11.500> gunk<00:04:11.710> comes<00:04:12.010> out<00:04:12.310> of

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
all of the kind of gunk comes out of

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.730 
all of the kind of gunk comes out of
there<00:04:12.670> as<00:04:13.450> you<00:04:13.600> can<00:04:13.750> see<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.140> tubing<00:04:14.500> looks

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
there as you can see the tubing looks

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.680 
there as you can see the tubing looks
much<00:04:15.160> much<00:04:15.370> cleaner<00:04:15.730> which<00:04:16.030> helps<00:04:16.450> promote

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
much much cleaner which helps promote

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.630 
much much cleaner which helps promote
the<00:04:16.840> health<00:04:17.350> of<00:04:17.620> pretty<00:04:18.010> much<00:04:18.130> everything<00:04:18.519> in

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
the health of pretty much everything in

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.030 
the health of pretty much everything in
your<00:04:18.760> tank<00:04:18.940> not<00:04:19.690> bad<00:04:19.930> I'd<00:04:20.200> give<00:04:20.530> myself<00:04:20.709> a
