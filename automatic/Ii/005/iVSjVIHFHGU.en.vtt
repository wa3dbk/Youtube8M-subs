look like after the upgrade
the<00:02:13.359> developers<00:02:13.930> even<00:02:14.379> added<00:02:14.709> really<00:02:15.129> subtle

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
the developers even added really subtle

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.330 
the developers even added really subtle
things<00:02:15.819> for<00:02:16.569> example<00:02:16.659> they<00:02:17.560> added<00:02:17.890> fallen

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
things for example they added fallen

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.089 
things for example they added fallen
leaves<00:02:18.609> under<00:02:18.969> trees<00:02:19.359> and<00:02:19.780> other<00:02:20.409> beautiful

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
leaves under trees and other beautiful

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.459 
leaves under trees and other beautiful
little<00:02:21.250> brush<00:02:21.519> strokes<00:02:21.849> like<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.390> they<00:02:23.200> make

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:23.469 
little brush strokes like that they make

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.009 
little brush strokes like that they make
a<00:02:23.500> huge<00:02:24.099> difference<00:02:24.840> something<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.989> note

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
a huge difference something to note

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.099 
a huge difference something to note
something<00:02:26.950> very<00:02:27.430> important<00:02:28.120> actually<00:02:28.359> is

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
something very important actually is

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:31.349 
something very important actually is
that<00:02:29.379> the<00:02:29.469> frames<00:02:29.739> per<00:02:30.010> second<00:02:30.430> will<00:02:30.909> actually

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
that the frames per second will actually

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.530 
that the frames per second will actually
improve<00:02:31.810> on<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.439> new<00:02:32.590> maps<00:02:32.920> or<00:02:33.819> at<00:02:34.000> least<00:02:34.239> stay

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
improve on the new maps or at least stay

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.839 
improve on the new maps or at least stay
the<00:02:34.719> same<00:02:34.930> if<00:02:35.469> you<00:02:35.680> decide<00:02:36.069> to<00:02:36.250> use<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.670> higher

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
the same if you decide to use the higher

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.780 
the same if you decide to use the higher
settings<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:38.379> new<00:02:38.560> rendering<00:02:39.099> system<00:02:39.310> is

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
settings the new rendering system is

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.149 
settings the new rendering system is
going<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.569> really<00:02:40.840> help<00:02:41.139> the<00:02:41.379> game<00:02:41.560> run<00:02:41.859> more

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
going to really help the game run more

notebooks you'll be able to use the

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.710

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
some of the new graphical features but

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.610 
some of the new graphical features but
they'll<00:02:55.299> have<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.540> better<00:02:55.720> playing<00:02:56.139> experience
