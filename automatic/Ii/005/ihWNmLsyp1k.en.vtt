the<00:01:25.020> only<00:01:25.110> disappointing<00:01:25.710> part<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.340> half

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.340 
of over here just going to come with a
little<00:01:28.950> tiny<00:01:29.220> arm<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.020> I<00:01:31.020> think<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.259> would

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
little tiny arm and I think it would

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.359

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
to build two of them just in one series

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.929 
to build two of them just in one series
like<00:01:34.799> each<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.009> would<00:01:35.340> come<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.759> two

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
like each one would come with like two

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.270 
like each one would come with like two
pieces<00:01:36.150> or<00:01:36.479> something<00:01:36.829> just<00:01:37.829> kind<00:01:38.220> of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
pieces or something just kind of

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.390

unfulfilled<00:01:38.579> bath<00:01:39.090> bath<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.900> guess<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.770> mean

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
unfulfilled bath bath I guess but I mean

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.940

it's<00:01:41.490> still<00:01:41.579> pretty<00:01:41.790> cool<00:01:42.030> though<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.950> that's

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
it's still pretty cool though but that's

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.050 
it's still pretty cool though but that's
just<00:01:44.100> my<00:01:44.280> opinion<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:46.100> on<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> figure<00:01:47.759> I'm

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
just my opinion but on to the figure I'm

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.480 
just my opinion but on to the figure I'm
very<00:01:48.509> nice<00:01:48.750> looking<00:01:48.960> costume<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.829> I'm
