over<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.890> sort<00:00:42.280> of<00:00:42.370> confirmation<00:00:43.199> bird<00:00:44.199> blues

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
over a sort of confirmation bird blues

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.420 
over a sort of confirmation bird blues
type<00:00:45.480> progression<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:47.620> got<00:00:47.800> pretty<00:00:48.220> much

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
type progression it's got pretty much

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.549 
type progression it's got pretty much
the<00:00:48.489> same<00:00:48.909> changes<00:00:49.629> as<00:00:49.780> confirmation<00:00:50.409> and

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
the same changes as confirmation and

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:51.780 
the same changes as confirmation and
then<00:00:50.650> it<00:00:50.739> has<00:00:50.830> a<00:00:50.860> little<00:00:51.100> different<00:00:51.309> bridge

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
then it has a little different bridge

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.329 
then it has a little different bridge
but<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.570> point<00:00:52.809> is<00:00:53.110> is<00:00:53.379> that<00:00:53.860> there's<00:00:54.100> many

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
but the point is is that there's many

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.399 
but the point is is that there's many
common<00:00:55.180> progressions<00:00:55.659> that<00:00:55.839> can<00:00:55.989> be<00:00:56.110> applied

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
common progressions that can be applied

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.860 
common progressions that can be applied
to<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.739> standard<00:00:57.129> jazz<00:00:57.339> repertoire<00:00:57.909> lots<00:00:58.750> of

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
to the standard jazz repertoire lots of

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.500 
to the standard jazz repertoire lots of
to<00:00:59.110> five<00:00:59.350> ones<00:00:59.650> plus<00:01:00.400> of<00:01:00.640> three<00:01:00.970> six<00:01:01.239> two<00:01:01.479> five

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
to five ones plus of three six two five

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.189 
to five ones plus of three six two five
ones<00:01:02.040> which<00:01:03.040> is<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:04.360> progression<00:01:04.839> which<00:01:05.050> I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
ones which is the progression which I

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.140 
ones which is the progression which I
took<00:01:05.440> this<00:01:06.430> line<00:01:06.700> off<00:01:06.909> of<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:09.150> very

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
took this line off of it's a very

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.630 
took this line off of it's a very
classic<00:01:10.510> bebop<00:01:11.260> line<00:01:11.530> that<00:01:11.890> he<00:01:11.979> plays<00:01:12.220> over<00:01:12.610> a

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
classic bebop line that he plays over a

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.000 
classic bebop line that he plays over a
three<00:01:12.940> six<00:01:13.210> two<00:01:13.450> five<00:01:13.750> one<00:01:14.049> in<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.590> key<00:01:14.770> of<00:01:14.799> F

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
three six two five one in the key of F

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:25.080 
three six two five one in the key of F
so<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:16.030> mo<00:01:18.450> 62

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.120 

I<00:01:25.149> don't<00:01:25.899> want<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.079> spend<00:01:26.289> a<00:01:26.560> lot<00:01:26.799> of<00:01:26.950> time

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
I don't want to spend a lot of time

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.029 
I don't want to spend a lot of time
going<00:01:27.369> into<00:01:27.759> too<00:01:28.090> much<00:01:28.240> detail<00:01:28.750> and

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
going into too much detail and

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.080 
going into too much detail and
deconstructing<00:01:30.039> the<00:01:30.130> line<00:01:30.310> but<00:01:30.640> I<00:01:30.789> would<00:01:30.969> like

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
deconstructing the line but I would like

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.249 
deconstructing the line but I would like
to<00:01:31.240> point<00:01:31.420> out<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:31.630> couple<00:01:31.899> of<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.109> interesting

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
to point out a couple of the interesting

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.539 
to point out a couple of the interesting
things<00:01:32.799> that<00:01:33.490> I<00:01:34.119> like<00:01:34.990> about<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.469> so<00:01:35.649> let's

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
things that I like about it so let's

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.919 
things that I like about it so let's
briefly<00:01:36.700> go<00:01:36.909> through<00:01:37.240> it<00:01:37.329> very<00:01:39.719> simple<00:01:40.719> he's

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
briefly go through it very simple he's

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.899 
briefly go through it very simple he's
just<00:01:41.079> approaching<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.590> root<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.549> a<00:01:42.579> minor

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
just approaching the root of the a minor

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.810 
just approaching the root of the a minor
7

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.180 

I<00:01:45.850> was<00:01:46.360> seen<00:01:46.570> that<00:01:46.720> before<00:01:47.350> circling<00:01:47.920> of<00:01:48.100> the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
I was seen that before circling of the

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.820 
I was seen that before circling of the
court<00:01:48.460> on<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.910> f-sharp<00:01:49.090> in<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.660> d7<00:01:50.230> all<00:01:50.590> he's

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
court on the f-sharp in the d7 all he's

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.380 
court on the f-sharp in the d7 all he's
doing<00:01:50.980> is<00:01:51.160> approaching<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:51.730> by<00:01:51.880> two<00:01:51.940> half

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
doing is approaching it by two half

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.320 
doing is approaching it by two half
steps<00:01:52.570> above

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.710 

and<00:01:55.540> a<00:01:55.600> half<00:01:55.780> step<00:01:55.990> below<00:01:57.120> is<00:01:58.120> a<00:01:58.150> really<00:01:58.510> nice

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
and a half step below is a really nice

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.980 
and a half step below is a really nice
sort<00:01:59.680> of<00:01:59.830> delay<00:02:00.150> resolution<00:02:01.150> to<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.420> sound<00:02:01.690> of

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
sort of delay resolution to the sound of

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.430 
sort of delay resolution to the sound of
the<00:02:02.350> line

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.089 

-<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> roads

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.800 

and<00:02:17.099> some<00:02:17.280> more<00:02:17.489> delayed<00:02:17.849> resolutions<00:02:18.510> there

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and some more delayed resolutions there

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.800 
and some more delayed resolutions there
so<00:02:19.379> he<00:02:19.470> puts<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.920> chromatic<00:02:20.400> tone<00:02:20.879> away<00:02:21.180> from<00:02:21.510> a

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
so he puts a chromatic tone away from a

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.050 
so he puts a chromatic tone away from a
common<00:02:22.530> chord<00:02:22.769> tone<00:02:22.980> or<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.519> whole<00:02:23.790> step

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
common chord tone or a whole step

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.990 
common chord tone or a whole step
sometimes<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.019> you<00:02:25.530> get<00:02:25.680> these<00:02:25.879> sort<00:02:26.879> of

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
sometimes and you get these sort of

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.330 
sometimes and you get these sort of
interesting<00:02:27.510> but<00:02:27.720> very<00:02:27.780> classic<00:02:28.590> delayed

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
interesting but very classic delayed

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.789 
interesting but very classic delayed

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.580

6:57<00:02:46.700> bird<00:02:47.170> sounds<00:02:48.170> really<00:02:48.380> cool<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.620> time

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.050
