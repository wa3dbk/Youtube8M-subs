want to make them I'm all about saving

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.490 
want to make them I'm all about saving
time<00:00:45.590> right<00:00:46.510> time<00:00:47.510> is<00:00:47.660> one<00:00:47.809> thing<00:00:47.840> we<00:00:48.170> can't

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
time right time is one thing we can't

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.110 
time right time is one thing we can't
really<00:00:48.770> get<00:00:49.010> more<00:00:49.220> up<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:49.610> we<00:00:49.640> have<00:00:49.880> to<00:00:50.000> be

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
really get more up so we have to be

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.690 
really get more up so we have to be
efficient<00:00:50.660> with<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.870> time<00:00:51.050> that<00:00:51.200> we<00:00:51.290> have

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
efficient with the time that we have

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.970 
efficient with the time that we have
while<00:00:52.700> maximizing<00:00:53.600> what<00:00:54.410> we<00:00:54.530> can<00:00:54.680> get<00:00:54.800> out<00:00:54.950> of

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
while maximizing what we can get out of

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.880 
while maximizing what we can get out of
that<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.300> when<00:00:56.450> I<00:00:56.540> look<00:00:56.719> at<00:00:56.899> recipes<00:00:57.140> and

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
that and so when I look at recipes and

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.799 
that and so when I look at recipes and
it<00:00:58.730> says<00:00:59.059> you<00:00:59.960> know<00:01:00.370> grind<00:01:01.370> these<00:01:01.550> nuts<00:01:01.910> sure
