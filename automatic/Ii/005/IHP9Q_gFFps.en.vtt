00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.879
 Chilean who has this collection of me 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.359
 I think he has everything because every 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.879
 one of the clothes I would put them on 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:43.059

 possibilities that have to see a lot 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.140
 with me and I hope that with the women that 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.179
 are watching this video I think what 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.800
 important is to take advantage of knowing that 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:58.780
 use and not use 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.410
 and in that sense if it helped me 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.199
 Apply comfort but good clothes 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.909
 finally fit fits well to the 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.409
 Most women 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.320
 phil and claire with pants for example 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.540
 high shooting containers has to do 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.820
 with which they told him envelopes that 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.409
 lengthen the figures and you think 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.200
 that you can wear these clothes and I think that 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.909
 most women because it's clothes 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.210
 superclÃ¡sico has more touches 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.300
 modern but it is for all occasions is 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.479
 For all sizes we have treats 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.390
 50 is for more voluptuous women are more 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.429
 thin of what we use alive is that 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.470
 be stronger or more powerful in the 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.240
 image and I think we have 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.979
 that being the protagonists and the clothes we 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.410

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.340
 I love the envelopes because one of 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.010
