00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
wanted to see him get beat and he held

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.800 
wanted to see him get beat and he held
the<00:02:47.069> title<00:02:47.430> for<00:02:47.459> like<00:02:47.760> 15<00:02:48.180> months

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
the title for like 15 months

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.440 
the title for like 15 months
nobody's<00:02:49.170> ever<00:02:49.260> held<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.680> longer<00:02:50.359> but<00:02:51.359> he

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
nobody's ever held it longer but he

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.599 
nobody's ever held it longer but he
never<00:02:51.690> really<00:02:52.139> had<00:02:52.379> that<00:02:52.409> one<00:02:52.829> marquee<00:02:53.370> match

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
never really had that one marquee match

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.129 
never really had that one marquee match
I<00:02:53.819> guess<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> biggest<00:02:54.299> match<00:02:54.629> was<00:02:54.840> probably

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
I guess the biggest match was probably

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.839 
I guess the biggest match was probably
the<00:02:55.290> thirty<00:02:55.530> second<00:02:55.889> match<00:02:56.010> where<00:02:56.250> he<00:02:56.280> lost<00:02:56.549> it

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
the thirty second match where he lost it

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.280 
the thirty second match where he lost it
to<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.030> ultimate<00:02:57.450> warrior<00:02:57.629> but<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.959> Ultimate

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
to the ultimate warrior but the Ultimate

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.869 
to the ultimate warrior but the Ultimate
Warrior<00:02:58.319> was<00:02:58.650> gonna<00:02:58.799> get<00:02:59.010> over<00:02:59.280> as<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.430> big<00:02:59.670> star

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
Warrior was gonna get over as a big star

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.729 
Warrior was gonna get over as a big star
no<00:03:00.030> matter<00:03:00.060> what<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.720> just<00:03:00.959> got<00:03:01.170> him<00:03:01.349> going

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
no matter what that just got him going

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.589 
no matter what that just got him going
but<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.549> warrior<00:03:02.849> was<00:03:03.000> gonna<00:03:03.090> be<00:03:03.299> big<00:03:03.480> no

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
but the warrior was gonna be big no

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.679 
but the warrior was gonna be big no
matter<00:03:03.629> what<00:03:04.019> when<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:04.739> think<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.069> savage<00:03:05.689> I'm

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
matter what when I think of savage I'm

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.809 
matter what when I think of savage I'm
pretty<00:03:06.959> sure<00:03:07.139> Savage<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.799> think<00:03:08.159> savage<00:03:08.579> held

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
pretty sure Savage I think savage held

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.059 
pretty sure Savage I think savage held
the<00:03:08.909> title<00:03:09.239> over<00:03:09.359> a<00:03:09.480> year<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.959> think<00:03:10.379> Savage<00:03:10.859> is

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
the title over a year I think Savage is

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.339 
the title over a year I think Savage is
not<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.670> far<00:03:12.090> behind<00:03:12.269> honky<00:03:12.840> Tonk<00:03:13.049> Man<00:03:13.139> if

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
not that far behind honky Tonk Man if

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.199 
not that far behind honky Tonk Man if
honky<00:03:13.590> tonk<00:03:13.769> man<00:03:13.920> had<00:03:14.129> at<00:03:14.250> almost<00:03:14.459> 15<00:03:14.909> months

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
honky tonk man had at almost 15 months

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.020 
honky tonk man had at almost 15 months
savage<00:03:16.019> probably<00:03:16.349> had<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.590> for<00:03:16.709> like<00:03:16.829> 13<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:17.879> he

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
savage probably had it for like 13 so he

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.330 
savage probably had it for like 13 so he
