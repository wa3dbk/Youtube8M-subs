I've<00:00:01.440> been<00:00:01.589> bigger<00:00:01.800> studies<00:00:02.160> I<00:00:02.280> would<00:00:02.340> say<00:00:02.520> in

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
I've been bigger studies I would say in

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.340 
I've been bigger studies I would say in
places<00:00:02.909> like<00:00:02.939> Canada<00:00:03.240> where<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:04.050> forests

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
places like Canada where the forests

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.980 
places like Canada where the forests
tend<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.620> be<00:00:04.740> much<00:00:05.310> larger<00:00:05.520> but<00:00:06.330> in<00:00:06.629> terms<00:00:06.870> of

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
tend to be much larger but in terms of

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.570 
tend to be much larger but in terms of
complexity<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.710> don't<00:00:08.010> think<00:00:08.160> there<00:00:08.550> is

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
complexity I don't think there is

work at the level of landscapes if you

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
landscape approach and then break it
