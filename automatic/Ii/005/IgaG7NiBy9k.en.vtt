00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.730
 hello dear swami drake's friends 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.240
 if i tell the battle arena is gone 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.950
 as you asked in a group in contact 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.110
 tell about something like this 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.960
 like a plugin so you wanted 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.529
 to have a pvp arena and extra 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.900
 classes 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.460
 Well, I found and the plug-in house should 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.079
 I existed and used it 152 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.010
 he is very comfortable that is there were still 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.050
 additional pinball of this splif and but 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.380
 then before there appeared a separate plugins this 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.500
 more would be more convenient than with the battle arena 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.050
 yes at least boiled more finishing 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.360
 and also interesting to play download under 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.290
 your version here is so much 174 with this 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.100
 just beta 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:01.510
 you can download it too it will go 172 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:05.199
 for example yes sleep my eyes 1-2 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.240
 server everything went well so Well 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.700
 let's see the config and start 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.310
 create arena knife sasha and when already 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.979
 started the server here everything is clear and 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.869
 we are creating a component folder here 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.509
 us dinner and try themselves arena arena 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.689
 as a config let's see here in 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.780
 nameplate we need and more precisely when what 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:29.259
 then the message we manage as an arena there 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.299
 before the database it can be included so yes 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.219
 it is yours to touch geyba 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.850
 from ripped off that is also possible to put 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:39.520
 some other where is it possible already 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.799
 touch like this is already in another config 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.499
 further set up the battle ground 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.979
 and these are different these are different modes they can 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:47.170
 then 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.939
 change that is for example this stream 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.100
 ground compic here 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:56.200
 which team how many teams more precisely from 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.359
 team site you can increase to 4 or 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.450
 then its size is also for its 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.219
 such modes can certainly for sure yes 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.380
 rather, you can't create your own mode 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.929
 but although you can try here we are 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.170
 see that you can customize 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.650
 how much life will be with what we have 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.270
 hunger will 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.910
 yes and another so let's post something 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.410
 can be translated into Russian here that is 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.010
 here is the standard reported 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.720
 it can be removed here these are called 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.280
 comments so-called and already 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.500
 translate so but then we can not touch 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.870
 let's leave us 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.810
 customize the month and here are these three plugins 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.130
 generally config infuriates it too 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:49.030
 bring that is it is all in Russian 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.650
 Further config class so this version is not 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.120
 touch the car will 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:59.200
 realist is also able to solaris 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.390
 balance console was added so models 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.740
 what the name would be 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:09.580
 I can write an example of our money 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.920
 coins and let's call coins some 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.220
 style and port will be that is if we 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.200
 indicated slept somewhere for example on the floor 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.360
 so we do not get stuck there for example 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.820
 can you put it on up on 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.020
 one block is inserted then it can not 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:29.050
 touch so 10 was teams hopps dad 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:36.640
 drove and other daughter can add 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:40.120
 our decks so on we have here in common 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.690
 with this too can change here as if 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.740
 this is nothing special scoreboard 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.870
 You can turn it on here if so 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.100
 a mischief someone's yes we will have in color 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.870
 just like here such settings 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.140
 got used to patients there is no 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.730
 touch like here and classes can 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.270
 add your own class for example 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.730
 copied this monk and paste it 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.790
 and do it through the night program but 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:16.140
 kate plus plus force the names of characters 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:20.970
 think up for example here up tutorial 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.970
 so the name also surrenders here 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.530
 it will be used on kimu tablets 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.240
 give give will be given things 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:37.669
 for example, we can give as diamond 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:41.090
 what gives help 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.720
 this is shorthand hell with chest bib 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.180
 gives me too 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.540
 Well, here we are already going. 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.350
 ears 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.510
 it is but it is different and chan kino come on 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.130
 effects will be given to the player himself 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.930
 then speed or something like that 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.830
 let's go into the game now and 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.770
 set up the arena 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:05.230
 so but we have to highlight two points 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.230
 for example so that de arena was herself 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.630
 for example here this is when we should 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:17.419
 create such a command create arena 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:20.060
 such as name, we will be here here 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.060
 now we need to put different with 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:33.350
 pauses yes what is here first on spawn 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:37.430
 arena alter here from sequins 1 proved 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:40.520
 now we render 2 here of course there is 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.470
 the team still others it is possible to 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.240
 change tiemco from here something like 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:52.180
 this lobby put a sign now 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:58.460
 write death match 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:06:00.560
 in the second join and the arena as it will give here 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.690
 the label created is not yet done correctly 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.440
 add the first line to finish the arena 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.070
 although here you can go to the config in the safe 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.919
 and 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.030
 language varetas and choose add here 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:17.030
 gives the match then we will get out 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:20.690
 that is , it was allowed to come in as vdt 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:23.300
 kachek so but here it was impossible to add 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:27.180
 i.e. blu, it was created for pinball 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:29.669
 that is, this is a new way let's go 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:33.090
 in our rent and now the rain has 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.810
 long iraq well well as we see already 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.479
 started 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:40.560
 that is, it came out such here 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:43.410
 armor and then as it will affect even here 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:49.520
 finish building i mean we have 32 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:55.639
 dynamite, that's where you do 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:07:00.560
 so we can fight here when we kill 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:03.900
 Here we write that drives won and 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.550
 by the way here, too, is already setting it up 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.380
 comp wow, that is what will be 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.360
 class advocate it all 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.360
 that is, there it is all set up 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:16.680
 it's all pretty simple rain in it all 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.840
 I think you liked the teeth plugin soon 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.340
 there will be lessons and passing cards on 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:25.560
 passing cards will not be so fast 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.870
 close to in general let's see that is 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:31.370
 this week is not sure but although maybe 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.370
 okay bye
