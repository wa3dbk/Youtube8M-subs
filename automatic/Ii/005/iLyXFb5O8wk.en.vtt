00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.830 
introduction I'm going to explain a bit
the<00:00:25.680> basics<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.279> acrobatics<00:00:26.880> generally<00:00:27.360> seen

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
the basics of acrobatics generally seen

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.319 
the basics of acrobatics generally seen
from<00:00:28.220> my<00:00:29.220> personal<00:00:29.550> point<00:00:29.790> of<00:00:29.910> view<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.119> I

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:30.329 
from my personal point of view that I

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.930 
from my personal point of view that I
raised<00:00:30.660> during<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.680> ears<00:00:31.919> I've<00:00:32.460> been<00:00:32.669> doing

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
raised during the ears I've been doing

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.860 
raised during the ears I've been doing
acrobatics<00:00:34.220> so<00:00:35.220> the<00:00:36.030> first<00:00:36.210> thing<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.570> we

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
acrobatics so the first thing that we

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.600 
acrobatics so the first thing that we
have<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.170> know<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.950> every<00:00:38.130> move<00:00:38.460> is

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
have to know is that every move is

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.229 
have to know is that every move is
composed<00:00:39.030> by<00:00:39.180> three<00:00:39.870> essential<00:00:40.469> parts<00:00:41.239> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
composed by three essential parts the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:54.319 
composed by three essential parts the
the<00:00:42.690> jump<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.260> trick<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.640> landing

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.450 

every<00:00:55.079> time<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.379> want<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.589> try<00:00:55.859> and<00:00:56.010> move<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
every time you want to try and move the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.459 
every time you want to try and move the
best<00:00:56.640> way<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.909> do<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.539> try<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.899> subdivide

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
best way to do it is to try to subdivide

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.740 
best way to do it is to try to subdivide
the<00:00:58.620> movement<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.190> these<00:00:59.370> three<00:01:00.059> parts<00:01:00.420> which

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the movement in these three parts which

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.149 
the movement in these three parts which
are<00:01:00.899> very<00:01:01.019> important<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> understand<00:01:01.920> in

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
are very important to understand in

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.249 
are very important to understand in
order<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.760> win<00:01:02.909> the<00:01:02.940> fear<00:01:03.269> and<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.690> perform<00:01:03.899> it

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
order to win the fear and to perform it

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:10.310 
order to win the fear and to perform it
in<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.710> safe<00:01:04.920> way<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:09.240> origin<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.899> fear<00:01:10.110> is

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
in a safe way the origin of the fear is

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.350 
in a safe way the origin of the fear is
our<00:01:10.500> mind<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.100> doesn't<00:01:11.789> let<00:01:11.880> our<00:01:12.030> body

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
our mind that doesn't let our body

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.810 
our mind that doesn't let our body
perform<00:01:12.869> whatever<00:01:13.259> we<00:01:13.619> want<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.950> do<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
perform whatever we want to do in the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.300 
perform whatever we want to do in the
way<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.240> would<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.539> do<00:01:16.009> because<00:01:17.009> our

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
way we would like to do because our

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.830 
way we would like to do because our
instinct<00:01:17.820> knows<00:01:18.149> that<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.509> are<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.689> danger

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
instinct knows that we are in danger

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.169 
instinct knows that we are in danger
when<00:01:19.439> our<00:01:19.740> head<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.250> our<00:01:20.369> toes<00:01:20.700> are<00:01:20.909> turned

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
when our head and our toes are turned

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:27.380 
when our head and our toes are turned
upside<00:01:21.450> down<00:01:24.530> I'll<00:01:25.530> give<00:01:25.740> an<00:01:25.830> example<00:01:26.390> when

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
upside down I'll give an example when

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.690 
upside down I'll give an example when
somebody<00:01:27.810> wants<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.470> learn<00:01:28.700> standing

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
somebody wants to learn standing

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.539 
somebody wants to learn standing
backflip<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.810> know<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.200> he<00:01:32.039> always<00:01:32.190> bent

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
backflip if we know this he always bent

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.080 
backflip if we know this he always bent
his<00:01:32.880> chest<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.590> head<00:01:34.590> backwards<00:01:35.130> just

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
his chest and head backwards just

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.940 
his chest and head backwards just
because<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.780> difficult<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.289> our<00:01:37.530> mind<00:01:37.830> to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
because it is difficult for our mind to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.550 
because it is difficult for our mind to
get<00:01:38.130> far<00:01:38.429> from<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.630> ground<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.289> position

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
get far from the ground in a position

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.020 
get far from the ground in a position
that<00:01:40.740> our<00:01:41.100> body<00:01:41.459> is<00:01:41.789> not<00:01:42.060> used<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.420> be<00:01:43.789> so<00:01:44.789> our

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
that our body is not used to be so our

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.289 
that our body is not used to be so our
body<00:01:45.390> always<00:01:46.259> tries<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.590> avoid<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.789> biggest

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
body always tries to avoid the biggest

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.919 
body always tries to avoid the biggest
fear<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:49.409> jump<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:51.030> course<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> hate<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
fear the jump and of course the hate the

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.359 
fear the jump and of course the hate the
first<00:01:52.560> point<00:01:52.830> that<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.039> explained<00:01:53.459> for<00:01:55.369> when

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
first point that I explained for when

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.279 
first point that I explained for when
somebody<00:01:56.729> wants<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> learn<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.810> front<00:01:58.080> flip

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
somebody wants to learn the front flip

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.800 
somebody wants to learn the front flip
as<00:01:58.619> soon<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:59.009> he<00:01:59.190> jumps<00:01:59.550> he<00:02:00.149> bends<00:02:00.360> his<00:02:00.539> body

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
as soon as he jumps he bends his body

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.680 
as soon as he jumps he bends his body
forward<00:02:01.319> because<00:02:02.069> he<00:02:02.160> thinks<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.519> that<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
forward because he thinks that that the

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.839 
forward because he thinks that that the
biggest<00:02:03.989> problem<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.500> fix<00:02:04.679> in<00:02:05.129> order<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.580> do

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
biggest problem to fix in order to do

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.419 
biggest problem to fix in order to do
the<00:02:06.030> front<00:02:06.300> look<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.709> able<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.220> spin

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
the front look is to be able to spin

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.509 
the front look is to be able to spin
fastly<00:02:09.110> but<00:02:10.110> he's<00:02:10.259> wrong<00:02:10.500> because<00:02:10.950> he's

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
fastly but he's wrong because he's

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.690 
fastly but he's wrong because he's
missing<00:02:11.849> again<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.269> first<00:02:12.480> point<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.489> so<00:02:14.489> on

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
missing again the first point and so on

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.880 
missing again the first point and so on
for<00:02:14.730> every<00:02:15.269> move<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.510> we<00:02:15.870> don't<00:02:16.050> know<00:02:16.230> how<00:02:16.860> to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
for every move that we don't know how to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.710 
for every move that we don't know how to
perform<00:02:17.340> exactly<00:02:19.819> by<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.879> ears<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.569> I've

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
perform exactly by the ears that I've

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.360 
perform exactly by the ears that I've
been<00:02:21.870> training<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.530> studying<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
been training and studying the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.280 
been training and studying the
acrobatics<00:02:23.849> also<00:02:24.209> from<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.870> philosophical

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
acrobatics also from a philosophical

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.350 
acrobatics also from a philosophical
point<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.950> view<00:02:26.159> I<00:02:26.370> thought<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.330> best

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
point of view I thought that the best

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.250 
point of view I thought that the best
way<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.620> overcome<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.519> fear<00:02:29.760> obstacle<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:31.019> not

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
way to overcome the fear obstacle is not

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.710 
way to overcome the fear obstacle is not
to<00:02:31.409> think<00:02:31.650> about<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.430> move<00:02:32.640> itself<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.390> to

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
to think about the move itself but to

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.839 
to think about the move itself but to
think<00:02:33.930> about<00:02:34.260> them<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:35.099> heart<00:02:35.370> but<00:02:35.670> at<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
think about them the heart but at the

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.540 
think about them the heart but at the
same<00:02:36.120> time<00:02:36.360> easy<00:02:36.840> little<00:02:37.140> steps<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:38.250> we<00:02:38.400> need

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
same time easy little steps that we need

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.170 
same time easy little steps that we need
to<00:02:38.670> understand<00:02:39.140> by<00:02:40.140> studying<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.769> movement

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
to understand by studying the movement

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.480 
to understand by studying the movement
if<00:02:44.180> we<00:02:44.390> think<00:02:44.570> about<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:45.200> little<00:02:45.620> steps<00:02:46.010> that

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
if we think about the little steps that

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.630 
if we think about the little steps that
we<00:02:46.640> need<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:47.060> learn<00:02:47.450> in<00:02:48.080> order<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.680> understand

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
we need to learn in order to understand

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.270 
we need to learn in order to understand
when<00:02:50.300> we<00:02:50.330> have<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.720> jump<00:02:50.990> how<00:02:51.710> much<00:02:51.890> we<00:02:52.070> have<00:02:52.220> to

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
when we have to jump how much we have to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.600 
when we have to jump how much we have to
jump<00:02:52.640> where<00:02:53.480> we<00:02:53.870> have<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.050> jump<00:02:54.380> how<00:02:55.040> we<00:02:55.100> should

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
jump where we have to jump how we should

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.840 
jump where we have to jump how we should
control<00:02:56.030> our<00:02:56.300> body<00:02:56.660> in<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.410> air<00:02:57.670> when<00:02:58.670> we

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
control our body in the air when we

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.970 
control our body in the air when we
should<00:02:59.060> stop<00:02:59.360> our<00:02:59.540> trick<00:02:59.960> in<00:03:00.320> order<00:03:00.710> to<00:03:00.860> land

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
should stop our trick in order to land

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.140 
should stop our trick in order to land
and<00:03:01.340> so<00:03:02.060> on<00:03:02.240> then<00:03:02.930> our<00:03:03.830> mind<00:03:04.190> will<00:03:04.580> get<00:03:04.760> used<00:03:05.000> to

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
and so on then our mind will get used to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.910 
and so on then our mind will get used to
have<00:03:05.300> a<00:03:05.330> perfect<00:03:05.600> control<00:03:06.380> of<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.770> body

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
have a perfect control of the body

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.820 
have a perfect control of the body
whatever<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.880> movement<00:03:08.270> is<00:03:11.080> control<00:03:12.080> of<00:03:12.620> the

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
whatever the movement is control of the

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.580 
whatever the movement is control of the
body<00:03:13.010> means<00:03:13.760> also<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.900> possibility<00:03:15.080> to

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
body means also the possibility to

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.750 
body means also the possibility to
combine<00:03:16.270> multiple<00:03:17.270> acrobatics<00:03:18.170> movements

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
combine multiple acrobatics movements

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.290 
combine multiple acrobatics movements
always<00:03:19.760> being<00:03:20.000> aware<00:03:20.300> of<00:03:20.570> where<00:03:20.990> our<00:03:21.140> body<00:03:21.500> is

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
always being aware of where our body is

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.510 
always being aware of where our body is
even<00:03:23.300> after<00:03:23.840> some<00:03:24.320> lung<00:03:24.500> multiple<00:03:25.010> acrobatics

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
even after some lung multiple acrobatics

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.970 
even after some lung multiple acrobatics
movement<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:28.810> this<00:03:29.810> was<00:03:29.990> a<00:03:30.380> little

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
movement so this was a little

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.160 
movement so this was a little
introduction<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.790> what<00:03:32.060> acrobatic<00:03:32.570> is<00:03:32.780> for<00:03:33.050> me

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
introduction of what acrobatic is for me

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.950 
introduction of what acrobatic is for me
and<00:03:33.380> then<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:34.370> really<00:03:34.730> hope<00:03:34.910> that<00:03:35.150> this<00:03:35.780> is

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
and then I really hope that this is

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.120 
and then I really hope that this is
going<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.200> help<00:03:36.350> everybody<00:03:36.950> want<00:03:37.940> to<00:03:38.060> learn

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
going to help everybody want to learn

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.220 
going to help everybody want to learn
practice<00:03:40.150> remember<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.300> practice<00:03:41.480> acrobatics
