hey everybody I'm Jamie province and I
want<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.820> talk<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.030> you<00:00:03.090> today<00:00:03.360> about

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
want to talk to you today about

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.230 
want to talk to you today about
barbecuing<00:00:04.380> ribs<00:00:04.770> now<00:00:05.400> you<00:00:05.460> probably<00:00:05.819> know

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
barbecuing ribs now you probably know

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.140 
barbecuing ribs now you probably know
that<00:00:06.270> ribs<00:00:07.170> cook<00:00:07.740> best<00:00:08.010> over<00:00:08.429> indirect<00:00:09.030> heat

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
that ribs cook best over indirect heat

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.530 
that ribs cook best over indirect heat
that<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.900> fire<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.410> off<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.800> side

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
that is the fire is off to the side

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.490 
that is the fire is off to the side
trouble<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.690> if<00:00:12.840> you're<00:00:12.960> working<00:00:13.170> with<00:00:13.469> a

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
trouble is if you're working with a

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.829 
trouble is if you're working with a
grill<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.429> size<00:00:14.700> or<00:00:15.120> maybe<00:00:15.240> one<00:00:15.540> even

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
grill this size or maybe one even

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.740 
grill this size or maybe one even
smaller<00:00:16.230> there's<00:00:17.070> only<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.670> much<00:00:17.910> area<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
smaller there's only so much area of the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.320 
smaller there's only so much area of the
grill<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.260> can<00:00:19.410> devote<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.550> indirect

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
grill that you can devote to indirect

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.359 
grill that you can devote to indirect
heat<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.050> might<00:00:22.500> be<00:00:22.650> limited<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
heat so you might be limited in the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.250 
heat so you might be limited in the
number<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.640> slabs<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.779> cook<00:00:25.019> well

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
number of slabs that you can cook well

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.710 
number of slabs that you can cook well
I've<00:00:26.130> got<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> solution<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.510> going<00:00:27.660> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
I've got a solution this is going to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.359 
I've got a solution this is going to
allow<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.080> maximize<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.890> number<00:00:29.220> of

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
allow you to maximize the number of

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.290 
allow you to maximize the number of
slabs<00:00:29.760> over<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> very<00:00:30.359> limited<00:00:30.660> area<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:32.300> call

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
slabs over a very limited area I call

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.740 
slabs over a very limited area I call
this<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.570> stack<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.680> swap<00:00:35.219> technique<00:00:35.880> you

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
this the stack and swap technique you

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.139 
this the stack and swap technique you
can<00:00:36.870> see<00:00:37.140> I've<00:00:37.410> got<00:00:37.710> three<00:00:37.770> slabs<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.940> ribs

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
can see I've got three slabs of ribs

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.840 
can see I've got three slabs of ribs
stacked<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:40.020> top<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.290> each<00:00:40.530> other<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.340> fire<00:00:41.670> is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
stacked on top of each other the fire is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.709 
stacked on top of each other the fire is
off<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.239> either<00:00:42.450> side<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:44.670> top<00:00:44.940> slab<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
off to either side and the top slab is

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.600 
off to either side and the top slab is
browning<00:00:46.050> really<00:00:46.440> nicely<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:47.039> been<00:00:47.219> cooking

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
browning really nicely it's been cooking

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.220 
browning really nicely it's been cooking
well<00:00:48.000> they've<00:00:48.149> all<00:00:48.300> been<00:00:48.480> cooking<00:00:48.870> now<00:00:48.899> for

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
well they've all been cooking now for

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.400 
well they've all been cooking now for
about<00:00:49.440> 45<00:00:49.980> minutes<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.579> an<00:00:50.610> hour<00:00:51.230> but<00:00:52.230> you'll

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
about 45 minutes to an hour but you'll

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.069 
about 45 minutes to an hour but you'll
see<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.890> unstack<00:00:53.520> them<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.570> ones<00:00:54.809> down

going to be on the bottom well this one
is<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> go<00:01:26.009> into<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> middle<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.060> let's

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
is going to go into the middle and let's

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.469 
is going to go into the middle and let's
say<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.229> one<00:01:28.470> goes<00:01:28.740> up<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.159> top<00:01:29.430> all<00:01:30.299> right

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
say this one goes up on top all right

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.100 
say this one goes up on top all right
I'm<00:01:31.079> going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.290> slide<00:01:31.590> them<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:32.040> over<00:01:33.110> to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
I'm going to slide them all over to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.499 
I'm going to slide them all over to
indirect<00:01:34.680> heat<00:01:35.000> because<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.210> leave<00:01:36.329> them

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
indirect heat because if you leave them

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.819 
indirect heat because if you leave them
over<00:01:36.689> direct<00:01:36.990> heat<00:01:37.229> they're<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.619> burn

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
over direct heat they're going to burn

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.620 
over direct heat they're going to burn
on<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.400> if<00:01:38.490> they<00:01:38.640> cook<00:01:38.880> over<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.540> the

on you but if they cook over here in the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.160 
on you but if they cook over here in the
middle<00:01:40.880> they're<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.479> they're<00:01:42.930> going<00:01:42.960> to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
middle they're going to they're going to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.109 
middle they're going to they're going to
slowly<00:01:43.590> tenderize<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.939> that

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
slowly tenderize and have that

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.859 
slowly tenderize and have that
incredible<00:01:45.750> great<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.619> know<00:01:46.710> barbecue<00:01:47.280> rib

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
incredible great you know barbecue rib

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.830 
incredible great you know barbecue rib
tenderness<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.680> taste<00:01:50.329> so<00:01:51.329> there<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.630> go

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
tenderness and and taste so there you go

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.200 
tenderness and and taste so there you go
another<00:01:52.560> 45<00:01:53.130> minutes<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.610> an<00:01:53.729> hour<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.180> this

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
another 45 minutes to an hour like this

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.899 
another 45 minutes to an hour like this
and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.290> swap<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:55.890> more<00:01:56.159> time<00:01:56.490> so

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
and then you swap one more time so

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.789 
and then you swap one more time so
that's<00:01:57.240> slab<00:01:57.689> that's<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> middle<00:01:58.469> gets<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
that's slab that's in the middle gets a

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
that's slab that's in the middle gets a
little<00:01:58.950> opportunity<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.670> sit<00:01:59.850> on<00:01:59.880> top<00:02:00.270> and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
little opportunity to sit on top and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.510 
little opportunity to sit on top and
caramelize<00:02:01.049> nicely<00:02:01.079> now<00:02:02.040> you've<00:02:02.159> got<00:02:02.280> three

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
caramelize nicely now you've got three

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.280 
caramelize nicely now you've got three
slabs<00:02:03.049> beautifully<00:02:04.049> caramelized

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
slabs beautifully caramelized

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.359 
slabs beautifully caramelized
beautifully<00:02:05.219> cooked<00:02:05.840> it's<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.960> happy<00:02:07.259> day

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
beautifully cooked it's a happy day

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.619 
beautifully cooked it's a happy day
because<00:02:08.369> three<00:02:08.640> slabs<00:02:08.879> are<00:02:09.149> always<00:02:09.450> better

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
because three slabs are always better

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:15.690 
because three slabs are always better
than<00:02:09.750> two

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.760
