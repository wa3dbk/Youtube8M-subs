with a really pretty pink tent I would
definitely<00:02:02.189> wear<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.880> color<00:02:03.320> red<00:02:04.320> carpet<00:02:04.770> is

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
definitely wear this color red carpet is

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.350 
definitely wear this color red carpet is
the<00:02:05.070> next<00:02:05.340> color<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.210> your

quintessential<00:02:07.229> red<00:02:07.710> lip<00:02:08.190> shade<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.149> is

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
quintessential red lip shade if that is

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.230 
quintessential red lip shade if that is
what<00:02:09.539> you're<00:02:09.690> going<00:02:10.080> after<00:02:10.229> i<00:02:10.709> will<00:02:11.370> say<00:02:11.760> that

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
what you're going after i will say that

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.210 
what you're going after i will say that
tip<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.750> lipstick<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.410> very<00:02:13.770> thick<00:02:14.190> and

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
tip of the lipstick is very thick and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.430 
tip of the lipstick is very thick and
the<00:02:14.520> precision<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.240> not<00:02:15.450> very<00:02:15.750> sharp<00:02:16.050> on<00:02:16.290> it

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
the precision is not very sharp on it

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.470 
the precision is not very sharp on it
because<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:17.490> hard<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.880> get<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.300> on

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
because of this it's hard to get it on

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.930 
because of this it's hard to get it on
without<00:02:18.810> going<00:02:19.350> outside<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:20.250> lines<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.730> your

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
without going outside the lines of your

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.150 
without going outside the lines of your
lips<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.480> needed<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.290> blot<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.560> down<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.890> little

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
lips I needed to blot it down a little

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.860 
lips I needed to blot it down a little
bit<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.760> could<00:02:23.880> tone<00:02:24.240> down<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.630> shade

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
bit so that I could tone down the shade

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.860 
bit so that I could tone down the shade
because<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.410> was<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:25.980> bright<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.510> not<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.540> color

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
because it was so bright and not a color

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.990 
because it was so bright and not a color
I<00:02:27.930> would<00:02:28.230> ever<00:02:28.470> choose<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.890> wear<00:02:29.160> it's<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.700> far

I would ever choose to wear it's so far

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.300 
I would ever choose to wear it's so far
out<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.180> my<00:02:30.330> comfort<00:02:30.420> zone<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.320> stands<00:02:32.040> out

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
out of my comfort zone it stands out

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.270 
out of my comfort zone it stands out
with<00:02:32.370> those<00:02:32.730> soft<00:02:33.090> pink<00:02:33.480> shades<00:02:33.870> oh<00:02:34.140> those<00:02:35.070> are
