00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
is the one thing that I dislike the most

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.179 
is the one thing that I dislike the most
about<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.900> game<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.439> they<00:01:16.710> took<00:01:16.860> out<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
about this game that they took out the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.160 
about this game that they took out the
three<00:01:17.460> round<00:01:17.700> system<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.390> made<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.810> matches

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
three round system it made the matches

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.109 
three round system it made the matches
much<00:01:19.380> more<00:01:19.619> enjoyable<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.369> my<00:01:20.490> opinion<00:01:20.939> I

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
much more enjoyable in my opinion I

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.910 
much more enjoyable in my opinion I
liked<00:01:21.479> seeing<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.930> changes<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> way<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
liked seeing the changes in the way the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.140 
liked seeing the changes in the way the
characters<00:01:23.310> were<00:01:23.430> looking<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.030> between

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
characters were looking in between

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.570 
characters were looking in between
rounds<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.140> banter<00:01:25.560> between<00:01:25.710> them<00:01:26.189> but

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
rounds and the banter between them but

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.819 
rounds and the banter between them but
that<00:01:26.759> being<00:01:26.970> said<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.509> still<00:01:27.810> fun<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.470> plays

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
that being said it is still fun it plays

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.649 
that being said it is still fun it plays
and<00:01:29.130> feels<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> punch-out<00:01:30.090> game<00:01:30.360> only

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and feels like a punch-out game only

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.109 
and feels like a punch-out game only
with<00:01:31.110> much<00:01:31.380> better<00:01:31.590> graphics<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.670> visuals

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
with much better graphics the visuals

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.940 
with much better graphics the visuals
were<00:01:33.329> stunning<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> Super<00:01:34.350> Nintendo<00:01:34.470> game

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
were stunning for a Super Nintendo game

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.950 
were stunning for a Super Nintendo game
the<00:01:35.369> characters<00:01:35.790> had<00:01:35.939> plenty<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.299> detail<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the characters had plenty of detail and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.420 
the characters had plenty of detail and
moves<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.560> would<00:01:37.710> make<00:01:37.860> them<00:01:38.040> different

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
moves that would make them different

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.100 
moves that would make them different
from<00:01:38.460> each<00:01:38.700> other<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.360> was<00:01:39.479> nice<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:39.840> some

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
