00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the working surface such as in the fryer

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.080 
the working surface such as in the fryer
here<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:55.110> use<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> system<00:00:55.770> called<00:00:56.090> deep-drawn

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
here we use a system called deep-drawn

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.650 
here we use a system called deep-drawn
it's<00:00:58.020> pressed<00:00:58.500> into<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.340> steel<00:00:59.789> as<00:01:00.059> opposed

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
it's pressed into the steel as opposed

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.779 
it's pressed into the steel as opposed
to<00:01:00.809> folding<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.620> cutting<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.129> welding<00:01:02.309> as

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
to folding and cutting and welding as

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.240 
to folding and cutting and welding as
you<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.049> corners<00:01:04.409> are<00:01:04.530> more<00:01:04.739> rounded

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
you can see the corners are more rounded

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.460 
you can see the corners are more rounded
and<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.880> also<00:01:06.090> adds<00:01:06.479> strength<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and this also adds strength to the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.090 
and this also adds strength to the
appliance<00:01:08.720> now<00:01:09.770> Electrolux<00:01:10.770> has<00:01:10.860> also

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
appliance now Electrolux has also

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.640 
appliance now Electrolux has also
invested<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:12.030> lot<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.540> money<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.320> latest

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
invested a lot of money in the latest

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.980 
invested a lot of money in the latest
laser<00:01:13.950> cutting<00:01:14.369> technology<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.659> also

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
laser cutting technology and also

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.800 
laser cutting technology and also
robotic<00:01:16.920> welding<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.330> giving<00:01:18.689> us

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
robotic welding and this is giving us

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.160 
robotic welding and this is giving us
virtually<00:01:19.740> seamless<00:01:20.400> joins<00:01:21.090> between<00:01:21.780> each

each<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.220> these<00:01:26.340> modules<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.540> gone<00:01:27.780> away

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
each of these modules we have gone away

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.770 
each of these modules we have gone away
from<00:01:28.350> using<00:01:28.710> many<00:01:28.950> panels<00:01:29.400> which<00:01:30.180> were<00:01:30.360> bolted

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
from using many panels which were bolted

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.039 
from using many panels which were bolted
together<00:01:30.979> to<00:01:31.979> more<00:01:32.670> fewer<00:01:33.180> pieces<00:01:33.450> which<00:01:33.810> are

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
together to more fewer pieces which are

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.330 
together to more fewer pieces which are
folded<00:01:35.040> giving<00:01:35.759> better<00:01:35.939> hygiene<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.689> also

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
folded giving better hygiene and also

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.569 
folded giving better hygiene and also
increasing<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.490> strength<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.390> appliance

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
increasing the strength of the appliance

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.160 
increasing the strength of the appliance
regarding<00:01:41.579> installation<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.869> here

around me the island version we can also
go<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.220> what<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.729> call<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.939> bridged<00:01:48.299> version<00:01:49.170> if

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
go for what we call a bridged version if

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.730 
go for what we call a bridged version if
