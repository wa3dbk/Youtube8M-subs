00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.609
 hello everybody on this video teach a 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.350
 butterfly wing inspired decoration 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.900
 she gives a little more work because I 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.269
 I used the gradient and made a fingernail of each 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.639
 color to make a gradient you will 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.170
 need light tones and dark tones 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.980
 of the chosen colors 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.240
 I chose the green yellow pink blue and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.010
 lilac 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.619
 in fact I made up my mind which 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.150
 course choose because all are beautiful 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.710
 so I decided to make a fingernail of each 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.109
 color and the good thing is that you can 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.329
 to see which color looks better with this 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.309
 decoration 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.200
 The first step is the same for all 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.969
 nails with light colors 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.680
 I passed more or less two hands of 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.750
 each color 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.940
 To start the gradient, it's good to wait 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.260
 Enamel dry well I waited more or 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.149
 less than 15-20 minutes to do 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.520
 and we will need a 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.280
 sponge and the dark tones of 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.219
 selected enamels 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.399
 you put the enamel on the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.339
 sponge and stamped on the half nail to 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.170
 down is good to pass a little nail polish 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.950
 not be very marked the difference of 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.350
 color 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.530
 then you will put more nail polish 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.240
 and will do only at the tip of the nail and there he 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.240
 will get a gradient right 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:37.640
 after finishing a gradient I passed 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:39.740
 a layer of enamel with glitter make 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.830
 the details of the butterfly I'll use 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.410
 this enamel it has a tip and 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.000
 makes it easy to make nail designs 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.160
 you can also use a brush with the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.340
 very fine tip black enamel 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:02:00.200
 so you start is doing with if it were 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:02.360
 a sun and then you unite the ends and 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.119
 leaving rounded you can 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.780
 fill the lateral path of the nail one 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.780
 black enamel 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.750
 and leaves well rounded 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.140
 after that with the scorer glaze 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.330
 white you make very small balls 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.560
 on the side of the nail where it was filled 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.560
 with black enamel 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.350
 If you want you can also 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.270
 fill there near the cuticle I think 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.170
 that looks more beautiful is more similar 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.910
 still and it got so our nails gesture 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.489
 Butterfly I hope you have 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.410
 enjoyed a kiss and see you around
