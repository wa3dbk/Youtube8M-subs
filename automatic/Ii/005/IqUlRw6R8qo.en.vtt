00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
explore a number of environments but the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.850 
explore a number of environments but the
primary<00:01:46.760> location<00:01:47.760> for<00:01:48.030> Halo<00:01:48.390> 4<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.140> world

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
primary location for Halo 4 is a world

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.280 
primary location for Halo 4 is a world
called<00:01:50.100> requiem<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:51.390> won't<00:01:51.570> say<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> lot<00:01:52.110> about

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
called requiem we won't say a lot about

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.530 
called requiem we won't say a lot about
what's<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> surface<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.369> requiem<00:01:53.760> but

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
what's on the surface of requiem but

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.120 
what's on the surface of requiem but
it's<00:01:54.659> definitely<00:01:54.840> obvious<00:01:55.470> from<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> outside

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
it's definitely obvious from the outside

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.190 
it's definitely obvious from the outside
that<00:01:56.340> appears<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.820> be<00:01:56.939> four<00:01:57.180> runner<00:01:57.390> an<00:01:57.689> origin

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
that appears to be four runner an origin

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.260 
that appears to be four runner an origin
and<00:01:58.409> we'll<00:01:59.040> definitely<00:01:59.189> tease<00:01:59.760> out<00:01:59.939> more<00:02:00.180> of

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
and we'll definitely tease out more of

and we'll definitely tease out more of
that<00:02:00.390> story<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.049> year<00:02:01.200> goes

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
that story of the year goes

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.029
