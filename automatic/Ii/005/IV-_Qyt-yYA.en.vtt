00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:56.929 
first off we have a larger LED light in
here<00:02:56.069> so<00:02:56.189> it's<00:02:56.310> going<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.489> get<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.609> little<00:02:56.819> bit

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
here so it's going to get a little bit

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.280

brighter you're going to be able to see
a<00:02:58.319> little<00:02:58.560> bit<00:02:58.680> better<00:02:58.919> on<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.189> inside<00:02:59.700> we've

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
a little bit better on the inside we've

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.390 
a little bit better on the inside we've
again<00:03:00.780> made<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.379> shelves<00:03:01.859> even<00:03:02.159> more

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
again made the shelves even more

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.159 
again made the shelves even more
streamlined<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.359> you've<00:03:03.480> still<00:03:03.720> got<00:03:03.870> more

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:04.169 
streamlined so you've still got more

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:06.379 
streamlined so you've still got more
usable<00:03:04.620> space<00:03:04.739> in<00:03:05.069> there<00:03:05.280> we've<00:03:05.849> added<00:03:06.090> some

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
usable space in there we've added some

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.629 
usable space in there we've added some
nice<00:03:06.569> finishing<00:03:07.200> touches<00:03:07.439> to<00:03:07.620> your<00:03:07.889> bins<00:03:08.159> and

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
also we've added these little handles to

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.890 
also we've added these little handles to
your<00:03:11.519> glide<00:03:11.790> out<00:03:11.939> drawers<00:03:12.269> they<00:03:12.480> still<00:03:12.689> glide

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
your glide out drawers they still glide

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.959 
your glide out drawers they still glide
out<00:03:13.079> just<00:03:13.319> nice<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.530> easily<00:03:14.040> but<00:03:14.639> they've<00:03:14.849> got

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:14.969 
out just nice and easily but they've got

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:16.369 
out just nice and easily but they've got
a<00:03:15.000> little<00:03:15.269> handle<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.629> them<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:15.989> it's<00:03:16.109> a<00:03:16.139> little

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
a little handle to them so it's a little

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.129 
a little handle to them so it's a little
bit<00:03:16.530> easier<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:17.099> get<00:03:17.250> up<00:03:17.280> on<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.510> again<00:03:18.989> we

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
bit easier to get up on to and again we

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.459 
bit easier to get up on to and again we
