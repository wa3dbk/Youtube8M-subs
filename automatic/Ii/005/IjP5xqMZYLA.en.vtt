side stock before making the last pass
we<00:01:58.740> use<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.310> drawer<00:01:59.640> side<00:02:00.000> stock<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.930> set<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
we use the drawer side stock to set the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.300 
we use the drawer side stock to set the
fence<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.920> proper<00:02:02.369> depth<00:02:04.189> using<00:02:05.189> this

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
fence to proper depth using this

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.399 
fence to proper depth using this
technique<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.000> set<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.390> fence<00:02:06.659> will<00:02:06.960> ensure<00:02:07.380> a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
technique to set the fence will ensure a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.800 
technique to set the fence will ensure a
perfectly<00:02:08.220> flush<00:02:08.610> joint<00:02:09.149> when<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.690> are

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
perfectly flush joint when you are

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:19.900 
perfectly flush joint when you are
finished

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.850 

to<00:02:20.910> adjust<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.570> cut<00:02:21.900> from<00:02:22.200> being<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.500> flush

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
to adjust this cut from being a flush

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.190 
to adjust this cut from being a flush
cut<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.520> being<00:02:23.730> an<00:02:23.850> overlapping<00:02:24.420> joint<00:02:24.960> is

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
cut to being an overlapping joint is

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.340 
cut to being an overlapping joint is
very<00:02:25.740> simple<00:02:26.430> because<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.600> fence<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:28.020> already

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
very simple because the fence is already

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.590 
very simple because the fence is already
set<00:02:28.590> for<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.830> flush<00:02:29.160> cut<00:02:29.190> any<00:02:29.760> distance<00:02:30.420> you

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
set for a flush cut any distance you

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.720 
set for a flush cut any distance you
move<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.960> fence<00:02:31.170> back<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.890> increase<00:02:32.520> the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
move the fence back and increase the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.970 
move the fence back and increase the
depth<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.210> cut<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:34.080> will<00:02:34.320> be<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.590> amount<00:02:34.830> of

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
depth of cut that will be the amount of

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.100 
depth of cut that will be the amount of
overhang<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:38.300> again<00:02:39.300> we<00:02:39.690> do<00:02:39.900> these

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
overhang that you have again we do these

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.530 
overhang that you have again we do these
cuts<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.770> multiple<00:02:41.370> passes<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.090> small

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
cuts in multiple passes in small

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.690 
cuts in multiple passes in small
increments<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.380> assure<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.770> smooth<00:02:44.490> clean<00:02:45.000> cut

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
increments to assure a smooth clean cut

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.400 
increments to assure a smooth clean cut
make<00:02:47.700> these<00:02:47.970> passes<00:02:48.540> until<00:02:48.960> you've<00:02:49.140> reached

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
make these passes until you've reached

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.610 
make these passes until you've reached
the<00:02:49.650> maximum<00:02:50.100> depth<00:02:50.610> for<00:02:50.970> your<00:02:51.120> overhang<00:02:51.690> once

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
the maximum depth for your overhang once

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.530 
the maximum depth for your overhang once
you've<00:02:52.830> reached<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.310> depth<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:54.180> are<00:02:54.210> ready

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
you've reached that depth you are ready

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:03.910 
you've reached that depth you are ready
for<00:02:54.810> glue<00:02:55.080> up

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.680 

now<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:05.160> we<00:03:05.250> are<00:03:05.370> done<00:03:05.580> making<00:03:05.850> our<00:03:06.180> cuts<00:03:06.450> we

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
now that we are done making our cuts we

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.750 
now that we are done making our cuts we
will<00:03:06.840> do<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.020> dry<00:03:07.380> fit<00:03:07.740> to<00:03:07.950> make<00:03:08.130> sure<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.520> joint

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
will do a dry fit to make sure the joint

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.010 
will do a dry fit to make sure the joint
goes<00:03:09.030> together<00:03:09.450> nice<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.810> snug<00:03:11.600> now<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.660> can

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
goes together nice and snug now you can

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.620 
goes together nice and snug now you can
add<00:03:13.230> glue<00:03:13.709> clamp<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.610> drawer<00:03:14.880> together<00:03:15.300> and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
add glue clamp the drawer together and

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.830 
add glue clamp the drawer together and
you<00:03:16.230> have<00:03:16.350> created<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.980> very<00:03:17.280> strong<00:03:17.840> durable

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
you have created a very strong durable

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.150 
you have created a very strong durable
