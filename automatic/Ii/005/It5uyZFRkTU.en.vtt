00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
you're gonna have to UM melt it by just

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.020 
you're gonna have to UM melt it by just

Jamaican<00:00:33.480> black<00:00:33.630> castor<00:00:33.690> oil<00:00:34.520> so<00:00:35.520> why<00:00:35.700> did<00:00:35.880> you

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
Jamaican black castor oil so why did you

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.819 
Jamaican black castor oil so why did you
pick<00:00:36.210> coconut<00:00:36.719> oil<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.230> Jamaican<00:00:37.680> black

pick coconut oil in Jamaican black

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.630 
pick coconut oil in Jamaican black
castor<00:00:37.890> oil

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
castor oil

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.090 
castor oil
I<00:00:38.840> picked<00:00:39.840> Jamaican<00:00:40.469> black<00:00:40.620> castor<00:00:40.680> oil

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
I picked Jamaican black castor oil

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.180 
I picked Jamaican black castor oil
because<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.760> has<00:00:41.840> some<00:00:42.840> thickening

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
because it has some thickening

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.910 
because it has some thickening
properties<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:45.450> um<00:00:45.750> that's<00:00:46.530> why<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> picked

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
properties so um that's why I picked

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.380 
properties so um that's why I picked
that<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.250> then<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> coconut<00:00:47.820> oil<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.149> really

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
that and then the coconut oil is really

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.510 
that and then the coconut oil is really
good<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.500> believe<00:00:51.559> moisture<00:00:52.559> by<00:00:53.219> keeping

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
good for I believe moisture by keeping

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.619 
good for I believe moisture by keeping
the<00:00:53.670> moisture<00:00:53.820> locked<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.390> whatever

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the moisture locked in whatever

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.319 
the moisture locked in whatever
something<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:55.920> oh<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.489> did<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.879> so

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
something like that it's oh I did it so

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.260 
something like that it's oh I did it so
it's<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.770> oily<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.910> see<00:01:00.030> like<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
it's not so oily so you can see like the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.420 
it's not so oily so you can see like the
coconut<00:01:00.660> oil<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:01.129> melting<00:01:03.920> so<00:01:04.920> once<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.250> got

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
coconut oil is melting so once you got

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.510 
coconut oil is melting so once you got
that<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.229> can<00:01:07.229> see<00:01:07.409> I'm<00:01:07.560> not<00:01:07.680> using<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:08.100> lot<00:01:08.310> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
that you can see I'm not using a lot I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.580 
that you can see I'm not using a lot I
don't<00:01:08.580> know<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.240> mm-hmm<00:01:09.960> but

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
don't know if you can see mm-hmm but

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.260 
don't know if you can see mm-hmm but
then<00:01:10.890> we're<00:01:11.010> gonna<00:01:11.130> take<00:01:11.310> em<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.060> we're

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
then we're gonna take em in and we're

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.850 
then we're gonna take em in and we're
just<00:01:12.299> gonna<00:01:12.479> eyeball<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:13.020> make<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.530> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
just gonna eyeball it make it like a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.570 
just gonna eyeball it make it like a
half<00:01:14.340> half<00:01:14.640> mixture<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.740> half<00:01:16.740> oil<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.400> half

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
half half mixture so half oil and half

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.100 
half half mixture so half oil and half
minus<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:18.509> why<00:01:18.720> are<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:19.080> only

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
minus that and then why are we only

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.429 
minus that and then why are we only
doing<00:01:19.890> such<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> small<00:01:20.610> amount<00:01:21.200> right<00:01:22.200> now<00:01:22.229> we

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
doing such a small amount right now we

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.960 
doing such a small amount right now we
are<00:01:22.799> only<00:01:22.920> doing<00:01:23.159> such<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> small<00:01:23.670> amount

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
are only doing such a small amount

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.270 
are only doing such a small amount
because<00:01:24.229> we're<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.439> showing<00:01:25.590> we're<00:01:26.100> just

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
because we're just showing we're just

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.999 
because we're just showing we're just
showing<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.939> usually<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.049> about<00:01:28.140> double

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
showing so usually it's about double

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.630 
showing so usually it's about double
this<00:01:29.280> amount<00:01:29.340> right<00:01:30.200> maybe<00:01:31.200> triple<00:01:31.770> it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
this amount right maybe triple it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.160 
this amount right maybe triple it
because<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:33.180> only<00:01:34.049> make<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.250> application<00:01:36.180> per

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.770 

round<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.710> every<00:01:41.280> time<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.670> put<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.299> we

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
round so every time we put this on we

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.499 
round so every time we put this on we
make<00:01:42.990> enough<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.350> fill<00:01:44.280> our<00:01:44.430> scalp<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.360> we

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
make enough to fill our scalp so we

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.499 
make enough to fill our scalp so we
don't<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:46.259> mix<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.950> oils<00:01:47.490> together<00:01:47.790> and

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
don't like mix the oils together and

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.740 
don't like mix the oils together and
then<00:01:48.720> mix<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.500> whole<00:01:49.680> tube<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.130> -<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.750> she

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
then mix the whole tube of - that she

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.280 
then mix the whole tube of - that she
just<00:01:51.960> mixes<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.619> freshly<00:01:52.920> every<00:01:53.520> time<00:01:53.790> we

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
just mixes it freshly every time we

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.490 
just mixes it freshly every time we

now how often do you say we do this

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.569 
now how often do you say we do this
um<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:13.329> depends<00:02:13.780> on<00:02:13.930> what<00:02:14.859> your<00:02:15.069> schedule<00:02:15.430> is

everyday<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.989> week<00:02:20.469> but<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.370> more<00:02:21.700> realistic

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
everyday a week but a more realistic

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.449 
everyday a week but a more realistic
goal<00:02:22.359> would<00:02:22.780> be<00:02:22.930> maybe<00:02:23.200> every<00:02:23.650> other<00:02:23.799> day<00:02:24.099> or
