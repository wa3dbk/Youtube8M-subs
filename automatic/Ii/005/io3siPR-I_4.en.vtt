00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.000
 the intelligent GPUs from Multiplex 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 uses the same satellites the car navigation 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.710
 finally, values ​​like the current airspeed can 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.550
 above the city location and the distance of the model shown 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.690
 become 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.990
 In addition, more will give everything like the whole 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.630
 traveled route 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.630
 or different angle specifications 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.900
 With the Multiplex GPS you know the current airspeed 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.940
 the data is displayed in real time on the transmitter's display 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.940
 The Multiplex Sensor Bus System MSC is an independent development 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.810
 Underflow in a multiplex Wenning receiver up to 16 sensors 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.860
 be interconnected and managed as desired 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.720
 Visas in the SB are also sensors from third-party providers in the system 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.860
 incorporate and the appropriate telemetry values ​​on the transmitter display 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.740
 represent 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.320
 Save light and costs 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.300
 because SB Heil intelligent sensors do not need them so much sense 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.380

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.340
 The GPS sensor from Multiplex is one of many other Kemmling 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.010
 Sensors over the model compartment 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.440
 which are available 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.540
