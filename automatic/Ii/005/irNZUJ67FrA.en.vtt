against<00:05:09.010> him<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.430> this<00:05:09.850> is<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.030> battle<00:05:10.300> that

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
against him and this is the battle that

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.400 
against him and this is the battle that
phalanx<00:05:11.680> were<00:05:11.800> headed<00:05:12.010> uploaded<00:05:13.229> but<00:05:14.229> he

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
phalanx were headed uploaded but he
