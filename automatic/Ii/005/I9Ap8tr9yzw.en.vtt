00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:03.889
 good that you are watching the second video 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.080
 because before you buy the product 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.340
 Of course you have to know the angle easily the self-build PSP parquet 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.219
 works 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.029
 the psv structure known 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.999
 is lived and two parts 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:20.060
 what is it and pandora battery and which imports from hongkong but this is one 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.009
 dive their ticket 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.919
 I appreciate the special software set 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.109
 to make it all easier for the Alps 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.009
 I will therefore show in this video 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.320
 how easy it is 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.440
 to build your psp with the help of these two colson 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 but so we start with the memory card 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.730
 too strong in the psp 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.760
 cans and shut 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.510
 then we had the left 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.850
 hold down 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.930
 twello do that so I still pressed that key 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.860
 order pandora battery 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.680
 the only natural disaster 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.680
 what a bit awkward 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.750
 now you can see that the island is burning and I still have it 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.820
 the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.000
 also cooperated 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.700
 now see here 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.670
 flames in the stable 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.360
 crv that means custom processed 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.710
 55 and d3 well this was confirmed by on the 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.380
 text is pressing key 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.550
 you now see the psp itself 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.460
 in tales or falling off and then he goes the new own 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.690
 there was a wide choice of prison sentences for special school work 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.640
 so you too 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.640
 only spain games you can put on your psp 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.870

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:02.930

 then the psp will restart 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:30.249
 after the time not just the time to make the service right there for you 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:32.089

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:37.949

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.759

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.330

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.489
 6 I send start custom vermeer 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:25.689
 that's your son 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.900
 well you see the psp has now restarted well just controlled 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.150
 otherwise it goes well s 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.669
 we are going with an eviction 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.809
 system settings 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:39.909
 golden trio sirloin 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.289
 the system as well and 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.889
 system software five are in situ with 5 0 when the ps 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:48.949
 but with this software 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.020
 times all games that are currently out of its way simply play effortlessly 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.469
 on your psp 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:58.229

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.229
 it is a meadow here if your psp just converted 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.969
