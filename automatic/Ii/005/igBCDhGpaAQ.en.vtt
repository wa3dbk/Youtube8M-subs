there<00:02:23.799> in<00:02:24.250> fact<00:02:24.430> before<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.910> got<00:02:25.030> here<00:02:25.180> when

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
there in fact before you got here when

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.120 
there in fact before you got here when
we<00:02:25.450> enter<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.989> new<00:02:26.110> physical<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.769> gotta<00:02:26.950> move

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
we enter the new physical you gotta move

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.690 
we enter the new physical you gotta move
your<00:02:27.340> energy<00:02:27.610> into<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.880> physical<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:29.700> that's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
your energy into a physical and that's

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.539 
your energy into a physical and that's
all<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.180> means<00:02:31.950> from<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.040> very<00:02:33.250> practical

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
all it means from a very practical

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.039 
all it means from a very practical
standpoint<00:02:34.350> we<00:02:35.459> are<00:02:36.459> basically<00:02:36.940> coming<00:02:37.660> into

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
standpoint we are basically coming into

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.420 
standpoint we are basically coming into
a<00:02:38.110> greater<00:02:38.319> consciousness<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:39.100> how<00:02:39.250> we're

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
a greater consciousness of how we're

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.710 
a greater consciousness of how we're
moving<00:02:39.880> it<00:02:40.030> with<00:02:40.360> within<00:02:41.110> these<00:02:41.790> physicals<00:02:42.790> so

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
moving it with within these physicals so

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.300 
moving it with within these physicals so
so<00:02:44.019> it's<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.200> mind<00:02:44.500> body<00:02:44.769> spirit<00:02:45.099> and<00:02:47.310> frequency

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
so it's a mind body spirit and frequency

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.190 
so it's a mind body spirit and frequency
or<00:02:48.609> vibration<00:02:48.640> as<00:02:49.390> we<00:02:49.540> were<00:02:49.630> just<00:02:49.780> talking<00:02:50.109> a

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
or vibration as we were just talking a

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.690 
or vibration as we were just talking a
little<00:02:50.290> bit<00:02:50.410> earlier<00:02:50.890> it's<00:02:51.100> exactly<00:02:51.579> the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
little bit earlier it's exactly the

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.180 
little bit earlier it's exactly the
painting<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.090> get<00:02:52.269> somebody<00:02:52.630> back<00:02:52.900> up<00:02:53.109> and<00:02:53.230> go

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190

that<00:03:32.319> with<00:03:32.440> that<00:03:32.530> person<00:03:32.890> that's<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.790> way

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
that with that person that's the way

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.150 
that with that person that's the way
with<00:03:34.120> you<00:03:34.300> because<00:03:35.170> if<00:03:35.349> you're<00:03:35.470> resonating<00:03:35.709> on

with you because if you're resonating on
that<00:03:36.340> that's<00:03:36.519> what<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.790> want<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.060> track<00:03:37.860> so

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
that that's what you want to track so

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.949 
that that's what you want to track so
it's<00:03:38.980> important<00:03:39.400> for<00:03:39.459> us<00:03:39.550> to<00:03:39.610> to<00:03:40.330> know<00:03:41.519> so

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
it's important for us to to know so

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.470 
it's important for us to to know so
knowing<00:03:43.959> what<00:03:44.549> vibrational<00:03:45.549> frequency

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
knowing what vibrational frequency

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
and what is fine what is frequency what

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.230 
and what is fine what is frequency what
is<00:06:46.360> connection<00:06:47.360> and<00:06:48.350> it<00:06:48.680> always<00:06:48.950> begins<00:06:49.430> here

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
is connection and it always begins here

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:58.140 
is connection and it always begins here
first<00:06:51.220> because<00:06:53.020> if<00:06:54.020> you<00:06:54.140> don't<00:06:54.260> get<00:06:54.440> it<00:06:54.560> here
