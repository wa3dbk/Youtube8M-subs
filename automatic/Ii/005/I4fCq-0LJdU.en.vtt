of team

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.920 
of team
I<00:02:02.100> think<00:02:02.340> DICOM<00:02:02.700> Team<00:02:02.969> Plasma<00:02:03.149> earlier<00:02:03.780> it's

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
I think DICOM Team Plasma earlier it's

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.880 
I think DICOM Team Plasma earlier it's
team's<00:02:04.170> game<00:02:04.439> that's<00:02:05.070> who<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:05.640> battled<00:02:06.030> in

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
team's game that's who we battled in

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.340 
team's game that's who we battled in
when<00:02:07.730> we<00:02:07.880> were<00:02:07.970> here<00:02:08.210> going<00:02:08.630> towards<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.140> lure

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
when we were here going towards the lure

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.310 
when we were here going towards the lure
in<00:02:09.530> elite<00:02:09.979> for<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:10.789> anyway<00:02:11.140> when<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.200> come

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
in elite for so anyway when you come

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.750 
in elite for so anyway when you come
over<00:02:12.410> here<00:02:12.890> we'll<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:13.310> go<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.430> this<00:02:13.610> one

first I guess there is a sign that says
do<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.520> want<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.730> go<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:17.180> use<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.480> portal<00:02:17.930> so

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
I think I can remember how to spell that

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.920 
I think I can remember how to spell that
my<00:04:59.039> spelling<00:04:59.490> is<00:04:59.580> like<00:04:59.970> my<00:05:00.120> memory<00:05:00.720> for

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
my spelling is like my memory for

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.590 
my spelling is like my memory for
spelling<00:05:01.169> is<00:05:01.410> so<00:05:01.590> bad<00:05:01.830> uh<00:05:02.150> this<00:05:03.150> looks<00:05:03.389> about

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
spelling is so bad uh this looks about

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.300 
spelling is so bad uh this looks about
right<00:05:04.139> I<00:05:04.440> think<00:05:04.979> and<00:05:06.110> yep<00:05:07.139> temporal<00:05:07.620> that

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
right I think and yep temporal that

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
right I think and yep temporal that
looks<00:05:08.610> okay<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.060> me

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
looks okay to me

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330 
looks okay to me
I<00:05:09.450> bet<00:05:09.690> it's<00:05:09.810> wrong<00:05:09.990> though<00:05:10.229> anyway<00:05:10.950> now<00:05:11.100> we've

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
I bet it's wrong though anyway now we've

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.890 
I bet it's wrong though anyway now we've
done<00:05:11.490> that<00:05:11.550> we're<00:05:11.880> going<00:05:12.000> to<00:05:12.060> hop<00:05:12.240> on<00:05:12.419> Taillow

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
done that we're going to hop on Taillow

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.960 
done that we're going to hop on Taillow
but<00:05:13.440> we<00:05:13.530> can't<00:05:13.710> use<00:05:13.770> that<00:05:13.889> here<00:05:14.160> apparently<00:05:14.460> so

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
but we can't use that here apparently so

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:15.800 
but we can't use that here apparently so
we're<00:05:15.090> gonna<00:05:15.180> have<00:05:15.300> to<00:05:15.330> go<00:05:15.450> to<00:05:15.539> the<00:05:15.690> outside

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
we're gonna have to go to the outside

just check out this things move so

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.440 
just check out this things move so
temporal<00:06:07.190> as<00:06:08.190> the<00:06:08.729> moves<00:06:08.910> dragon<00:06:09.330> breath

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.839 
temporal as the moves dragon breath

metal claw ancient power dragon claw

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.540 
metal claw ancient power dragon claw
very<00:06:12.450> well<00:06:13.409> actually<00:06:13.770> because<00:06:14.010> dragon<00:06:14.400> is<00:06:14.490> a

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
very well actually because dragon is a

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.050 
very well actually because dragon is a
special<00:06:15.000> type<00:06:15.210> of<00:06:15.240> tackiness<00:06:15.599> it's<00:06:15.810> got

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
special type of tackiness it's got

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.910 
special type of tackiness it's got
it's<00:06:16.360> a<00:06:16.420> mixed<00:06:16.660> attacker<00:06:16.930> essentially<00:06:17.530> which

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
it's a mixed attacker essentially which

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.820 
it's a mixed attacker essentially which
isn't<00:06:18.070> bad<00:06:18.480> and<00:06:19.480> then<00:06:19.780> we<00:06:19.900> have<00:06:20.080> the<00:06:20.560> exact

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
isn't bad and then we have the exact

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.500 
isn't bad and then we have the exact
same<00:06:20.860> moves<00:06:21.310> on<00:06:22.200> spatial<00:06:23.200> and<00:06:24.270> I<00:06:25.270> think<00:06:25.450> they

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
same moves on spatial and I think they

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.510 
same moves on spatial and I think they
have<00:06:25.600> it<00:06:25.720> all<00:06:26.260> right<00:06:26.500> Dale<00:06:26.710> guys<00:06:26.950> more<00:06:27.160> HP<00:06:27.340> and

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
have it all right Dale guys more HP and

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.720 
have it all right Dale guys more HP and
paying<00:06:28.450> as<00:06:28.630> a<00:06:28.810> poky<00:06:29.770> has<00:06:29.860> way<00:06:30.100> more<00:06:30.130> special

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 
paying as a poky has way more special

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.270 
paying as a poky has way more special
attack<00:06:30.970> and<00:06:31.380> then<00:06:32.380> we<00:06:32.590> have<00:06:32.680> Giratina<00:06:33.100> who<00:06:33.250> I

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
attack and then we have Giratina who I

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.340 
attack and then we have Giratina who I
haven't<00:06:33.550> looked<00:06:33.610> done<00:06:33.850> in<00:06:34.600> a<00:06:34.660> long<00:06:34.990> time<00:06:35.290> so
