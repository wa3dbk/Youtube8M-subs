00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.430
 hello to everyone welcome to 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.010
 3d games puntocom I'm Alberto Pastor 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.380
 come back with a video gameplay 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.960
 commented on heros of the storm other and 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.430
 another but this time more than 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.260
 tell you about the many virtues that 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.880
 have this mode for that you have the 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.130
 text and video analysis that we just finished 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.989
 to publish what I will do will be to raise 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.460
 simple guidelines for those who 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.859
 you give your first steps in the 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.809
 gender I do not intend either to teach 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:40.819
 no one play god free me because I do not 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.559
 I consider a great of fashion but 

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:44.659
 I think this is the perfect opportunity 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.760
 to explore a new video format 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.219
 closest to the tutorial concept that 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.350
 analysis itself the idea to 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.609
 final is that with a few tricks and 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.739
 Several tips you can enjoy 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.960
 fully of the brutal action of this 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.100
 video game a title absolutely 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.870
 spectacular that will make us 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.209
 Enjoy epic sequencing 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.159
 how are you seeing but that 

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:05.630
 can also frustrate the most painted if 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.119
 the game is not focused in a way 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.049
 correct so without further ado 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.049
 let's start 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.159
 This is the million dollar question and no no 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.409
 I can give you a concrete answer 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.569
 because in the end everything depends on you 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.729
 of the type of action you seek in me 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.829
 case I am more of heroes who attack from 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.729
 the distance and if they are agile and fast 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.709
 better than better 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.170
 that's why the demon hunter goes the 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:37.450
 that you will know devil 3 is usually a 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.340
 of my favorite selections is also 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.689
 an easy to handle character that with 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.700
 little that you do offers a great 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.959
 performance what is important to have 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.140
 into account when taking the first 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:51.179
 steps in the game because here easier 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.179
 to control is not synonymous with weaker 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.470
 so I would recommend you to start 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.420
 opt for heroes that do not exceed 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.580
 medium difficulty level 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.470
 otherwise you will feel lost in 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.300
 the battle and also the tasks to your 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.040
 team which will eventually make 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.470
 departure is a roll that is difficult 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.610
 win that you hate yourself and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.610
 you know what's always 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.230
 it's worth alberto but then 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.959
 we choose good my recommendation 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.459
 staff that is very personal is that 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.440
 if you're going the assassin roll 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.730
 distance update by nova that well 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.730
 managed is a fearsome enemy 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.080
 points and hikes if you go to combat 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.720
 melee 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.310
 Badly fury or lily for those who enjoy 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.680
 supporting his allies 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.349
 and that reagan for more to create enemies 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.630
 in close combat from there 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.760
 try for yourselves the rest of 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.709
 characters because each one is a world and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.840
 offers lots of playable alternatives 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.060
 I love the sergeant hammer 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.590
 but I understand that others do not like what 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.569
 what is clear is that the more works 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.550
 made with a better character we 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.790
 desenvolveremos with him and joys you 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.790
 give to 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.640
 and do not forget that there is nothing 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.260
 how to meet your rivals for 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.510
 defend ourselves better from their attacks 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.910
 so try to prove how many more better 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.040
 because in the end you will know how to react 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.270
 before any of them and that believe me 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.270
 It is the best possible strategy 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.430
 and I understand 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.250
 Well, to fight clearly but with a head 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.680
 because this is first and foremost a game of 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.349
 team so do not even think out for 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.000
 there in big plan if you do it good and 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.650
 You see, they will kill you right away 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.690
 advanced with your allies 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.400
 Attack in a group take advantage of 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.500
 skills of your classmates for 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.510
 maximize your own doing 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.050
 what you will surely enjoy the glory 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.050
 of the winners 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.629
 if you do not accept that here the 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.610
 Individualities do not lead to any 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.730
 I already tell you that this is not your 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.730
 game 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.989
 the battle begins the election of 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.489
 talents is also crucial escoged 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.170
 your skills with care 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.299
 thinking especially in the style of 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.009
 game that you are looking for but also a little 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.009
 in the allies that accompany you and in the 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:21.389
 own scenario in which you are 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.220
 later I'll talk about this last 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.990
 point but note that what 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.910
 works in a few games does not have 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.800
 what to do just as well in other bullets 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.780
 for example that here life throwing of 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.639
 one side to the other can enhance their 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.889
 area attacks to cause harm to a 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.360
 greater number of enemies such that like this or 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.190
 can specialize in shots 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.620
 accurate that only reach an opponent 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.720
 but cause much more damage which 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.550
 monsters or points that seem to have been 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.889
 just to resist more hits than anyone 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.720
 and yet it can also become 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.570
 in a fierce killing machine if we opted 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.880
 for the relevant improvements there are options 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.740
 to bore so many that depending on 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.330
 the selected talents you will achieve that 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.349
 the same character is totally 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.349
 different from the rival 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.389
 God cursed 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.110
 7 are the scenarios that we find in 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.120
 heros of the storm and each of them 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.070
 has its own peculiarities not 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.840
 only aesthetic than of course but 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.580
 mainly playable because they will give 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.440
 access to a tactical advantage to those 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.540
 that they earn it so we do a favor 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.040
 and work as a team to cooperate with 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.290
 your allies to fulfill the 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.390
 objectives that you are commissioned to collect 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.730
 seeds skulls gold coins 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.890
 control the temples whatever but 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.360
 do it as a team if it is not coordination and 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.460
 you let the other side do 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.610
 with this extra power it is necessary that you 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.889
 say that it happened then 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.870
 Besides, what the hell are you, the sauce? 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.460
 of the game that you can not imagine what 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.560
 fun that is crushing the enemies 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.419
 in the skin of a dragon knight or 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.230
 fight to death for taking control of 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:01.529
 a pirate ship to bombard them 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.539
 this place 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.309
 you have to be so ready if sometimes 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.869
 a little bitchy to adapt our 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:09.119
 game to the conditions of the map in the 

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:11.249
 that we find ourselves know how to take advantage of 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:13.049
 moment to attack when it touches and retreats 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:16.519
 if it is necessary to hit with greater 

00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:16.519
 rotundity later 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.830
 also the mercenary camps 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.900
 are very important to achieve 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.120
 victory defeat them and they will unite 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.009
 temporarily to your cause let that 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.449
 the enemy defeats them and then you will have 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:32.449
 more rivals against those who fight 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.180
 and finally here we have something that does not 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.760
 communication can never fail and the 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.040
 I repeat communication not insults nor 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.750
 no complaints or crying or anything like that for god 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.490
 that there are everyone on the networks but 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.490
 good good I still miss 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.509
 there is not a voice chat that is something that 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.129
 many will miss but if you have 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:05.289
 the option to write messages to 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:07.389
 your allies only to them for 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:09.669
 coordinate a little and a very simple 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:11.080
 menu with four basic commands that 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:14.409
 will become your best tool 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.060
 to throw them into combat you see that 

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:18.490
 easy is to indicate to the allies that 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.590
 you need help that danger or that 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.759
 you are going to attack a particular position and 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.759
 it is very useful, believe me 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.600
 with this last note he finished this 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.100
 I review hero how the storm that I hope 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.990
 I have been worth to make you an idea 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.060
 clear of what you will find in the 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.340
 I already told you before that my intention 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.020
 it was not teaching anyone to play that 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.210
 you will do with the practice testing the 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.220
 each hero's skills and getting to 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.630
 test on the battlefield but if I 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.510
 you say that you have lost the fear of 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.669
 enter the nexus and I am satisfied 

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:53.240
 so without a greeting we see each other in 

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:53.240
 the battlefield
