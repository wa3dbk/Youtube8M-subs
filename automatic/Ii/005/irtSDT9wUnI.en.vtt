00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
here on the left I probably should have

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.360 
here on the left I probably should have
it<00:04:40.280> in<00:04:40.400> a<00:04:40.490> case<00:04:40.780> because<00:04:41.780> it'll<00:04:41.990> la<00:04:42.220> get<00:04:43.220> the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
it in a case because it'll la get the

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.129 
it in a case because it'll la get the
cap<00:04:43.820> dangling<00:04:44.300> out<00:04:44.479> of<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.630> way<00:04:44.750> there<00:04:47.139> it's

cap dangling out of the way there it's

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.360 
cap dangling out of the way there it's
to<00:04:48.260> make<00:04:48.410> sure<00:04:48.560> you<00:04:48.680> don't<00:04:48.800> touch<00:04:49.040> the<00:04:49.220> back

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
to make sure you don't touch the back

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.710 
to make sure you don't touch the back
when<00:04:49.580> its<00:04:49.700> operating<00:04:49.820> because<00:04:50.300> you<00:04:50.510> know<00:04:50.600> it's

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
when its operating because you know it's

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.350 
when its operating because you know it's
240<00:04:51.320> volts<00:04:51.590> it<00:04:51.770> going<00:04:51.950> to<00:04:52.010> be<00:04:52.070> careful<00:04:52.460> so

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
240 volts it going to be careful so

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.140 
240 volts it going to be careful so
that's<00:04:53.690> how<00:04:54.250> that's<00:04:55.250> how<00:04:55.400> to<00:04:55.460> control<00:04:55.790> it<00:04:55.850> you

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
that's how that's how to control it you

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.200 
that's how that's how to control it you
can<00:04:56.270> see<00:04:56.450> that<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:57.169> copper<00:04:57.830> wire<00:04:58.130> here<00:04:58.700> what

20<00:05:10.190> degrees<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:12.100> that<00:05:13.100> should<00:05:13.340> provide<00:05:13.880> just

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
20 degrees and that should provide just

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.460 
20 degrees and that should provide just
about<00:05:14.240> perfect<00:05:14.419> fermentation<00:05:15.260> temperature

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
about perfect fermentation temperature

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
up by Vienna mash and see how it turns

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.030 
up by Vienna mash and see how it turns
out<00:05:37.380> ah<00:05:37.650> let's<00:05:38.070> keep<00:05:38.580> you<00:05:38.670> informed
