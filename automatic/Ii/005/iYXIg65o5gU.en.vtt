explain<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> philosophy<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.289> drop<00:00:22.529> test

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
explain the philosophy of this drop test

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.529 
explain the philosophy of this drop test
so<00:00:23.250> what<00:00:23.430> we're<00:00:23.580> trying<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.820> do<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.269> bring

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
so what we're trying to do here is bring

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.420 
so what we're trying to do here is bring
you<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.900> most<00:00:25.050> realistic<00:00:25.590> possible<00:00:26.220> drop

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
you the most realistic possible drop

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.849 
you the most realistic possible drop
test<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.300> involves<00:00:27.930> three<00:00:28.320> different

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
test so that involves three different

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.220 
test so that involves three different
drops<00:00:29.220> first<00:00:30.000> we're<00:00:30.539> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.720> drop<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.929> out

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
drops first we're going to drop it out

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.020 
drops first we're going to drop it out
of<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.410> pocket<00:00:31.769> as<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.099> pull<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.550> device<00:00:32.790> out

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
of the pocket as we pull the device out

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.670 
of the pocket as we pull the device out
which<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> most<00:00:33.840> typical<00:00:34.170> use<00:00:34.559> case

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
which is the most typical use case

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.440 
which is the most typical use case
scenario<00:00:35.250> when<00:00:35.610> people<00:00:35.850> actually<00:00:36.000> drop<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
scenario when people actually drop the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
scenario when people actually drop the
device<00:00:36.719> from<00:00:37.260> there<00:00:37.559> we're<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> drop<00:00:38.340> it

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
device from there we're going to drop it

goodness first part of the drop test

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.910 
goodness first part of the drop test
right<00:01:06.689> from<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.900> pocket

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.320 

let's<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.310> see<00:01:14.549> how<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.880> fares<00:01:15.030> from<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
let's just see how it fares from the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.420 
let's just see how it fares from the
reverse<00:01:15.570> initial<00:01:15.990> drop<00:01:16.110> test<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:17.040> right<00:01:17.250> so

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
reverse initial drop test all right so

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.859 
reverse initial drop test all right so
no<00:01:17.580> shattering<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> display<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.570> really

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
no shattering on the display a really

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.710 
no shattering on the display a really
good<00:01:19.020> sign<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:21.060> looks<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
good sign but it looks like we have a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.090 
good sign but it looks like we have a
little<00:01:21.990> bit<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.170> scratching<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> side

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
little bit of scratching to the side

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.859 
little bit of scratching to the side
here<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.090> does<00:01:24.270> seem<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.689> fared

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
here but it does seem to have fared

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.499 
here but it does seem to have fared
quite<00:01:24.960> well<00:01:25.460> other<00:01:26.460> than<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.729> very<00:01:27.210> minimal

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
quite well other than that very minimal

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.910 
quite well other than that very minimal
damage<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:27.960> things<00:01:28.140> considering<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.830> was

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
damage all things considering but it was

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.700 
damage all things considering but it was
from<00:01:29.100> only<00:01:29.369> two<00:01:29.520> feet<00:01:30.090> six<00:01:30.509> inches<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.500> let's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
from only two feet six inches so let's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.249

here<00:02:08.170> we<00:02:08.289> are<00:02:08.410> going<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.649> drop<00:02:08.769> it<00:02:08.950> from<00:02:09.039> mid

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
here we are going to drop it from mid

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.330 
here we are going to drop it from mid
height<00:02:09.459> from<00:02:09.789> 4<00:02:10.149> feet

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.160 

all<00:02:17.700> right<00:02:17.910> look<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.390> drop<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.810> side<00:02:18.989> but

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
all right look to drop on the side but

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.630 
all right look to drop on the side but
let's<00:02:19.349> see<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.590> moment<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.890> truth<00:02:22.040> okay<00:02:23.040> now

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
let's see the moment of truth okay now

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.240 
let's see the moment of truth okay now
in<00:02:23.760> terms<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.150> actually<00:02:24.450> how<00:02:24.540> unfair<00:02:25.250> all

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
in terms of actually how unfair all

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.820 
in terms of actually how unfair all
right<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:27.230> actually<00:02:28.230> relatively<00:02:28.590> minimal

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
right so actually relatively minimal

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.800 
right so actually relatively minimal
damage<00:02:29.190> as<00:02:29.580> we<00:02:30.090> can<00:02:30.239> see<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.480> point<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.690> impact

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
damage as we can see the point of impact

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.350 
damage as we can see the point of impact
is<00:02:31.170> here<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:31.890> looks<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.160> almost<00:02:32.879> fracture<00:02:33.239> the

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
it from five foot six at the air let's

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:49.750 
it from five foot six at the air let's
see<00:03:41.610> how<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.880> goes

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.610 

you<00:03:50.299> know<00:03:50.420> I've<00:03:50.870> really<00:03:51.140> got<00:03:51.260> to<00:03:51.290> hand<00:03:51.470> it<00:03:51.560> to

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
you know I've really got to hand it to

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.869 
you know I've really got to hand it to
Apple<00:03:52.060> device<00:03:53.060> itself<00:03:53.420> is<00:03:53.599> still<00:03:53.780> functioning

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
Apple device itself is still functioning

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.250 
Apple device itself is still functioning
let's<00:03:55.879> see<00:03:56.060> where<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.299> moment<00:03:56.569> of<00:03:56.629> point<00:03:57.200> of

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
let's see where the moment of point of

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.770 
let's see where the moment of point of
impact<00:03:57.379> less

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.280 

all<00:04:01.140> right<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:01.890> fair<00:04:02.069> so<00:04:02.310> yeah<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:03.510> know<00:04:03.630> it's

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
all right and fair so yeah you know it's

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.020 
all right and fair so yeah you know it's
a<00:04:04.440> really<00:04:04.620> learn<00:04:04.800> cloud<00:04:04.980> device<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.520> just<00:04:05.819> a

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
a really learn cloud device I just a

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.820 
a really learn cloud device I just a
little<00:04:06.209> bit<00:04:06.390> of<00:04:06.450> damage<00:04:06.600> on<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.930> side<00:04:07.140> we<00:04:07.680> had

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
little bit of damage on the side we had

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.320 
little bit of damage on the side we had
the<00:04:07.920> first<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.400> second<00:04:08.670> point<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.880> impact<00:04:09.000> was

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
the first the second point of impact was

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.110 
the first the second point of impact was
here<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.140> first<00:04:10.319> point<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.590> impact<00:04:10.680> was

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
here and the first point of impact was

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.400 
here and the first point of impact was
actually<00:04:12.120> excuse<00:04:12.450> me<00:04:12.630> this<00:04:12.990> appears<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.319> be

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
actually excuse me this appears to be

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.500 
actually excuse me this appears to be
actually<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.980> point<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.280> impact<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:14.880> whereas

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
actually the point of impact and whereas

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.990 
actually the point of impact and whereas
you<00:04:15.690> know<00:04:15.720> from<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.049> galaxy<00:04:16.290> s3<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:17.070> smash<00:04:17.459> one

you know from the galaxy s3 is smash one

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.210 
you know from the galaxy s3 is smash one
of<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.150> iphone<00:04:18.480> 5<00:04:18.690> appears<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.859> sustain

relatively minimal damage the LCD itself
is<00:04:22.800> still<00:04:22.950> completely<00:04:23.070> functioning<00:04:23.850> it's

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
is still completely functioning it's

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.330 
is still completely functioning it's
just<00:04:24.450> minor<00:04:24.630> aesthetic<00:04:25.050> damage<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.040> bezel

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
itself which is made of a hard composite

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.000 
itself which is made of a hard composite
metal<00:04:28.800> so<00:04:29.730> yeah<00:04:30.540> iphone<00:04:30.990> 5<00:04:31.169> felt<00:04:31.440> very<00:04:31.710> very

well all right guys samsung galaxy s3
time<00:04:35.100> again<00:04:35.610> we're<00:04:36.060> going<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.240> drop<00:04:36.390> it<00:04:36.570> from

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
time again we're going to drop it from

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.659 
time again we're going to drop it from
the<00:04:36.840> height<00:04:36.990> of<00:04:37.020> my<00:04:37.200> ear<00:04:37.410> to<00:04:37.710> retrain

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
the height of my ear to retrain

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.760 
the height of my ear to retrain
realistic<00:04:39.150> drop<00:04:39.360> test<00:04:39.630> scenario<00:04:40.020> i<00:04:40.260> will<00:04:40.680> be

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
realistic drop test scenario i will be

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.040 
realistic drop test scenario i will be
five<00:04:40.980> foot<00:04:41.190> six<00:04:41.400> of<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.730> year<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.810> let's<00:04:42.990> just

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
five foot six of the year and let's just

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:50.439 
five foot six of the year and let's just
see<00:04:43.290> how<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:43.560> fares

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.719 

so<00:04:50.539> as<00:04:50.629> we<00:04:50.719> can<00:04:50.809> see<00:04:50.870> ya<00:04:51.770> just<00:04:52.340> from<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.550> side

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
so as we can see ya just from the side

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.239 
so as we can see ya just from the side
here<00:04:52.969> it<00:04:53.090> did<00:04:53.300> crack<00:04:53.539> a<00:04:53.569> little<00:04:53.719> bit<00:04:53.930> more<00:04:54.249> it

00:04:55.239 --> 00:04:55.249 
here it did crack a little bit more it

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:57.040 
here it did crack a little bit more it
appears<00:04:55.550> as<00:04:55.699> though<00:04:55.729> yeah<00:04:56.449> the<00:04:56.629> impact<00:04:56.930> was

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
appears as though yeah the impact was

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.899 
appears as though yeah the impact was
here<00:04:57.259> on<00:04:57.379> the<00:04:57.469> side<00:04:57.680> which<00:04:58.400> caused<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.610> glass

00:04:58.899 --> 00:04:58.909 
here on the side which caused the glass

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:00.429 
here on the side which caused the glass
to<00:04:59.120> fracture<00:04:59.419> a<00:04:59.479> little<00:04:59.659> bit<00:04:59.749> more<00:04:59.930> but<00:05:00.349> it

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:00.439 
to fracture a little bit more but it

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:01.929 
to fracture a little bit more but it
just<00:05:00.589> compounded<00:05:01.189> the<00:05:01.219> fractures<00:05:01.729> to<00:05:01.759> the

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:01.939 
just compounded the fractures to the

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:04.420 
just compounded the fractures to the
point<00:05:02.210> where<00:05:02.449> they<00:05:02.839> extend<00:05:03.439> all<00:05:03.589> the<00:05:03.650> way<00:05:04.039> down

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
point where they extend all the way down

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.329 
point where they extend all the way down
the<00:05:04.669> device<00:05:04.939> itself<00:05:05.529> to<00:05:06.529> the<00:05:06.650> rear<00:05:06.830> yeah

00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:07.339 
the device itself to the rear yeah

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:09.790 
the device itself to the rear yeah
obviously<00:05:08.180> not<00:05:08.300> very<00:05:08.389> much<00:05:08.629> damage<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.559> case

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
obviously not very much damage the case

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.200 
obviously not very much damage the case
really<00:05:10.159> no<00:05:10.309> one<00:05:10.430> cares<00:05:10.639> about<00:05:10.699> it's<00:05:11.059> just

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
really no one cares about it's just

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.320 
really no one cares about it's just
cheap<00:05:11.509> plastic<00:05:11.719> really<00:05:12.139> anyway<00:05:12.639> but<00:05:13.639> yeah<00:05:13.759> the

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
cheap plastic really anyway but yeah the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.579 
cheap plastic really anyway but yeah the
screen<00:05:14.479> itself<00:05:14.659> is<00:05:14.870> still<00:05:15.050> functioning<00:05:15.499> so

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:15.589 
screen itself is still functioning so

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:16.839 
screen itself is still functioning so
that's<00:05:15.740> a<00:05:15.830> really<00:05:15.860> good<00:05:16.099> sign<00:05:16.159> the<00:05:16.460> internals

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
that's a really good sign the internals

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.749 
that's a really good sign the internals
are<00:05:16.879> obviously<00:05:17.270> okay<00:05:17.949> but<00:05:18.949> it<00:05:19.580> just

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 
are obviously okay but it just

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.519 
are obviously okay but it just
compounded<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.270> impact<00:05:20.689> and<00:05:20.870> just<00:05:21.349> made<00:05:21.499> all

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:21.529 
compounded the impact and just made all

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:22.959 
compounded the impact and just made all
the<00:05:21.740> cracks<00:05:21.979> just<00:05:22.189> go<00:05:22.309> down<00:05:22.490> a<00:05:22.520> little<00:05:22.639> farther

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
the cracks just go down a little farther

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.450 
the cracks just go down a little farther
down<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:23.569> length<00:05:23.900> of<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.169> display<00:05:24.529> so

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
down the length of the display so

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.329 
down the length of the display so
Samsung<00:05:26.210> s3<00:05:26.389> unfortunately<00:05:27.080> is<00:05:27.469> in<00:05:27.680> pretty

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:28.339 
Samsung s3 unfortunately is in pretty

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:29.649 
Samsung s3 unfortunately is in pretty
tough<00:05:28.520> shape<00:05:28.580> right<00:05:28.939> now<00:05:28.969> relative<00:05:29.479> to<00:05:29.569> the

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
tough shape right now relative to the

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.519 
tough shape right now relative to the
iphone<00:05:29.990> 5<00:05:31.029> damn<00:05:32.029> the<00:05:32.389> iphone<00:05:32.779> 5<00:05:32.990> held<00:05:33.259> up<00:05:33.379> well

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:33.529 
iphone 5 damn the iphone 5 held up well
