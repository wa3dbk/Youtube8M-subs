00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.119
 on a whole new diet that 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.699
 comes from corsair cs 450 m 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.250
 an interesting diet because 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.649
 proposed in 450 watts but with a 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.460
 gold certification and cables 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.250
 modular 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.010
 all with a 3 year warranty and a 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.840
 price of 89 dollars for the moment on 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.329
 waiting for the price in France 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.670
 hope it will be around 80 euros 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.020
 this little food we go in 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.140
 go around right now 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.059
 now it's sure that the code tv on 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.550
 start our little ride with the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.989
 bundle bundle that is pretty limited 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.370
 will we say with the leaflets 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.609
 of use and the cord 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.199
 feeding only as we the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.270
 say the food is kind 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.790
 the modular so revises with cables 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.250
 modular which are two types there one 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.710
 will find a cord with two sata sockets 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.080
 a second cord with two sata sockets 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.890
 a cable that offers a plug 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.930
 pci-express 6-pin compatible 8 pin and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.360
 finally we have a cable that offers 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.250
 three molex plug with system of 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.340
 quick detachment right away 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.049
 is interested in the block 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.810
 the block therefore has a standard size on 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.000
 is about 140 mm in length which is 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.750
 pretty good for modular on 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.299
 sides we find stickers cs 450m 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.030
 green and white rather clean at the back 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.979

 with the corsair logo that hides a 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.799

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.960
 find non- modular cables with a 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.469
 sheath says long on the 24 pin branch 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.330
 and a flat type sheath on the 8 pin 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.220

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.560
