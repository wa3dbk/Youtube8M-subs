good<00:01:41.250> thing<00:01:41.280> about<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> fact<00:01:42.299> that

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
good thing about this is the fact that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.639 
good thing about this is the fact that
anything<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.590> put<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.950> into<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:45.320> Mac<00:01:46.320> as

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
anything I put it into the Mac as

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.539 
anything I put it into the Mac as
new-snippets

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
new-snippets

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.850 
new-snippets
will<00:01:48.420> automatically<00:01:48.990> find<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.290> way<00:01:49.439> over

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
will automatically find the way over

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.520 
will automatically find the way over
onto<00:01:50.270> this<00:01:51.270> application<00:01:52.079> here<00:01:52.229> which<00:01:52.380> is

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
onto this application here which is

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.200 
onto this application here which is
rather<00:01:52.710> nice<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.520> what's<00:01:53.670> good<00:01:53.820> about<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.149> is

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
rather nice so what's good about this is

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.630 
rather nice so what's good about this is
that<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.570> all<00:01:54.689> works<00:01:54.960> together<00:01:55.189> if<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.399> for

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
that it all works together if I do for

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.100 
that it all works together if I do for
two<00:01:56.790> forward<00:01:57.149> slashes<00:01:57.180> followed<00:01:57.719> by<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> day

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
two forward slashes followed by a day

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.800 
two forward slashes followed by a day
it'll<00:01:58.469> put<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.850> HTTP<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.000> all<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.299> stuff<00:02:00.600> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
it'll put in HTTP and all that stuff and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.139 
it'll put in HTTP and all that stuff and
digital<00:02:01.320> maestro<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.790> don't<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.060> to

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
digital maestro and I don't have to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.670 
digital maestro and I don't have to
worry<00:02:03.329> about<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.689> too<00:02:03.810> much<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.320> exactly

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
worry about it too much and it's exactly

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.249 
worry about it too much and it's exactly
the<00:02:04.829> same<00:02:05.450> snippet<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.570> I've<00:02:06.659> got<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.110> my

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the same snippet that I've got it on my

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.249 
the same snippet that I've got it on my
Mac<00:02:08.300> so<00:02:09.300> we've<00:02:09.509> got<00:02:09.629> some<00:02:09.780> settings<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
Mac so we've got some settings to the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.600 
Mac so we've got some settings to the
air<00:02:10.410> as<00:02:10.560> well<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.099> I'll<00:02:11.190> be<00:02:11.280> tell<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.459> to

air as well so I'll be tell you to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.250 
air as well so I'll be tell you to
ignore<00:02:11.790> case

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
ignore case

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.990 
ignore case
I<00:02:13.290> will<00:02:13.620> tell<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.830> expand<00:02:14.430> immediately<00:02:14.970> I

capitalizations so that's useful

with<00:02:28.769> tweet<00:02:28.980> bots<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.900> course<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.290> I

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
with tweet bots and of course that I

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.600 
with tweet bots and of course that I
could<00:02:31.530> have<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.739> working<00:02:31.950> with<00:02:32.190> Tweety<00:02:32.430> or

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
could have it working with Tweety or

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.339 
could have it working with Tweety or
Twitter<00:02:32.849> as<00:02:33.060> well<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:34.110> synchronization

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
Twitter as well and the synchronization

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.800 
Twitter as well and the synchronization
goes<00:02:35.040> through<00:02:35.220> Dropbox<00:02:35.459> it's<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.510> really<00:02:36.690> good

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
goes through Dropbox it's a really good

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.910 
goes through Dropbox it's a really good
application<00:02:37.349> I<00:02:37.440> think<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.739> well<00:02:37.890> worth

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
application I think it's well worth

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.280 
application I think it's well worth
having<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:39.209> does<00:02:39.360> offer<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.660> bit<00:02:39.870> more<00:02:40.049> than

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
having and it does offer a bit more than

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.920 
having and it does offer a bit more than
the<00:02:40.819> settings<00:02:41.819> that<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.180> have<00:02:42.390> within<00:02:42.629> the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
the settings that you have within the

system settings of iOS keyboard and my

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.930 
system settings of iOS keyboard and my
thing<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.319> whether<00:02:46.560> get<00:02:46.769> in<00:02:46.950> mainly<00:02:47.790> because

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
thing is whether get in mainly because

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.210

working on your main machine too and

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.140 
working on your main machine too and
there's<00:02:55.799> a<00:02:55.890> lots<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.190> neat<00:02:56.489> little<00:02:56.640> trick<00:02:56.880> you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
there's a lots of neat little trick you

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.809 
there's a lots of neat little trick you
can<00:02:57.299> do<00:02:57.510> as<00:02:57.630> well<00:02:57.780> where<00:02:58.079> you<00:02:58.519> for<00:02:59.519> instance

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
can do as well where you for instance

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.759 
can do as well where you for instance
might<00:03:00.150> want<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.480> have<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.170> the

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
might want to have it so that the

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.830 
might want to have it so that the
insertion<00:03:02.459> point<00:03:02.670> that's<00:03:03.480> where<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.780> can

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
insertion point that's where you can

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.280 
insertion point that's where you can
start<00:03:03.959> typing<00:03:04.560> within<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.819> text<00:03:06.569> but<00:03:07.170> it's

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
start typing within the text but it's

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.600 
start typing within the text but it's
really<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.590> best<00:03:07.620> way<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.890> do<00:03:08.130> this<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.489> to

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
really the best way to do this is to

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.860 
really the best way to do this is to
actually<00:03:08.700> show<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.360> let's<00:03:09.540> go<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.720> an

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
actually show you so let's go to an

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.600 
actually show you so let's go to an
application<00:03:09.989> where<00:03:10.620> we<00:03:11.099> can<00:03:11.280> actually<00:03:11.400> use

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
application where we can actually use

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.120 
application where we can actually use
this<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.269> let's<00:03:12.989> go<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.230> simple<00:03:13.829> notes<00:03:13.980> I'm

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
this so let's go to simple notes I'm

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.370 
this so let's go to simple notes I'm
fairly<00:03:14.310> sure<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.630> text<00:03:15.630> expander<00:03:15.900> will<00:03:16.170> work

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
fairly sure that text expander will work

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.740 
fairly sure that text expander will work
within<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.920> let's<00:03:17.310> press<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.359> start<00:03:18.660> a

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
within that let's press that so start a

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.360 
within that let's press that so start a
new<00:03:18.930> one

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
new one
