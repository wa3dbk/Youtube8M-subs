00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.220
 welcome to the record and garci channel 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.770
 sand and I extract a trick of how come out 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.599
 of the map of die rise in zombies and what 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.190
 first thing we have to do is go 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.050
 to the elevator where it takes us to 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.140
 electricity which comes out in the first 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.030
 room we have to have at least 750 money 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.830
 then we give a few hops here and 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.420
 it takes us down and we go to the 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.879
 electricity room 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.339
 there we turn on the electricity between 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.290
 the elevators will start to work 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.050
 we will have to place on the frame of the 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.910
 elevator in a way where when 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.070
 is not the elevator puts you press to 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.289
 get on or jump, but of course when 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.579
 is in it does not work for you then 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.530
 get on top of everything we have to 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.780
 to do is that the elevator gives us a 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.180
 push as you are going to see now more 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.890
 go ahead then if we place here 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.720
 when you are not tensor will let us go up 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.369
 as you have seen it has come out click to 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.350
 jump but it does not leave us at all 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.479
 so what we have to do as 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.820
 I said is that the elevator does not push 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.860
 It can be done in any plant 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.780
 there are rooms like this one can not 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.640
 do in the last then how is 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.340
 Now I start to give him the whole time 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.260
 to jump and I'm staying in what is 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.300
 out of the map 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.950
 that we do not die out here the map 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.570
 we have to go jumping because there are 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.010
 a barrier of death in which yes 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.410
 we are still 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.720
 more than a second more than two we're going to 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.420
 die although there are parts in which this 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.190
 do not pass because as you are going to see now I'm going 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.290
 to throw down and we fall on 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.990
 a room where he does not have 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.060
 loophole but good at the end of the 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.430
 video I check what 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.320
 that I could sit still and not pass 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.180
 nothing and as you can see here, you see all the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.430
 map all the elevators with all the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.439
 advantages so nothing this has been all 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.090
 if you liked giving lecce favorites 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.950
