00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
spawning at the time I think they might

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.319 
spawning at the time I think they might
have<00:02:54.799> been<00:02:54.889> at<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.400> big<00:02:55.549> rocks<00:02:55.819> spawn<00:02:56.060> right

usually I don't get those that are like
that<00:03:02.810> where<00:03:02.959> he's<00:03:03.319> kind<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.560> far<00:03:03.769> away<00:03:04.000> so<00:03:05.000> now

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
that where he's kind of far away so now

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.920 
that where he's kind of far away so now
I<00:03:05.150> just<00:03:05.239> run<00:03:05.540> around<00:03:05.659> in<00:03:05.810> my<00:03:05.930> pistol<00:03:06.409> and<00:03:07.930> I'm

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
I just run around in my pistol and I'm

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.659 
I just run around in my pistol and I'm
at<00:03:09.109> like<00:03:09.230> 113<00:03:09.889> points<00:03:10.040> I'm<00:03:10.280> like<00:03:10.400> if<00:03:10.459> I<00:03:10.519> could

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
at like 113 points I'm like if I could

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.220 
at like 113 points I'm like if I could
drop<00:03:10.790> my<00:03:10.939> crews<00:03:11.180> at<00:03:11.329> this<00:03:11.450> many<00:03:11.659> points<00:03:12.079> I<00:03:12.169> can

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
drop my crews at this many points I can

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.740 
drop my crews at this many points I can
get<00:03:12.409> so<00:03:12.590> many<00:03:12.680> kills<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.060> decided<00:03:14.510> that<00:03:14.629> I

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
get so many kills so I decided that I

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.490 
get so many kills so I decided that I
just<00:03:14.989> keep<00:03:15.109> going

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
just keep going

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.839

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
rushing in trying to make sure I get

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.759 
rushing in trying to make sure I get
this<00:03:17.239> objective<00:03:17.750> so<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:18.139> don't<00:03:18.319> know<00:03:18.379> why<00:03:18.560> that

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
this objective so I don't know why that

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.110 
this objective so I don't know why that
guy<00:03:18.950> is<00:03:19.010> just<00:03:19.129> sitting<00:03:19.430> in<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:19.609> corner<00:03:19.819> he<00:03:20.030> has

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
guy is just sitting in the corner he has

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.629 
guy is just sitting in the corner he has
too<00:03:20.269> low<00:03:20.450> sensitivity<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:21.310> shot<00:03:22.310> this<00:03:22.430> guy

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
too low sensitivity I shot this guy

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.189 
too low sensitivity I shot this guy
using<00:03:22.909> the<00:03:22.969> flag<00:03:23.209> as<00:03:23.419> cover<00:03:23.659> because<00:03:23.989> that's

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
using the flag as cover because that's

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.930 
using the flag as cover because that's
how<00:03:24.319> I<00:03:24.349> roll<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.949> right<00:03:25.370> here<00:03:25.519> I<00:03:25.579> decide<00:03:25.819> I'm

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
how I roll and right here I decide I'm

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.550 
how I roll and right here I decide I'm
just<00:03:25.970> gonna<00:03:26.269> run<00:03:26.659> back<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.079> call<00:03:27.229> this<00:03:27.379> thing

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
just gonna run back and call this thing

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.020 
just gonna run back and call this thing
in<00:03:27.739> because<00:03:28.069> I<00:03:28.159> think<00:03:28.220> they<00:03:28.459> were<00:03:28.519> at<00:03:28.639> the<00:03:28.790> big

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
in because I think they were at the big

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.520 
in because I think they were at the big
rock<00:03:29.209> spawn<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.810> was<00:03:29.959> just<00:03:29.989> gonna<00:03:30.139> call<00:03:30.379> this

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
rock spawn so I was just gonna call this

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.229 
rock spawn so I was just gonna call this
thing<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:30.889> and<00:03:31.099> they're<00:03:31.549> spread<00:03:31.909> out<00:03:32.030> all<00:03:32.209> over

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
thing in and they're spread out all over

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.460 
thing in and they're spread out all over
the<00:03:32.510> map<00:03:32.629> so<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.840> put<00:03:32.989> it<00:03:33.079> right<00:03:33.109> in<00:03:33.319> the<00:03:33.379> middle

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
the map so I put it right in the middle

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.949 
the map so I put it right in the middle
and<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.400> picked<00:03:34.609> up<00:03:34.699> I<00:03:34.819> think<00:03:35.030> six<00:03:35.389> something

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
and I picked up I think six something

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.080 
and I picked up I think six something
like<00:03:36.139> that<00:03:36.349> and<00:03:36.859> I<00:03:37.489> ended<00:03:37.729> up<00:03:37.790> right<00:03:37.970> at

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
like that and I ended up right at

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.819 
like that and I ended up right at
artillery<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:38.810> guess<00:03:39.260> where<00:03:39.349> they<00:03:39.470> spawned

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
artillery and guess where they spawned

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.589 
artillery and guess where they spawned
right<00:03:40.159> over<00:03:40.430> here<00:03:40.549> to<00:03:40.639> my<00:03:40.729> right<00:03:40.760> this<00:03:41.449> is

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
right over here to my right this is

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.149 
right over here to my right this is
probably<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.019> best<00:03:42.139> spawn<00:03:42.409> trapping<00:03:42.709> Kunar

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
probably the best spawn trapping Kunar

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.789 
probably the best spawn trapping Kunar
one<00:03:43.280> of<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.430> best<00:03:43.579> in<00:03:43.669> the<00:03:43.760> game<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.379> I<00:03:45.379> mean

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
one of the best in the game and I mean

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.849 
one of the best in the game and I mean
from<00:03:45.979> here<00:03:46.040> on<00:03:46.340> out<00:03:46.900> it's<00:03:47.900> just<00:03:47.989> destruction<00:03:48.530> I

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
from here on out it's just destruction I

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.159 
from here on out it's just destruction I
mean<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:49.849> just<00:03:49.879> rained<00:03:50.329> out<00:03:50.479> support<00:03:50.870> actions

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
mean I just rained out support actions

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:52.629 
mean I just rained out support actions
on<00:03:51.290> that<00:03:51.409> spawn<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:51.739> mean<00:03:52.040> I'm<00:03:52.159> not<00:03:52.280> saying<00:03:52.549> that

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
on that spawn I mean I'm not saying that

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.280 
on that spawn I mean I'm not saying that
that<00:03:52.879> requires<00:03:53.239> any<00:03:53.449> sort<00:03:53.689> of<00:03:53.750> skill<00:03:54.049> because

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
that requires any sort of skill because

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.920 
that requires any sort of skill because
it<00:03:54.409> doesn't<00:03:54.769> but<00:03:55.579> to<00:03:55.759> me<00:03:55.939> this<00:03:56.329> is<00:03:56.509> a<00:03:56.540> special

it doesn't but to me this is a special

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.539 
it doesn't but to me this is a special
