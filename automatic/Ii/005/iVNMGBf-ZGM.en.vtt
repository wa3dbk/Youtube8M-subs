00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
possible way this episode even has a

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.490 
possible way this episode even has a
subtle<00:01:29.909> reference<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.420> Hugh<00:01:30.689> Hefner<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.380> all

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
subtle reference to Hugh Hefner of all

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920 
subtle reference to Hugh Hefner of all
things<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:32.369> any<00:01:32.670> kid<00:01:33.000> would<00:01:33.150> ever<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.689> that

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
things like any kid would ever get that

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.170 
things like any kid would ever get that
also<00:01:34.770> cindy<00:01:35.130> has<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> song<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.729> episode

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
also cindy has a song in this episode

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.840 
also cindy has a song in this episode
quite<00:01:36.720> inexplicably<00:01:37.590> yeah<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.460> only<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
quite inexplicably yeah it's only the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.060 
quite inexplicably yeah it's only the
one<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.420> done<00:01:39.689> all<00:01:39.869> 50<00:01:40.320> style<00:01:40.680> although

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
one and it's done all 50 style although

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.350 
one and it's done all 50 style although
I<00:01:41.100> guess<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.549> makes<00:01:41.759> sense<00:01:41.850> considering

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
I guess that makes sense considering

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.300 
I guess that makes sense considering
they're<00:01:42.630> at<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> candy<00:01:43.170> bar<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.619> she<00:01:44.070> sings

they're at the candy bar and she sings

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.100 
they're at the candy bar and she sings
about<00:01:44.640> how<00:01:44.820> she<00:01:44.880> wants<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.299> man<00:01:45.509> who<00:01:45.540> she<00:01:45.930> can

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
about how she wants a man who she can

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.260 
about how she wants a man who she can
