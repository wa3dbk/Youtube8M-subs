shedding<00:01:02.100> like<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:03.030> would<00:01:03.420> sweep<00:01:03.719> my<00:01:03.870> bathroom

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
shedding like I would sweep my bathroom

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.570 
shedding like I would sweep my bathroom
floor<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.920> could<00:01:05.100> probably<00:01:05.309> make

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
floor and you could probably make

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.380 
floor and you could probably make
another<00:01:05.939> weave<00:01:06.560> with<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:08.610> amount<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.090> hair

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
another weave with the amount of hair

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.109 
another weave with the amount of hair
but<00:01:09.990> now<00:01:10.229> i<00:01:10.710> don't<00:01:11.369> know<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.850> cuz<00:01:12.030> i

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
but now i don't know if it's cuz i

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.880 
but now i don't know if it's cuz i
watched<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.780> or<00:01:14.150> whatever<00:01:15.259> but<00:01:16.259> now<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.740> like

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
watched it or whatever but now it's like

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.020 
watched it or whatever but now it's like
a<00:01:16.950> limited<00:01:17.850> amount<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.270> shedding<00:01:18.600> which<00:01:18.930> I

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
a limited amount of shedding which I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.609 
a limited amount of shedding which I
guess<00:01:21.030> I'm<00:01:21.210> real<00:01:21.420> critical<00:01:21.930> when<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.259> comes<00:01:22.530> to

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
guess I'm real critical when it comes to

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.620 
guess I'm real critical when it comes to
shedding<00:01:22.890> ball<00:01:23.220> hair<00:01:23.549> sheds<00:01:23.909> your<00:01:24.180> real<00:01:24.390> hair

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
shedding ball hair sheds your real hair
