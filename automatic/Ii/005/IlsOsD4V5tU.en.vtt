00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 what you see in that drawing holes 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.510
 faces stones 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.639
 perhaps you have the impression of seeing a 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.590
 face in the drawing as well as thousands of 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.179
 people in the 1970s turned their faces 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.529
 surface of Mars when the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.529
 released photos of this planet 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.080
 if you look at the sky when you are 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.220
 full of clouds 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.460
 It will not be long until you arrive. 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.440
 dragons monsters and our silhouettes 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.390
 brain has an incredible ability to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.290
 identify patterns of relationships between 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.969
 things 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.620
 This is such a basic capability. 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.090
 of the brain that is capable of 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.219
 recognize patterns until 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.140
 there are true patterns or relationships 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.090
 taking pictures of mountains on Mars 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.440
 clouds appear in the sky to faces 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.030
 they are monsters 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.800
 we also use this ability to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.840
 understand how the world works 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.610
 our ancestors will need to search for 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.500
 irregularities in the environment and 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.030
 between events such as the relationship between 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.289
 smell of a food and its suitability 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.730
 to eat 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.320
 this allowed us to have greater control 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.900
 on the environment and increase our 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.580
 ability to survive and reproduce 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.500
 the same capacity that has helped our 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.510
 ancestors aware of environmental standards 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.430
 and surviving can also lead us to 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.810
 misperceptions of the environment 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.250
 because the human brain was 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.770
 selected for its ability to 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.479
 to hit most of the time and not 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.580
 ability to always hit 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.890
 living this life getting predators 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.659
 fast and strong it is better to confuse a 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.000
 bush with the lion of what's in front 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.920
 of a lion and find that in a bush for 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.259
 that the tendency of the brain is to commit 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.000
 more false positive type errors 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.710
 a false positive occurs when we find 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.930
 We found something but actually did not 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.030
 find you think you have found a 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.049
 but it was really just a liana in the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.970
 middle of the forest 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.100
 errors like this do not usually result in 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.590
 loss as sipam will bite you 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.079
 so the logic here is that if it's to err 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.000
 that is by excess and not for lack of 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.860
 precaution so that many times 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.840
 we perceive more things of the environment of the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.189
 that there are in fact this is especially 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.340
 true in dimly lit environments 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.079
 and when we are tired and sleepy 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.939
 which by an incredible coincidence are 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.290
 exactly the conditions under which the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.729
 more people report than live 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.890
 supernatural experiences or 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.620
 interplanetary 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.480
 at the same time some psychologists propose 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.550
 which has a strong propensity to 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.569
 identify entities and intentions in the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.280
 environment 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.319
 this protection is so strong that some 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.060
 studies done people identify 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.790
 intention even objects and beings 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.780
 inanimate as small squares in 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.520
 some people 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.140
 these propensities are so strong that they 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.580
 often experience what we call 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.950
 of hallucination 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.600
 they genuinely perceive something that does not 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.880
 corresponds to an external object in the 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.069
 environment or they really have 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.870
 psychological experience of hearing 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.910
 feel something of the environment in question 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.220
 although nothing in this environment is 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.440
 clearly the source of this experience 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.480
 hallucination is stigmatized in the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.550
 our culture although the truth is that the 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.320
 majority of people have lived or will 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.820
 experience at least once some 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.470
 hallucination form 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.570
 even if they do not have any disease 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.160
 mental capacity is the ability to recognize 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.720
 of human brain patterns that 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.090
 computer scientists and engineers 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.620
 interested in artificial intelligence 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.900
 have tried for many years to understand 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.100
 reproduce if we can do this 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.900
 we can build machines 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.910
 intelligent learners perform 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.709
 several extremely useful tasks 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.030
 Even so we are still far from 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.709
 able to build 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.410
 artificial intelligence capable of 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.940
 accomplish the feats of the human brain 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.500
 our evolutionary past this ability 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.570
 to extrapolate reality to 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.880
 recognize patterns likely to 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.410
 helped a lot but nowadays she also 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.690
 can lead to errors
