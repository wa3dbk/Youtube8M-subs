generator<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.410> then<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.710> can<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:17.070> play

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
generator and then you can just play

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.770 
generator and then you can just play
around<00:02:17.490> with<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.880> colors<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.240> do<00:02:18.540> whatever

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
around with the colors and do whatever

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:27.460 
around with the colors and do whatever
you<00:02:19.560> want<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:22.260> now<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.890> looks<00:02:23.220> like<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:24.830> and

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
you want so now it looks like this and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.920 
you want so now it looks like this and
the<00:02:28.470> only<00:02:28.770> other<00:02:28.950> step<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.820> making<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.390> intro

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
the only other step in making this intro

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.800 
the only other step in making this intro
is<00:02:31.200> just<00:02:32.130> putting<00:02:32.460> text<00:02:33.000> in<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.300> middle<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.690> I

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
is just putting text in the middle and I

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.550 
is just putting text in the middle and I
think<00:02:34.050> that's<00:02:34.230> pretty<00:02:35.150> explanatory<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.930> that

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
think that's pretty explanatory so that

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.870 
think that's pretty explanatory so that
is<00:02:37.800> how<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.010> make<00:02:38.190> my<00:02:38.400> job<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:39.950> i<00:02:40.950> thought<00:02:41.820> i

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
is how you make my job so i thought i

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.270 
is how you make my job so i thought i
would<00:02:41.970> also<00:02:42.270> show<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.630> guys<00:02:42.900> how<00:02:42.960> I<00:02:43.680> made<00:02:44.100> a

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
would also show you guys how I made a

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.090 
would also show you guys how I made a
pole<00:02:44.550> right<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:45.090> my<00:02:46.080> winter<00:02:46.440> morning<00:02:46.770> routine

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
pole right in my winter morning routine

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.820 
pole right in my winter morning routine
with<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.580> blurred<00:02:47.820> background<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:49.260> I'm<00:02:49.590> just

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
with the blurred background so I'm just

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.470 
with the blurred background so I'm just
going<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.010> start<00:02:50.250> off<00:02:50.340> by<00:02:50.490> taking<00:02:50.790> just<00:02:51.090> a

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
going to start off by taking just a

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.830 
going to start off by taking just a
random<00:02:51.870> clip<00:02:56.000> so<00:02:57.000> once<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.300> have<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.450> clip

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
on it and you're under video then you

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.030 
on it and you're under video then you
want<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.580> switch<00:03:27.090> style<00:03:27.570> instead<00:03:28.320> of<00:03:28.470> classics

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
want to switch style instead of classics

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.660 
want to switch style instead of classics
switch<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.660> instant<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.370> there's<00:03:32.370> your

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
switch it to instant and there's your

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.729 
switch it to instant and there's your
pull<00:03:32.910> right<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.300> then<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:34.080> can<00:03:34.260> move<00:03:34.500> it

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
pull right and then you can move it

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.860 
pull right and then you can move it
around<00:03:34.890> so<00:03:35.700> let's<00:03:35.850> say<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.060> want<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.390> right<00:03:36.510> here

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
around so let's say I want it right here

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.340 
around so let's say I want it right here
and<00:03:37.080> then<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.190> can<00:03:38.430> put<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.940> blurry

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
and then you can put the blurry

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
and then you can put the blurry
blurriness<00:03:40.350> up<00:03:41.160> or<00:03:41.700> down<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:43.019> think<00:03:43.920> let's<00:03:44.070> go

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
blurriness up or down I think let's go

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.120 
blurriness up or down I think let's go
just<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.790> little<00:03:44.820> blurriness<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:46.010> you<00:03:47.010> can

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
just a little blurriness and you can

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.460 
just a little blurriness and you can
make<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.370> bigger<00:03:47.700> or<00:03:47.880> smart<00:03:48.330> so<00:03:49.019> that's<00:03:49.230> how<00:03:49.440> I

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
make it bigger or smart so that's how I

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.850 
make it bigger or smart so that's how I
got<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.850> parade<00:03:51.420> blurring<00:03:52.019> background

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
got the parade blurring background

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.090 
got the parade blurring background
effect<00:03:53.459> on<00:03:53.730> my<00:03:53.970> clip<00:03:54.470> so<00:03:55.470> last<00:03:55.680> thing<00:03:55.890> I

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
effect on my clip so last thing I

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.890 
effect on my clip so last thing I
thought<00:03:56.489> I'd<00:03:56.640> show<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.820> guys<00:03:57.030> how<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.420> turn

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
thought I'd show you guys how to turn

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.199 
thought I'd show you guys how to turn
your<00:03:58.170> saturation<00:03:59.010> up<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.519> make<00:03:59.790> it<00:03:59.820> brighter

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
your saturation up and make it brighter

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.530 
your saturation up and make it brighter
or<00:04:00.630> make<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.380> faded<00:04:01.860> so<00:04:02.640> I'm<00:04:02.940> just<00:04:03.120> going<00:04:03.330> to

or make it faded so I'm just going to

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.870 
or make it faded so I'm just going to
take<00:04:03.750> another<00:04:04.080> random<00:04:04.590> clip

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.580 

and<00:04:09.140> just<00:04:10.140> drag<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.560> in<00:04:11.480> okay<00:04:12.480> so<00:04:13.200> once<00:04:13.380> you

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
and just drag it in okay so once you

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.100 
and just drag it in okay so once you
have<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.860> clip<00:04:14.400> in<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:15.600> want<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.930> go<00:04:16.049> to

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
have that clip in you want to go to

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.699 
have that clip in you want to go to

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
so make sure under saturation and watch

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.290 
so make sure under saturation and watch
the<00:04:34.440> difference<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.220> colors<00:04:35.610> once<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.240> do

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
the difference of the colors once I do

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.560 
the difference of the colors once I do
this<00:04:36.830> so<00:04:37.830> now<00:04:38.010> you<00:04:38.070> can<00:04:38.340> see<00:04:38.490> it's<00:04:38.670> much<00:04:39.180> much

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
this so now you can see it's much much

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.740 
this so now you can see it's much much
much<00:04:39.840> brighter<00:04:40.170> and<00:04:40.590> you<00:04:41.460> can<00:04:41.670> kind<00:04:42.540> of<00:04:42.690> see

much brighter and you can kind of see

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.340
