00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
so I did this video a couple weeks back

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.939 
so I did this video a couple weeks back
about<00:00:11.480> how<00:00:11.990> to<00:00:12.049> make<00:00:12.799> a<00:00:12.830> DI<00:00:13.219> to<00:00:13.959> wire<00:00:14.959> routing

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
about how to make a DI to wire routing

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.099 
about how to make a DI to wire routing
tool<00:00:16.309> through<00:00:16.730> frames<00:00:17.029> and<00:00:17.390> bars<00:00:17.570> and<00:00:17.720> such

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
tool through frames and bars and such

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.240 
tool through frames and bars and such
and<00:00:18.440> anyway<00:00:19.310> I<00:00:19.340> wanted<00:00:19.789> to<00:00:19.880> make<00:00:20.119> a<00:00:20.150> list<00:00:20.510> of

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
and anyway I wanted to make a list of

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.170 
and anyway I wanted to make a list of
ten<00:00:22.250> different<00:00:23.290> other<00:00:24.290> little<00:00:24.820> helpful<00:00:25.820> tools

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
ten different other little helpful tools

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.410 
ten different other little helpful tools
you<00:00:26.420> can<00:00:26.600> make<00:00:26.630> out<00:00:26.900> of<00:00:27.050> just<00:00:27.200> random<00:00:27.650> part<00:00:27.920> so

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
you can make out of just random part so

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.689 
you can make out of just random part so
number<00:00:29.420> one<00:00:29.660> we<00:00:30.650> got<00:00:30.860> the<00:00:31.629> sharpened

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
number one we got the sharpened

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.279 
number one we got the sharpened
quick-release<00:00:34.699> skewer<00:00:35.079> basically<00:00:36.079> it's<00:00:36.199> just

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
quick-release skewer basically it's just

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.660 
quick-release skewer basically it's just
a<00:00:36.699> quick<00:00:37.699> early<00:00:37.850> skewer<00:00:38.359> and<00:00:38.629> you<00:00:38.719> can<00:00:39.670> grind

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
a quick early skewer and you can grind

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.220 
a quick early skewer and you can grind
the<00:00:40.909> tips<00:00:41.149> there<00:00:41.449> are<00:00:41.539> two<00:00:41.690> different<00:00:42.079> ways

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
the tips there are two different ways

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.410 
the tips there are two different ways
for<00:00:42.769> you<00:00:43.309> know<00:00:43.429> kind<00:00:43.640> of<00:00:43.699> like<00:00:43.789> an<00:00:43.940> easy<00:00:44.149> out

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
for you know kind of like an easy out

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.849 
for you know kind of like an easy out
and<00:00:44.600> then<00:00:44.690> a<00:00:44.719> reverse<00:00:44.899> easy<00:00:45.379> out<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:45.739> these

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:45.859 
and then a reverse easy out and these

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.599 
and then a reverse easy out and these
are<00:00:45.979> basically<00:00:46.159> used<00:00:46.670> to<00:00:48.280> thread<00:00:49.280> spoke

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
are basically used to thread spoke

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.729 
are basically used to thread spoke
nipples<00:00:49.999> into<00:00:50.329> a<00:00:50.359> bike<00:00:51.050> rim<00:00:51.379> when<00:00:51.589> you're

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
nipples into a bike rim when you're

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.979 
nipples into a bike rim when you're
trying<00:00:52.609> to<00:00:52.729> get<00:00:52.850> one<00:00:52.909> built<00:00:53.300> up<00:00:53.510> quickly

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
trying to get one built up quickly

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.719 
trying to get one built up quickly
basically<00:00:54.319> to<00:00:54.589> make<00:00:54.710> this<00:00:54.889> tool<00:00:55.129> you<00:00:55.370> remove

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
basically to make this tool you remove

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.869 
basically to make this tool you remove
the<00:00:56.170> quick-release<00:00:57.170> lever<00:00:57.589> mechanism<00:00:58.129> and

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
the quick-release lever mechanism and

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.879 
the quick-release lever mechanism and
you're<00:00:59.269> left<00:00:59.449> with<00:00:59.659> a<00:00:59.899> little<00:01:00.379> hold<00:01:00.589> there

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:00.889 
you're left with a little hold there

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:03.610 
you're left with a little hold there
it's<00:01:01.039> kind<00:01:01.280> of<00:01:01.339> handy<00:01:01.639> makes<00:01:02.059> it<00:01:02.269> easy<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.620> hang

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
it's kind of handy makes it easy to hang

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.460 
it's kind of handy makes it easy to hang
it<00:01:03.769> up<00:01:03.889> or<00:01:04.129> whatever<00:01:04.280> when<00:01:04.729> your<00:01:05.290> store<00:01:06.290> it

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
the edge of a grinding wheel and you'll

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.550 
the edge of a grinding wheel and you'll
just<00:01:13.399> you<00:01:13.909> know<00:01:14.030> pull<00:01:14.479> back<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.079> turn<00:01:15.320> either

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
just you know pull back and turn either

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.459 
just you know pull back and turn either
clockwise<00:01:16.490> or<00:01:16.759> counterclockwise<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:18.170> get<00:01:18.350> the

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
clockwise or counterclockwise to get the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.950 
clockwise or counterclockwise to get the
right<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:20.210> know<00:01:20.299> something<00:01:20.539> you<00:01:20.600> gotta<00:01:20.719> kind

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
right you know something you gotta kind

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.410 
right you know something you gotta kind
of<00:01:20.990> experiment<00:01:21.649> with<00:01:21.740> but<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.490> know<00:01:22.609> it's<00:01:22.759> as

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
of experiment with but you know it's as

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.029 
of experiment with but you know it's as
you're<00:01:23.630> tightening<00:01:23.930> a<00:01:24.140> nipple<00:01:24.409> on<00:01:24.530> like<00:01:24.859> this

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
you're tightening a nipple on like this

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.529 
you're tightening a nipple on like this
it<00:01:25.250> actually<00:01:25.369> gets<00:01:25.700> tighter<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.299> nipple

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
it actually gets tighter to the nipple

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.630 
it actually gets tighter to the nipple
until<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.140> spoke<00:01:27.409> bottoms<00:01:27.920> out<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:28.130> actually

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
until the spoke bottoms out and actually

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.109 
until the spoke bottoms out and actually
ejects<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.509> tool<00:01:30.200> there<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.039> you<00:01:31.729> know<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:31.880> tool

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
ejects the tool there so you know a tool

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.590 
ejects the tool there so you know a tool
number<00:01:32.450> two<00:01:33.100> it's<00:01:34.100> on<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.280> similar<00:01:34.729> note<00:01:34.759> to<00:01:35.450> the

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
number two it's on a similar note to the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.419 
number two it's on a similar note to the
ground<00:01:36.020> down<00:01:38.079> standard<00:01:39.079> screwdriver<00:01:39.429> tip

once you get your wheel built you want
to<00:01:46.270> tighten<00:01:47.270> them<00:01:47.390> all<00:01:47.509> into<00:01:47.719> a<00:01:47.929> certain<00:01:48.500> depth

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
to tighten them all into a certain depth

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.209 
to tighten them all into a certain depth
that<00:01:49.520> is<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.119> same<00:01:50.390> there<00:01:50.659> it's<00:01:50.840> super<00:01:51.259> quick
