00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
you can see them on the map screen it's

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.709 
you can see them on the map screen it's
actually<00:00:11.429> pretty<00:00:11.790> straightforward<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.450> do

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
actually pretty straightforward to do

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.589 
actually pretty straightforward to do
first<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.740> need<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.040> save<00:00:14.280> your<00:00:14.490> tracks<00:00:15.059> once

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
first you need to save your tracks once

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.450 
first you need to save your tracks once
they're<00:00:15.809> saved<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.470> best<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.770> set<00:00:17.099> them<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.430> a

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
they're saved it's best to set them to a

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.530 
they're saved it's best to set them to a
different<00:00:17.640> color<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.119> I'm<00:00:18.210> going<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.360> just

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.540 
different color and I'm going to just

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.570 
different color and I'm going to just
show<00:00:18.689> you<00:00:18.750> how<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.960> do<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.199> really<00:00:19.380> quick<00:00:19.710> so

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
show you how to do that really quick so

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.900 
show you how to do that really quick so
let's<00:00:20.730> go<00:00:20.850> into<00:00:20.970> our<00:00:21.150> main<00:00:21.330> menu<00:00:22.789> we're<00:00:23.789> going

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
let's go into our main menu we're going

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.950 
let's go into our main menu we're going
to<00:00:23.970> look<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.269> track<00:00:24.689> manager<00:00:26.510> once<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.720> track

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
to look for track manager once in track

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.439 
to look for track manager once in track
manager<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:29.220> could<00:00:29.400> save<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.880> track<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.330> I've

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
manager we could save a track but I've

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.430 
manager we could save a track but I've
already<00:00:30.750> pre<00:00:31.019> saved<00:00:31.439> them<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.830> split<00:00:32.250> them<00:00:32.369> up

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
already pre saved them and split them up

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.689 
already pre saved them and split them up
so<00:00:34.440> let's<00:00:34.589> just<00:00:34.739> take<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.949> look<00:00:35.250> at<00:00:35.400> the<00:00:35.519> one<00:00:35.670> I

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
so let's just take a look at the one I

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.630 
so let's just take a look at the one I
called<00:00:36.000> mouth<00:00:36.330> hit<00:00:36.720> enter<00:00:37.280> we<00:00:38.280> could<00:00:38.460> change

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
called mouth hit enter we could change

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.340 
called mouth hit enter we could change
this<00:00:38.820> color<00:00:39.089> just<00:00:39.330> so<00:00:39.479> it<00:00:39.600> stands<00:00:39.900> apart<00:00:40.260> from

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
this color just so it stands apart from

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.530 
this color just so it stands apart from
the<00:00:40.559> other<00:00:40.830> tracks<00:00:42.019> set<00:00:43.019> that<00:00:43.229> to<00:00:43.409> pink<00:00:44.059> now<00:00:45.059> if

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
the other tracks set that to pink now if

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.479 
the other tracks set that to pink now if
you<00:00:45.750> want<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.049> view<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.440> tracks<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:47.040> the<00:00:47.280> map

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
you want to view the tracks on the map

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.549 
you want to view the tracks on the map
screen<00:00:47.850> what<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.239> need<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> do<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.140> down<00:00:49.290> to

you want to see on the map so all these

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.030 
you want to see on the map so all these
tracks<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> different<00:01:07.500> color<00:01:07.680> now<00:01:07.950> I'm

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
going to show you them on the map okay

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.110 
going to show you them on the map okay
so<00:01:14.790> let's<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.390> scroll<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.140> here<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:17.790> tracks

so let's just scroll up here so tracks

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.290 
so let's just scroll up here so tracks
are<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> little<00:01:18.510> further<00:01:18.780> north<00:01:19.430> and<00:01:20.430> you'll

happy face they're made with tracks and
you<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.250> see<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.880> view<00:01:33.000> multiple<00:01:33.510> tracks

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
you can see you can view multiple tracks

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.260 
you can see you can view multiple tracks
on<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> device<00:01:34.710> at<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> time<00:01:35.040> one<00:01:35.850> thing<00:01:36.090> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
on the device at a time one thing to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.210 
on the device at a time one thing to
keep<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.630> mind<00:01:36.690> though<00:01:37.260> if<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.830> a<00:01:37.860> Curt

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
keep in mind though if you have a Curt

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.399 
keep in mind though if you have a Curt

or an active track or a current track

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.560 
or an active track or a current track
and<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.740> don't<00:01:41.010> clear<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.390> in

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
and you don't clear that and it's in

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.380 
and you don't clear that and it's in
this<00:01:42.720> area<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.590> may<00:01:44.100> sit<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.640> top<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.030> those

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
this area it may sit on top of those

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.840 
this area it may sit on top of those
individual<00:01:46.140> tracks<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.740> hide<00:01:46.979> them<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.790> you

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
individual tracks and hide them so you

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.399 
individual tracks and hide them so you
can't<00:01:48.210> see<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.600> they're<00:01:48.780> individually

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
can't see that they're individually

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.740 
can't see that they're individually
