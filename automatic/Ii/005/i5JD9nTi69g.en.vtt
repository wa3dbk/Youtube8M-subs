00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
think it's um a well-made mini album so

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.370 
think it's um a well-made mini album so
it<00:01:38.280> tends<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> go<00:01:39.600> back<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.079> all

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.600 
again the cut aparts I inked only the
decorative<00:03:53.440> paper<00:03:53.709> I<00:03:53.890> didn't<00:03:54.160> think<00:03:54.280> any<00:03:54.489> of

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
decorative paper I didn't think any of

the<00:03:54.880> craft<00:03:55.510> cardstock<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:57.700> then<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:57.940> just

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
the craft cardstock so and then you just

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.380 
the craft cardstock so and then you just
matte<00:03:58.360> all<00:03:58.660> your<00:03:59.459> these<00:04:00.459> are<00:04:00.519> tags<00:04:00.880> I<00:04:01.209> guess

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
matte all your these are tags I guess

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.090 
matte all your these are tags I guess
you<00:04:01.510> would<00:04:01.630> call<00:04:01.660> them<00:04:01.840> really<00:04:02.350> big<00:04:02.530> tags<00:04:02.860> so

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
you would call them really big tags so

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.710 
you would call them really big tags so
you<00:04:03.130> can<00:04:03.310> definitely<00:04:03.489> fit<00:04:03.820> big<00:04:04.090> pictures<00:04:04.570> in
