00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210 

I<00:00:02.570> think<00:00:03.570> it<00:00:03.659> does<00:00:03.810> changes<00:00:04.290> perspective<00:00:04.890> for

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
I think it does changes perspective for

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.400 
I think it does changes perspective for
much<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.120> season<00:00:06.420> but<00:00:06.779> it's<00:00:06.960> like<00:00:07.109> just

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
much of the season but it's like just

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.080 
much of the season but it's like just
like<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.680> way<00:00:07.799> you<00:00:07.859> know<00:00:08.059> human<00:00:09.059> beings

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
like the way you know human beings

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.820 
like the way you know human beings
develop<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.019> grow<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.230> mean<00:00:10.469> that's<00:00:10.620> one<00:00:10.740> of

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
develop and grow I mean that's one of

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.780 
develop and grow I mean that's one of
the<00:00:10.889> great<00:00:11.010> things<00:00:11.190> about<00:00:11.250> dr.<00:00:11.639> as<00:00:11.759> a

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
the great things about dr. as a

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.440 
the great things about dr. as a
character

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
character

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.360 
character
it<00:00:12.840> obviously<00:00:13.139> changes<00:00:13.920> with<00:00:14.070> each

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
it obviously changes with each

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.980 
it obviously changes with each
regeneration<00:00:15.299> but<00:00:15.540> within<00:00:15.719> that

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
regeneration but within that

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.019 
regeneration but within that
regeneration<00:00:16.529> he<00:00:17.070> changes<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.609> grows<00:00:17.820> as

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
regeneration he changes and grows as

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.269 
regeneration he changes and grows as
well<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.080> think<00:00:19.380> last<00:00:19.650> year<00:00:19.949> he<00:00:20.130> was

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
well so I think last year he was

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.710 
well so I think last year he was
probably<00:00:20.490> still<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.090> think<00:00:21.359> when<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.539> do

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
probably still I think when you do

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.090 
probably still I think when you do
regenerate<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.439> probably<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.859> struggle

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
regenerate you probably have to struggle

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.429 
regenerate you probably have to struggle
to<00:00:23.250> find<00:00:23.369> out<00:00:23.670> who<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.000> are<00:00:24.210> it's<00:00:24.930> as<00:00:25.199> much<00:00:25.380> of

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
to find out who you are it's as much of

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.560 
to find out who you are it's as much of
a<00:00:25.619> mystery<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.920> him<00:00:26.250> as<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.390> other

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
a mystery to him as it is to other

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.380 
a mystery to him as it is to other
people<00:00:28.189> and<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.340> think<00:00:29.429> he<00:00:29.670> recognized<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.300> he

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
people and I think he recognized that he

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
people and I think he recognized that he
did<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> kind<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.199> moral<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:33.410> complicated

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
did have a kind of moral a complicated

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.840 
did have a kind of moral a complicated
moral<00:00:35.300> position<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:37.020> he<00:00:37.140> would<00:00:37.290> he

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
moral position and that he would he

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.770 
moral position and that he would he
definitely<00:00:38.850> wanted<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.149> help<00:00:39.329> people<00:00:39.450> and

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
definitely wanted to help people and

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.600 
definitely wanted to help people and
definitely<00:00:40.050> wanted<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:41.250> save<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
definitely wanted to to save the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.100 
definitely wanted to to save the
universe<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:42.300> he<00:00:42.540> knew<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.719> there<00:00:42.960> was<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
universe but he knew that there was a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.740 
universe but he knew that there was a
often<00:00:43.739> there<00:00:43.860> would<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.160> wake<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.879> suffering

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
often there would be a wake of suffering

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.529 
often there would be a wake of suffering
and<00:00:45.930> pain<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.789> he<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.300> he<00:00:48.360> thought

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and pain and that and he and he thought

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.910 
and pain and that and he and he thought
well<00:00:48.690> am<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.960> responsible<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.890> I

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
well am I responsible for that can I

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
well am I responsible for that can I
live<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:51.270> eventually<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.020> think<00:00:52.170> he

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
live with that and eventually I think he

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.310 
live with that and eventually I think he
realized<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.250> who<00:00:53.640> he<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.050> but<00:00:55.050> now<00:00:55.289> I

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
realized that is who he is but now I

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.729 
realized that is who he is but now I
think<00:00:55.590> he's<00:00:55.980> realized<00:00:56.610> wow<00:00:57.199> what<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> gift<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
think he's realized wow what a gift the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.459 
think he's realized wow what a gift the
universe<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.579> mine<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.300> plan<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.230> range

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
universe is is mine to plan I can range

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.560 
universe is is mine to plan I can range
all<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.829> way<00:01:01.949> through<00:01:02.250> time<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.670> space<00:01:02.789> you

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
all the way through time and space you

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.640 
all the way through time and space you
know<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.809> even<00:01:03.989> though<00:01:04.110> he's<00:01:04.260> two<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.559> half

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
know and even though he's two and a half

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.340 
know and even though he's two and a half
thousand<00:01:05.040> years<00:01:05.159> old<00:01:05.510> life<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.780> still<00:01:06.990> short

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
thousand years old life is still short

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.780 
thousand years old life is still short
so<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.250> think<00:01:08.430> he<00:01:08.700> really<00:01:08.939> really<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.450> embracing

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
so I think he really really is embracing

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.260 
so I think he really really is embracing
the<00:01:11.790> adventure<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.710> great

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
the adventure and the great

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.820 
the adventure and the great
opportunities<00:01:15.270> being<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.170> Time<00:01:16.409> Lord<00:01:16.619> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
opportunities being a Time Lord and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.100 
opportunities being a Time Lord and
having<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.100> TARDIS<00:01:17.490> affords<00:01:18.180> him<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:19.020> of

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
having a TARDIS affords him but of

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.330 
having a TARDIS affords him but of
course<00:01:19.290> being<00:01:19.470> as<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.740> Doctor<00:01:20.009> Who<00:01:20.130> there's

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
course being as it's Doctor Who there's

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.730 
course being as it's Doctor Who there's
always<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.580> darkness<00:01:21.320> pursuing<00:01:22.320> him<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.680> know

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
always a darkness pursuing him you know

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.679 
always a darkness pursuing him you know
there's<00:01:22.950> something<00:01:23.310> brewing<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.479> going

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
there's something brewing that is going

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.289 
there's something brewing that is going
to<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.110> curtail<00:01:25.680> his<00:01:25.820> good<00:01:26.820> times<00:01:27.090> but

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
to I think curtail his good times but

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.109 
to I think curtail his good times but
he's<00:01:27.450> sadly<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> haven't<00:01:28.680> had<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> lot<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.729> fun<00:01:29.939> at

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
he's sadly I haven't had a lot of fun at

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.270 
he's sadly I haven't had a lot of fun at
the<00:01:30.180> moment<00:01:30.329> um<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.530> think<00:01:31.590> he<00:01:31.770> does<00:01:31.979> definitely

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
the moment um I think he does definitely

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.490 
the moment um I think he does definitely
want<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.850> find<00:01:33.119> Gallifrey<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.720> think<00:01:34.140> that's<00:01:34.320> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
want to find Gallifrey I think that's a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.649 
want to find Gallifrey I think that's a
it's<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.700> duty<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.119> mean<00:01:36.390> there's<00:01:36.540> some

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
it's a it's a duty I mean there's some

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.850 
it's a it's a duty I mean there's some
ways<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> doctors<00:01:37.560> got<00:01:37.740> an

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
ways that the doctors got an

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.310 
ways that the doctors got an
old-fashioned

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
old-fashioned

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.319 
old-fashioned
character<00:01:40.320> he<00:01:40.950> does<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> recognition<00:01:42.090> of

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
character he does have a recognition of

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.980 
character he does have a recognition of
duties<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.140> loyalties<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.750> these<00:01:45.750> are

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
duties and loyalties but these are
