00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
some kind of system like this where you

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.990 
some kind of system like this where you
get<00:00:10.530> their<00:00:10.740> attention<00:00:10.920> long<00:00:11.309> distance<00:00:11.790> you

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
get their attention long distance you

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.450 
get their attention long distance you
can<00:00:12.509> get<00:00:12.630> these<00:00:12.809> it'll<00:00:13.110> be<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.460> semi-automatic

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
can get these it'll be a semi-automatic

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.670 
can get these it'll be a semi-automatic
when<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.940> fire<00:00:15.150> your<00:00:15.330> threes<00:00:15.630> uh<00:00:15.780> it's<00:00:16.470> just

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
when you fire your threes uh it's just

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.700 
when you fire your threes uh it's just
like<00:00:16.920> your<00:00:17.070> m203<00:00:17.720> your<00:00:18.720> safety<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.289> sold<00:00:19.619> it

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
like your m203 your safety is I sold it

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.529 
like your m203 your safety is I sold it
this<00:00:19.830> way<00:00:20.070> or<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.820> can<00:00:21.060> hold<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.480> way

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
this way or you can hold it this way

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:49.280 
this way or you can hold it this way
whichever<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.380> perfect

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:01:40.410 

we<00:00:50.290> go<00:00:50.469> with<00:00:50.530> tasers<00:00:51.129> for<00:00:51.309> fun<00:00:51.460> another<00:01:39.420> we

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
we go with tasers for fun another we

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.910 
we go with tasers for fun another we
provide<00:01:40.720> external<00:01:41.020> security<00:01:41.530> like<00:01:41.649> blocking

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
provide external security like blocking

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.620 
provide external security like blocking
positions<00:01:42.430> for<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.700> raid<00:01:42.880> force<00:01:43.149> actually

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
positions for the raid force actually

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.359 
positions for the raid force actually
going<00:01:43.780> on<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.380> hit<00:01:44.500> site<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:45.009> it's

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
going on to the hit site and it's

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.950 
going on to the hit site and it's
important<00:01:45.759> for<00:01:45.820> us<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:45.970> understand<00:01:46.509> that<00:01:46.720> we

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
important for us to understand that we

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.410 
important for us to understand that we
can't<00:01:47.740> always<00:01:47.890> use<00:01:48.070> lethal<00:01:48.640> force<00:01:48.850> in<00:01:49.270> every

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
can't always use lethal force in every

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.060 
can't always use lethal force in every
situation<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:50.049> in<00:01:50.320> civilians<00:01:50.710> but<00:01:50.920> we

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
situation so in civilians but we

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.010 
situation so in civilians but we
understand<00:01:51.549> these<00:01:51.670> tactics<00:01:52.119> as<00:01:52.240> well<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.930> be

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
understand these tactics as well to be

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.319 
understand these tactics as well to be
just<00:01:53.229> as<00:01:53.350> effective<00:01:53.439> I<00:01:54.119> trained<00:01:55.119> with<00:01:55.149> the

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
just as effective I trained with the

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:56.760 
just as effective I trained with the
Philippine<00:01:55.719> Marines<00:01:55.930> is<00:01:56.079> great<00:01:56.320> because<00:01:56.530> it's

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
Philippine Marines is great because it's

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.100 
Philippine Marines is great because it's
something<00:01:57.729> that<00:01:58.030> not<00:01:58.180> everyone<00:01:58.450> here<00:01:58.689> gets<00:01:58.990> to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
something that not everyone here gets to

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.389 
something that not everyone here gets to
do<00:01:59.229> and<00:01:59.380> they<00:01:59.439> may<00:01:59.560> not<00:01:59.680> get<00:01:59.860> the<00:01:59.950> chance<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.250> do

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
do and they may not get the chance to do

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.399 
do and they may not get the chance to do
again<00:02:00.670> it's<00:02:01.240> just<00:02:01.479> interesting<00:02:01.960> learning<00:02:02.140> the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
again it's just interesting learning the

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.810 
again it's just interesting learning the
different<00:02:02.770> ways<00:02:02.890> that<00:02:03.100> they<00:02:03.250> train<00:02:03.579> and<00:02:03.729> they

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
different ways that they train and they

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.429 
different ways that they train and they
get<00:02:03.969> to<00:02:04.060> learn<00:02:04.090> how<00:02:04.210> we<00:02:04.360> train<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:04.990> actually

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
get to learn how we train and actually

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.539 
get to learn how we train and actually
come<00:02:05.560> up<00:02:05.590> with<00:02:05.710> some<00:02:05.829> interesting<00:02:06.310> ways<00:02:06.430> of

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
come up with some interesting ways of

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.939 
come up with some interesting ways of
doing<00:02:06.670> things
