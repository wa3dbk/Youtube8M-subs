00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
removable which is kind of disappointing

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.760 
removable which is kind of disappointing
I<00:02:03.119> mean<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.810> would<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.049> been<00:02:04.140> really<00:02:04.409> simple

I mean it would have been really simple

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.889 
I mean it would have been really simple
just<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.040> make<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:06.119> know<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> sword<00:02:06.570> come<00:02:06.780> out

just to make you know the sword come out
of<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.140> thing<00:02:07.429> but<00:02:08.429> has<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.879> light<00:02:09.390> blue

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
of this thing but has a light blue

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.100 
of this thing but has a light blue
handle<00:02:09.899> as<00:02:10.020> well<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.679> all<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> swords<00:02:11.790> match

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110

articulation<00:03:25.410> like<00:03:25.859> I<00:03:25.950> said<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.190> ball<00:03:26.940> join

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
articulation like I said a ball join

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.789 
articulation like I said a ball join
with<00:03:27.299> head<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.780> then<00:03:28.170> as<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.410> guys<00:03:28.560> can<00:03:28.739> see

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
with head and then as you guys can see

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.759 
with head and then as you guys can see
she's<00:03:29.160> got<00:03:29.310> three<00:03:29.579> arms<00:03:29.850> on<00:03:29.970> each<00:03:30.090> side<00:03:30.389> and

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
she's got three arms on each side and

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.039 
she's got three arms on each side and
they<00:03:31.769> did<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> really<00:03:32.220> good<00:03:32.430> job<00:03:32.489> on<00:03:32.850> this<00:03:33.049> each

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
they did a really good job on this each

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.740 
they did a really good job on this each
arm<00:03:34.470> at<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.370> shoulder<00:03:35.700> has<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.940> ball<00:03:36.420> jointed

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
arm at the shoulder has a ball jointed

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.879 
arm at the shoulder has a ball jointed
shoulder<00:03:37.620> joint<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:38.510> then<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:40.260> have<00:03:40.500> double

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
shoulder joint and then you have double

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.870 
shoulder joint and then you have double
jointed<00:03:41.160> elbows<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:42.590> then<00:03:43.590> they<00:03:44.250> rotate<00:03:44.700> at

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
jointed elbows and then they rotate at

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.879 
jointed elbows and then they rotate at
the<00:03:45.000> wrists<00:03:45.359> so<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.260> mean<00:03:46.500> that's<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:46.769> lot<00:03:46.859> of

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
the wrists so I mean that's a lot of

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.559 
the wrists so I mean that's a lot of
points<00:03:47.100> of<00:03:47.310> articulation<00:03:47.459> just<00:03:48.150> right<00:03:48.329> there

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
points of articulation just right there

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.470 
points of articulation just right there
having<00:03:49.560> six<00:03:49.859> arms<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.850> you<00:03:50.940> can<00:03:51.090> pose<00:03:51.299> them

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
having six arms and you can pose them

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.229 
having six arms and you can pose them
down<00:03:51.630> in<00:03:51.810> different<00:03:51.930> positions<00:03:52.560> which<00:03:52.829> I

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
down in different positions which I

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.610 
down in different positions which I
think<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.540> mean<00:03:54.870> they<00:03:54.989> really<00:03:55.260> couldn't<00:03:55.500> have

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
think I mean they really couldn't have

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.280 
think I mean they really couldn't have
done<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.859> better<00:03:55.950> job<00:03:56.190> on<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.819> it<00:03:57.810> just<00:03:57.989> looks

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
done a better job on that it just looks

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.839 
done a better job on that it just looks
really<00:03:58.380> cool<00:03:58.940> and<00:03:59.940> then<00:04:00.660> got<00:04:01.620> some<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.489> little

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
really cool and then got some a little

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.110 
really cool and then got some a little
bit<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.440> torso<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.470> waist<00:04:04.799> moving<00:04:05.250> up<00:04:05.340> there<00:04:05.549> it

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120

doesn't<00:04:06.329> go<00:04:06.750> up<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.019> down<00:04:07.170> very<00:04:07.349> much<00:04:07.470> but

a<00:04:35.630> very<00:04:36.630> cool<00:04:36.870> figure<00:04:37.110> I<00:04:37.470> mean<00:04:37.830> seriously<00:04:38.390> it's

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
a very cool figure I mean seriously it's

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.960 
a very cool figure I mean seriously it's
just<00:04:39.510> a<00:04:39.720> really<00:04:39.990> good<00:04:40.110> job<00:04:40.320> you<00:04:40.500> got<00:04:40.590> the

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
just a really good job you got the

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.770 
just a really good job you got the
cool-looking<00:04:41.970> silver<00:04:42.750> arm<00:04:42.990> they're<00:04:44.750> nice<00:04:45.750> and

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
cool-looking silver arm they're nice and

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.260 
cool-looking silver arm they're nice and
then<00:04:46.050> she's<00:04:46.170> got<00:04:46.640> partly<00:04:47.640> metal<00:04:47.820> arm<00:04:48.090> right

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
then she's got partly metal arm right

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.520 
then she's got partly metal arm right
there<00:04:48.480> that's<00:04:48.690> exposed<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:50.790> on<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:52.110> this

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
there that's exposed and on the the this

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.500 
there that's exposed and on the the this
is<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.860> non<00:04:53.040> variant<00:04:53.490> but<00:04:53.610> on<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.820> variant<00:04:54.240> I

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
is the non variant but on the variant I

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.150 
is the non variant but on the variant I
think<00:04:54.900> that<00:04:55.110> it's<00:04:55.440> a<00:04:55.560> little<00:04:55.650> different<00:04:56.070> with

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
think that it's a little different with

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.440 
think that it's a little different with
the<00:04:56.280> arms<00:04:56.580> too

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
the arms too

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.270 
the arms too
we'll<00:04:58.080> see<00:04:58.230> on<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.410> future<00:04:58.710> date<00:04:58.830> when<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.160> do

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
we'll see on a future date when I do

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.900 
we'll see on a future date when I do
that<00:04:59.490> review<00:04:59.640> but<00:05:00.060> I<00:05:00.300> believe<00:05:01.850> there's<00:05:02.850> a

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
that review but I believe there's a

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.480 
that review but I believe there's a
different<00:05:03.300> amount<00:05:03.540> of<00:05:04.010> mechanical<00:05:05.010> arms<00:05:05.310> like

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
different amount of mechanical arms like

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.910 
different amount of mechanical arms like
this<00:05:05.640> ones<00:05:06.260> mechanical<00:05:07.260> and<00:05:07.440> then<00:05:07.560> that<00:05:07.710> was

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
this ones mechanical and then that was

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.340 
this ones mechanical and then that was
part<00:05:08.190> I<00:05:08.460> think<00:05:09.240> they<00:05:09.780> just<00:05:09.990> did<00:05:10.110> a<00:05:10.140> different

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
part I think they just did a different

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.850 
part I think they just did a different
job<00:05:10.770> on<00:05:10.980> the<00:05:11.430> paint<00:05:11.640> on<00:05:11.820> that<00:05:12.030> but<00:05:12.600> a<00:05:12.710> very<00:05:13.710> cool

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
job on the paint on that but a very cool

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.630 
job on the paint on that but a very cool
figure<00:05:14.220> so<00:05:14.430> uh

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
figure so uh

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.230 
figure so uh
