because it doesn't have any kind of

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.510 
because it doesn't have any kind of
switch<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.390> says<00:02:19.600> hey<00:02:19.900> I'm<00:02:20.650> already<00:02:21.130> turned

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
switch that says hey I'm already turned

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.400 
switch that says hey I'm already turned
up<00:02:21.850> we<00:02:22.390> turn<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.630> off<00:02:22.720> for<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.870> second<00:02:23.140> I'm

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
up we turn it off for a second I'm

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.660 
up we turn it off for a second I'm
already<00:02:23.769> in<00:02:24.330> Dimond<00:02:25.330> mode<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.950> don't<00:02:27.459> make<00:02:27.610> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
already in Dimond mode so don't make the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.509 
already in Dimond mode so don't make the
noise<00:02:27.910> again<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.480> guess<00:02:29.290> they<00:02:29.440> just<00:02:29.470> will<00:02:29.980> turn

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
noise again I guess they just will turn

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.050 
noise again I guess they just will turn
it<00:02:30.640> off<00:02:30.760> before<00:02:31.000> doing<00:02:31.269> that<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.540> don't<00:02:31.660> know

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
it off before doing that I don't know

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:49.199 
it off before doing that I don't know
yeah<00:02:45.930> digital<00:02:46.930> industry

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
yeah digital industry

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.789
