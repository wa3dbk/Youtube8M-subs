00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
there's another rate get behind them

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.950 
there's another rate get behind them
there<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.550> go<00:00:47.700> gonna<00:00:48.090> tuck<00:00:48.390> them<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.690> you'll

there we go gonna tuck them up you'll

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080 
there we go gonna tuck them up you'll
notice<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> ring<00:00:49.559> inside<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> little

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
notice the ring inside you have a little

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.560 
notice the ring inside you have a little
bar<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.510> popped<00:00:51.719> up<00:00:51.930> that's<00:00:52.829> all<00:00:53.570> telling

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
bar that popped up that's all telling

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.849 
bar that popped up that's all telling
you<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.840> progress<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:58.530> little

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
you you progress for that so little

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.830 
you you progress for that so little
later<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.250> switch<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.420> give<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> a

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
later on I switch out with give to a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.470 
later on I switch out with give to a
passenger<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> laser<00:01:01.879> there's<00:01:02.879> six<00:01:03.210> rates

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
passenger the laser there's six rates

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.060 
passenger the laser there's six rates
altogether

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.790 

and<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:09.120> map<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:10.020> course<00:01:10.290> uplift

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
and this map is of course uplift

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.690 
and this map is of course uplift
reserved

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.569 

so<00:01:19.270> this<00:01:19.570> is<00:01:19.600> on<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.619> two<00:01:20.890> rate<00:01:21.159> after<00:01:21.340> you

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
so this is on the two rate after you

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.459 
so this is on the two rate after you
meet<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:22.049> 2nd<00:01:23.049> platoon<00:01:25.049> they're<00:01:26.049> just<00:01:26.409> a

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
meet the 2nd platoon they're just a

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.230 
meet the 2nd platoon they're just a
while<00:01:26.590> right<00:01:26.770> next<00:01:27.100> to<00:01:27.159> each<00:01:27.219> other<00:01:27.399> I'm<00:01:28.030> just

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
while right next to each other I'm just

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.359 
while right next to each other I'm just
trying<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.200> stop<00:01:29.350> by<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.560> checkpoint<00:01:30.159> real

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
trying to stop by the checkpoint real

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:40.460 
trying to stop by the checkpoint real
quick

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.400 

there<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.160> go<00:01:41.690> now<00:01:42.690> this<00:01:42.900> guy<00:01:43.140> they're

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
starting to get smart on me I guess he

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.950 
starting to get smart on me I guess he
does<00:01:46.470> not<00:01:46.620> want<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.950> let<00:01:47.040> me<00:01:47.190> behind<00:01:47.520> him<00:01:47.960> plus
