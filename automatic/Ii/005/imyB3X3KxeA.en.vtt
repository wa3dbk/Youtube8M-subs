00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:37.580 
your same machine foot put the foot down
it<00:01:27.780> should<00:01:27.930> be<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> center<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:36.380> with<00:01:37.380> my

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
it should be in the center and with my

it should be in the center and with my
stitch

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.209 

don't<00:01:45.869> grab<00:01:46.259> hold<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> fabric<00:01:47.340> just

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
don't grab hold of the fabric just

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.219 
don't grab hold of the fabric just

allow the fabric to flow underneath and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.340 
allow the fabric to flow underneath and
that<00:01:54.840> way<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.829> some<00:01:56.579> really<00:01:56.820> lovely
