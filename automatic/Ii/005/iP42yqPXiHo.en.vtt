00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
 good 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.880
 especially northern music has had 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.150
 an evolution and acceptance never before 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.230
 views this is definitely a new 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.230
 epoch of urena 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.300
 I'm passionate, it fills me, it makes me happy 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.379
 how are you going to amuse others if you do not 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.329
 you have fun how are you going to make them 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.829
 move something if you do not love it if 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.829
 platinum you move something 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:00.260
 and the accordion is an instrument 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.309
 emblematic and representative 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.309
 you do not know 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.299
 when I was a child with being small 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:17.430
 many times the events went and nothing else 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.070
 to see the accordion up close 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.340
 the will not 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.579
 now all legs 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.609
 it is said that one should not go to war 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.090
 without a gun, it's not just that you can not go 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.630
 with any rifle 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.630
 weather 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.240
 as a musician you need an instrument 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.930
 reliable to sound well threshed and 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.310
 even corny but you really become 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.310
 one with your instrument 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 A) Yes 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.050
 gabriel is an accordion that gives you everything 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.940
 that is very very reliable is very 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.850
 hold on now you know you can touch 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.410
 in the cold in the heat in the humidity in 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.700
 a closed place in an open place 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.040
 for the study they are unbeatable 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.810

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.650

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.650
 the note 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.620
 no no no 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.519
 you know if you have the confidence that 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:47.220
 accounts with everything you need to to 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.220
 play any kind of song 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.470
 no no no 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.430
 you know well that you have all the 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.940
 sounds and with all the tools 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.450
 to be able to execute what you have in the 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.450
 mind and in the heart 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 yes 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:27.460
 my first mega nelly october 10 ago 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:31.680
 years approximately for me it was like a 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.680
 dream and a hand be seen on TV 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.050
 it was a lot of sacrifice but 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.790
 if I tried other brands all of them very 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:55.329
 respectable and many of them when 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.900
 quite acceptable performances but I still 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.900
 in gabanelli 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:26.130
 I do not think there are good musicians we are 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.330
 and with bad the best and the worst 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.180
 simply and simply everyone 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.600
 he expresses his music each one expresses his 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.610
 art 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.330
 and they are all valuable they are all 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.330
 respectable 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.530
 and
