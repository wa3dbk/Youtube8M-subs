 no we have musicians we have 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.770
 opted this year for a Breton aspect 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:12.119
 of our region we have some 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.119

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.450
 sailors with accordionists who 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.820

 and we did come for the 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.159
 first time I think in such a cycle 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.899
 of cyclotourists Breton games is 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.939

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.179
 other than most people are going 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.829
 discover a day of relaxation that 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.960
 also allows participants to train 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:44.289
 a first assessment of the performances and 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.310
 on the event and that is not too much 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.060
 to think we have some rain all 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.539
 because we are not far from 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.049
 Britain 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.149

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.310
 4 50 km we do not do people 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.259
