off<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:50.940> floor<00:04:51.210> and<00:04:51.450> then<00:04:51.630> start<00:04:51.960> recording

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.500 
and I think we're going to do like our
version<00:04:55.050> here<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:55.920> then<00:04:56.040> later<00:04:57.000> on<00:04:57.180> maybe

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510
