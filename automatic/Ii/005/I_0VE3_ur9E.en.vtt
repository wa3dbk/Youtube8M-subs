thing<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.309> asked<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.610> when<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.790> came<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.120> here

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
thing I asked you when I came in here

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.400 
thing I asked you when I came in here
was<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.509> know<00:00:12.599> you're<00:00:12.809> not<00:00:12.870> gonna<00:00:12.990> throw<00:00:13.200> me

around or anything are you and I said

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.450 
around or anything are you and I said
but<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.880> course<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.240> are<00:00:15.740> so<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.980> big<00:00:17.160> part<00:00:17.369> is

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
but of course we are so the big part is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.510 
but of course we are so the big part is
taking<00:00:17.730> self-defense<00:00:17.970> right<00:00:18.510> absolutely<00:00:19.520> and

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
taking self-defense right absolutely and

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.250 
taking self-defense right absolutely and
it's<00:00:20.730> adult<00:00:20.970> self-defense<00:00:21.660> as<00:00:21.840> we've<00:00:21.990> talked

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
it's adult self-defense as we've talked

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.980 
it's adult self-defense as we've talked
about<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.640> lot<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:24.029> our<00:00:24.150> self-defense<00:00:24.810> is

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
about and a lot of our self-defense is

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.620 
about and a lot of our self-defense is
based<00:00:25.230> around<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:26.400> idea<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.060> don't<00:00:27.119> want

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
based around the idea that I don't want

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.169 
based around the idea that I don't want
to<00:00:27.720> trade<00:00:27.900> hits<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> attacker<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.580> so

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
to trade hits with the attacker and so

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.880 
to trade hits with the attacker and so
one<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> very<00:00:30.810> first<00:00:31.050> things<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.470> work<00:00:31.679> off

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
one of the very first things we work off

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.530 
one of the very first things we work off
if<00:00:32.070> you'll<00:00:32.189> take<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:32.669> step<00:00:32.910> back<00:00:33.120> for<00:00:33.390> me

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
if you'll take one step back for me

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.350 
if you'll take one step back for me
there<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.890> identifying<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.850> course<00:00:36.120> when

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
there the is identifying of course when

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.970 
there the is identifying of course when
there<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.660> an<00:00:36.750> attacker<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.500> when<00:00:37.620> somebody's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
there is an attacker and when somebody's

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.290 
there is an attacker and when somebody's
going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.190> throw<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> punch<00:00:38.670> at<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:39.030> head<00:00:39.180> or

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
going to throw a punch at your head or

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.260 
going to throw a punch at your head or
something<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:40.110> basically<00:00:40.469> move<00:00:41.059> other<00:00:42.059> words

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
something to basically move other words

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.369 
something to basically move other words
why<00:00:42.480> would<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.750> say<00:00:42.930> if<00:00:42.989> he's<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> throw

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
why would I say if he's going to throw

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.930 
why would I say if he's going to throw
it<00:00:43.530> my<00:00:43.620> head<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.980> see<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> lot<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.430> styles<00:00:44.789> where

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
it my head you see a lot of styles where

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.069 
it my head you see a lot of styles where
they're<00:00:45.059> trying<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.989> they're

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
they're trying to do this and they're

trying<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.350> slam<00:00:46.649> something<00:00:46.950> into<00:00:47.280> his<00:00:47.399> arm

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
trying to slam something into his arm

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.720 
trying to slam something into his arm
