00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.150 

so<00:00:04.360> here<00:00:04.600> we<00:00:04.720> have<00:00:04.870> the<00:00:05.170> pimp<00:00:05.380> on<00:00:05.529> the<00:00:05.649> left<00:00:05.890> and

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.160 
so here we have the pimp on the left and

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.610 
so here we have the pimp on the left and
this<00:00:06.939> is<00:00:07.120> a<00:00:07.149> capacitive<00:00:07.690> battery<00:00:08.020> charger<00:00:08.469> it

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
this is a capacitive battery charger it

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.080 
this is a capacitive battery charger it
is<00:00:09.219> a<00:00:09.580> manual<00:00:09.910> device<00:00:10.389> so<00:00:10.809> we<00:00:11.320> turn<00:00:11.530> on<00:00:12.090> the

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
is a manual device so we turn on the

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.240 
is a manual device so we turn on the
voltage<00:00:13.420> switch<00:00:14.350> here<00:00:14.559> the<00:00:14.680> metal<00:00:14.920> switching

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
voltage switch here the metal switching

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.680 
voltage switch here the metal switching
we<00:00:15.400> get<00:00:15.520> a<00:00:15.549> voltage<00:00:15.760> reading<00:00:16.150> of<00:00:16.209> about<00:00:16.299> seven

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
we get a voltage reading of about seven

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.810 
we get a voltage reading of about seven
point<00:00:16.930> nine<00:00:16.990> volts<00:00:17.140> so<00:00:18.130> this<00:00:18.250> is<00:00:18.369> just<00:00:18.520> acting

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
point nine volts so this is just acting

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.760 
point nine volts so this is just acting
as<00:00:18.910> a<00:00:18.970> multimeter<00:00:19.420> right<00:00:19.660> now<00:00:19.840> I've<00:00:20.440> also

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
as a multimeter right now I've also

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.470 
as a multimeter right now I've also
hooked<00:00:20.950> up<00:00:21.100> two<00:00:21.310> alligator<00:00:21.850> clips<00:00:22.120> a<00:00:22.270> black

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
hooked up two alligator clips a black

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.210 
hooked up two alligator clips a black
and<00:00:22.660> a<00:00:22.690> red<00:00:22.720> and<00:00:23.020> they're<00:00:23.830> connected

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
and a red and they're connected

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.440 
and a red and they're connected
appropriately<00:00:24.790> to<00:00:24.940> the<00:00:25.030> negative<00:00:25.360> and

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
appropriately to the negative and

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.020 
appropriately to the negative and
positive<00:00:25.510> of<00:00:26.110> this<00:00:26.260> battery<00:00:26.850> this<00:00:27.850> is<00:00:28.000> a

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.030 
positive of this battery this is a

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.630 
positive of this battery this is a
little<00:00:28.330> APC<00:00:28.780> 12<00:00:29.170> volt<00:00:29.320> battery<00:00:29.680> and<00:00:29.830> I<00:00:30.460> found

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
little APC 12 volt battery and I found

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.040 
little APC 12 volt battery and I found
it<00:00:30.760> in<00:00:30.820> a<00:00:30.850> dumpster<00:00:31.000> and<00:00:31.480> I<00:00:31.570> don't<00:00:31.750> think<00:00:31.960> it's

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
it in a dumpster and I don't think it's

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.900 
it in a dumpster and I don't think it's
any<00:00:32.259> good<00:00:32.289> but<00:00:32.770> let<00:00:33.070> me<00:00:33.280> show<00:00:33.460> you<00:00:33.520> why<00:00:33.760> I<00:00:33.789> think

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
any good but let me show you why I think

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.060 
any good but let me show you why I think
that<00:00:34.300> so<00:00:35.110> there's<00:00:35.379> another<00:00:35.560> core<00:00:35.829> that<00:00:35.920> comes

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
that so there's another core that comes

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.740 
that so there's another core that comes
out<00:00:36.220> here<00:00:36.370> there's<00:00:36.579> a<00:00:36.610> power<00:00:36.820> cord<00:00:37.090> it<00:00:37.510> goes<00:00:37.660> to

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
out here there's a power cord it goes to

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.660 
out here there's a power cord it goes to
an<00:00:37.840> outlet<00:00:38.140> and<00:00:38.500> at<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.070> moment<00:00:39.190> this<00:00:39.400> black

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
an outlet and at the moment this black

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.130 
an outlet and at the moment this black
switch<00:00:39.940> would<00:00:40.120> bring<00:00:40.360> in<00:00:40.510> our<00:00:40.720> power<00:00:40.989> from

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
switch would bring in our power from

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.900 
switch would bring in our power from
mains<00:00:41.440> and<00:00:41.800> I<00:00:41.890> don't<00:00:42.160> have<00:00:42.280> it<00:00:42.399> turned<00:00:42.579> on<00:00:42.700> yet

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
mains and I don't have it turned on yet

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.400 
mains and I don't have it turned on yet
so<00:00:43.210> let's<00:00:43.390> turned<00:00:43.600> on<00:00:43.750> I'll<00:00:43.930> show<00:00:43.960> you<00:00:44.140> why

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
so let's turned on I'll show you why

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.150 
so let's turned on I'll show you why
this<00:00:44.470> battery<00:00:45.010> is<00:00:45.040> suspicious<00:00:46.200> boom<00:00:47.200> so<00:00:47.680> look

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
this battery is suspicious boom so look

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.979 
this battery is suspicious boom so look
at<00:00:48.250> that<00:00:48.370> we<00:00:48.910> see<00:00:49.120> a<00:00:49.149> voltage<00:00:49.540> reading<00:00:49.809> in<00:00:49.899> the

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
at that we see a voltage reading in the

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.350 
at that we see a voltage reading in the
80's<00:00:50.380> 90's<00:00:50.590> that's<00:00:50.980> jumping<00:00:51.370> around<00:00:51.460> this<00:00:52.210> is

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
80's 90's that's jumping around this is

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.180 
80's 90's that's jumping around this is
a<00:00:52.390> sign<00:00:52.660> of<00:00:52.840> a<00:00:52.930> unhealthy<00:00:53.590> battery<00:00:53.890> this<00:00:54.040> is<00:00:54.160> a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
a sign of a unhealthy battery this is a

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.670 
a sign of a unhealthy battery this is a
battery<00:00:54.460> that<00:00:54.670> is<00:00:54.940> heavily<00:00:55.809> sulfated<00:00:56.530> it's

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
battery that is heavily sulfated it's

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.410 
battery that is heavily sulfated it's
been<00:00:56.829> sitting<00:00:57.100> so<00:00:57.280> long<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.700> charges<00:00:58.090> trying

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
been sitting so long the charges trying

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.000 
been sitting so long the charges trying
to<00:00:58.540> rev<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.809> voltage<00:00:59.320> up<00:00:59.500> to<00:00:59.530> whatever's

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
to rev the voltage up to whatever's

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.100 
to rev the voltage up to whatever's
necessary<00:01:00.219> to<00:01:00.579> push<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:00.850> fan<00:01:01.300> through<00:01:01.629> it<00:01:01.750> and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
necessary to push a fan through it and

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.889 
necessary to push a fan through it and
it<00:01:02.440> has<00:01:02.559> to<00:01:02.590> be<00:01:02.800> in<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.040> 90s<00:01:03.520> to<00:01:03.700> do<00:01:03.820> it<00:01:04.000> so<00:01:04.210> this

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
it has to be in the 90s to do it so this

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.990 
it has to be in the 90s to do it so this
battery<00:01:05.290> although<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.920> might<00:01:06.189> be<00:01:06.399> possible<00:01:06.610> to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
battery although it might be possible to

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.779 
battery although it might be possible to
recover<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:07.829> basically<00:01:08.829> using<00:01:09.399> the<00:01:09.490> DES<00:01:09.579> pimp

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
recover it basically using the DES pimp

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.300 
recover it basically using the DES pimp
as<00:01:09.909> a<00:01:09.939> tester<00:01:10.479> I<00:01:10.689> would<00:01:11.319> say<00:01:11.560> you<00:01:12.009> should<00:01:12.039> let

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
as a tester I would say you should let

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.039 
as a tester I would say you should let
this<00:01:12.429> battery<00:01:12.759> go<00:01:12.999> you<00:01:13.569> know<00:01:13.689> we<00:01:13.810> want<00:01:13.990> a

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
this battery go you know we want a

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.830 
this battery go you know we want a

dumpster<00:01:36.209> this<00:01:37.209> is<00:01:37.359> the<00:01:37.479> kind<00:01:37.689> you<00:01:37.749> leave

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:37.959 
dumpster this is the kind you leave

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:46.200 
dumpster this is the kind you leave
behind

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.230 

okay<00:01:47.210> just<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:48.160> clarify<00:01:49.160> what<00:01:49.640> a<00:01:49.700> good<00:01:50.000> battery

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
okay just to clarify what a good battery

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.780 
okay just to clarify what a good battery
looks<00:01:50.630> like<00:01:50.870> this<00:01:51.140> is<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.350> 18<00:01:52.070> volt<00:01:52.340> battery<00:01:52.760> I

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
looks like this is a 18 volt battery I

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.430 
looks like this is a 18 volt battery I
found<00:01:53.060> in<00:01:53.210> a<00:01:53.270> dumpster<00:01:53.420> someone<00:01:53.990> even<00:01:54.200> took

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
found in a dumpster someone even took

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.440 
found in a dumpster someone even took
the<00:01:54.590> time<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.860> write<00:01:54.950> bad<00:01:55.250> on<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.730> this<00:01:56.240> is<00:01:56.300> the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
the time to write bad on it this is the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.090 
the time to write bad on it this is the
kind<00:01:56.750> of<00:01:56.870> battery<00:01:57.230> that<00:01:57.410> you're<00:01:57.560> more<00:01:57.830> likely

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
kind of battery that you're more likely

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.670 
kind of battery that you're more likely
to<00:01:58.340> be<00:01:58.430> able<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.760> recover<00:01:59.410> probably<00:02:00.410> cuz<00:02:00.530> it's

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
to be able to recover probably cuz it's

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.900 
to be able to recover probably cuz it's
an<00:02:00.770> AI<00:02:00.830> CAD<00:02:01.070> based<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.490> they<00:02:01.550> tend<00:02:01.730> to<00:02:01.760> be<00:02:01.850> a

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
an AI CAD based and they tend to be a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.640 
an AI CAD based and they tend to be a
little<00:02:02.030> more<00:02:02.210> robust<00:02:02.600> we'll<00:02:03.230> turn<00:02:03.350> on<00:02:03.530> the

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
little more robust we'll turn on the

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:15.120 
little more robust we'll turn on the
voltage<00:02:03.950> meter<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:13.150> we're<00:02:14.150> seeing<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.720> nice

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
voltage meter and we're seeing a nice

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.060 
voltage meter and we're seeing a nice
clear<00:02:16.130> rise<00:02:19.510> slowly<00:02:20.510> going<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.959> 10<00:02:21.290> volt<00:02:21.650> this

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
clear rise slowly going to 10 volt this

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.710 
clear rise slowly going to 10 volt this
is<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.280> sign<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.850> healthy<00:02:22.880> battery<00:02:23.540> that

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
is a sign of a healthy battery that

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.540 
is a sign of a healthy battery that
slowly<00:02:23.990> climbs<00:02:24.500> up<00:02:24.800> as<00:02:25.040> opposed<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.400> just

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
slowly climbs up as opposed to just

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.000 
slowly climbs up as opposed to just
jumping<00:02:26.060> right<00:02:26.209> up<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.480> towards<00:02:26.750> 100<00:02:27.140> volts<00:02:27.500> so

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
jumping right up to towards 100 volts so

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.130 
jumping right up to towards 100 volts so
the<00:02:28.190> kind<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.600> behavior<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.780> battery<00:02:30.050> that

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
the kind of behavior of a battery that

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.740 
the kind of behavior of a battery that
you<00:02:30.260> could<00:02:30.590> recover<00:02:30.980> using<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:31.970> pimp<00:02:32.209> is

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
you could recover using the pimp is

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.880 
you could recover using the pimp is
where<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.410> slowly<00:02:33.830> Rises<00:02:34.459> like<00:02:34.490> this
