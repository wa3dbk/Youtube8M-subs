00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.870 
muscular looking and overall the package
is<00:01:56.899> lower<00:01:57.710> than<00:01:58.250> what<00:01:58.429> you<00:01:58.520> see<00:01:58.670> on<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.819> regular

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
is lower than what you see on a regular

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.359 
is lower than what you see on a regular
GLA<00:01:59.630> now<00:02:00.259> that's<00:02:00.440> of<00:02:00.590> course<00:02:00.740> because<00:02:01.100> this<00:02:01.220> is

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
GLA now that's of course because this is

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.980 
GLA now that's of course because this is
performance<00:02:01.789> oriented<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.509> needs<00:02:02.689> to<00:02:02.810> hug

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
performance oriented so it needs to hug

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.899 
performance oriented so it needs to hug
the<00:02:03.140> road<00:02:03.290> just<00:02:03.619> a<00:02:03.860> little<00:02:04.070> bit<00:02:04.189> so<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.579> kind<00:02:04.790> of

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
the road just a little bit so it kind of

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.850 
the road just a little bit so it kind of
stops<00:02:05.149> looking<00:02:05.540> like<00:02:05.750> an<00:02:05.930> SUV<00:02:06.259> then<00:02:06.560> doesn't

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
stops looking like an SUV then doesn't

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.390 
stops looking like an SUV then doesn't
it

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.899 

so<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.450> gla45<00:02:13.019> looks<00:02:13.590> different<00:02:14.099> enough<00:02:14.400> but

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
so the gla45 looks different enough but

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.240 
so the gla45 looks different enough but
the<00:02:15.000> part<00:02:15.269> you<00:02:15.480> wanna<00:02:15.750> see<00:02:16.049> is<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.860> drive

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
the part you wanna see is the drive

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.119 
the part you wanna see is the drive

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
finally got that little break that I was

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.590 
finally got that little break that I was
literally<00:03:55.870> craving<00:03:56.650> by<00:03:56.890> now<00:03:57.300> you<00:03:58.300> know<00:03:58.420> this

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
literally craving by now you know this

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.690 
literally craving by now you know this
engine<00:03:58.780> is<00:03:59.110> a<00:03:59.170> familiar<00:03:59.530> one<00:03:59.920> because<00:04:00.280> it's

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
engine is a familiar one because it's

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.490 
engine is a familiar one because it's
the<00:04:00.790> exact<00:04:01.300> same<00:04:01.390> engine<00:04:01.870> that<00:04:01.900> goes<00:04:02.140> into<00:04:02.320> the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
the exact same engine that goes into the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.680 
the exact same engine that goes into the
CLA<00:04:02.920> 45<00:04:02.950> AMG<00:04:03.460> which<00:04:04.090> we've<00:04:04.240> showed<00:04:04.450> you<00:04:04.570> before

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.510 
CLA 45 AMG which we've showed you before
but<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.410> difference<00:04:05.740> is<00:04:05.890> that<00:04:05.920> engines<00:04:06.370> gotta

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
but the difference is that engines gotta

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.760 
but the difference is that engines gotta
solve<00:04:06.730> a<00:04:06.850> screaming<00:04:07.300> quality<00:04:07.960> to<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.290> while
