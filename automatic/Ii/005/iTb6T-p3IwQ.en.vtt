so<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:27.740> may<00:01:27.890> consider<00:01:28.130> this<00:01:28.549> not<00:01:28.940> virgin

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
so you may consider this not virgin

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.980 
so you may consider this not virgin
because<00:01:29.680> I<00:01:30.680> consider<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.580> virgin<00:01:32.119> hair<00:01:32.360> hair

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
because I consider a virgin hair hair

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.260 
because I consider a virgin hair hair
that<00:01:33.170> hasn't<00:01:33.470> been<00:01:33.500> chemically<00:01:33.740> processed<00:01:34.270> so

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
that hasn't been chemically processed so

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.960 
that hasn't been chemically processed so
steam<00:01:36.140> processing<00:01:36.770> for<00:01:37.009> me<00:01:37.190> still<00:01:37.580> means<00:01:37.789> that

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
steam processing for me still means that

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.249 
steam processing for me still means that
its<00:01:38.119> version<00:01:38.360> for<00:01:38.720> some<00:01:38.869> people<00:01:39.170> they

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
its version for some people they

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.710 
its version for some people they
consider<00:01:39.649> that<00:01:39.799> Reming<00:01:40.220> so<00:01:40.700> all<00:01:40.940> terminology

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
consider that Reming so all terminology

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.200 
consider that Reming so all terminology
is<00:01:41.780> up<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.320> um<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.340> hair<00:01:43.580> does<00:01:43.850> feel

really know about the shedding because

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.340 
really know about the shedding because
you're<00:02:55.430> not<00:02:55.549> combing<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:56.810> brushing<00:02:57.200> it

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
you're not combing it and brushing it

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.380 
you're not combing it and brushing it
and<00:02:57.530> curling<00:02:57.920> in<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.190> straightening<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.910> like

and curling in and straightening it like

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.330 
and curling in and straightening it like
you<00:02:59.540> do<00:02:59.690> with<00:02:59.870> straight<00:03:00.019> hair<00:03:00.140> or<00:03:00.350> wavy<00:03:00.950> hair

doesn't<00:03:04.840> shed<00:03:05.020> a<00:03:05.050> whole<00:03:05.260> lot<00:03:05.440> anyway<00:03:05.890> because

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
doesn't shed a whole lot anyway because

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.250 
doesn't shed a whole lot anyway because
you're<00:03:06.970> not<00:03:07.120> really<00:03:07.360> putting<00:03:07.630> stress<00:03:07.930> on<00:03:08.110> the

you're not really putting stress on the
webs<00:03:08.440> like<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:08.860> but<00:03:09.069> it<00:03:09.190> does<00:03:09.370> tangle<00:03:10.000> more

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209
