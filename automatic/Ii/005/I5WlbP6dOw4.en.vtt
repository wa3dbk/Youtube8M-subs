 Sounds percent is that 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.339
 the endpoint is 5 euros gross 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:22.580
 old tradition 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.679
 in the engine 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.829
 the name of the boat 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.829
 to the main mosque 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.899
 Great 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.729
 and so on 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.330
 I'm not an artist though 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
 Coalition come and searched because I have since fully connected 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.100
 the flower house APA 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.990
 The duel I can still with the next six years invited her mother 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.990
 I always come by sometimes or sometimes a little bit nice 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.540
 behind me 7 percent 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.800
 we have to deal with that 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.240
 May 09 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.240
 Bottleneck bun 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:10.300
 Marcel Ngyuen has not taken anybody else with one life or the other 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.190
 we are going neatly the other way 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.090
 to the fact that yet another Canadian met the stock otherwise 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.649
 The only teacher seems to be smoking with smoking 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.810
 to go the direction 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.560
 you already say some velvet gloves methodical type with Brings 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.380
 Christina Huckle Orion Omori 0 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.380
 sometimes you just have to do a good thing 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.210
 so know the smart one else is 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.590
 if I speak the champagne and beer, not least because I'm a percent 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.270
 It was by and large not always seen as a single-handed ship though 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.909
 Also like to take the opportunity when someone asks me if you are hourly 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.280
 now it is possible to get controlled so Spohn 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.600
 Dr with me together from here it goes across the Atlantic 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.330
 sails to New York 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.730
 of course a bit easier for me, too, because I'm not big 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.210
 Have to think about that 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.290
 numerous 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.890
 the exhausting weeks 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.340
 neat the activists always easy 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.819
 somehow again 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.819
 be alone 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.139
 I do not want anymore 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.969
 premiere 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:28.339
 only what we see is 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:31.339
 this failed 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.389
 presses from below 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.839
 that's all 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:47.879
 avoid that you are sometimes even a few days possible cards 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:50.579
 we have a relatively lucky hold 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.799
 It is very very far to the south 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.399
 deliver anyway 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.399
 by a bursting are always on 20 times 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.779
 Burglars front los scorer John then of course you ask yourself already 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:09.979
 okay the 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:13.339
 sailing in the North Atlantic was really smart 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:15.439
 24 hours 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:16.449
 sailing 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:19.449
 also means 24 hours a day for black and green 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.589
 because winter is the few to the west 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:35.749
 There is not much left as first time 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:38.299
 to make a Father Brown tours 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.129
 Swap Chopin 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.169
 to change the tax Lyon 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.169
 so loud little correction that constantly be on the way 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.409
 because that is all done 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.139
 then you have time 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.139
 that really 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:57.429
 started well 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:00.049
 to see this spectacle 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.649

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.259
