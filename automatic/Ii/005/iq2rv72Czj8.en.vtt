00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.760
 hello good morning to all the guys 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.310
 and girls now we are here in minecraft 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:25.210
 good and I'll show you a way 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.259
 giving a click with the hand 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.840
 if giving a click with the right button 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:35.079
 they make those structures look 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.719
 or whatever it is that be pyramid 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.730
 we put this block that can be captured 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:43.710
 and we give it to him with his hand or with what 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.710
 we want and leave that structure 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.360
 viso has been detected lol 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.140
 well there are different blocks as you see 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.790
 how is this one put all at the foot 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.790
 so you can see well look 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.829
 I would have to know up but the 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.829
 on 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:16.960
 It's your neighborhood but I can not get 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.430
 well this is a lighthouse the typical lighthouse 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.320
 and this is like fake beaches 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.110
 prohibits razing all this is a table 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.350
 of enchantments works a hundred times 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.350
 one hundred 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.090
 and then there is the house is whatever 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.700
 normal 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.700
 an open door in my house 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.580
 Then there is this other type of house that 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.820
 It comes out in cactus around it 's like that 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.820
 Question 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.960
 but it's this other type of house that has 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.960
 so fire over here because this will kill you 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.990
 and then there is this weird pond they are not 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.899
 stable enough for you to throw with him 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:12.400
 in the east of shooting, we go with the boat 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:14.620
 pussy and this kind of tree look 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.750
 is mined of bugs 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.750
 because this is like stone 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.450
 It is a rare leaf 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.220
 I would like to see 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.220
 is 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.650
 you see that this trunk 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:39.040
 this sheet is very rare 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:43.230
 well more things you can make berries 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.230
 gates closed 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.569
 they can be blocks 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.300
 but it is also extend and crops 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.640
 giving a click you do all that 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.640
 crops and the same for this type 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:05.840
 here this assange is the block 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:08.690
 I have clearly seen this from above 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.660
 good photo slide 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.120
 and another type of house that is everything 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.300
 It has a shape of what will come out 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.520
 this is like more a store in ovens 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.120
 values ​​and everything 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.600
 well here another guy is the sand without 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.700
 fire or anything then here another kind of 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.860
 house east 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.970
 It is curious looks like a trench 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.570
 caution 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.500
 and here melon crops is a click for 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.880
 melon forever 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.880
 and here the same but with 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.960
 and pumpkins 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.470
 it's around here then a jail 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.410
 entered breaking 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.040
 this in theory would be a separate cell 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.930
 from another one above in the rotor 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.640
 this is good if you do not see these cells 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.099
 this mode is pretty good for when 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.469
 that accept a quick house I also think 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.930
 that consumed little material with this what 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:16.530
 same but obsidian so it's not going 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:21.639
 to teach and an abuser has touched me 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.780
 this a few rails like walsh that you 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.950
 create over here 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.220
 therefore it is by more clear 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.240
 this building 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.490
 and look that you want torches to come out 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.729
 and that when cutting a building because it has 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.370
 have to expand a building again what 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:44.889
 we can re -attach you see what is 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.889
 also for click may by apply 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.710
 then there is this one that comes out of this bird 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.830
 It's like a bird I think it's a plane 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.930
 he 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.930
 I think a bird more than a good 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.430
 a boy can be be all about this 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.780
 mode now we will pass to her to comment 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:12.340
 well this is from a mine I think it was 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:17.199
 this block this 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:20.440
 this is the light plans of the mine 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.650
 you think a hole is made but here 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.650
 as 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.490
 like here fuck you are going to say like 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.490
 here 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:36.960
 and there is no space space directly 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:39.050
 there is no land because it does not contain a 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.050
 hole 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.759
 good 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:49.789
 this spider is as well as the edge 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:55.310
 that like skewers in a typical jail 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:59.670
 good and he is as stable so far 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.790
 I already missed musicians landscapes 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.560
 fear 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.970
 but he explained quickly because it's very 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.790
 simple 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.889
 you download this instant folder 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.830
 massive structures 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:15.069
 is to be here I say it's all 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.440
 because I have extracted and we give here 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:20.220
 install windows 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.850
 let's install 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:28.020
 let's see how good he will ask us if it is 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:30.780
 that I have not yet put of minecraft no 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:35.280
 I have fuck I do not have updated now 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:37.950
 so I'll ask the first 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.389
 will ask us if you want to delete the 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:45.180
 goal and you give that if you erase slaves 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:47.080
 then those who install the audio mode is that 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.819
 do not 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.669
 and the ader module is also going to 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:54.340
 ask to give him that of all those 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:57.490
 in the instructions are super easy 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:01.419
 is to give if not and you do not have to have 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:04.180
 minecraft updated and then there's that 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:05.979
 be reinstalled and open minecraft and for 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.319
 perfectly so I hope that I have 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:12.419
