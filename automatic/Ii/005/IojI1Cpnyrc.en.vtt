00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.350
 15 terabytes per Potsdam 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.350
 with 20 million 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.469
 finally right 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.339
 it is quiet for many children 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.949
 I do not understand 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.770
 to 13 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.770
 of course very disappointing to strengthen so own 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.030
 lost sight of 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.030
 Gelsenkirchen 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.990
 the game tipped 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.340
 do not let us get it 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.710
 but also chubby Switzerland entered 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.790
 LÃ¶w hopes that she will be able to get away soon, at least for the time being 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.120
 The perpetrators of violence did not look so violent but heard 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.100
 These times can 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.100
 he qualifies 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
 change with the last sentence 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.420
 I think 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.440
 The Greens would know enough are all stood the must 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.439
 compete and give this first half 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.980
 Battis does not see him being matched here yet but they just have to 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.810
 use 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.689
 shot on goal and that's the 139th 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.080
 the essence Hanseatic city in any case 30 0 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.080
 to bring the time 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.909
