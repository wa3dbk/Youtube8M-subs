00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.490
 olan alpha technicians in afa techniques in this video we will know how to 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.660
 transforms sound into electricity and how electricity is transformed 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.369
 sound with the principle of electromagnetism and we do that with 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.460
 two utensils that we use daily in the radios ones the microphone and others 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.220
 are the loudspeakers let's start with the microphone then if we remove the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.750
 grid to a microphone 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.610
 what we can see inside it that a few little threads of copper 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.450
 rolled around a piece inside what is there is a magnet 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.450
 those kilos of copper are known as vineyards 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.970
 around this copper thread wants to avoid 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.179
 one in parana 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:47.569
 they can be made of plastic, generating a very thin plastic 

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:51.140
 and what we do when speaking we want our waves to cut the 

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:52.710
 particles that are in the air 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.750
 and those particles those sound points of our voice 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.200
 pressing this membrane that is here 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.950
 the membrane is attached to the bovine and the coil what it does are small 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.289
 displacements small movements 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:06.800
 around the sea 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.820
 puel prince electromagnetism says that all humility all copper thread 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.180
 as it is around a magnet when it moves generates some currents 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.979
 very little current to the target 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.550
 that comes out the back by the connector 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.610
 therefore we have sound waves we squeeze what is the membrane of the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.170
 microphone moves the coil around the magnet 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.680
 and we produce a son 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.340
 this in kumite form it dynamic these microphones are of this class we already know 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.440
 that there are other condenser microphones 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.659
 The gift of the system is a bit different because there are two layers of a capacitor 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.800
 that is moving with the sound pressure 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.180
 but in the case of the dynamic one this is how we transform the sound into 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.600
 electricity but how is the simple reverse process of the microphone going to 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.810
 go out to the console and from the console and an amplifier we're going to take it to a 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.410
 speaker the speaker is similar to the microphone we could say that it is the 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.960
 inverse of the microphone 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.140
 very simple if we turn around 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.200
 we will observe that they have the cables by which they carry the electricity 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.619
 a little cable we see that there is a copper wire 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.379
 that are going to inside the two cables 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.689
 and here we have also kuin hand we can check that your sister that 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.099
 we have the screws we see how they stick on the magnet 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.780
 correct and we have a membrane similar to the microphone what it does 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:27.489
 electricity electricity moves this work that is around the magnet 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.690
 and there small displacements 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.509
 now we are going to see it from this membrane 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:36.529
 When the membrane moves fruit of the electricity that is arriving it goes 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.529
 generating a pressure the particles in the air 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.709
 we are afraid 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.030
 shortly before President Alan Garcia as we can see 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.470
 it is a reverse process the soundtrack petra the membrane we produce 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.509
 electricity 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:53.669
 electricity as another membrane that generates a sound pressure some 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.669
 vibrations in the air and therefore only in them 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.829
 it is an infunctional microphone and so a loudspeaker works 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.010
 we could deduce then how are 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.969
 reverse devices that one can function like the other 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.050
 yes, it is very simple if we grab a small hearing aid 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.290
 and we connect it to the computer mic input and we talk 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.999
 for him 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:17.379
 let's see what with hearing aids can be aggravated because it is just like a 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.920
 microphone but upside down 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.140
 well yes electricity works so the sound of if we convert is 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.780
 sonia in electricity and electricity sound
