00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 last they are telling me that with the theme 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.930
 of the fruit I do not want to talk about who stole 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.480
 the fruit to make then sell the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:17.190
 fruit salads at home the first 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:19.920
 Once Robert had the last one 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.189
 steal to this date was the kiosk of 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.680
 neighborhood of the boys and my grandfather 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.199
 he found out and he kicked me in the ass 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.210
 tremendous baby told me I'm not 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.510
 hitting why you stole but because 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.760
 you stole affects what you examine and in that 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.920
 I understood what 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.620
 to be a thief you have to have ethics 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.449
 also know what steal if 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.430
 example the robbery and robbing a 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.430
 bank for example me 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:01:00.670
 would be something pleasant would be something of what 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:01:07.560
 that he admired deeply in the 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.560
 Catchers a very nice song 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.200
 and in a time that I knew a boy 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:19.030
 it's good that later he went to the 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.580
 bahamas and he did well a gap and with 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.710
 Gabriel fantasized we faked and 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.740
 rent a house near the bank of 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.830
 quilmes we knew what it was but not 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.950
 we were moles and our engineering did not 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.209
 we are moving 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.009
 it was only in fantasy but 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:38.130
 steal a bank about the most things 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.130
 cute 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.000
 in the terrible midnight 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:58.980
 that is the elegance of violence and that 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:06.260
 not because that is 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:06.260
 and does not justify the means 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:16.170
 art with the machine 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:25.720
 and it works well if I die of admiration 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:28.000
 it's one of the things that was part 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.750
 of forgiveness and a band of us 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.900
 for example not at gunpoint to steal a 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.750
 car and exit from a return to the market 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.750
 when they end up leaving it 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.750
 Barcelona 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.489
 in an audio like that, the girl who 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.510
 you like 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.430
 if you play the voice and take a beautiful turn the 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.140
 from house in the house to the back you leave the 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.140
 great auto tips 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:05.670
 same in the supermarket 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.420
 for example I like 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.170
 and I love that what is wrong is very 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.600
 cute is more I'm composing a 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.060
 song that is called just bad 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.110
 this spiral chatruc and the chorus and 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.110
 the chorus says 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.159
 I want the most beautiful bottle more beautiful 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.500
 I want the most beautiful bottle, today I 'm going to 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:48.220
 bring me bad and I do not want to be 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.180
 normal I do not want to be normal anymore 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.180
 to bring evil 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:59.560
 has three children that's not an example 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.410
 for his daughters but 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.010
 and we are in the plane of the 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.010
 fantasy 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.550
 you do not have money you do not have a match and 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.280
 is without work already 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.500
 the television channels forgot you 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.530
 the theater companies know that 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.930
 you worked with the television did not you 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.150
 they want to see more if the producers that 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.150
 they love you and they say this man 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:42.340
 friends on the street are larger if 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.340
 seeing your children to grandchildren 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.780
 is the fantasy a little truck 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:04.699
 little things are very good 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.470
 one of the techniques that I recommend that 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:11.190
 There is a poncho with a poncho 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:16.440
 put this this is this is it works 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:21.199
 it always works like this but more 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.830
 things more things can happen like this 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.350
 quietly 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.310
 quietly as long as you 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.310
 are you chatting 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.480
 one of the things that they mention to us but 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.880
 quickly as long as you have a 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:41.020
 underpants with elastic if this is 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.820
 Now I do not have to do much because 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.820
 I have a better or nothing 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:56.689
 another one of the things that work very well 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:59.139
 very well in the middle it becomes a 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.139
 changuito 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:06.699
 in every supermarket that you see 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:10.379
 to go to lamb check the head 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.379
 when there is one thing
