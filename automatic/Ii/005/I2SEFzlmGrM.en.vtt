00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
and that is when you're taking the metal

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.020 
and that is when you're taking the metal
and<00:01:04.670> actually<00:01:05.210> painting<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:06.350> metal<00:01:06.710> down<00:01:07.030> so

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
and actually painting the metal down so

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.610 
and actually painting the metal down so
this<00:01:08.360> right<00:01:08.870> here<00:01:08.930> is<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:10.370> quarter<00:01:10.790> inch

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
this right here is a quarter inch

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.520 
this right here is a quarter inch
actually<00:01:12.620> this<00:01:12.710> is<00:01:12.920> five<00:01:13.100> sixteenth<00:01:13.640> inch<00:01:13.940> bar

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
actually this is five sixteenth inch bar

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.650 
actually this is five sixteenth inch bar
what<00:01:15.530> he<00:01:15.860> actually<00:01:16.070> can<00:01:16.430> do<00:01:16.610> is<00:01:16.940> actually<00:01:17.210> fit

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
what he actually can do is actually fit

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.350 
what he actually can do is actually fit
it<00:01:17.810> out<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.770> can<00:01:18.950> get<00:01:19.130> it<00:01:19.250> down<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.640> an<00:01:20.090> eighth

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
it out you can get it down to an eighth

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.800 
it out you can get it down to an eighth
inch<00:01:20.660> round<00:01:21.610> or<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:22.820> can<00:01:22.970> even<00:01:23.060> square<00:01:23.570> it<00:01:23.690> up

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
inch round or you can even square it up

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.630 
inch round or you can even square it up
but<00:01:24.380> that's<00:01:24.560> what<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:24.830> do<00:01:24.979> is<00:01:25.100> just<00:01:25.220> lending

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
but that's what you do is just lending

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.120 
but that's what you do is just lending
it<00:01:25.820> out<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.270> actually<00:01:26.450> extending<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.860> length

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
it out and actually extending the length

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.660 
it out and actually extending the length
of<00:01:28.369> it<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:28.700> this<00:01:28.820> is<00:01:29.060> 48<00:01:29.540> inches<00:01:30.430> right<00:01:31.430> now

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
of it so this is 48 inches right now

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.390 
of it so this is 48 inches right now
after<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:32.630> can<00:01:32.840> make<00:01:33.080> it<00:01:33.259> I<00:01:33.440> don't<00:01:33.619> know<00:01:33.740> maybe

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
after you can make it I don't know maybe

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.190 
after you can make it I don't know maybe
50<00:01:34.880> inches<00:01:35.180> after<00:01:35.360> you<00:01:35.570> stretch<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.080> whole

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
50 inches after you stretch the whole

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.160 
50 inches after you stretch the whole
bar<00:01:36.410> out<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:37.490> that's<00:01:38.300> what<00:01:38.479> throwing<00:01:38.930> it<00:01:39.050> out

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
bar out so that's what throwing it out

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.800 
bar out so that's what throwing it out
means<00:01:39.470> we<00:01:39.680> go<00:01:39.860> show<00:01:40.580> you<00:01:40.640> how<00:01:40.880> it's<00:01:41.060> done<00:01:43.810> ok

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
means we go show you how it's done ok

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.210 
means we go show you how it's done ok
now<00:01:44.990> when<00:01:45.140> drawing<00:01:45.380> out<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.590> bar<00:01:45.860> you<00:01:46.040> don't

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
now when drawing out the bar you don't

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.650 
now when drawing out the bar you don't
want<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.460> just<00:01:46.580> hit<00:01:46.820> it<00:01:46.850> in<00:01:47.060> one<00:01:47.270> certain<00:01:47.509> spot

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
want to just hit it in one certain spot

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.740 
want to just hit it in one certain spot
constantly<00:01:48.610> because<00:01:49.610> all<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:50.479> would<00:01:50.630> be

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
constantly because all you would be

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.630 
constantly because all you would be
doing<00:01:50.869> is<00:01:51.229> flattening<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.890> bar<00:01:52.100> out<00:01:52.369> and

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
doing is flattening the bar out and

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.280 
doing is flattening the bar out and
you'd<00:01:53.090> be<00:01:53.210> taking<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.630> heat<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:53.960> actually

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
you'd be taking the heat and actually

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.320 
you'd be taking the heat and actually
transferring<00:01:54.830> it<00:01:55.009> into<00:01:55.040> whatever<00:01:55.640> your<00:01:55.880> anvil

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
transferring it into whatever your anvil

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.050 
transferring it into whatever your anvil
is<00:01:56.740> right<00:01:57.740> now<00:01:57.890> i'm<00:01:58.039> using<00:01:58.369> a<00:01:58.429> railroad<00:01:58.850> tie

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
is right now i'm using a railroad tie

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.910 
is right now i'm using a railroad tie
but<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.630> know<00:01:59.750> if<00:01:59.869> you<00:01:59.960> have<00:02:00.080> an<00:02:00.200> actual<00:02:00.380> anvil

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
but you know if you have an actual anvil

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.400 
but you know if you have an actual anvil
you'd<00:02:01.429> be<00:02:01.580> transferring<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.179> heat<00:02:02.410> every

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
you'd be transferring the heat every

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.580 
you'd be transferring the heat every
time<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.710> smashed<00:02:04.069> it<00:02:04.280> into<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.700> anvil<00:02:05.590> so

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
time you smashed it into the anvil so

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.770 
time you smashed it into the anvil so
when<00:02:06.950> you're<00:02:07.069> doing<00:02:07.399> it<00:02:07.550> you<00:02:08.240> actually<00:02:08.630> buy<00:02:08.750> a

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
when you're doing it you actually buy a

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.420 
when you're doing it you actually buy a
smack<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:09.380> here<00:02:10.180> rotate<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.390> 90<00:02:11.660> degrees<00:02:11.690> and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
smack it here rotate it 90 degrees and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.080 
smack it here rotate it 90 degrees and
then<00:02:13.430> hit<00:02:13.700> again<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:15.230> get<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:16.730> start

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
then hit again to get to start

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.970 
then hit again to get to start
stretching<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.810> out<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.200> they<00:02:18.319> rotate<00:02:18.350> it

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
stretching it out and they rotate it

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.620 
stretching it out and they rotate it
back<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:20.510> then<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.900> rotate<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.380> back<00:02:22.630> back

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
back and then you rotate it back back

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.809 
back and then you rotate it back back
and<00:02:23.810> forth<00:02:24.080> like<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.319> you<00:02:24.620> can<00:02:24.770> even<00:02:24.890> go<00:02:25.069> you

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
and forth like that you can even go you

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.070 
and forth like that you can even go you
know<00:02:25.940> two<00:02:26.000> times<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.959> then<00:02:27.650> go<00:02:27.830> like<00:02:28.010> this<00:02:28.190> and

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
know two times and then go like this and

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.570 
know two times and then go like this and
then<00:02:30.080> once<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.440> start<00:02:30.740> get<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.220> the

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
then once you start get it to the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.720 
then once you start get it to the
diameter<00:02:31.819> you<00:02:32.240> want<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:33.160> stretched<00:02:34.160> out<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.430> be

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
diameter you want it stretched out to be

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.150 
diameter you want it stretched out to be
or<00:02:35.060> whatever<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:36.410> can<00:02:36.620> actually<00:02:36.830> start

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
or whatever you can actually start

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.940 
or whatever you can actually start
finishing<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:37.819> up<00:02:37.880> by<00:02:38.150> smaller<00:02:38.510> hits<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.260> kind

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
finishing it up by smaller hits and kind

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.710 
finishing it up by smaller hits and kind
of<00:02:40.010> shaping<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.819> little<00:02:41.120> bit<00:02:41.270> better<00:02:41.420> how

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
of shaping it a little bit better how

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.330

guys<00:03:33.639> well<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.389> is<00:03:34.629> the<00:03:35.250> drawing<00:03:36.250> out

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
guys well that is the drawing out

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.319 
guys well that is the drawing out
technique<00:03:37.060> it's<00:03:37.419> a<00:03:37.959> very<00:03:38.349> basic<00:03:38.950> method<00:03:39.700> for<00:03:40.299> a

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
technique it's a very basic method for a

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.379 
technique it's a very basic method for a
blacksmith's<00:03:40.989> but<00:03:41.590> it's<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:41.889> must<00:03:42.189> note<00:03:42.489> here's

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
blacksmith's but it's a must note here's

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.399 
blacksmith's but it's a must note here's
the<00:03:43.810> end<00:03:44.560> result<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:46.540> can<00:03:46.629> see<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.959> little

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
the end result you can see the little

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.020 
the end result you can see the little
point<00:03:47.739> on<00:03:48.099> it<00:03:48.780> it's<00:03:49.780> used<00:03:50.230> in<00:03:50.590> many<00:03:50.859> ways<00:03:51.030> my

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
point on it it's used in many ways my

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.179 
point on it it's used in many ways my
hooks<00:03:52.299> that<00:03:52.510> made<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.930> other<00:03:53.019> day<00:03:53.169> it<00:03:54.010> would

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:54.189 
hooks that made the other day it would

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:55.860 
hooks that made the other day it would
have<00:03:54.280> been<00:03:54.310> an<00:03:54.519> added<00:03:54.849> feature<00:03:54.879> if<00:03:55.480> I<00:03:55.629> had

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
have been an added feature if I had

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.170 
have been an added feature if I had
drawn<00:03:56.530> out<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:57.099> tip<00:03:57.579> and<00:03:57.879> then<00:03:57.970> actually

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
drawn out the tip and then actually

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.929 
drawn out the tip and then actually
curled<00:03:58.629> it<00:03:58.840> over<00:03:59.169> it<00:03:59.560> adds<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.370> little<00:04:00.459> bit<00:04:00.609> more

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
curled it over it adds a little bit more

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.860 
curled it over it adds a little bit more
decoration<00:04:01.629> to<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:02.729> you<00:04:03.729> can<00:04:03.940> draw<00:04:04.209> out<00:04:04.389> square

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
decoration to it you can draw out square

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.479 
decoration to it you can draw out square
stock<00:04:05.560> as<00:04:05.799> well<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.340> try<00:04:06.760> to<00:04:06.819> keep<00:04:07.329> the<00:04:07.540> square

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
stock as well and try to keep the square

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.219 
stock as well and try to keep the square
form<00:04:09.489> of<00:04:09.669> it<00:04:09.819> and<00:04:10.120> that's<00:04:10.299> when<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.810> actually

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:11.229 
form of it and that's when you actually

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:14.339 
form of it and that's when you actually
hit<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:11.889> then<00:04:12.010> you<00:04:12.129> rotate<00:04:12.690> 90<00:04:13.690> degrees<00:04:13.720> and

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
hit and then you rotate 90 degrees and

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:15.960 
hit and then you rotate 90 degrees and
you<00:04:14.440> hit<00:04:14.680> you<00:04:14.829> want<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.129> try<00:04:15.250> key<00:04:15.489> that<00:04:15.669> square

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
you hit you want to try key that square

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.779 
you hit you want to try key that square
form<00:04:16.269> and<00:04:16.659> all<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.440> is<00:04:17.470> doing<00:04:17.799> is<00:04:18.220> stretching

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
form and all it is doing is stretching

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.960 
form and all it is doing is stretching
the<00:04:18.880> metal<00:04:19.209> out<00:04:20.010> where<00:04:21.010> round<00:04:21.310> you<00:04:21.579> can<00:04:21.729> kind

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
the metal out where round you can kind

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.420 
the metal out where round you can kind
of<00:04:22.060> do<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.389> 90<00:04:22.690> degrees<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:23.949> just<00:04:24.159> kind

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
of do the 90 degrees and you just kind

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.909 
of do the 90 degrees and you just kind
of<00:04:24.550> try<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:24.909> keep<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.270> roundness<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:25.990> but

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
of try to keep the roundness to it but

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.120

it's<00:04:27.370> a<00:04:27.490> very<00:04:27.520> basic<00:04:27.940> technique<00:04:29.130> it's
