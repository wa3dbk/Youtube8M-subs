start it and then I actually use the
drill<00:02:57.030> press<00:02:57.090> as<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.630> can<00:02:57.780> see<00:02:57.990> here<00:02:58.380> in<00:02:58.830> order

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
drill press as you can see here in order

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.500 
drill press as you can see here in order
to<00:02:59.130> drill<00:02:59.340> all<00:02:59.460> the<00:02:59.580> way<00:02:59.700> through<00:03:00.030> that's

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
to drill all the way through that's

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.730 
to drill all the way through that's
because<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.810> don't<00:03:00.990> want<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.230> damage<00:03:01.440> the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
because I don't want to damage the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:21.400 
because I don't want to damage the
surface<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.400> rotary<00:03:02.760> table

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.040 

drill<00:03:21.650> out<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:21.860> four<00:03:22.520> bolt<00:03:22.910> holes<00:03:23.150> for<00:03:23.810> these

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
drill out the four bolt holes for these

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.890 
drill out the four bolt holes for these
studs<00:03:24.350> all<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.340> way<00:03:25.400> through<00:03:25.730> at<00:03:26.120> the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
studs all the way through at the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.530 
studs all the way through at the
appropriate<00:03:27.550> diameters<00:03:28.550> so<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:28.790> can<00:03:29.030> tap<00:03:29.300> them

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
appropriate diameters so I can tap them

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.040 
appropriate diameters so I can tap them
later<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:31.100> will<00:03:31.580> not<00:03:31.760> draw<00:03:32.090> out<00:03:32.210> the<00:03:32.390> center<00:03:32.840> and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
later I will not draw out the center and

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.200 
later I will not draw out the center and
the<00:03:33.800> reason<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.220> because<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.670> center<00:03:34.910> drill

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
the reason is because the center drill

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.130 
the reason is because the center drill
leaves<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.630> nice<00:03:35.780> beveled<00:03:37.840> partially<00:03:38.840> drills

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
leaves a nice beveled partially drills

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.590 
leaves a nice beveled partially drills
all<00:03:39.380> kind<00:03:40.310> of<00:03:40.370> like<00:03:40.460> a<00:03:40.490> cone<00:03:40.790> actually<00:03:41.390> and

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
all kind of like a cone actually and

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.530 
all kind of like a cone actually and
that<00:03:42.380> cone<00:03:42.740> being<00:03:43.400> in<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.700> center<00:03:44.090> of<00:03:44.120> this

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
that cone being in the center of this

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.570 
that cone being in the center of this
hub<00:03:45.110> allows<00:03:45.860> me<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.250> use<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:48.250> which<00:03:49.250> we<00:03:49.400> call

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
hub allows me to use the which we call

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.840 
hub allows me to use the which we call
it<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.700> live<00:03:50.230> Center<00:03:51.230> in<00:03:51.800> my<00:03:52.010> tail<00:03:52.280> stock<00:03:52.610> on

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
it the live Center in my tail stock on

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.970 
it the live Center in my tail stock on
my<00:03:53.030> late<00:03:53.240> so<00:03:53.930> when<00:03:54.080> I'm<00:03:54.170> done<00:03:54.380> I<00:03:54.410> can<00:03:54.740> chuck

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
my late so when I'm done I can chuck

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.310 
my late so when I'm done I can chuck
this<00:03:55.130> dead<00:03:55.460> center<00:03:55.880> and<00:03:56.060> then<00:03:56.420> skim<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:57.020> front

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
this dead center and then skim the front

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.710 
this dead center and then skim the front
the<00:03:57.560> back<00:03:57.740> and<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:59.200> the<00:04:00.200> perimeter
