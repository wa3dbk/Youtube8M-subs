00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.270
 very good people here debutan cow with 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.310
 a new video this time I bring you the 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.770
 twelfth myth of the series for this 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.590
 occasion we will go to the one that I believe is the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.110
 most known mountain of the game yes the 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.630
 mount chilia but not the mount itself 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.550
 but that strange cabin that if only we 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.620
 we set out to complete the story of the 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.410
 game we just went through it once 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.900
 Many have told me that inside her 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.090
 the famous murderer lives on one occasion 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.310
 Last time we went to the wood 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.410
 game but we found nothing me 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.329
 they said in the comments that there is not 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.329
 found but in the cabin that 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.550
 we will visit now before starting them 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.400
 I'm going to propose an idea that I'm just 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.560
 if it happens that the series of myths is 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.330
 the most beloved by all of you the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.520
 most of you see the myths 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.340
 while a small part is in 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.979
 this channel for the gameplays I'll go 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.619
 to the point, what about doing the following? 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.509
 when uploading a video independently 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.060
 of whatever I will ask in the description 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.630
 of the video a specific number of likes 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.000
 or more 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.280
 up as you want to call it when 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.189
 let's get to that requested number of likes 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.259
 is when to upload the next chapter 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.600
 for example if they want the following myth 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.000
 the goal of this video is 500 likes 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.500
 when we reach that goal raise the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.659
 next myth 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.939
 I think that's how I'm more interactive with 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.509
 you and if you want the following myth 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:53.119
 will depend on you something else about the 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.280
 Greetings since I sent the greeting 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.360
 until the many have begun to ask me 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.789
 Greetings which for me is not easy in 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.849
 a video there are approximately 300 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.429
 comments of which 80 are for 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:09.649
 ask for greetings I am always pending 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.769
 and I read all the comments 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.299
 noting those who want greetings 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.790
 I personally think that send them a 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.920
 greeting through the computerized voice of 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.030
 loquendo is something that does not have much 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.890
 sense 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.930
 I prefer to send greetings with me 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.030
 true voice for the greeting to be 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.459
 warm and with encouragement a voice 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.650
 computerized is cold and the greeting does not 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.880
 has that touch that love that I put 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.370
 in my videos 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.560
 for which I will send greetings with 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.590
 my true voice so they feel that 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.230
 I love my subscribers 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.230
 Now, I think we talk a lot, let's start 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.540
 if we remember the first mission in the 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.580
 field of the game was to come here and kill 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.320
 an alleged officer of the police who 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.170
 was against the methods that 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.660
 used tempel and after that I do not know 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.180
 again mention this cabin but yes 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.640
 that rumors have been created let's start with 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.950
 the research good if you're supposed to 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.060
 nobody lives here because this one is sanchez 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.610
 this bike is the most common in the field and 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.450
 personally my favorite let's go 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.450
 to see what we got 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.280
 go totally empty not even a 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.520
 furniture or something I'll put on my glasses 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.459
 night vision who knows but nothing of 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.470
 nothing as I understood you could see 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.780
 blood on the floor but I think it's 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.720
 confusion the blood on the floor is in 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.090
 the area of ​​lumberjacks let's see what's 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.420
 on the outside maybe we could find 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.420
 something 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.190
 Well maybe the house is ugly but it has 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.659
 open ocean view maybe that's why the 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.659
 policeman was here 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.540
 these three trees here are very 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.500
 different from the others the funny thing is that 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.500
 it's just these three 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.180
 ok nothing we found but we will apply what 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:03.669
 that we always wait for it to be 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.919
 night now that night is the atmosphere 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.229
 it's a little gloomy I've been awhile 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.780
 waiting and I tell you that nothing happened 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.479
 while I was waiting but we're going to 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.780
 investigate now that it has darkened ah 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:19.689
 because that lighting the cabin has 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.849
 that strange light that should not be 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:24.520
 completely empty without any source 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:28.530
 of lighting but still has a lot 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.530
 light even looks better than day 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.560
 come is much clearer at night is 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:47.750
 very weird like the fishers lagun 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.750
 has those random illuminations 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.720
 the sanchez yes that has changed but that 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.510
 there's nothing mysterious about that, that's where 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.310
 appears may appear blue at 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.700
 same as cream color like we just 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.700
 to see 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.910
 this is completely alone you do not see 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.910
 a soul as they say out there 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.650
 the mountain chilia yes it is dark the 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:35.220
 cottage has this random lighting 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.650
 which is something very, very strange 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.720
 we have investigated this curious cabin and 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.690
 unfortunately the most paranormal that 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.420
 we found were the lights outside 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.569
 that the cabin does not hide anything that more 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.659
 is the myth is 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:53.599
 fake personally I expected something more 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:55.849
 things like shadows sounds or that the 

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:58.339
 cottage had something different at night 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:00.770
 apart from that light I did not expect 

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:03.860
 find me the killer but if something that 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:06.439
 will draw attention a moment now that 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.929
 it comes to my mind they remember the mission 

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:11.089
 what I said at the beginning of the video now 

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:12.860
 that I think about if you're supposed to 

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:15.050
 the only people who knew the 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.389
 policeman's location they were just 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.240
 other cops because when we got to 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:21.199
 this cabin is so protected and if not 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.330
 I remember badly 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:25.759
 tempe tells us that they are investigating a 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.889
 case for Mount Chilian will be that those 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.409
 police officers knew of the existence of 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:31.789
 murderer and they were actually there 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:34.159
 looking for him to kill him 

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:36.259
 it's something that I just came to the 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:39.139
 but I'll leave them to 

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:41.110
 you have another theory can 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:43.999
 leave it in the comments 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:46.459
 remember like they subscribe for more 

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:48.589
 videos and share the video so that more 

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:51.589
 people know this great family that 

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:52.670
 we have as channel and on the greetings 

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:55.220
 already knows 

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:58.400
 I prefer a thousand times to tell them with my voice 

00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:02.410
 that to a computerized voice that has been 

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.410
 everything for today debutan says goodbye
