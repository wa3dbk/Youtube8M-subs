00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.769
 it's a shame it's a shame because 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.360
 do we have failed we have had times 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.710
 weak weak moments in the game 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.529
 they match me I took the points 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.619
 especially with two yellow cards they have 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.680
 did raise their bulletin board 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.730
 and we started at ten 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.470
 last minute thumped at home 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.480
 because if we did that if we had 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.859
 did that all the game we would have put 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.420
 more points than I thought 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.180
 that's it yeah 5000 against teams 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.500
 like that five minutes of floating and 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.719
 we take two tests especially that they have 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.559
 the back who is who is fabulous and he 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.840
 must be put under pressure all the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.969
 time so here it is it's a pity 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.289
 now you have to see to analyze 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.590
 work and and the best will be remains 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.989
 to be continued 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.690
 yes disappointment deception of the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.790
 performance even though it was not we did not 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.689
 not been helped in there but yeah have 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.770
 good times did not sit tonight 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.770
 and defensively and offensively 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.549
 we did not have offensive cohesion 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:23.009
 hoped defensively some of our 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:25.689
 principles have let us down so 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.549
 sending the face to face to wigan that can 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.670
 forgive you we knew before the 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.670
 match 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.149
 it's confirmed after the match the 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.500
 motivation is sincerely motivated it's 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.619
 what I said to the guys at the motivation 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.240
 was there in the latitudes 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.829
 the boys answered present a term 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.860
 and in terms of attitude there is nothing to 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.080
 say in za 13 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.490
 I spent ten minutes or even 20 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.310
 minutes forgiveness to at 11 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.869
 you face wigan his share in the device 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.360
 yet learned that 13 points second 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.340
 half time we mean it wants 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.450
 to say that here you are working hard one 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.929
 for others but that's not it 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.560
 not been often enough tonight I think 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:15.400
 Offensively it's the game I'm 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:19.239
 the most 10 us despite all remarks 16 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:23.100
 points but I think we have not been 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.720
 smart enough I think we did not 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.690
 enough worked for each other with the 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.670
 balloon and a lot of direct miss of 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.160
 lack support of so-called 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.889
 checks are in a we missed that we have 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.720
 had our 9/7 6-1 that was not on the 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:44.500
 same wavelength 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.030
 whenever he has been asked 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.480
 good questions and annoy the defense 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:54.310
 of wigan is unfortunately past 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.560
 tonight between and here are so lessons 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.190
 again retaining cougar plays this 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.500
 evening I look pretty much chora of them 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:07.209
 two live games of the weekend on sky 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.680
 and for the preparation of the match 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.620
 the opposition how do I have the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.599
 look at the two three matches so I 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.650
 wins I will have two last three 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:20.030
 matches this weekend I saw 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.620
 two son pastel fawn son witness the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.720
 flora that explains me anyway common 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.250
 many times there is a plating like this and 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.530
 as once he gets out a yellow card 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.970
 so I went to see james zhan one 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.870
 with whom I have a very good relationship 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:40.010
 he told me it was automatic I 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:42.319
 do you want to be here after to predict a term 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.950
 of aggression I tell you I do not think so 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.390
 we are more aggressive than wigan but 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.940
 we are more punished than seeing that 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.470
 it's a fact that it's an observation I 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.599
 do not want to redo the match and it's not 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.629
 an excuse it's not an excuse I think 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.849
 not that I want to fix what we can 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.549
 fix that I can not fix it it's a 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.930
 problem i can not fix the end the end 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.379
 of the first half is a turning point 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.849
 I think that defensively we went 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.280
 a little beside 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.049
 on the last ten minutes see and 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.900
 then your goal on two cartons 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:18.320
 yellow after after that's gonna 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.060
 boys they have they wanted tonight 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.789
 they were aggressive were none 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.900
 aggression and that's it I do not think 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:27.740
 that we are more aggressive than 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.010
 the opposition yet on arrival there is 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.690
 2 0 it was in the first half with the 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.090
 wind it was very hard to leave home 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.770
 we and as I tell you to get out of 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.289
 with us, we still have to give it 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.030
 it's important that the ball is 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.539
 damn support someone has info 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.979
 who that's questions asked if 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.289
 it's of such a wigan they have 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:51.800
 used to flatten at 3.4 to have a 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:55.520
 very very good at speed and often we 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.949
 typed 30 meters 40 m I come back on 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.099
 the point will lelas play the last held 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:04.280
 the kick and quality of blow 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.490
 foot and improve but the five outfits 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.009
 before 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.310
 a theme that can ask questions 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:13.110
 it cgr because it's a big one 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.840
 matches like that it happens like that 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.389
 both were in terms of resources 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.720
 term to play foot no more no more 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:27.210
 here is there communication cohesion 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:30.090
 part of the question asked is the 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.840
 last held one that's the responsibility 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.849
 from 9 7 6 1 and morgan flying also there 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.440
 in is an option and that showed 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:41.340
 in the past they were a good 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.710
 option that's not on the same length 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.940
 wave so it's frustrating if we 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:49.310
 look at the bulletin board but 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:51.419
 it's a stunt after difficult to 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:57.240
 I tell you I will fix what has 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:06:01.380
 fixed after deadlines are piped 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.530
 shot at 24 to 10 at the half time I was 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:08.759
 just is still pretty confident 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.590
 yeah not sincerely after two boxes 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.310
 yellows 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:16.770
 start by entering the shoulders but 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.020
 no it's an oath to 24 to 10 I knew 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:23.340
 that we could score two tests 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.960
 could we come back to see that 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.409
 it was quickly the dice were 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.330
 quickly pipe and so that's it's a 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:32.130
 stop with dice like you 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.069
 want as you want to announce it as you 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.110
 want to tell jeff jeff on a big 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:39.060
 match against between his old 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.400
 teammates I liked olivier 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.830
 bullish elements even though it was just 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:49.020
 at the limit of a sauna we are well 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:52.349
 aggression it would be nice to be able to 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.310
 give rest god some rest to some 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:57.670
 but 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:07:00.220
 we gave our start of the season 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.160
 calamitous allows it allows us a 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.880
 a little less at some positions 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:09.550
 so here we will continue to think about 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.540
 some options - that's all 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.110
 points all points are important 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.880
 and the two points that we find and sons 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:19.810
 are going to be because they stay on 5 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:23.490
 it's unhealthy defeats 4 4 wins 1 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.490
 tie they have a confidence that is 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.380
 who is at the highest and here we are 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:34.330
 took a quick shot behind the head this 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:37.320
 evening so we will make sure that this 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.320
 be bad for a good
