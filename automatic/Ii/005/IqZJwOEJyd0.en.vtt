00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
box here pretty much your standard fare

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.040

and this once again is too exciting

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.230 
and this once again is too exciting
spent<00:01:18.410> too<00:01:18.560> much<00:01:18.740> time<00:01:18.800> not<00:01:19.369> actually<00:01:19.850> looking

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
spent too much time not actually looking

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.210 
spent too much time not actually looking
at<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.450> thing<00:01:20.630> itself<00:01:21.020> especially<00:01:22.009> as<00:01:22.100> it

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
at the thing itself especially as it

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.660 
at the thing itself especially as it
needs<00:01:22.430> inflating<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:23.990> I<00:01:24.410> suppose<00:01:25.250> it's<00:01:25.580> about

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
needs inflating so I suppose it's about

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.050 
needs inflating so I suppose it's about
time<00:01:25.790> that<00:01:26.690> we<00:01:27.220> got<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.399> good<00:01:28.550> old<00:01:28.670> scissors

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
time that we got the good old scissors

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:51.609 
time that we got the good old scissors
out<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:32.110> ultimately<00:01:33.110> let's<00:01:34.070> dive<00:01:34.369> in<00:01:50.619> the

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
out and ultimately let's dive in the

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.699 
out and ultimately let's dive in the
real<00:01:51.860> trick<00:01:52.250> here<00:01:52.300> it's<00:01:53.300> going<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.600> be<00:01:53.750> trying

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
real trick here it's going to be trying

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.359 
real trick here it's going to be trying
to<00:01:54.800> open<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:56.170> there<00:01:57.170> no<00:01:57.410> way<00:01:57.679> that's<00:01:57.950> actually

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
to open it there no way that's actually

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.400 
to open it there no way that's actually
going<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.580> be<00:01:58.670> viewable<00:01:59.030> to<00:01:59.179> the<00:01:59.390> camera<00:01:59.810> so

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
going to be viewable to the camera so

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.160 
going to be viewable to the camera so
I'm<00:02:00.470> not<00:02:00.649> used<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:01.100> unboxing<00:02:01.759> things<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.390> are

this thing isn't going to be that big of
a<00:03:00.960> worry<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.470> me<00:03:01.740> because<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.370> can<00:03:02.550> literally

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
a worry to me because I can literally

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.910 
a worry to me because I can literally
put<00:03:03.210> it<00:03:03.240> off<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.600> back<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.050> boat<00:03:04.200> string

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.790 
put it off the back of the boat string
into<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.220> water<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:06.720> never<00:03:07.170> actually<00:03:07.410> have

into the water and never actually have

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.000 
into the water and never actually have
to<00:03:08.010> step<00:03:08.490> onto<00:03:08.730> any<00:03:09.030> dry<00:03:09.300> line<00:03:12.770> first<00:03:13.770> things

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
to step onto any dry line first things

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.970 
to step onto any dry line first things
first<00:03:14.100> we've<00:03:14.580> obviously<00:03:14.790> got<00:03:15.270> I<00:03:15.770> went<00:03:16.770> all

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
first we've obviously got I went all

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:32.560 
first we've obviously got I went all
here<00:03:17.540> oars<00:03:18.540> whatever<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.380> technical<00:03:19.740> team<00:03:20.130> is

and carefully this all looks really

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.900 
and carefully this all looks really
substantial<00:03:37.200> than<00:03:37.380> a<00:03:37.470> lot<00:03:37.710> a<00:03:38.010> lot<00:03:38.430> sturdier

than I was expecting
however<00:03:41.550> we're<00:03:42.090> only<00:03:42.270> a<00:03:42.450> fraction<00:03:43.050> of<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.530> way

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
sad like it like this is going to be a

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.030 
sad like it like this is going to be a
lot<00:03:49.800> better<00:03:50.100> quality<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:50.910> lot<00:03:51.120> more<00:03:51.420> solid

you can see a these this is going to be
simple<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.710> slot<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.250> you've<00:03:59.550> got<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.850> little

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
simple to slot in you've got the little

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.580 
simple to slot in you've got the little
weird<00:04:00.240> pressed<00:04:00.540> buttons<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.140> will<00:04:01.230> pop<00:04:01.410> up

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
weird pressed buttons that will pop up

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.620 
weird pressed buttons that will pop up
into<00:04:01.770> these<00:04:02.010> holes<00:04:02.220> we'll<00:04:03.090> have<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.240> look<00:04:03.390> at<00:04:03.540> it

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
into these holes we'll have a look at it

into these holes we'll have a look at it
all<00:04:03.780> properly<00:04:04.230> in<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.680> second

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:32.680

again<00:04:33.020> this<00:04:33.229> is<00:04:33.410> fairly<00:04:34.160> self-explanatory

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.100 

but<00:04:39.770> what<00:04:40.280> we<00:04:40.460> really<00:04:40.880> want<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.150> see<00:04:41.389> and

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
goodness knows how this is going to end

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:52.300 
goodness knows how this is going to end
up<00:04:44.060> on<00:04:44.240> a<00:04:44.510> film<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:48.580> how<00:04:49.580> we're<00:04:49.760> actual<00:04:51.310> kayak

itself oh you can see you've got a

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.790 
itself oh you can see you've got a
couple<00:04:56.180> of<00:04:56.270> separate<00:04:56.630> parts<00:04:56.990> here<00:04:57.169> for<00:04:57.560> the

some kind of seat to me so this is
already<00:05:20.780> far<00:05:21.139> more<00:05:21.350> substantial<00:05:21.590> than<00:05:22.310> I<00:05:22.430> was

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
already far more substantial than I was

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.650 
already far more substantial than I was
intended<00:05:23.210> up<00:05:23.360> expecting<00:05:23.960> it<00:05:24.260> to<00:05:24.410> be<00:05:25.330> and<00:05:26.330> so<00:05:26.510> he
