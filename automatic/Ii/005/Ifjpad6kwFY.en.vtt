00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
month this is his moment the network is

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.570 
month this is his moment the network is
one<00:00:20.039> time<00:00:20.520> if<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.090> look<00:00:21.330> behind<00:00:21.630> me<00:00:22.580> quantum

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
one time if you look behind me quantum

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.900 
one time if you look behind me quantum
has<00:00:23.789> achieved<00:00:24.180> amazing<00:00:24.650> growth<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.010> we<00:00:26.730> are

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
has achieved amazing growth and we are

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.870 
has achieved amazing growth and we are
reinvesting<00:00:27.810> our<00:00:28.140> money<00:00:28.590> back<00:00:29.250> into<00:00:29.730> you

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
reinvesting our money back into you

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.299

quantum<00:01:06.659> does<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.590> freedom<00:01:08.520> does

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
quantum does all that and freedom does

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.120 
quantum does all that and freedom does
