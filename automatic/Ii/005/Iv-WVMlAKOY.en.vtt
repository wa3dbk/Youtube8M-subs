and saw somebody that was making spoon

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.630 
and saw somebody that was making spoon
holders<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.740> I<00:02:01.740> thought<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.189> was<00:02:02.340> kind<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.549> a

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
holders and I thought that was kind of a

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.539 
holders and I thought that was kind of a
cool<00:02:02.970> idea<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.600> made<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.470> oh<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:05.189> don't<00:02:05.399> know

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
cool idea so I made it oh I don't know

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.389 
cool idea so I made it oh I don't know
it<00:02:05.670> half<00:02:06.630> dozen<00:02:06.990> or<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.140> these<00:02:07.500> spoon<00:02:07.920> holders

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
it half dozen or so these spoon holders

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.309 
it half dozen or so these spoon holders
because<00:02:09.209> i<00:02:09.420> figured<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.720> big<00:02:09.989> good<00:02:10.110> way<00:02:10.259> to

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
because i figured that big good way to

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.550 
because i figured that big good way to
fill<00:02:10.649> up<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:11.280> little<00:02:11.850> small<00:02:12.319> crevices<00:02:13.319> in<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
fill up a little small crevices in the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.620 
fill up a little small crevices in the
kiln<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:14.069> know<00:02:14.220> you're<00:02:14.430> always<00:02:14.549> looking<00:02:14.940> for

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
kiln you know you're always looking for

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.539 
kiln you know you're always looking for
stuff<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.930> could<00:02:16.049> just<00:02:16.230> throw<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.980> take<00:02:17.400> up

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
stuff you could just throw in to take up

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.020 
stuff you could just throw in to take up
space<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:19.549> anyway<00:02:20.549> I<00:02:20.580> got<00:02:20.760> done<00:02:20.880> with<00:02:20.910> the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
space and anyway I got done with the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.030 
space and anyway I got done with the
firing<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.810> had<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.200> bunch<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.500> family<00:02:22.860> come

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
firing and had a bunch of family come

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.059 
firing and had a bunch of family come
over<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.810> they<00:02:24.810> all<00:02:24.840> wanted<00:02:25.440> one<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.769> them<00:02:25.890> so

I ended up giving them all away it was

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.650 
I ended up giving them all away it was
kind<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.720> big<00:02:27.900> hit<00:02:28.140> it's<00:02:28.560> kind<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.549> know

kind of a big hit it's kind of you know
surprising<00:02:30.660> how<00:02:30.860> something<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:31.980> think<00:02:32.160> was

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
surprising how something you think was

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.770 
surprising how something you think was
just<00:02:32.489> going<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.760> be<00:02:33.170> an<00:02:34.170> extra<00:02:35.269> kiln<00:02:36.269> filling

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
just going to be an extra kiln filling

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.870 
just going to be an extra kiln filling
space<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.410> camp<00:02:37.680> ended<00:02:38.340> up<00:02:38.489> being<00:02:38.730> what

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
space and the camp ended up being what

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.960 
space and the camp ended up being what
everybody<00:02:39.269> thought<00:02:39.450> was<00:02:39.630> cool<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.799> anyway<00:02:41.130> so

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
everybody thought was cool so anyway so

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.220 
everybody thought was cool so anyway so
I<00:02:42.000> started<00:02:42.359> thinking<00:02:42.660> about<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.109> I

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
I started thinking about it and I

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.900 
I started thinking about it and I
thought<00:02:43.470> well<00:02:43.650> maybe<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:44.190> want<00:02:44.549> to<00:02:44.640> make<00:02:44.730> some

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
thought well maybe I want to make some

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.060 
thought well maybe I want to make some
I've<00:02:45.450> made<00:02:45.810> some<00:02:45.870> toothbrush<00:02:46.560> holders<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
I've made some toothbrush holders in the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.470 
I've made some toothbrush holders in the
past<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.519> think<00:02:47.640> I'm<00:02:47.820> going<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.000> make<00:02:48.150> some

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
past so I think I'm going to make some

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.400 
past so I think I'm going to make some
set<00:02:49.230> some<00:02:49.590> soap<00:02:50.160> dishes<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:51.410> toothbrush

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
set some soap dishes and toothbrush

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.210 
set some soap dishes and toothbrush
holders<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:54.540> thought<00:02:55.230> well<00:02:55.470> looking<00:02:56.130> at

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
holders and I thought well looking at

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.699 
holders and I thought well looking at
the<00:02:56.870> spoon<00:02:57.870> holder<00:02:58.290> if<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.530> did<00:02:58.680> something

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
the spoon holder if I did something

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.180 
the spoon holder if I did something
similar<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.609> that<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:01.590> could<00:03:01.769> pour<00:03:01.950> off<00:03:02.160> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
similar to that you could pour off the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.690 
similar to that you could pour off the
water<00:03:03.320> when<00:03:04.320> you're<00:03:04.500> done<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:04.829> help<00:03:05.280> keep<00:03:05.459> the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
water when you're done and help keep the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.190 
water when you're done and help keep the
soap<00:03:06.060> dry<00:03:06.299> you<00:03:06.359> know<00:03:06.570> so<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.870> doesn't<00:03:07.109> get

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
soap dry you know so it doesn't get

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.900 
soap dry you know so it doesn't get
mushy<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:08.250> then<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.549> was<00:03:08.640> kind<00:03:08.820> of<00:03:08.850> looking

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
mushy and then I was kind of looking

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.970 
mushy and then I was kind of looking
around<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.600> thought<00:03:09.780> well<00:03:10.019> how<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.769> put

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
around and I thought well how to put

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.590 
around and I thought well how to put
some<00:03:11.130> grooves<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.760> kind<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.000> hold<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.359> soap

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
some grooves and kind of hold the soap

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.810 
some grooves and kind of hold the soap
up<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.930> little<00:03:13.200> bit<00:03:13.320> so<00:03:13.590> that's<00:03:14.370> kind<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.670> what<00:03:14.790> I

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
up a little bit so that's kind of what I

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.880 
up a little bit so that's kind of what I
did<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.630> got<00:03:15.989> one<00:03:16.230> here<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.560> I've<00:03:16.709> already

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
did and I got one here that I've already

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.440 
did and I got one here that I've already
kind<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.280> made<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.549> pour<00:03:17.760> spout<00:03:17.790> on<00:03:18.090> right

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
kind of made the pour spout on right

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.960 
kind of made the pour spout on right
there<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.709> I'm<00:03:20.250> getting<00:03:20.459> ready<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.640> put<00:03:20.819> some

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
there and I'm getting ready to put some

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.220 
there and I'm getting ready to put some
grooves<00:03:21.269> on<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.569> so<00:03:21.690> that's<00:03:21.840> what<00:03:21.989> I<00:03:22.019> thought

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
grooves on it so that's what I thought

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.960 
grooves on it so that's what I thought
I'd<00:03:22.380> do<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.680> show<00:03:22.859> you<00:03:22.920> today<00:03:23.250> I've<00:03:23.760> got<00:03:23.940> a

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
I'd do and show you today I've got a

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.390 
I'd do and show you today I've got a
couple<00:03:24.209> others<00:03:24.600> already<00:03:24.810> done<00:03:25.170> here<00:03:25.590> that's

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
couple others already done here that's

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.160 
couple others already done here that's
kind<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.760> what<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:27.000> looks<00:03:27.209> like<00:03:27.420> there's<00:03:27.780> the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
kind of what it looks like there's the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.559 
kind of what it looks like there's the
the<00:03:29.010> grooves<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.700> makes<00:03:29.970> kind<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.239> some<00:03:30.450> kind

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
the grooves of makes kind of some kind

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.199 
the grooves of makes kind of some kind
of<00:03:30.690> rolled<00:03:31.440> out<00:03:31.590> some<00:03:31.890> triangular<00:03:32.519> pieces<00:03:32.790> and

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
of rolled out some triangular pieces and

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.300 
of rolled out some triangular pieces and
stuck<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.750> down<00:03:33.840> in<00:03:34.019> there<00:03:34.139> kind<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.530> put<00:03:35.190> it

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
stuck it down in there kind of put it

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.400 
stuck it down in there kind of put it
down<00:03:35.459> in<00:03:35.639> there<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.060> anyway<00:03:36.870> that's<00:03:37.019> kind<00:03:37.319> of

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
down in there so anyway that's kind of

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.430 
down in there so anyway that's kind of
how<00:03:37.859> they<00:03:38.010> turned<00:03:38.250> out<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.880> think<00:03:39.359> I<00:03:39.720> think<00:03:40.319> they

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
how they turned out I think I think they

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.770 
how they turned out I think I think they
might<00:03:40.620> work<00:03:40.769> ok

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
might work ok

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.470 
might work ok
here's<00:03:43.780> another<00:03:44.020> one<00:03:44.260> kind<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:44.590> similar

here's<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.810> triangle<00:04:01.350> pieces<00:04:01.590> right

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
here's the the triangle pieces right

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.280 
here's the the triangle pieces right
there<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:03.360> that's<00:04:03.510> what<00:04:03.840> we're<00:04:03.990> going<00:04:04.080> to<00:04:04.170> go

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
there and that's what we're going to go

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:25.430 
there and that's what we're going to go
ahead<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:04.560> stick<00:04:04.890> in<00:04:05.070> there

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.830 

okay<00:04:26.440> here<00:04:27.070> we<00:04:27.160> go<00:04:27.360> there's<00:04:28.360> going<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.630> be<00:04:28.660> the

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
okay here we go there's going to be the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.409 
okay here we go there's going to be the
first<00:04:29.080> one<00:04:29.320> here<00:04:29.820> let's<00:04:30.820> get<00:04:31.000> down<00:04:31.030> here<00:04:31.389> a

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
first one here let's get down here a

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:38.150 
first one here let's get down here a
little<00:04:31.480> ways<00:04:32.070> get<00:04:33.070> this<00:04:33.220> turned<00:04:33.550> around

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.870 

in<00:04:38.580> there

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.439 

push<00:04:44.420> down<00:04:44.600> in<00:04:44.840> there

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:06:02.050 

it<00:04:50.449> goes

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.850 

I<00:06:02.150> think<00:06:02.750> it<00:06:02.840> those<00:06:02.990> are<00:06:03.020> even<00:06:03.320> as<00:06:03.470> well<00:06:03.740> as

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
I think it those are even as well as

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.650 
I think it those are even as well as
possible<00:06:04.430> Clay's<00:06:05.090> about<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.480> same

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
possible Clay's about the same

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.909 
possible Clay's about the same
consistency<00:06:06.380> so<00:06:07.280> and<00:06:08.060> it's<00:06:08.210> all<00:06:08.389> green<00:06:08.990> I<00:06:09.380> mean

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
consistency so and it's all green I mean

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.790 
consistency so and it's all green I mean
all<00:06:10.070> wet<00:06:10.880> clay<00:06:11.180> so<00:06:11.840> we're<00:06:11.990> not<00:06:12.080> going<00:06:12.320> to<00:06:12.410> score

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
all wet clay so we're not going to score

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:19.839 
all wet clay so we're not going to score
or<00:06:13.010> anything

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:28.010 

soften<00:06:20.360> up<00:06:20.479> the<00:06:20.629> edges

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.930 

gotta<00:06:28.560> remember<00:06:28.860> also<00:06:29.190> you<00:06:29.460> know<00:06:29.669> when<00:06:29.849> you

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
gotta remember also you know when you

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.029 
gotta remember also you know when you
glaze<00:06:30.150> and<00:06:30.419> it's<00:06:30.569> going<00:06:30.720> to<00:06:30.780> take<00:06:31.470> it<00:06:31.590> a<00:06:31.620> lot<00:06:31.889> of

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
glaze and it's going to take it a lot of

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.460 
glaze and it's going to take it a lot of
it<00:06:32.629> anything<00:06:33.629> you<00:06:33.750> want<00:06:33.900> to<00:06:33.960> do<00:06:34.110> is<00:06:34.259> just<00:06:34.289> make

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
it anything you want to do is just make

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:47.170 
it anything you want to do is just make
sure<00:06:34.740> those<00:06:34.889> are<00:06:35.069> attached<00:06:35.280> really<00:06:35.639> good

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.790 

let's<00:06:47.600> see<00:06:47.750> how<00:06:47.810> it<00:06:47.960> turns<00:06:48.110> out<00:06:48.380> I've<00:06:48.590> never

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
let's see how it turns out I've never

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.800 
let's see how it turns out I've never
really<00:06:49.759> done<00:06:49.820> a<00:06:49.970> lot<00:06:50.240> of<00:06:50.270> this<00:06:50.419> attached

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
really done a lot of this attached

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:57.150 
really done a lot of this attached
animas<00:06:51.350> this<00:06:52.280> wet

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.690 

hoping<00:06:57.910> I<00:06:57.970> don't<00:06:58.150> have<00:06:58.300> any<00:06:58.420> cold<00:06:59.430> brakes<00:07:00.430> on

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:00.700 
hoping I don't have any cold brakes on

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.320 
hoping I don't have any cold brakes on
it<00:07:00.880> Oracle<00:07:01.090> joins<00:07:01.600> whatever<00:07:02.140> you<00:07:02.230> want

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
it Oracle joins whatever you want

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.640 
it Oracle joins whatever you want
probably<00:07:04.870> okay

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.650 

okay<00:07:08.660> anyway<00:07:09.830> it's<00:07:10.830> about<00:07:11.100> all<00:07:11.550> i<00:07:12.210> got<00:07:12.449> on<00:07:12.630> that

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
okay anyway it's about all i got on that

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:27.740 
okay anyway it's about all i got on that
thing<00:07:13.590> up<00:07:13.740> the<00:07:13.889> ends<00:07:14.070> of<00:07:14.160> these<00:07:14.250> a<00:07:14.310> little<00:07:14.550> bit

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:27.750 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.630 

we'll<00:07:28.200> see<00:07:28.410> what<00:07:28.560> happens<00:07:28.710> on<00:07:29.100> this<00:07:29.280> is<00:07:29.490> you

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:29.640 
we'll see what happens on this is you

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.670 
we'll see what happens on this is you
know<00:07:29.760> one<00:07:29.970> of<00:07:30.000> those<00:07:30.210> things<00:07:30.450> two<00:07:31.350> things<00:07:31.380> that

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 
know one of those things two things that

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.670 
know one of those things two things that
inspired<00:07:32.310> inspired<00:07:32.850> this<00:07:33.300> dish<00:07:33.600> we're<00:07:34.500> both

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 
inspired inspired this dish we're both

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.850 
inspired inspired this dish we're both
kind<00:07:35.100> of<00:07:35.220> accidental<00:07:36.150> successes<00:07:36.840> so<00:07:37.080> since

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:37.860 
kind of accidental successes so since

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.230 
kind of accidental successes so since
this<00:07:37.980> is<00:07:38.160> more<00:07:38.340> of<00:07:38.370> a<00:07:38.490> clam<00:07:38.760> and<00:07:39.060> it'll

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 
this is more of a clam and it'll

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.150 
this is more of a clam and it'll
probably<00:07:39.480> the<00:07:39.720> thing<00:07:39.900> that<00:07:43.040> doesn't<00:07:44.040> really

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 
probably the thing that doesn't really

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.880 
probably the thing that doesn't really
work<00:07:44.430> at<00:07:44.610> all<00:07:44.820> so<00:07:45.630> anyway<00:07:45.930> that's<00:07:46.440> all<00:07:46.650> I<00:07:46.740> have

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:46.890 
work at all so anyway that's all I have

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.960 
work at all so anyway that's all I have
for<00:07:46.920> today<00:07:48.080> I'll<00:07:49.080> try<00:07:49.290> to<00:07:49.320> get<00:07:49.530> it<00:07:49.710> to<00:07:49.970> get

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:50.970 
for today I'll try to get it to get

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.050 
for today I'll try to get it to get
these<00:07:51.180> uh<00:07:51.210> finished<00:07:52.080> up<00:07:52.290> and<00:07:52.610> got<00:07:53.610> one<00:07:53.730> more<00:07:53.940> to

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.060 
these uh finished up and got one more to

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.960 
these uh finished up and got one more to
