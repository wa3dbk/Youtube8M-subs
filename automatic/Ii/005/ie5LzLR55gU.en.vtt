00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.510
 I'm frank and these are my adventures 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.510
 literary 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.039
 as the title may have fixed 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.890
 again let's talk about stephen king and 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.309
 for that I will comment on the long march 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.630
 this novel was published in 79 under 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.000
 pseudonyms 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.520
 that stephen king adopted was called 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.160
 richard bach man this novel wrote it 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.260
 when he was about 19 years old and it was his 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.670
 first novel that wrote this novel 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.220
 that shows a totalitarian and 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.190
 authoritarian and somewhat futuristic is a 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.309
 future pretty close to our 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.309
 present this society that arises in 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.309
 this book is directed as by the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.470
 commander the commander and the boss and 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.440
 people have a lot of respect I have 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.880
 here as points scored of the ones I want 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.369
 talk because I do not want to leave 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.250
 nothing so from time to time today I was 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.590
 reading my super notebook 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.480
 this is the book tells us the long 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.750
 march as is the title 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:27.780
 competition where they choose 100 guys from 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.880
 different state of the USA and they put it to 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.310
 march to a long walk that leaves 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.030
 on the border of canada and usa and 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.910
 ends when there is only one walker left and 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.750
 that is the winner as he wins this 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.400
 marchador has to watch his 99 die 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.770
 opponents as they die there are some 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.970
 soldiers that are like guarding and 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.690
 you have to maintain a speed 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.510
 constant as the group and is established 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.240
 which are generally 6.5 kilometers per 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.000
 hour then if you drop in that 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.270
 speed if you stop if you 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.150
 you fainted if you are big nose you 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.790
 kill you get three warnings in an interval 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.190
 of 30 seconds if your third notice arrives 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.880
 and in 30 seconds you can not get up or 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.880
 you can not follow 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.349
 the prize for the winner is what the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.769
 tc is going to tell us the story of 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.959
 raymonda rating better known as garat 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.440
 and that is one of the guys chosen for 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.930
 competing in this march he has a 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.690
 mother and a girlfriend who are waiting for him 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.180
 at home and that's why these people are 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.760
 as its point its fundamental engine for 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.670
 have these desires to win during the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.310
 up which makes new friends 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.549
 realazos with some people or if it goes 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.610
 passing the story are dying some 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.860
 opponents 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.870
 as it is in a good competition that 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.700
 basically with the foundation of the book 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.950
 if it looks like the hunger games ' what 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.360
 I commented in the search engine and with the 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.630
 difference that they kill you between 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.230
 they kill you this story is full 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.269
 of metaphors and I like this from stephen 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.730
 king who has to transform from 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.360
 transform trivial things and without 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.790
 meaning to things that deserve a 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.430
 reflection I like comparisons 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.099
 do for example there is a part where 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.590
 free compares what it is to walk between 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.859
 fog to what it would be to walk between 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.650
 butterfly dust that is to me of 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.569
 true that these comparisons of things 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.180
 that encourages us to very 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.430
 important or things like very gimmicky 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.879
 good question us as we recount 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.129
 these relationships that creates garat and us 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.810
 show how the thoughts are 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.670
 they go deep into the minds of all 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.040
 characters and each character has a 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.620
 story behind I like it to be where 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.909
 as in the most recondite parts and 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.209
 dark of the human being because 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.919
 normally one the thoughts as 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.120
 cigars that they have are not told 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.439
 other people 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.419
 stephen king of the stories of a 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.389
 so exquisite way and that girl in the 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:09.790
 beautiful and sometimes like it's like today 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:12.760
 that the TV was this is cojÃ¡is 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.939
 as a sense of fright read as 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.139
 what's happening from your head and you give yourself 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.870
 realize that you have ever 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.780
 raised something like that and I like how 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.240
 stephen kim knows how to translate into these 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.669
 books without anything else that I like is that 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.560
 each chapter begins with some phrase 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:34.449
 or some date or some song of something 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.240
 related to contests remembered 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.720
 very much like don francisco and 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.120
 scream and out or something like that in your 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.030
 Chilean saturday program the Chileans 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.570
 they will understand me or I said earlier to 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:52.120
 times these as stories and how you 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.050
 tell your thoughts or how you 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.430
 they report the deaths or the state 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.410
 insane that they get to have some 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.940
 characters becomes somewhat morbid 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.550
 and a bit like nasty 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.130
 stephen king know the time will come 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.370
 so stop exactly where description 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.430
 and he knows how much to put these things on you and 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.450
 average mean rare and mean exasperating 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.670
 for the reader 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.340
 another good thing that this book has is 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.620
 which shows exactly and explains you 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.140
 the sensations of some of the 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.210
 characters and the same protagonist and you 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.800
 you feel them with them, that is , 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.530
 they become paranoid you become 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.840
 paranoid with them to this planet him 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.910
 something happens feels nervous fear the 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.380
 Reader also feels it and I feel that 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.650
 that only he has been able to achieve 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:44.130
 stephen king with me as readers like that 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:47.460
 that the point like I'm not in favor 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.620
 of this book the ending is a bit 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.880
 implicitly leaves you as a little to the 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.300
 imagination 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.910
 I had a hard time analyzing it, it cost me a lot 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.280
 analyze it but I did it so that 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.610
 as with the end what 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.650
 it was a bit predictable but at the same time 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.889
 two a little implied this with respect 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.200
 al with regard to the long march if I 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.110
