I've already pressed the connect button
and<00:05:39.669> in<00:05:39.759> theory<00:05:40.149> this<00:05:40.509> should<00:05:40.569> be<00:05:40.779> connected

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
and in theory this should be connected

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:49.619 
and in theory this should be connected
but<00:05:46.199> as<00:05:47.580> always<00:05:48.580> with<00:05:48.849> these<00:05:48.969> things<00:05:49.330> it's<00:05:49.569> a

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:49.629 
but as always with these things it's a

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:54.629 
but as always with these things it's a
bit<00:05:49.779> hit<00:05:50.229> and<00:05:50.259> miss<00:05:53.009> person<00:05:54.009> buttons<00:05:54.309> to<00:05:54.429> skip

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
bit hit and miss person buttons to skip

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.239 
bit hit and miss person buttons to skip
this<00:05:54.819> nothing's<00:05:55.389> happening<00:05:55.979> by<00:05:56.979> the<00:05:57.009> way<00:05:57.189> you
