creating<00:03:55.240> the<00:03:55.330> little<00:03:55.540> down<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.020> solder

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
creating the little down of the solder

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.320 
creating the little down of the solder
level<00:03:56.800> done<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.130> was<00:03:57.250> wiped<00:03:57.550> up<00:03:57.760> really<00:03:58.090> loud

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
level done it was wiped up really loud

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:13.940 
level done it was wiped up really loud
yeah

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.259 

luis<00:04:14.950> gives<00:04:15.159> an<00:04:15.280> excellent<00:04:15.519> few<00:04:15.819> takes<00:04:16.060> of<00:04:16.209> the

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
luis gives an excellent few takes of the

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.610 
luis gives an excellent few takes of the
track<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:16.720> they<00:04:16.810> begin<00:04:17.079> listening<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.530> the

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
track and they begin listening to the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.920 
track and they begin listening to the
recordings<00:04:18.100> nikolai<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.090> brad<00:04:19.419> now<00:04:19.630> give<00:04:19.840> us

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.509 
recordings nikolai and brad now give us
another<00:04:20.260> extremely<00:04:20.739> useful<00:04:21.160> tip<00:04:21.340> on

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
another extremely useful tip on

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.950 
another extremely useful tip on

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
producing the drum sound to make it

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.590 
producing the drum sound to make it
bigger<00:04:23.229> and<00:04:23.470> more<00:04:23.740> present<00:04:24.210> by<00:04:25.210> compressing

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
bigger and more present by compressing
