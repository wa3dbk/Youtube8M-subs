Cathy<00:00:05.790> song<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.090> down<00:00:06.300> tune<00:00:06.570> by<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.840> half<00:00:07.110> step

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
Cathy song is down tune by a half step

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.070 
Cathy song is down tune by a half step
or<00:00:08.090> actually<00:00:09.090> up<00:00:09.240> slightly<00:00:09.510> annoying<00:00:09.809> looks

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
or actually up slightly annoying looks

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.930 
or actually up slightly annoying looks
down<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.469> my<00:00:10.680> little<00:00:10.800> bit<00:00:11.040> less<00:00:11.280> than<00:00:11.520> half<00:00:11.580> a

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
down to my little bit less than half a

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.000 
down to my little bit less than half a
step<00:00:12.210> but<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.720> think<00:00:12.900> if<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.350> come<00:00:13.530> down<00:00:13.560> a<00:00:13.740> half

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.010 
step but I think if we come down a half

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.160 
step but I think if we come down a half
step<00:00:14.190> with<00:00:14.550> closer<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.330> what<00:00:15.450> he's<00:00:15.630> doing<00:00:15.870> and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
step with closer to what he's doing and

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.280 
step with closer to what he's doing and
it's<00:00:16.619> slightly<00:00:16.800> easier<00:00:16.950> to<00:00:17.520> sing<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.960> bring

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
it's slightly easier to sing so bring

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.939 
it's slightly easier to sing so bring
