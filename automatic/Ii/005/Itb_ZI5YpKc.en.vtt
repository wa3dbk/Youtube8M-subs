students<00:00:19.210> should<00:00:19.390> use<00:00:19.600> strategies<00:00:20.170> such<00:00:20.410> as

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 
students should use strategies such as

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.679 
students should use strategies such as
these<00:00:20.770> to<00:00:21.010> build<00:00:21.130> conceptual<00:00:21.880> understanding

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
these to build conceptual understanding

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.929 
these to build conceptual understanding
so<00:00:23.470> in<00:00:23.589> previous<00:00:23.769> lessons<00:00:24.400> students<00:00:24.759> use

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
so in previous lessons students use

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.269 
so in previous lessons students use
various<00:00:25.390> strategies<00:00:25.869> to<00:00:26.109> divide<00:00:26.439> at<00:00:26.710> this

various strategies to divide at this
point<00:00:27.519> we're<00:00:27.669> still<00:00:27.880> just<00:00:27.939> looking<00:00:28.359> at<00:00:28.480> one

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
point we're still just looking at one

point we're still just looking at one
digit<00:00:29.050> divisors<00:00:29.650> and<00:00:29.980> one<00:00:30.789> strategy<00:00:31.089> that

digit divisors and one strategy that
students<00:00:31.900> can<00:00:32.050> use<00:00:32.079> to<00:00:32.410> think<00:00:32.619> about<00:00:32.890> division

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
students can use to think about division

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.060 
students can use to think about division
is<00:00:34.420> to<00:00:34.630> think<00:00:34.840> of<00:00:34.900> it<00:00:34.989> as<00:00:35.140> finding<00:00:35.500> an<00:00:35.650> unknown

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
is to think of it as finding an unknown

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.550 
is to think of it as finding an unknown
factor<00:00:36.640> where<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.270> dividend<00:00:37.690> is<00:00:37.900> the<00:00:38.050> product

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560 
factor where the dividend is the product

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.400 
factor where the dividend is the product
the<00:00:39.070> divisor<00:00:39.460> is<00:00:39.760> a<00:00:39.790> known<00:00:40.150> factor<00:00:40.720> and<00:00:40.960> the

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
the divisor is a known factor and the

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.650 
the divisor is a known factor and the
quotient<00:00:41.620> is<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.160> unknown<00:00:42.550> factor<00:00:42.610> and<00:00:43.480> I'm

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
quotient is the unknown factor and I'm

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.940 
quotient is the unknown factor and I'm
going<00:00:43.900> to<00:00:43.960> show<00:00:44.140> you<00:00:44.170> two<00:00:44.500> ways<00:00:44.530> that<00:00:44.860> you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
going to show you two ways that you

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.980 
going to show you two ways that you
could<00:00:45.100> approach<00:00:45.340> this<00:00:45.640> one<00:00:46.300> is<00:00:46.420> by<00:00:46.570> using<00:00:46.600> the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990 
could approach this one is by using the

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.050 
could approach this one is by using the
rectangle<00:00:47.530> sections<00:00:48.010> model<00:00:48.490> and<00:00:48.700> here's<00:00:48.910> how

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.060 
rectangle sections model and here's how

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.880 
rectangle sections model and here's how
that<00:00:49.090> looks<00:00:49.410> first<00:00:50.410> you<00:00:50.560> would<00:00:50.680> draw<00:00:50.860> a

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
that looks first you would draw a

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.420 
that looks first you would draw a
rectangle<00:00:51.490> and<00:00:51.610> label<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.210> knowns<00:00:52.510> I<00:00:53.400> have<00:00:54.400> a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
rectangle and label the knowns I have a

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.290 
rectangle and label the knowns I have a
rectangle<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:57.250> I<00:00:57.370> labeled<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.850> dividend

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
rectangle and I labeled the dividend

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.270 
rectangle and I labeled the dividend
which<00:00:58.450> I<00:00:58.630> know<00:00:58.690> which<00:00:58.960> is<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.950> problem<00:01:00.160> that

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
which I know which is the problem that

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.999 
which I know which is the problem that
we're<00:01:00.520> solving<00:01:00.700> first<00:01:01.980> 3372<00:01:03.390> divided<00:01:04.390> by<00:01:04.540> 4<00:01:05.009> so

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
we're solving first 3372 divided by 4 so

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.590 
we're solving first 3372 divided by 4 so
the<00:01:06.189> dividend<00:01:06.520> we<00:01:06.700> know<00:01:08.490> 3372<00:01:09.490> and<00:01:09.939> the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
the dividend we know 3372 and the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.859 
the dividend we know 3372 and the
divisor<00:01:10.929> is<00:01:11.320> 4<00:01:12.149> so<00:01:13.149> the<00:01:13.420> first<00:01:13.659> thing<00:01:13.840> that

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
divisor is 4 so the first thing that

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.889 
divisor is 4 so the first thing that
you'll<00:01:14.079> think<00:01:14.259> about<00:01:14.380> is<00:01:14.829> 4<00:01:15.759> times<00:01:16.630> what

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
you'll think about is 4 times what

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.450 
you'll think about is 4 times what
number<00:01:17.140> would<00:01:17.259> be<00:01:17.439> close<00:01:17.799> to<00:01:18.960> 3372<00:01:19.960> and<00:01:20.590> using

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
number would be close to 3372 and using

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.980 
number would be close to 3372 and using
numbers<00:01:21.819> with<00:01:22.030> zeros<00:01:22.509> like<00:01:22.689> 100<00:01:23.439> 200<00:01:23.909> 1,000

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
numbers with zeros like 100 200 1,000

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.800 
numbers with zeros like 100 200 1,000
excuse<00:01:25.990> me<00:01:26.140> are<00:01:26.590> helpful<00:01:27.159> with<00:01:27.280> this<00:01:27.460> strategy

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
excuse me are helpful with this strategy

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.520 
excuse me are helpful with this strategy
so<00:01:28.810> I<00:01:28.840> know<00:01:29.200> that<00:01:29.350> 4<00:01:29.799> times<00:01:30.100> 8<00:01:30.369> is<00:01:30.399> 32<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.229> 4

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
so I know that 4 times 8 is 32 so 4

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.849 
so I know that 4 times 8 is 32 so 4
times<00:01:32.799> 8<00:01:33.009> hundred<00:01:33.490> would<00:01:33.670> be<00:01:34.619> 3,200<00:01:35.619> and

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:35.859 
times 8 hundred would be 3,200 and

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:39.899 
times 8 hundred would be 3,200 and
that's<00:01:36.700> pretty<00:01:36.880> close<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.210> 3,000<00:01:38.130> 372<00:01:39.130> so<00:01:39.850> I'll

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
that's pretty close to 3,000 372 so I'll

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.889 
that's pretty close to 3,000 372 so I'll
go<00:01:40.060> ahead<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:40.329> record<00:01:40.630> 800<00:01:41.409> at<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.429> top<00:01:42.899> now

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
go ahead and record 800 at the top now

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.080 
go ahead and record 800 at the top now
800<00:01:44.380> times<00:01:44.649> 4<00:01:44.979> is<00:01:46.170> 3,200<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.789> go<00:01:48.789> ahead<00:01:48.939> and

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
800 times 4 is 3,200 I go ahead and

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.179 
800 times 4 is 3,200 I go ahead and
subtract<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.770> I<00:01:51.069> would<00:01:51.189> be<00:01:51.280> left<00:01:51.429> with<00:01:51.719> 172

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
subtract and I would be left with 172

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.590 
subtract and I would be left with 172
now<00:01:54.189> I'll<00:01:54.369> move<00:01:54.549> that<00:01:54.579> over<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:55.240> another

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
now I'll move that over to another

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.279 
now I'll move that over to another
section<00:01:56.289> and<00:01:58.889> record<00:01:59.889> that<00:01:59.950> here<00:02:00.990> now<00:02:01.990> we<00:02:02.049> can

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
section and record that here now we can

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.859 
section and record that here now we can
think<00:02:02.590> again<00:02:02.740> using<00:02:03.279> numbers<00:02:03.579> with<00:02:03.759> zeros<00:02:04.209> 4

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
think again using numbers with zeros 4

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.359 
think again using numbers with zeros 4
times<00:02:05.829> what<00:02:06.069> would<00:02:06.159> get<00:02:06.369> close<00:02:06.609> to<00:02:06.869> 172<00:02:07.869> and

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
times what would get close to 172 and

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.220 
times what would get close to 172 and
students<00:02:09.369> might<00:02:09.610> pick<00:02:09.850> something<00:02:10.270> in<00:02:11.020> this

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
students might pick something in this

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.280 
students might pick something in this
case<00:02:11.470> something<00:02:11.709> like<00:02:12.040> 30<00:02:12.900> where<00:02:13.900> as<00:02:14.019> here

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
case something like 30 where as here

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.170 
case something like 30 where as here
students<00:02:14.650> picked<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:14.950> number<00:02:15.280> with<00:02:15.519> zeros<00:02:15.939> that

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
students picked a number with zeros that

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.160 
students picked a number with zeros that
was<00:02:16.299> very<00:02:16.599> close<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.260> what<00:02:17.409> we<00:02:17.439> had

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
was very close to what we had

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.780 
was very close to what we had
in<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.530> case<00:02:18.740> we<00:02:18.920> know<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:19.100> 40<00:02:19.640> would

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
in this case we know that 40 would

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.520 
in this case we know that 40 would
actually<00:02:20.210> be<00:02:20.360> closer<00:02:20.660> but<00:02:21.050> I'll<00:02:21.140> show<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.350> how

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
actually be closer but I'll show you how

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.199 
actually be closer but I'll show you how
it<00:02:21.680> would<00:02:21.800> still<00:02:22.040> work<00:02:22.069> out<00:02:22.430> with<00:02:22.819> students

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
it would still work out with students

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.870 
it would still work out with students
picking<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.540> number<00:02:23.660> like<00:02:23.959> this<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:24.890> 30<00:02:25.190> times<00:02:25.459> 4

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
picking a number like this so 30 times 4

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.270 
picking a number like this so 30 times 4
is<00:02:26.150> 120<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:28.670> we<00:02:28.790> would<00:02:28.970> subtract<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.720> we

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
is 120 so we would subtract that we

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.270 
is 120 so we would subtract that we
would<00:02:31.280> have<00:02:31.430> 52<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.800> then<00:02:33.800> we<00:02:33.920> would<00:02:34.069> move

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
would have 52 and then we would move

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.050 
would have 52 and then we would move
that<00:02:34.459> over<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.000> new<00:02:35.240> section<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.880> here<00:02:40.880> we

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
that over to a new section and here we

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.970 
that over to a new section and here we
would<00:02:41.150> think<00:02:41.390> 4<00:02:41.690> times<00:02:42.080> what<00:02:42.440> would<00:02:42.590> get<00:02:42.709> close

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
would think 4 times what would get close

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.150 
would think 4 times what would get close
to<00:02:43.130> 52<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:44.660> lot<00:02:45.020> of<00:02:45.140> students<00:02:45.530> might<00:02:45.680> see<00:02:45.950> that

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
to 52 a lot of students might see that

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.220 
to 52 a lot of students might see that
that<00:02:46.310> could<00:02:46.430> be<00:02:46.580> 10<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:48.970> 40<00:02:49.970> or<00:02:50.180> 10<00:02:50.510> times<00:02:50.870> 4<00:02:51.200> is

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
that could be 10 and 40 or 10 times 4 is

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.890 
that could be 10 and 40 or 10 times 4 is
40<00:02:53.470> we<00:02:54.470> would<00:02:54.620> have<00:02:54.800> 12<00:02:55.160> left<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.910> so<00:02:56.630> then<00:02:56.780> we

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
40 we would have 12 left and so then we

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.550 
40 we would have 12 left and so then we
would<00:02:56.989> move<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.350> 12<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.860> one<00:02:58.070> more<00:02:58.280> section

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
would move that 12 to one more section

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.310 
would move that 12 to one more section
and<00:03:01.120> then<00:03:02.120> students<00:03:02.570> would<00:03:02.690> know<00:03:02.870> that<00:03:02.900> 4

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
and then students would know that 4

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.790 
and then students would know that 4
times<00:03:03.530> 3<00:03:04.100> is<00:03:04.280> 12<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.600> we<00:03:06.019> could<00:03:06.200> subtract<00:03:06.620> the

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
times 3 is 12 and we could subtract the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.160 
times 3 is 12 and we could subtract the
12<00:03:09.190> now<00:03:10.190> we<00:03:10.250> have<00:03:11.180> 0<00:03:11.480> so<00:03:11.690> we<00:03:11.810> know<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.050> there

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
12 now we have 0 so we know that there

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.810 
12 now we have 0 so we know that there
is<00:03:12.200> no<00:03:12.470> remainder<00:03:12.860> for<00:03:13.130> this<00:03:13.250> one<00:03:13.430> if<00:03:13.640> there

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
is no remainder for this one if there

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.949 
is no remainder for this one if there
was<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.000> remainder<00:03:14.420> there<00:03:14.570> would<00:03:14.660> be<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.780> number

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
was a remainder there would be a number

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.570 
was a remainder there would be a number
left<00:03:15.230> here<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.680> it<00:03:15.739> would<00:03:15.860> be<00:03:15.980> smaller<00:03:16.340> than

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
left here and it would be smaller than

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.120 
left here and it would be smaller than
the<00:03:16.760> divisor<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:18.019> what's<00:03:18.200> left<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.560> do<00:03:18.709> is<00:03:18.920> to

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
the divisor so what's left to do is to

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.729 
the divisor so what's left to do is to
add<00:03:19.280> up<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.670> partial<00:03:20.090> quotients<00:03:20.750> here<00:03:20.959> so

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
add up the partial quotients here so

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.000 
add up the partial quotients here so
that<00:03:21.920> we<00:03:22.010> can<00:03:22.190> see<00:03:22.400> our<00:03:22.519> quotient<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.870> 800<00:03:24.709> plus

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
that we can see our quotient so 800 plus

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.140 
that we can see our quotient so 800 plus
30<00:03:25.370> plus<00:03:25.700> 10<00:03:26.420> plus<00:03:26.750> 3<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.739> we<00:03:28.670> would<00:03:28.820> see<00:03:29.090> him

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
30 plus 10 plus 3 and we would see him

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.850 
30 plus 10 plus 3 and we would see him
just<00:03:29.360> gonna<00:03:29.540> record<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:29.810> down<00:03:30.019> here<00:03:30.170> 800

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
just gonna record that down here 800

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.160 
just gonna record that down here 800
plus<00:03:31.430> 30<00:03:31.820> plus<00:03:32.620> 10<00:03:33.620> plus<00:03:33.920> 3<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.720> we<00:03:35.840> would<00:03:35.989> see

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
plus 30 plus 10 plus 3 and we would see

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.990 
plus 30 plus 10 plus 3 and we would see
that<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.350> quotient<00:03:36.829> is<00:03:38.410> 843<00:03:39.730> now<00:03:40.730> another

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
that the quotient is 843 now another

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.060 
that the quotient is 843 now another
strategy<00:03:41.329> students<00:03:41.900> can<00:03:42.079> use<00:03:42.320> is<00:03:42.500> expanded

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
strategy students can use is expanded

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.890 
strategy students can use is expanded
notation<00:03:43.459> it's<00:03:44.150> essentially<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.870> same

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
notation it's essentially the same

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.140 
notation it's essentially the same
process<00:03:45.590> it's<00:03:46.100> just<00:03:46.340> recorded<00:03:46.790> in<00:03:46.880> a<00:03:46.970> long

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
process it's just recorded in a long

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.780 
process it's just recorded in a long
division<00:03:47.510> format<00:03:48.170> so<00:03:48.890> students<00:03:49.370> would<00:03:49.519> write

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
division format so students would write

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.390 
division format so students would write
the<00:03:50.450> dividend<00:03:51.790> 3372<00:03:53.709> divided<00:03:54.709> by<00:03:54.890> 4<00:03:55.190> our

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
the dividend 3372 divided by 4 our

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.520 
the dividend 3372 divided by 4 our
divisor<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:56.660> we<00:03:56.840> would<00:03:56.989> do<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.260> same<00:03:57.290> thing

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
divisor and we would do the same thing

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.090 
divisor and we would do the same thing
here<00:03:58.040> looking<00:03:58.400> for<00:03:59.079> partial<00:04:00.079> quotients<00:04:00.620> so<00:04:00.769> 4

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
here looking for partial quotients so 4

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.240 
here looking for partial quotients so 4
times<00:04:01.989> 800<00:04:02.989> we<00:04:03.140> saw<00:04:03.350> got<00:04:03.620> as<00:04:03.739> close<00:04:03.829> to<00:04:05.079> 3,000

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
times 800 we saw got as close to 3,000

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.930 
times 800 we saw got as close to 3,000
372<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:08.000> I<00:04:08.030> would<00:04:08.180> go<00:04:08.299> ahead<00:04:08.329> and<00:04:08.450> subtract<00:04:09.940> we

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
372 so I would go ahead and subtract we

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.569 
372 so I would go ahead and subtract we
had<00:04:11.260> 172<00:04:12.260> we're<00:04:12.829> sticking<00:04:13.160> with<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.310> same

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
had 172 we're sticking with the same

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.759 
had 172 we're sticking with the same
numbers<00:04:13.940> then<00:04:14.090> we<00:04:14.209> could<00:04:14.359> think<00:04:14.480> that<00:04:14.600> 4<00:04:14.959> times

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
numbers then we could think that 4 times

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.599 
numbers then we could think that 4 times
30<00:04:16.100> so<00:04:16.430> it's<00:04:16.579> close<00:04:16.850> to<00:04:16.989> 172<00:04:18.130> so<00:04:19.130> I<00:04:19.190> record<00:04:19.579> that

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
30 so it's close to 172 so I record that

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.969 
30 so it's close to 172 so I record that
above<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.239> 830<00:04:21.229> times<00:04:21.650> 4<00:04:21.950> was<00:04:22.160> 120<00:04:23.979> we

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
above the 830 times 4 was 120 we

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.670 
above the 830 times 4 was 120 we
subtract<00:04:25.430> we<00:04:25.520> would<00:04:25.640> have<00:04:25.729> 52<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:27.410> we<00:04:27.440> could

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
subtract we would have 52 and we could

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.820 
subtract we would have 52 and we could
say<00:04:27.890> 4<00:04:28.700> times<00:04:28.970> 10

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
say 4 times 10

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.950 
say 4 times 10
it's<00:04:30.830> close<00:04:31.100> to<00:04:31.130> 52<00:04:31.910> but<00:04:32.870> 10<00:04:33.110> times<00:04:33.320> 4<00:04:33.680> is<00:04:33.710> 40<00:04:34.960> we

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
it's close to 52 but 10 times 4 is 40 we

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.450 
it's close to 52 but 10 times 4 is 40 we
would<00:04:36.110> have<00:04:36.260> 12<00:04:36.590> left<00:04:36.920> and<00:04:37.310> 4<00:04:38.150> times<00:04:38.540> 3<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:40.430> 12

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460

now we have 0 left and again we would
just<00:04:45.380> add<00:04:45.590> these<00:04:45.800> partial<00:04:46.400> quotients<00:04:47.590> 800

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
just add these partial quotients 800

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.260 
just add these partial quotients 800
plus<00:04:49.400> 30<00:04:49.850> plus<00:04:50.920> 10<00:04:51.920> plus<00:04:52.250> 3<00:04:53.230> and<00:04:54.230> we<00:04:54.350> would<00:04:54.500> have
