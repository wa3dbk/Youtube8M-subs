are<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.869> need<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.200> new<00:01:07.439> air<00:01:07.619> filter<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
are you need a new air filter and it's a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.280 
are you need a new air filter and it's a
good<00:01:08.850> idea<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.240> change<00:01:09.420> these<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.720> think<00:01:10.020> every

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
good idea to change these I think every

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.010 
good idea to change these I think every
six<00:01:10.890> thousand<00:01:11.310> miles<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.900> would

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
six thousand miles or so so that would

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.750 
six thousand miles or so so that would
be<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.680> reason<00:01:13.830> why<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.070> need<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.490> your<00:01:14.520> air

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
be the reason why you need in your air

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.670 
be the reason why you need in your air
filter<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.270> when<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:15.990> go<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.140> put<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.409> back<00:01:16.500> in

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
filter and when you go to put it back in

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
filter and when you go to put it back in
you're<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:16.890> gonna<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> same<00:01:17.490> thing

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
you're just gonna do the same thing

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
you're just gonna do the same thing
you're<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.030> lift<00:01:18.150> up<00:01:18.330> stick<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.350> back<00:01:19.470> in

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
you're going to lift up stick it back in

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.120 
you're going to lift up stick it back in
there<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.479> make<00:01:21.479> sure<00:01:21.509> your<00:01:22.259> air<00:01:22.439> filter<00:01:22.950> is

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.399 
there and make sure your air filter is
flush<00:01:23.490> along<00:01:24.090> these<00:01:24.600> are<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.840> lawns<00:01:25.020> here<00:01:25.290> to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
flush along these are the lawns here to

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.700 
flush along these are the lawns here to
make<00:01:25.530> sure<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:26.009> good<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.790> then

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
make sure it's in there good and then

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.800 
make sure it's in there good and then
you'll<00:01:28.710> work<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.790> top<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> air<00:01:30.450> filter

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
you'll work the top of the air filter

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.550 
you'll work the top of the air filter
box<00:01:30.840> back<00:01:31.770> into<00:01:32.340> its<00:01:33.299> little<00:01:33.570> area<00:01:34.200> back<00:01:34.380> there

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
box back into its little area back there

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.870 
box back into its little area back there
and<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:34.829> you'll<00:01:34.950> put<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> clips<00:01:35.520> back<00:01:35.670> on
