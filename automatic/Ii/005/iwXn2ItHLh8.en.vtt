00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
knit into a very small space so now

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.070 
knit into a very small space so now
let's<00:01:20.189> take<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.549> knowledge<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.060> kind<00:01:21.990> of

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
let's take this knowledge and kind of

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.950 
let's take this knowledge and kind of
the<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:23.040> idea<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.580> why<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.119> set<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> way

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the the idea of why it's set up the way

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.830 
the the idea of why it's set up the way
it<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.470> put<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.280> into<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> cocktail<00:01:27.630> menu

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
it is and put it into a cocktail menu

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.590 
it is and put it into a cocktail menu
program<00:01:28.500> as<00:01:28.710> well<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.939> very<00:01:30.180> first<00:01:30.450> step

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
program as well so the very first step

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.140 
program as well so the very first step
that<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.960> recommend<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.860> kind<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.880> building

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
that I recommend for kind of building

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.240 
that I recommend for kind of building
out<00:01:33.299> your<00:01:33.329> house<00:01:33.930> cocktail<00:01:34.350> speed<00:01:34.560> rack<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.979> to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
out your house cocktail speed rack is to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
out your house cocktail speed rack is to
run<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> report<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.970> find<00:01:36.270> out<00:01:36.420> what<00:01:36.960> your<00:01:37.110> most

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
run a report to find out what your most

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.530 
run a report to find out what your most
successful<00:01:37.500> house<00:01:38.009> cocktails<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
successful house cocktails are so you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.440 
successful house cocktails are so you
really<00:01:39.930> want<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> concentrate<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:42.150> top

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
really want to concentrate on the top

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.410 
really want to concentrate on the top
five<00:01:42.720> performers<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.530> kind<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.250> maximize<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
five performers and kind of maximize the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
efficiency of that speed rack for those

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.929 
efficiency of that speed rack for those
top<00:01:48.420> five<00:01:48.630> cocktails<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:49.979> for<00:01:50.460> example<00:01:50.850> if

crossover and ingredients there's no

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.630 
crossover and ingredients there's no
real<00:03:10.140> good<00:03:10.319> way<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.560> kind<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:10.980> maximize<00:03:11.160> this

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
real good way to kind of maximize this

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.420 
real good way to kind of maximize this
efficiency<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:13.019> this<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.620> where<00:03:13.799> that<00:03:13.980> reports

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
efficiency so this is where that reports

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.759 
efficiency so this is where that reports
going<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.610> come<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:14.910> handy<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.900> at<00:03:16.590> this

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
going to come in handy so you at this

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.220

base<00:03:46.650> period<00:03:46.890> doesn't<00:03:47.640> seem<00:03:47.880> reasonable

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
base period doesn't seem reasonable

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.940
