00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.910
 Good day to all with you channel 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.679
 f1 and today we'll talk about 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:15.480
 hard drives on my example 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:18.210
 hard drive that does not work after 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.760
 strong bounce we will consider 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:27.269
 how to check hard disk for 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:30.390
 broken sectors and maybe reanimate 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.000
 let's say it so but mine is already reanimated 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.820
 will not work but the basics 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.489
 i will show you now i will install 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.309
 hard drive and continue recording so here 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.190
 we installed the hard disk 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.559
 we will boot from the optical 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.410
 the drive 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:57.899
 so we probably hear you what he already 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:01.050
 makes sounds it is generally not very very 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.199
 bad but I already said that he was no longer 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.199
 to help 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.420
 there will be a menu select 9 at this way we 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.229
 we see went loading 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:20.369
 so here we choose victoria 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:24.869
 351 I may have someone 352 click 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:30.360
 enter loaded Victoria again click 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:33.270
 enter so you probably see the inscription 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.659
 to select a video channel press n 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.430
 click p here because we have 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:47.570
 device when connecting comb choose 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.570
 sata press enter so 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:02:00.430
 we press f4 and here we have a window in 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:04.540
 which are put on a construction site 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.880
 Victoria for this disc that is here 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.380
 he will set linear reading that is 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.510
 he will take everything into account 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.820
 sector 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.980
 ignore bad blocks it's just for 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.610
 statistics he will ignore broken 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.910
 blocks but we need the following that is 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.340
 classic remap he will try 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.360
 fix broken blocks with and which 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.440
 probably not loading or very 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.270
 your hard drive is slow 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:39.370
 choose classic shemagh and click 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:45.990
 button and 4 again we see took place 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:52.180
 recalibration and started reading here 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:55.470
 squares which sectors are shown 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:00.370
 how fast are we answered 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:03.850
 is it possible to fix them here 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:08.680
 you can see the defects that he fixed it then 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:12.300
 there is one sector corrected with the above can be seen 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.790
 designation of squares which 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.660
 sorry i'm sorry here 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:24.459
 here we have five milliseconds 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:28.540
 it's good 20 ok 50 ok everything 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:33.940
 that below is no longer good for me 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.760
 most of all as we see red so 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:41.320
 like this hard drive 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.880
 he no longer can help the entrance after 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.310
 corrections 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.940
 your hard drive that is after that 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:55.310
 how the victoria program will fix your 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:59.300
 hard drive is still desirable to close these 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:02.980
 sector bits through acronis below under 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:07.430
 video I throw off the link how to do it I 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:11.450
 I will not shoot my video but you 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:17.930
 it was clearer, I will throw off a link to another 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:23.690
 video so but this process takes a lot 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:26.900
 plenty of time so i wont be it 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.330
 shoot further because I know what 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.000
 I have very, very much here 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.730
 bad sectors and this disk in general already 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.910
 how not to help 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.760
 Here on this probably we will finish our 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.230
 first video if something goes wrong 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.660
 understandable and do you have any questions 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.880
 write in the comments necessarily all 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.860
 I will answer soon will be the next video 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:55.900
 the next video will be about cleaning 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.170
 computer dust and thermal paste replacement 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.920
 cooler 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:05.890
 cpu with you was the channel 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.890
 f1 see you soon
