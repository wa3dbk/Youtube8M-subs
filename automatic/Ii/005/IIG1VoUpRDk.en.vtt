body work on it and how to painted it

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.170

took<00:02:43.020> me<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> long<00:02:43.410> time<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:44.430> know<00:02:44.610> just<00:02:44.940> being

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
took me a long time you know just being

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.140 
took me a long time you know just being
young<00:02:45.650> find<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.739> project<00:02:46.950> car<00:02:47.370> like<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.819> I

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
young find a project car like this I

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.180 
young find a project car like this I
didn't<00:02:48.750> know<00:02:48.810> really<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.440> direction<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.069> was

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
didn't know really the direction I was

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.979 
didn't know really the direction I was
going<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:50.730> kind<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.150> father-son<00:02:51.450> project

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
going it's kind of a father-son project

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.890 
going it's kind of a father-son project
car<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.430> really<00:02:53.940> learned<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.360> lot<00:02:54.390> about

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
retrospect I could go back out do it a

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.680 
retrospect I could go back out do it a
whole<00:03:01.230> different<00:03:01.680> way<00:03:01.800> but<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.940> know<00:03:03.060> cool

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.100 
whole different way but you know cool
and<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:03.989> learned<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.319> lot<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:05.100> was<00:03:05.250> fun<00:03:05.519> so<00:03:06.110> I'm

and I learned a lot it was fun so I'm
happy<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:09.120> come<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> long<00:03:09.600> way<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.170> no

happy and it's come a long way and no
one<00:03:10.590> really<00:03:10.860> thought<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.489> would<00:03:11.640> actually

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
one really thought that I would actually

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.490 
one really thought that I would actually
get<00:03:12.209> it<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.569> point<00:03:12.810> where<00:03:12.930> it's<00:03:13.140> even<00:03:13.290> out

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
get it to the point where it's even out

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.030 
get it to the point where it's even out
now<00:03:13.709> weird<00:03:14.610> even<00:03:14.819> drive<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:16.170> cool<00:03:16.440> it's<00:03:16.950> a

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
now weird even drive so it's cool it's a

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.100 
now weird even drive so it's cool it's a
money<00:03:17.250> pit<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:17.730> know<00:03:17.760> like<00:03:18.120> all<00:03:18.299> project<00:03:18.900> cars

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
money pit you know like all project cars

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.520 
money pit you know like all project cars
