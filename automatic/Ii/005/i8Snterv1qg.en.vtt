00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.090
 how is my name is vÃ­ctor manuel 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.920
 orozco already this video is for the subject 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.540
 of operating systems I will talk about a 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.490
 very interesting topic that interest 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.750
 many people hard drives 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.540
 hybrids 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.100
 background the hard drive is one of the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.200
 most important components of a 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.640
 computer besides saving in your 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.380
 inside all the information that does not 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.000
 we want to lose also influences in a way 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.400
 direct in the speed with which it 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.470
 run the applications since it is the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.270
 place to turn to health for 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.610
 get the necessary data when performing 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.230
 any process how to run a game 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.680
 or watch a video using any 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.420
 tool 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.550
 Currently , the 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.200
 discs with this bad technology of this 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.360
 moment that is, you want it to be 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.270
 they are formed 2.5 inches and 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.560
 have a capacity of 250 to 500 gigabytes 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.000
 of memory with 32 mb of cache and have 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.730
 a driver that is compatible with 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.550
 operating systems like mac windows os 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.000
 xy linux and his approximate company is 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.520
 250 dollars 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.350
 hard disks to comment on the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.910
 divided hard drives it is necessary that 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.090
 let's know a little about architecture 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:13.229
 about the foundation house we talk about the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.090
 hard drives hdd and psc from hdd actis 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.210
 wright are magnetic hard drives 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.170
 best known for being the most economical 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.240
 characterized by employing a system of 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.830
 magnetic recording composed of discs 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.870
 rigid carry at high speeds 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.940
 Inside a metal city box 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.250
 these discs carry some 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.440
 considerable disadvantages subject in the 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.840
 time as your electricity consumption your 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.610
 shock sensitivity your generation 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.290
 low heat capacity 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.690
 storage and not much reliability 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.410
 to save the data 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.210
 solid disk ssd snake disk or disk in 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.860
 solid state this kind of 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.260
 storage uses nand memory 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.240
 like flash memory memories but with 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.980
 a much larger storage then 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.160
 there is no neglecting or moving parts 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.660
 and engines or anything in this style despite 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.760
 of the variety of advantages that they offer 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.040
 tdt disks also have some 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.870
 disadvantages of greater weight as cost and 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.400
 hope in the disc video by 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.170
 example if we undo recover 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.000
 information from our hard drive would be 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.060
 more difficult and expensive to do with a 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.760
 ssd disk that with a hdd 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.550
 the price of an SSD disk like the PRI 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.580
 Read better with my 64GB capacity 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.819
 is equivalent to the price of 64 point 95 euros 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.290
 that this would cost more than 1.0 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.290
 thousand euros to get 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.849
 lived HDDs 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.340
 singer 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.830
 hard white network hh from becomes a 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.510
 combination of both sd and hd technologies 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.090
 so it is called a hybrid 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.770
 the hybrid hard drives combine the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.110
 rotation of magnetic media and the 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.780
 nand memory non-volatile flash inside 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.130
 a single storage solution 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.620
 but to have operating systems 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.569
 new ones that make the most of this 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.969
 technology 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.829
 these hard drives have a capacity 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:22.260
 in gigabytes of flash memory that 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.689
 they act like steam using non-memory 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.370
 volatile being a cache memory where 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.989
 those are temporarily stored 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.040
 data that I usually assign a lot to 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.769
 operating system 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.810
 that way the rest of the disc 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.060
 magnetic with the classic dishes we 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.980
 guide and produce savings in both 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.170
 time in energy consumed and the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.269
 generation of heat and noise when reducing 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.470
 access to the magnetic part of the disk 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.260
 hard 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.030
 to try to improve performance it 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.120
 add a component is the technology 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.250
 called adapter and tecnobit a 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.470
 algorithm that monitors access to 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.930
 seen to see what data we will ask to 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.210
 below how to see the frequency in 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.220
 that we opened in the 10 in our pc and 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.250
 have it prepared in cache to improve 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.100
 access times 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.810
 advantages of hard drives divided to 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.610
 Although normal hard disks 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.040
 they also have a small memory 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.080
 built-in flash-based cache this is 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.930
 volatile and completely erased 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.100
 turn off the device on the contrary with an hd 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.140
 the operating system 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.660
 the programs start from the flash what 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.430
 which accelerates the system farm such 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.290
 is the case of operating systems 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.510
 windows 7 with windows seen with their 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.250
 medical hydrive technologies that 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.050
 allow teams to enter with a 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.330
 Hybrid tube drive for 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.800
 access data from the cache do not fly and 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.980
 allows memory devices 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.510
 non-volatile such as usb flashes 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.280
 they can be used as a cache of 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.280
 additional memory to improve the 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.980
 system performance the disadvantages 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.960
 that has the hard disk lived is the 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.880
 storage capacity that still 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.620
 It is very small and makes it barely exist 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.350
 Differences in front of more hard drives 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.240
 traditional an increase in capacity 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.800
 of flash of the hard disks and the 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.780
 would entail a large increase in 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.280
 prices of these devices that the 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.770
 you open a day that counts if it would be worth 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.980
 they acquired but that will depend on 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.380
 the user experience 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.210
 manufacturing the energy consumption of 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.830
 these hybrid units are ideal 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.900
 for laptops 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.550
 companies like toshiba and digital western 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.580
 works in this half time is 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.840
 free the company toshiba be one of 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.090
 the main engines of technology 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.400
 nand flash will start selling discs 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.440
 hard lived mainly focused on 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.610
 ultra-thin laptops we talk about the 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.400
 ultrabooks that are the forks 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.090
 next-generation laptops 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.620
 characterized by being completely 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.020
 decades and modern 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.520
 such is the case of computer accident 3 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.560
 which is one of those that uses the 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.380
 hybrid technology assembling a disk 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.110
 hard hdd of 320 gigs which is going 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.360
 accompanied by another ssd technology of so 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.280
 only 20 gigs 2 see that the 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.660
 operating system that way it 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.430
 guarantees the instantaneous start of the 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.420
 immediate use of the equipment in addition to 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.280
 favor the consumption of the battery 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.110
 these destined discs have been released 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.810
 to the consumer market at a price 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.970
 moderate between 113 and 256 hours 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.210
 depending on the capacity that goes from 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.030
 the 250 to the 500 gigas the first 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.350
 departures left a lot to be desired 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.180
 tsegay clarified that the cause of the lack 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.040
 of improvement in performance over 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.320
 original line of his records like the 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.150
 moment exists is due to the videos of 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.180
 the fish and the system drivers 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.860
 operative architecture even if it counted 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.360
 with greater storage capacity not 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.160
 you have to forget about the connection that 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.480
 We will give our hard drive currently 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.610
 the data are the ones that make the most 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.990
 I gained stability of connections and 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.700
 are in the future to take advantage of the width of 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.380
 band connections 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.740
 which is necessary on the discs but 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.419
 types 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.099
 more and more users appear 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.020
 some hard drives are changed in 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:45.979
 excellent alternatives in yields 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.660
 with respect to hard drives 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:49.639
 traditional while more offers 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.770
 units and floors we have much better to 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.479
 when choosing although the disks 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.460
 hard hybrids are not profitable for the 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:56.960
 weight that class memory has and little 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.150
 performance increase its cost is 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.919
 comes very close to a price very similar to 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.030
 of traditional hard drives what 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.919
 makes it perhaps the best 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.080
 alternative in quality relationships and 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.340
 price 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.229
 they have many alternatives for 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.060
 mention our information is so 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:12.960
 it was just one of many ways to power 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.960
 store our
