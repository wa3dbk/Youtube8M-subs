however this is only worth about alka
price<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.340> GE<00:03:44.519> at<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.849> moment<00:03:45.150> which<00:03:45.239> I

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
price and the GE at the moment which I

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.899 
price and the GE at the moment which I
believe<00:03:45.720> is<00:03:45.840> around<00:03:46.110> 75<00:03:46.650> K<00:03:46.890> so<00:03:47.489> that's<00:03:47.730> not

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
believe is around 75 K so that's not

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.759 
believe is around 75 K so that's not
worth<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.180> whole<00:03:48.209> lot<00:03:48.360> one<00:03:49.170> thing<00:03:49.349> worth<00:03:49.530> noting

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
worth a whole lot one thing worth noting

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.680 
worth a whole lot one thing worth noting
is<00:03:50.040> dark<00:03:50.400> bees<00:03:50.580> have<00:03:50.790> one<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.180> best<00:03:51.360> drop

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
is dark bees have one of the best drop

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.690 
is dark bees have one of the best drop
