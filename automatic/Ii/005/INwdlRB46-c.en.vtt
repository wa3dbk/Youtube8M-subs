let's<00:01:03.030> see<00:01:03.149> how<00:01:03.300> quickly<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.780> loads<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:05.900> you

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
let's see how quickly it loads up you

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.160 
let's see how quickly it loads up you
can<00:01:07.049> see<00:01:07.320> me<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.420> shiny<00:01:09.420> computer<00:01:09.930> screen

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
can see me in the shiny computer screen

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.539 
can see me in the shiny computer screen
so<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.500> starting<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:13.189> you<00:01:14.189> can<00:01:14.310> see<00:01:14.430> that

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
so it's starting up you can see that

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.649 
so it's starting up you can see that
it's<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:14.790> through<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> bit<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.420> setup

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it's going through a bit of a setup

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.890 
it's going through a bit of a setup
routine

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.070 

detecting<00:01:22.860> android<00:01:23.250> x86<00:01:23.760> this<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.870> cool

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
detecting android x86 this is cool

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.540 
detecting android x86 this is cool
because<00:01:25.170> every<00:01:25.530> kid<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.860> school<00:01:25.890> could<00:01:26.370> have
