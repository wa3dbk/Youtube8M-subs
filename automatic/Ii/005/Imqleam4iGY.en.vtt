so wait now that we've got this through

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.089 
so wait now that we've got this through
here<00:02:31.750> we<00:02:31.930> can<00:02:32.080> go<00:02:32.200> ahead<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.379> continue<00:02:32.620> to

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
here we can go ahead and continue to

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.910 
here we can go ahead and continue to
route<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.550> forward<00:02:34.440> or<00:02:35.440> make<00:02:35.800> our

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
route this forward or make our

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.670 
route this forward or make our
connections<00:02:36.989> okay<00:02:37.989> we're<00:02:38.200> going<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.349> take<00:02:38.500> the

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
settings so Cobra has designed this

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.140 
settings so Cobra has designed this
system<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.590> from<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.099> factory<00:02:45.550> set<00:02:45.849> this<00:02:45.970> to

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
system and from the factory set this to

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.670

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
absolutely ready to go now this FY 2005

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.589 
absolutely ready to go now this FY 2005
I<00:03:05.290> was<00:03:05.470> set<00:03:05.799> up<00:03:05.830> to<00:03:06.010> run<00:03:06.430> with<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.760> full<00:03:07.120> system

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
I was set up to run with a full system

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.720 
I was set up to run with a full system
set<00:03:07.810> of<00:03:07.900> Cobra<00:03:08.260> exhaust<00:03:08.590> pipes<00:03:08.920> from<00:03:09.549> the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
set of Cobra exhaust pipes from the

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.150 
set of Cobra exhaust pipes from the
factory<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:10.900> what<00:03:11.049> I<00:03:11.079> recommend<00:03:11.290> here<00:03:11.890> is<00:03:12.010> go

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
factory so what I recommend here is go

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.920 
factory so what I recommend here is go
ahead<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.519> run<00:03:12.819> it<00:03:12.970> with<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.209> stock<00:03:13.450> settings

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
ahead and run it with the stock settings

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.229 
ahead and run it with the stock settings
and<00:03:14.170> then<00:03:14.799> you<00:03:15.190> can<00:03:15.370> take<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.670> seal<00:03:15.880> off<00:03:15.970> and

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
and then you can take the seal off and

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.050 
and then you can take the seal off and
make<00:03:16.739> changes<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.799> each<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.250> those<00:03:18.340> pots<00:03:18.640> one

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
make changes to each of those pots one

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.030 
make changes to each of those pots one
at<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.269> time<00:03:19.480> by<00:03:20.019> following<00:03:20.440> this<00:03:20.680> really
