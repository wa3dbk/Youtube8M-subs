00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
so I can go to and from locations so I

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.810 
so I can go to and from locations so I
can<00:01:01.230> split<00:01:01.590> around<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.949> whole<00:01:02.160> Minecraft

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
can split around the whole Minecraft

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.479 
can split around the whole Minecraft
world<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.229> warp<00:01:04.589> around<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.250> world

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
world so you can warp around the world

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.170

cases too so we've created the basic
portal<00:02:26.730> gun<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.350> we<00:02:28.350> can<00:02:28.560> create<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.310> the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
portal gun and we can create it the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.070 
portal gun and we can create it the
orange<00:02:30.480> color<00:02:31.140> by<00:02:31.560> using<00:02:31.620> different

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
orange color by using different

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.630 
orange color by using different
combinations<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:35.569> of<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:37.640> substance

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
combinations of the of the substance

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.720 
combinations of the of the substance
that<00:02:38.970> was<00:02:39.180> crazy<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.590> now<00:02:40.830> we<00:02:40.890> got<00:02:41.190> to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
that was crazy and so now we got to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.210 
that was crazy and so now we got to
portal<00:02:42.300> guns<00:02:42.510> now<00:02:42.989> say<00:02:43.800> if<00:02:43.890> we're<00:02:44.010> going<00:02:44.130> to

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
portal guns now say if we're going to

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.240 
portal guns now say if we're going to
put<00:02:44.489> our<00:02:44.670> new<00:02:45.450> portal<00:02:45.930> here<00:02:46.410> I'm<00:02:47.010> going<00:02:47.130> to

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
put our new portal here I'm going to

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.750 
put our new portal here I'm going to
switch<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.730> with<00:02:47.820> our<00:02:48.090> ji<00:02:48.480> ki<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.580> blast<00:02:50.580> it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
switch it with our ji ki and blast it

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.759 
switch it with our ji ki and blast it
all<00:02:50.880> over<00:02:51.269> there<00:02:52.400> we're<00:02:53.400> gonna<00:02:53.640> go<00:02:53.910> well<00:02:54.870> aware

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
all over there we're gonna go well aware

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.509 
all over there we're gonna go well aware
over<00:02:56.190> there<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:57.630> we're<00:02:58.440> gonna<00:02:58.590> change<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.310> and

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
over there so we're gonna change it and

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.000 
over there so we're gonna change it and
we're<00:02:59.700> going<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.850> warp<00:03:00.569> way<00:03:01.019> over<00:03:01.440> there<00:03:01.739> to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
we're going to warp way over there to

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.070 
we're going to warp way over there to
work<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.700> think<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.209> did<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.569> we're<00:03:03.930> going<00:03:04.050> to

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
work I think it did and we're going to

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.720 
work I think it did and we're going to
warp<00:03:04.440> I'm<00:03:05.100> going<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.340> press<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.700> G<00:03:05.970> hit<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.959> and

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
warp I'm going to press a G hit that and

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.330 
warp I'm going to press a G hit that and
we're<00:03:08.730> warping<00:03:09.300> all<00:03:09.480> over<00:03:10.140> here<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:10.739> we<00:03:10.769> kind

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
we're warping all over here so we kind

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.880 
we're warping all over here so we kind
of<00:03:11.400> lost<00:03:13.250> shoot<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.489> here<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.500> switch<00:03:16.500> that

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
of lost shoot that here and switch that

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.170 
of lost shoot that here and switch that
over<00:03:17.430> there<00:03:19.340> hit<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.579> over<00:03:20.820> there<00:03:21.000> and

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
over there hit that over there and

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.390 
over there hit that over there and
switch<00:03:21.750> over<00:03:21.900> there<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.440> disappears<00:03:22.590> nope

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
switch over there so it disappears nope

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.539 
switch over there so it disappears nope
didn't<00:03:23.790> hit<00:03:23.910> anything<00:03:25.100> didn't<00:03:26.100> hit<00:03:26.220> anything
