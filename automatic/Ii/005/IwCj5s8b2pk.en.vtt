00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.130
 we need work and estrada because we 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.750
 that busy days here around 740 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.810
 movement that are take-offs and landings 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.449
 spoiled per day that is the maximum 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.970
 can handle the current job to give you an idea 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.769
 give won a chain is busiest 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.320
 airport in the world with a job 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.059
 And there is one that comes second 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.190
 people really work at the maximum 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.760
 capacity at the moment and my goal 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.890
 like to grow 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.210
 so that means how to invest 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.210
 in a new set of lantra 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.440
 well which is actually very similar 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.500
 is that their brisbane airport 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.090
 whole barrel row environment is situated 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.649
 we think you are not just investing 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.360
 you can moor to the ground 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.340
 must for tax that is something we are in 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.710
 I also know the Netherlands very well 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.030
 so in order to be able to construct that job 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.299
 there will be lots of sand first 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.649
 that sand is sprayed on and 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.860
 that must be for a certain period 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.840
 in sinking and actually good foundation 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.939
 forms were orb then tightly constructed 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.580
 may I have been asked to cooperate 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.259
 on two very specific topics 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.470
 is the job after the dries 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.610
 and the instrument landing system is that 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.590
 system used by 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.509
 planes to be able to stay 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.340
 countries during low visibility operations 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.500
 two topics where we test top 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.710
 racing and has a lot of experience at Schiphol 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.710
 life 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.799
 think we are around 35 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.180
 planes you expect 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.369
 we have to deal with that 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.049
 parking is quite a challenge 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.729
 make it all fit on it 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.410
 some smaller airport because of it 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.410
 Schiphol is great fun and far
