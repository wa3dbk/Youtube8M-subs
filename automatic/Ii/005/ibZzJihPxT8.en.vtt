three notice ring Pentatonix here which
can<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.890> quite<00:01:08.100> challenging<00:01:08.270> especially<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
can be quite challenging especially the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
can be quite challenging especially the
way<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.479> I'm<00:01:09.720> doing<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.290> with<00:01:10.409> lots<00:01:10.620> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
position shifts so you've got to have a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.020 
position shifts so you've got to have a
lot<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> accuracy<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.190> both<00:01:14.370> left<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.760> right

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
lot of accuracy with both left and right

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.180 
lot of accuracy with both left and right
hands<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:18.840> kind<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.170> breaks<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.950> love

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190
