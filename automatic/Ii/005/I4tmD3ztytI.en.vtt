00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
that it's exactly on scale with the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.900 
that it's exactly on scale with the
figure<00:03:17.750> here's<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.470> figure<00:03:18.650> uh<00:03:19.100> you<00:03:19.700> see

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
figure here's the figure uh you see

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.470

spider-man<00:03:20.299> Atilla<00:03:20.690> taller<00:03:21.230> than<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.709> door

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
spider-man Atilla taller than the door

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.410 
spider-man Atilla taller than the door
and<00:03:23.480> but<00:03:24.440> I'm<00:03:24.950> still<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.670> still<00:03:25.940> like<00:03:26.120> as<00:03:26.299> I

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
and but I'm still I still like as I

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
and but I'm still I still like as I
think<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:26.720> have<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:26.930> in<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.080> background

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
think you have it in the background

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.130 
think you have it in the background
looks<00:03:27.590> pretty<00:03:27.769> cool<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:29.060> figure<00:03:29.390> has<00:03:29.600> fairly

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
looks pretty cool the figure has fairly

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.220 
looks pretty cool the figure has fairly
good<00:03:30.440> amount<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:30.830> articulation<00:03:31.519> I<00:03:32.330> think<00:03:33.110> it's

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
good amount of articulation I think it's

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.310 
good amount of articulation I think it's
pretty<00:03:33.530> rare<00:03:33.830> how<00:03:34.130> if<00:03:34.489> you<00:03:34.640> see<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:34.970> hand<00:03:35.320> it

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
pretty rare how if you see the hand it

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.229 
pretty rare how if you see the hand it
already<00:03:36.560> comes<00:03:36.830> in<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.100> spider-man<00:03:37.489> son<00:03:37.910> and

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239

already comes in the spider-man son and
then<00:03:38.840> he<00:03:39.019> has<00:03:39.200> finger<00:03:39.769> articulation<00:03:40.340> I<00:03:40.430> mean

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
then he has finger articulation I mean

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.880 
then he has finger articulation I mean
those<00:03:40.850> two<00:03:41.060> middle<00:03:41.390> fingers<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:42.560> there's<00:03:42.769> an

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.860 
don't know it looks like a really good
spider-man<00:06:55.900> really<00:06:56.169> friendly<00:06:57.419> and<00:06:58.419> this<00:06:58.720> is

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:58.870 
spider-man really friendly and this is

spider-man really friendly and this is
the<00:06:58.960> only<00:06:59.110> downside<00:06:59.440> to<00:06:59.770> date<00:07:00.400> I<00:07:00.580> think<00:07:00.700> all<00:07:01.120> of

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.070 
them because I've seen this figure run

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.370 
them because I've seen this figure run

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
they all come with that like the painter

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.930 
they all come with that like the painter

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
strip and you can see a red line in

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.580 
strip and you can see a red line in
there<00:07:07.530> but<00:07:08.580> yeah<00:07:09.580> guys<00:07:09.790> just<00:07:10.229> check<00:07:11.229> that<00:07:11.410> out
