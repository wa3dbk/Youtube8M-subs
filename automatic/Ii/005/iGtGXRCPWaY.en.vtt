hi guys it's Tom Johnson here with my
protein<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:07.020> talk<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.500> about<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.950> my

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
protein to talk to you about the my

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.360 
protein to talk to you about the my
protein<00:00:08.870> supplement<00:00:09.870> leucine<00:00:10.769> tablets<00:00:11.160> now

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
protein supplement leucine tablets now

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.870 
protein supplement leucine tablets now
and<00:00:12.200> hopefully<00:00:13.200> most<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.530> know<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.309> a

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
and hopefully most of you know this is a

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.660 
and hopefully most of you know this is a
branch<00:00:15.599> chain<00:00:15.839> amino<00:00:15.870> acid<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:17.100> usually<00:00:17.520> when

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
branch chain amino acid so usually when

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.849 
branch chain amino acid so usually when
you<00:00:17.820> buy<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:18.029> protein<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.630> protein<00:00:19.170> powder<00:00:19.619> or<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
you buy a protein a protein powder or a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:20.779 
you buy a protein a protein powder or a
BCA<00:00:20.279> powder

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
BCA powder

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.939 
BCA powder
and<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.390> see<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> ratios<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.439> says<00:00:22.650> four

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
and you see the ratios and it says four

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.800 
and you see the ratios and it says four
one<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:23.189> two<00:00:23.730> one<00:00:23.970> one<00:00:24.000> eight<00:00:24.359> one<00:00:24.480> one

whatever<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.470> may<00:00:25.650> be

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
whatever that may be

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.480 
whatever that may be
this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.880> usually<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.480> higher<00:00:27.869> dosed<00:00:28.800> amino

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
this is usually the higher dosed amino

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.490 
this is usually the higher dosed amino
acid<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.880> they're<00:00:30.090> getting<00:00:30.210> now<00:00:31.170> what<00:00:31.349> this

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
acid that they're getting now what this

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.639 
acid that they're getting now what this
does<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.800> aids<00:00:32.329> protein<00:00:33.329> synthesis<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.260> its

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
does is aids protein synthesis and its

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.040 
does is aids protein synthesis and its
aim<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.040> add<00:00:35.280> muscle<00:00:35.940> mass<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.719> that's<00:00:36.809> why

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
aim is to add muscle mass so that's why

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.350 
aim is to add muscle mass so that's why
you'll<00:00:37.230> see<00:00:37.290> usually<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> higher<00:00:39.000> of

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
you'll see usually it's the higher of

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.610 
you'll see usually it's the higher of
the<00:00:39.510> amino<00:00:39.870> acids<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.610> to<00:00:41.610> add<00:00:41.730> into<00:00:42.350> I'll<00:00:43.350> add

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the amino acids and to add into I'll add

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.850 
the amino acids and to add into I'll add
muscle<00:00:43.860> into<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> antibody<00:00:45.180> now<00:00:45.780> with<00:00:46.649> this

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
muscle into the antibody now with this

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.240 
muscle into the antibody now with this
you<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.550> take<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.030> recommended<00:00:48.690> dose<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:50.010> I

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
you can take the recommended dose here I

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.119 
you can take the recommended dose here I
find<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.300> three<00:00:51.750> tablets<00:00:52.469> two<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.920> four

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
find it it's three tablets two to four

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.459 
find it it's three tablets two to four
times<00:00:53.340> per<00:00:53.730> day<00:00:53.760> now<00:00:54.270> personally<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.440> my

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
times per day now personally with my

to<00:01:13.470> show<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.710> what<00:01:13.890> they<00:01:13.979> look<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.130> again

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
to show you what they look like again

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.440 
to show you what they look like again
it's<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> high<00:01:16.049> protein<00:01:17.869> place<00:01:18.869> here<00:01:19.140> now

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
it's in the high protein place here now

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.429 
it's in the high protein place here now
show<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.509> probably<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.960> know<00:01:22.140> if<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
show you probably I know if you have a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.760 
show you probably I know if you have a
problem<00:01:22.680> taking<00:01:23.070> at<00:01:23.759> tablets<00:01:24.299> these<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.560> are

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
problem taking at tablets these they are

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.010 
problem taking at tablets these they are
quite<00:01:26.580> chunky<00:01:26.790> tablets<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> said

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
quite chunky tablets but like I said

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.010 
quite chunky tablets but like I said
they've<00:01:28.560> got<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.710> very<00:01:28.920> smooth<00:01:29.790> outer<00:01:30.600> coating

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
they've got a very smooth outer coating

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.780 
they've got a very smooth outer coating
and<00:01:31.439> when<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.829> drink<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.220> drink<00:01:32.490> them<00:01:32.670> with

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
and when you drink and drink them with

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.429 
and when you drink and drink them with
water<00:01:32.970> they're<00:01:33.659> very<00:01:33.869> very<00:01:34.290> easy<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:36.810> get

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
water they're very very easy to to get

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.620 
water they're very very easy to to get
down<00:01:37.650> now<00:01:37.950> how<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.579> take<00:01:38.820> two<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.240> three<00:01:39.270> of

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
down now how do you take two or three of

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.940 
down now how do you take two or three of
these<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.720> one<00:01:42.720> at<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.740> time

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
these so you can have just one at a time

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.560 
these so you can have just one at a time
or<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.399> even<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:45.060> three<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.479> it's

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
or you can even just have three and it's

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.859 
or you can even just have three and it's
really<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.350> too<00:01:46.530> difficult<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.100> drink<00:01:47.869> so

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
really not not too difficult to drink so

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.710 
really not not too difficult to drink so
that's<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.380> my<00:01:50.040> protein<00:01:50.490> products<00:01:50.939> Lucy<00:01:51.659> in

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
that's the my protein products Lucy in

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.460 
that's the my protein products Lucy in
trouble<00:01:51.990> us

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
