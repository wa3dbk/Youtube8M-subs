00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.710
 many of you ask us 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.900
 have a tutorial to find out how 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.460
 install the keys of a chassis so 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.840
 we will see that together the keys 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.290
 of a chassis it is very easy to 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.570
 install 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.310
 first of all what is a key 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.279
 so left whenever you 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.480
 buy a cat if you have 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.449
 hung 2 in a small bag with 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.099
 small pieces of good these pieces of 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.560
 woods actually these are the keys to 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.370
 chassis they serve wait for the canvas 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.520
 especially when doing activities 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.360
 with collage of the home decor with the de 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.100
 the thickness with a cracked effect 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.840
 that's past mobbing things like 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.000
 that's true it's from behind 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.410
 the chassis can put wounds 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.690
 to be able to stretch the canvas and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.980
 work on it 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.480
 so when we look at the key of a 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.449
 chassis ben that's how it looks 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.109
 it's easy afterwards to install it 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:05.210
 it settles 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:07.740
 monti nasa here so in the angles of 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.549
 vauchassis ch passion sees well there there is 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.189
 notches so the practice the most 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.810
 simple for m 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:20.880
 actually call him on your chassis 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.970
 cutthroat here is it to take the side 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.090
 beveled like that we follow the angle of the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.820
 chassis apply well here 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.530
 the key we do the same on the other side 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.990
 point of beveled hop we could well 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.510
 and that's it when we actually have a 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.490
 right angle that continue to the corner of 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.040
 chassis is that we have to install 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.930
 key on the chassis here this 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.600
 little manipulation I you art shows 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.250
 since it is easy to reproduce 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.800
 reproduced it identically on each 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.240
 beveled corner point like this one 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.820
 follows the notch of the chassis and we put his 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.450
 same key on the other side point of 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.180
 beveled here we put the notch the key 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.979
 in the notch here and there we have 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.539
 also a right angle and we do 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.550
 same four angles and it allows 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.010
 to have a canvas better tense so for 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.290
 support a little more thickness 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.600
 facts facts actually on on the 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.340
 canvas here is so it's a little tutorial 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.110
 in very simple video on how 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.360
 install keys on a chassis 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.640
 covered and as a reminder you will find 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.709
 a canvas-covered frame in range 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.980
 3d ie with thicknesses of 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.080
 3.8 cm so often could quickly to a 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.860
 framing or even chassis 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:43.140
