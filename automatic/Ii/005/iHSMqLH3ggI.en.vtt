00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.460
 today we shake sabaneev's fishing pots afterwards 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:14.620
 everybody to see how they behave 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:18.430
 also check them under load treshka 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.430
 up to 50 grams 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.000
 the best fishing rod in the whole range 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.929
 maybe I just love yo. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.929
 we load 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:36.360
 that's how it works load 3 30 to 60 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.670
 grams 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.860
 due to the fact that three sections instead of two 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.860
 like treshki obviously softer build load 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.700
 practically 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.700
 parabolic already close 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.890
 re 60 to 70 grams first model 360 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600
 already 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.600
 360 to 100 grams 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.290
 models differ slightly if their 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.970
 to hold a number of hands the difference is palpable if 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.619
 after ten minutes you can not take 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.619
 understand friends 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:44.390
 Here I go 39 to 30 grams 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.479
 1 menacing 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.280
 keeps not 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.280
 then calmly completely 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.159
 the last line of 42 to 180 grams 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.550
 keeps calm as well as before 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.420
 3 pound kilo if necessary 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:17.069
 we load here approximately here so 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.069
 it looks like she flutters her
