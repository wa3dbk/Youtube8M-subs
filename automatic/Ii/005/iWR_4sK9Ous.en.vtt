00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
put that much time into it it's very

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.370 
put that much time into it it's very
simple<00:00:19.380> for<00:00:20.130> people<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.609> use<00:00:21.050> you<00:00:22.050> go<00:00:22.140> there

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380

a<00:02:22.799> water<00:02:23.010> kind<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.730> thing<00:02:23.930> I'm<00:02:24.930> like<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.349> can

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
a water kind of thing I'm like you can

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.039 
a water kind of thing I'm like you can
jump<00:02:26.159> in<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.790> it's<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.480> makes<00:02:27.659> everything<00:02:27.870> a

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
jump in and it's this makes everything a

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.039 
jump in and it's this makes everything a
lot<00:02:28.230> more<00:02:28.260> complicated<00:02:28.890> when<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.549> go<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:30.049> so

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
lot more complicated when you go in so

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.250 
lot more complicated when you go in so
yeah<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:32.370> but<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.209> will<00:02:33.569> update<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.989> map<00:02:34.109> for

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
yeah that but I will update the map for

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.309 
yeah that but I will update the map for
you<00:02:34.379> guys<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.739> course<00:02:35.299> so<00:02:36.299> when<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:36.959> guys<00:02:37.049> do

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
you guys of course so when you guys do

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.140 
you guys of course so when you guys do
get<00:02:37.439> the<00:02:37.530> map<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.829> won't<00:02:38.010> look<00:02:38.099> like<00:02:38.159> this<00:02:38.310> but

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
get the map it won't look like this but

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.800 
get the map it won't look like this but
it<00:02:39.269> will<00:02:39.299> you<00:02:40.170> look<00:02:40.319> at<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.590> spawn<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.720> will

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
it will you look at the spawn so it will

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.210 
it will you look at the spawn so it will
just<00:02:42.870> be<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.109> regular<00:02:43.230> map<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.739> this<00:02:43.799> is<00:02:44.099> my

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
just be the regular map I this is my

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.789 
just be the regular map I this is my
personal<00:02:44.459> one<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.930> when<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.290> do<00:02:46.379> my<00:02:46.500> murder

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
personal one so when I do my murder

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.440 
personal one so when I do my murder
games<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.129> is<00:02:47.190> what<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.400> looks<00:02:47.549> like<00:02:47.670> well

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
games this is what it looks like well

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.539 
games this is what it looks like well
when<00:02:48.720> we<00:02:48.840> shut<00:02:49.019> off<00:02:49.200> when<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.099> get<00:02:50.250> your<00:02:50.400> map

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
when we shut off when you get your map

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.069 
when we shut off when you get your map
it<00:02:50.700> will<00:02:50.790> look<00:02:50.909> differently<00:02:51.329> a<00:02:51.690> lot<00:02:52.019> of

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
it will look differently a lot of

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.349 
it will look differently a lot of
different<00:02:52.409> um<00:02:52.680> another<00:02:53.549> thing<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.879> added<00:02:54.090> with

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
different um another thing I added with

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.379 
different um another thing I added with
us<00:02:54.540> was<00:02:54.950> that<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.010> can<00:02:56.519> rather<00:02:56.670> put<00:02:57.090> them<00:02:57.269> in

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
us was that you can rather put them in

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.479 
us was that you can rather put them in
their<00:02:57.569> slots<00:02:57.750> manually<00:02:58.470> or<00:02:59.010> they<00:02:59.159> can<00:02:59.310> put

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
their slots manually or they can put

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.280 
their slots manually or they can put
them<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.879> their<00:03:00.030> slots<00:03:00.239> themselves<00:03:01.019> or<00:03:01.260> you

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
them in their slots themselves or you

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.690 
them in their slots themselves or you
can<00:03:01.560> put<00:03:01.769> them<00:03:01.859> in<00:03:02.010> for<00:03:02.220> them<00:03:02.400> from<00:03:02.609> the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
can put them in for them from the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.490 
can put them in for them from the
standing<00:03:03.239> up<00:03:03.329> here<00:03:03.569> there's<00:03:04.200> one<00:03:04.290> thing<00:03:04.409> I

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
standing up here there's one thing I

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.899 
standing up here there's one thing I
realized<00:03:04.680> while<00:03:05.069> you're<00:03:05.220> up<00:03:05.370> here<00:03:05.400> it's

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
realized while you're up here it's

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.349 
realized while you're up here it's
really<00:03:06.599> hard<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.200> manage<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:08.069> players<00:03:08.370> like

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
really hard to manage the players like

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.970 
really hard to manage the players like
somebody<00:03:09.900> might<00:03:09.989> be<00:03:10.139> fighting<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.829> you<00:03:10.889> had

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
somebody might be fighting and you had

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.250 
somebody might be fighting and you had
to<00:03:11.040> keep<00:03:11.220> checking<00:03:11.519> skews<00:03:11.909> here<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.079> can

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
to keep checking skews here so you can

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.809 
to keep checking skews here so you can
do<00:03:13.379> is<00:03:13.500> I've<00:03:13.709> added<00:03:14.040> all<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.459> warps<00:03:14.760> and

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
do is I've added all the warps and

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.569 
do is I've added all the warps and
everything<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.389> each<00:03:15.660> slot<00:03:16.019> is<00:03:16.440> protected<00:03:16.980> so

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
everything and each slot is protected so

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.849 
everything and each slot is protected so
if<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.060> want<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.569> can<00:03:18.780> put<00:03:19.319> them<00:03:19.410> in<00:03:19.470> here<00:03:19.530> and

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
if you want you can put them in here and

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.369 
if you want you can put them in here and
the<00:03:20.160> reason<00:03:20.250> why<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.519> added<00:03:20.730> bedrock<00:03:21.660> is

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
the reason why I added bedrock is

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.740 
the reason why I added bedrock is
although<00:03:22.650> it's<00:03:22.919> protected<00:03:23.519> like<00:03:24.269> with<00:03:24.629> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
although it's protected like with the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.140 
although it's protected like with the
roof<00:03:25.139> glass<00:03:25.440> they<00:03:25.919> can<00:03:26.159> glitch<00:03:26.519> out<00:03:26.760> really

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
roof glass they can glitch out really

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.569 
roof glass they can glitch out really
easily<00:03:27.449> so<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:28.230> don't<00:03:28.590> want<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:28.980> happen<00:03:29.159> so

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
easily so I don't want that to happen so

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.939 
easily so I don't want that to happen so
I<00:03:30.150> added<00:03:30.480> bedrock<00:03:30.989> because<00:03:31.500> people<00:03:31.829> weren't

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
I added bedrock because people weren't

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.920 
I added bedrock because people weren't
watching<00:03:32.129> out<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.790> they<00:03:32.940> would<00:03:33.090> run<00:03:33.480> off<00:03:33.599> and

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
watching out and they would run off and

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.009 
watching out and they would run off and
get<00:03:34.109> all<00:03:34.139> chefs<00:03:35.129> before<00:03:35.370> other<00:03:35.699> people<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.840> you

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
get all chefs before other people so you

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:46.819 
get all chefs before other people so you
can<00:03:37.169> just<00:03:37.290> do<00:03:37.379> a<00:03:37.409> warp<00:03:37.680> slot<00:03:38.040> one<00:03:45.109> okay<00:03:46.109> there

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
can just do a warp slot one okay there

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.009 
can just do a warp slot one okay there
so<00:03:47.400> warp<00:03:47.609> slot<00:03:47.849> one<00:03:48.120> then<00:03:48.449> you<00:03:48.510> got<00:03:48.629> warp<00:03:48.840> slot

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
so warp slot one then you got warp slot

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:59.409 
so warp slot one then you got warp slot
two<00:03:49.229> three<00:03:50.129> four<00:03:51.379> five<00:03:52.729> six<00:03:54.500> seven<00:03:55.500> eight

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.089 

so<00:04:00.419> those<00:04:00.599> all<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.840> way<00:04:00.870> up<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.109> 24<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.919> they

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
so those all the way up to 24 and they

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.860 
so those all the way up to 24 and they
all<00:04:02.250> go<00:04:02.430> around<00:04:02.989> clockwise<00:04:05.209> so<00:04:06.209> yeah<00:04:06.359> so<00:04:06.810> this

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
all go around clockwise so yeah so this

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.530 
all go around clockwise so yeah so this
is<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.079> premade<00:04:07.409> server<00:04:07.829> two<00:04:08.040> plugins<00:04:08.540> there's

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
is a premade server two plugins there's

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.539 
is a premade server two plugins there's
an<00:04:09.720> anti-death<00:04:10.560> put<00:04:10.829> meant<00:04:11.069> like<00:04:11.250> once<00:04:11.459> you

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
an anti-death put meant like once you

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.330 
an anti-death put meant like once you
die<00:04:11.699> you<00:04:12.209> automatically<00:04:12.840> are<00:04:13.169> kicked<00:04:13.470> so<00:04:14.159> this

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
die you automatically are kicked so this

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.399 
die you automatically are kicked so this
group<00:04:14.519> manage<00:04:14.909> your<00:04:15.060> ban<00:04:15.209> on<00:04:15.389> death<00:04:15.629> so<00:04:16.139> once

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
group manage your ban on death so once

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.310 
group manage your ban on death so once
you<00:04:16.680> die<00:04:17.159> you're<00:04:17.459> automatically<00:04:18.120> banned<00:04:18.449> but

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
you die you're automatically banned but

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.760 
you die you're automatically banned but
that's<00:04:19.620> okay<00:04:19.950> since<00:04:20.250> it's<00:04:20.489> a<00:04:21.289> winrar<00:04:22.289> file<00:04:22.529> you

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
that's okay since it's a winrar file you

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.200
