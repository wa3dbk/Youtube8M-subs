pro<00:00:02.129> today<00:00:02.730> I'll<00:00:03.000> be<00:00:03.030> reviewing<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.720> co2

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
pro today I'll be reviewing the co2

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.590

regulator made by aqua tech California
now<00:00:07.170> aqua<00:00:07.470> tech<00:00:07.649> makes<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:08.010> few<00:00:08.370> different

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
now aqua tech makes a few different

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.459 
now aqua tech makes a few different
regulators<00:00:09.179> but<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.110> one<00:00:10.290> you're

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
regulators but this is the one you're

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.020 
regulators but this is the one you're
most<00:00:10.500> likely<00:00:11.010> going<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.370> want<00:00:11.639> if<00:00:11.849> you're

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
most likely going to want if you're

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.749 
most likely going to want if you're
planning<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.509> use<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.990> standard<00:00:13.620> co2<00:00:14.160> tank<00:00:14.400> they

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
purchase separately now let's hook up

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.219 
purchase separately now let's hook up
our<00:01:35.100> system<00:01:35.549> first<00:01:35.970> make<00:01:36.240> sure<00:01:36.270> your<00:01:36.570> co2<00:01:36.990> tank

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
our system first make sure your co2 tank

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.469 
our system first make sure your co2 tank
is<00:01:37.380> completely<00:01:37.650> closed<00:01:38.369> grab<00:01:38.939> your<00:01:39.119> regulator

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
is completely closed grab your regulator

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.060 
is completely closed grab your regulator
and<00:01:39.750> make<00:01:39.869> sure<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> working<00:01:40.560> pressure<00:01:40.799> knob

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
and make sure the working pressure knob

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.920 
and make sure the working pressure knob
is<00:01:41.250> all<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.640> way<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.030> left<00:01:42.360> which<00:01:42.750> is

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
is all the way to the left which is

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.990 
is all the way to the left which is
closed<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.680> sort<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.979> counterintuitive<00:01:44.369> but

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
closed it's sort of counterintuitive but

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.550 
closed it's sort of counterintuitive but
that's<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.420> how<00:01:45.540> these<00:01:45.689> regulators<00:01:46.140> work

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
that's just how these regulators work

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.920 
that's just how these regulators work
also<00:01:47.520> make<00:01:47.670> sure<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.970> fine<00:01:48.210> adjustment<00:01:48.780> or

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
also make sure the fine adjustment or

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.679 
also make sure the fine adjustment or
needle<00:01:49.350> valve<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.860> tightly<00:01:50.189> closed<00:01:50.670> screw<00:01:51.600> the

then<00:01:53.790> grab<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> wrench<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.780> make<00:01:55.110> sure<00:01:55.320> it's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
then grab a wrench to make sure it's

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.740 
then grab a wrench to make sure it's
snug<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.610> now<00:01:56.700> test<00:01:57.030> your<00:01:57.180> system<00:01:57.570> for

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
snug you can now test your system for

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.780 
snug you can now test your system for
leaks<00:01:57.960> by<00:01:58.170> opening<00:01:58.680> your<00:01:58.740> co2<00:01:59.310> tank<00:01:59.549> all<00:01:59.759> the

counter<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.540> came<00:02:30.750> with<00:02:30.900> our<00:02:31.020> regulator

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
counter that came with our regulator

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.320 
counter that came with our regulator
it's<00:02:31.950> pretty<00:02:32.220> small<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.580> doesn't<00:02:32.880> feel<00:02:33.090> like

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
it's pretty small and doesn't feel like

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.600 
it's pretty small and doesn't feel like
the<00:02:33.480> best<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.440> it's<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.800> little<00:02:34.890> add-on<00:02:35.220> so

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
the best but a it's a little add-on so

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.920 
the best but a it's a little add-on so
we're<00:02:35.760> going<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.030> give<00:02:36.210> it<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.390> shot

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
we're going to give it a shot

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.870 
we're going to give it a shot
it<00:02:37.290> comes<00:02:37.530> with<00:02:37.680> both<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.980> clamp<00:02:38.250> attachment

it comes with both a clamp attachment
and<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.510> suction<00:02:39.780> cup<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.350> set<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:41.010> guy<00:02:41.100> up

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
and a suction cup to set this guy up

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.640 
and a suction cup to set this guy up
simply<00:02:42.090> unscrew<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.660> lid<00:02:42.840> pour<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.530> enough

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
simply unscrew the lid pour in enough

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.200 
simply unscrew the lid pour in enough
water<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.250> fill<00:02:44.430> up<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.640> chamber<00:02:44.880> about

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
water to fill up the chamber about

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.660 
water to fill up the chamber about
halfway<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.020> close<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.620> back<00:02:46.770> up<00:02:46.800> so<00:02:47.550> the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
halfway and close it back up so the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.820 
halfway and close it back up so the
suction<00:02:48.090> cup<00:02:48.270> attachment<00:02:48.930> ended<00:02:49.500> up<00:02:49.620> not

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
suction cup attachment ended up not

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.590 
suction cup attachment ended up not
working<00:02:50.040> very<00:02:50.400> well<00:02:50.520> just<00:02:50.940> because<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:51.420> put<00:02:51.570> a

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
working very well just because it put a

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.750 
working very well just because it put a
lot<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.050> stress<00:02:52.290> on<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.620> counter<00:02:53.100> when<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.640> was

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
lot of stress on the counter when it was

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.610 
lot of stress on the counter when it was
all<00:02:53.940> hooked<00:02:54.300> up<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.750> decided<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.350> go<00:02:55.500> with

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
all hooked up so I decided to go with

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.010 
all hooked up so I decided to go with
the<00:02:55.740> clamp<00:02:56.070> instead<00:02:56.840> unfortunately<00:02:57.840> it

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
the clamp instead unfortunately it

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.870 
the clamp instead unfortunately it
wasn't<00:02:58.350> big<00:02:58.590> enough<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.950> fit<00:02:59.160> over<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.520> 40

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
wasn't big enough to fit over this 40

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.120 
wasn't big enough to fit over this 40
gallon<00:03:00.150> breeders<00:03:00.450> tang<00:03:00.750> clip<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.710> ended<00:03:02.010> up

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
gallon breeders tang clip so I ended up

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.980 
gallon breeders tang clip so I ended up
attaching<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.910> side<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.450> my<00:03:03.780> light

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
attaching it to the side of my light

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.440 
attaching it to the side of my light
