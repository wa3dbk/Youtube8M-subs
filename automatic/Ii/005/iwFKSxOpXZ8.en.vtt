00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.499 
classes but I mean the football stadium
being<00:01:54.340> right<00:01:54.490> next<00:01:54.700> door<00:01:54.759> is<00:01:54.939> also<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.270> huge

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
being right next door is also a huge

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.529 
being right next door is also a huge
plus<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.920> I<00:01:56.950> think<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.189> best<00:01:57.369> part<00:01:57.549> about<00:01:57.700> the

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
plus so I think the best part about the

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.719 
plus so I think the best part about the
location<00:01:59.200> is<00:01:59.500> probably<00:01:59.950> like<00:02:00.159> being<00:02:00.399> close<00:02:00.580> to

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
location is probably like being close to

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.580 
location is probably like being close to
the<00:02:00.850> right<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.840> there's<00:02:02.049> like<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.259> Highland
