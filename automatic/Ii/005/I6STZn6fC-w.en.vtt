president of BBC Dave bunker we invented
the<00:00:06.150> tension<00:00:06.509> free<00:00:06.750> neck<00:00:07.309> several<00:00:08.309> years<00:00:08.490> ago

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
the tension free neck several years ago

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.499 
the tension free neck several years ago
and<00:00:10.219> basically<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.550> came<00:00:11.730> about<00:00:11.910> because<00:00:12.090> the

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
and basically it came about because the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.990 
and basically it came about because the
development<00:00:12.960> in<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.410> touch<00:00:13.620> guitar<00:00:14.040> line<00:00:14.280> of

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
development in the touch guitar line of

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.799 
development in the touch guitar line of
guitars

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
guitars

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.590 
guitars
I<00:00:15.920> am<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.039> touch<00:00:17.190> guitar<00:00:17.550> had<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.970> develop<00:00:18.240> a

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
I am the touch guitar had to develop a

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200 
I am the touch guitar had to develop a
way<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.170> take<00:00:19.529> stress<00:00:20.160> off<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.730> neck<00:00:20.910> so

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
way to take stress off of the neck so

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.460 
way to take stress off of the neck so
that<00:00:21.359> not<00:00:21.480> only<00:00:21.510> could<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:21.990> get<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> more

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
that not only could I get a more

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.859 
that not only could I get a more
accurate<00:00:22.710> neck<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.580> stayed<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.570> longer

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
accurate neck that stayed for longer

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.380 
accurate neck that stayed for longer
periods<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.320> time<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.890> tune<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.060> could<00:00:27.210> also

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
periods of time in tune but I could also

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.640 
periods of time in tune but I could also
be<00:00:28.460> in<00:00:29.460> doing<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.510> took<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.230> stress

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
be in doing this that took the stress

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.799 
be in doing this that took the stress
off<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.250> strings<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.059> tension<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
off the strings so that the tension of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.470 
off the strings so that the tension of
the<00:00:34.410> strings<00:00:34.739> was<00:00:35.190> less<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.180> seemed

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the strings was less and that seemed

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.000 
the strings was less and that seemed
strange<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.200> would<00:00:37.410> be<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
strange that that would be but in a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.360 
strange that that would be but in a
normal<00:00:38.160> guitar<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:39.329> actually<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:40.020> a

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
normal guitar you actually have a

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.619 
normal guitar you actually have a
tensioning<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> wood<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> pull<00:00:42.210> back<00:00:42.390> of

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
tensioning of the wood a pull back of

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.810 
tensioning of the wood a pull back of
the<00:00:42.719> wood<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.770> spring<00:00:44.100> condition<00:00:44.640> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the wood and it's a spring condition so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.270 
the wood and it's a spring condition so
that<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.270> put<00:00:45.510> tension<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.800> actually

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
that as you put tension on you actually

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
that as you put tension on you actually
are<00:00:47.430> getting<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.539> scenario<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.440> bow

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
are getting like the scenario of a bow

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.580 
are getting like the scenario of a bow
and<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.370> wood<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.610> actually<00:00:51.120> bent<00:00:51.440> what<00:00:52.440> I've

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
and the wood is actually bent what I've

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.069 
and the wood is actually bent what I've
done<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> put<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.910> bar<00:00:54.600> through<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
done here is to put a bar through the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.740 
done here is to put a bar through the
neck<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:56.039> relieves<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.969> stress<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
neck that relieves the stress up to a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.520 
neck that relieves the stress up to a
certain<00:00:57.989> point<00:00:58.670> being<00:00:59.670> free<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.780> clear<00:01:01.170> here

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
certain point being free and clear here

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.670 
certain point being free and clear here
it<00:01:02.250> actually<00:01:02.760> separates<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.870> headstock<00:01:04.320> from

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
it actually separates the headstock from

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.660 
it actually separates the headstock from
the<00:01:04.890> from<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> rest<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> neck<00:01:07.460> with<00:01:08.460> one

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the from the rest of the neck with one

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.850 
the from the rest of the neck with one
simple<00:01:09.060> adjustment<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:10.200> then<00:01:10.320> adjust<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
simple adjustment I can then adjust the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.780 
simple adjustment I can then adjust the
neck<00:01:11.040> any<00:01:11.310> way<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:12.170> it<00:01:13.170> was<00:01:13.470> actually<00:01:13.920> also

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
neck any way I want it was actually also

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.910 
neck any way I want it was actually also
done<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.450> there<00:01:15.600> was<00:01:15.720> not<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.990> stress<00:01:16.650> on

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
done so that there was not the stress on

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.530 
done so that there was not the stress on
the<00:01:17.130> wood<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.640> funny<00:01:17.850> how<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.299> take<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
the wood it's funny how you can take a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.929 
the wood it's funny how you can take a
piece<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.869> wood<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.590> tap<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.670> it's

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
piece of wood and you can tap it if it's

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.230 
piece of wood and you can tap it if it's
got<00:01:21.350> no<00:01:22.350> stress<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> nice<00:01:23.430> ring<00:01:23.970> or

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
got no stress and you get a nice ring or

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.999 
got no stress and you get a nice ring or
musical<00:01:24.689> note<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.140> minute<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.770> put<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
musical note the minute you put a

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:26.870 
musical note the minute you put a
tension<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.700> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
tension on it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.870 
tension on it
and<00:01:27.030> stress<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.229> goes<00:01:28.470> dead<00:01:28.820> because<00:01:29.820> you

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and stress it it goes dead because you

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.330 
and stress it it goes dead because you
have<00:01:30.360> taken<00:01:31.229> away<00:01:31.439> any<00:01:31.619> chance<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
have taken away any chance for it to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.420 
have taken away any chance for it to
vibrate<00:01:32.880> or<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> resonate<00:01:33.950> this<00:01:34.950> was<00:01:35.159> really

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
vibrate or to resonate this was really

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.980 
vibrate or to resonate this was really
the<00:01:35.549> main<00:01:35.729> purpose<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.479> tension<00:01:36.810> free

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the main purpose of the tension free

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.380 
the main purpose of the tension free
neck<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.590> eliminate<00:01:37.860> stress<00:01:38.490> make<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
neck was to eliminate stress make a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.630 
neck was to eliminate stress make a
softer<00:01:39.990> string<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.650> would<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.890> easier<00:01:41.369> play

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
softer string that would the easier play

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.630 
softer string that would the easier play
when<00:01:41.939> touched<00:01:42.180> or<00:01:42.479> picked<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:43.110> held<00:01:43.590> down<00:01:43.829> make

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
when touched or picked or held down make

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.580 
when touched or picked or held down make
a<00:01:44.670> more<00:01:44.970> accurate<00:01:45.000> neck<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.020> would<00:01:46.110> actually

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
a more accurate neck that would actually

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.710 
a more accurate neck that would actually
stay<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.280> tune<00:01:47.579> longer<00:01:48.000> give<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.479> more

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
stay in tune longer give you more

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.510 
stay in tune longer give you more
sustain<00:01:49.200> because<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.829> more<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.250> rigid

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
sustain because you have more of a rigid

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.810 
sustain because you have more of a rigid
solid<00:01:51.479> contact<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> string<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
solid contact with a string so the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.550 
solid contact with a string so the
tension<00:01:54.149> free<00:01:54.299> neck<00:01:54.509> eliminates<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.380> lot<00:01:55.409> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
tension free neck eliminates a lot of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.490 
tension free neck eliminates a lot of
problems<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.520> easy<00:01:57.090> or<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.780> manufacture<00:01:58.409> in

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
problems it's easy or to manufacture in

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.719 
problems it's easy or to manufacture in
a<00:01:58.560> lot<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.680> ways<00:01:58.890> because<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.310> two<00:01:59.520> pieces

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
a lot of ways because it's two pieces

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.600 
a lot of ways because it's two pieces
it's<00:02:00.770> it's<00:02:01.770> very<00:02:02.100> easy<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:05.009> actually

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
it's it's very easy to to to actually

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.310 
it's it's very easy to to to actually
service<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.630> that's<00:02:06.689> something<00:02:07.079> I'm<00:02:07.200> going

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
service and that's something I'm going

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.260 
service and that's something I'm going
to<00:02:07.380> get<00:02:07.560> into<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.160> actually<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.729> easy<00:02:09.060> to

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
to get into but it actually is easy to

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.110 
to get into but it actually is easy to
service<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:10.080> take<00:02:10.259> apart<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.860> put<00:02:11.039> together<00:02:11.190> if

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
service to take apart to put together if

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.729 
service to take apart to put together if
you<00:02:12.239> want<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.599> tweak<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.020> rod<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.230> can<00:02:13.590> do

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
you want to tweak the rod you can do

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.210 
you want to tweak the rod you can do
that

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
that

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.550 
that
so<00:02:14.700> there's<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:14.970> lot<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.510> reasons<00:02:16.019> for<00:02:16.470> the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
so there's a lot of reasons for the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.210 
so there's a lot of reasons for the
tension<00:02:16.800> free<00:02:17.159> rod<00:02:20.720> on<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.780> bass<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:22.980> all<00:02:23.190> of
