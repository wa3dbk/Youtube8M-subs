00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.570
 we are going to have a look 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.920
 to the contest ladies gentlemen and concise 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.990
 summary with the peacocks with a 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.880
 good start than the men of the evil 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.030
 role from the new team 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.480
 actually a 10 next to that of 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.029
 bkcp moderate start of these sven nys too 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.740
 Albert started off quietly later 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.990
 I can especially rely on me to be straight 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.840
 stay that succeeded pole is not 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.240
 and with him many others and especially 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.730
 also very quietly build this scratch 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.430
 everything quiet here an absurd 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.079
 hear there are those that did that perfectly and 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.660
 the nose in the first place 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.219
 vantornout in this opening phase with the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.320
 second round of hair with an in between 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.570
 spin away from the rest bina die 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.460
 there if they could gather 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.530
 serious effort had to be made 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.450
 and then we see next to one 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.930
 thoroughly so the pin happened to her 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.469
 him 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.239
 yes for all ducklings and then thought 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.250
 you go from rican lab to data 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.859
 prevent knife from coming back but I can 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.199
 also reconnect quickly though it was there 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.420
 still what the scratches le for nes 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.000
 in this phase but then it came something 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.150
 further to connect that was 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.260
 corné corné van kessel with a 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.470
 formidable blow 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.760
 shake the head and the mane for a moment 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.759
 differences are under his headpiece 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.500
 here also about binah head over there 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.920
 had more trouble with this kind 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.689
 states so everyone iseren with clay 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.710
 of rocks in contact, this is the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.299
 moment 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.540
 There are quite a few who choose one 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.079
 switch and rsi visibility of qi this is mine 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.079
 opportunity 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.299
 I drive straight ahead I go my tendons and 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.979
 muscles is tension and that 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.869
 then they try to come back 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.930
 Albert II feels literally and figuratively 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.670
 the wetness and will is to me 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.560
 that counts the 12 seconds and then comes 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.630
 back to a second or three or four then 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.670
 we had impression to snape some gas 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.210
 back 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.600
 and let him come take lame 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:00.020
 was as if he could come to life 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.869
 smell thanks to sw the greenhouse and put it 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.430
 Albert definitively on his number that 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.860
 right and ultimately in sorrow 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.300
 because are in the background or china 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.880
 cables bid 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.350
 and she stayed there a beak century that 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.930
 kept drinking for a long time 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.830
 then wickedness and others are struggling with 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.530
 cycling bike people 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.780
 Tom hit was right again and goes 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.840
 the match the end 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.150
 pina like i said on and always there everywhere 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.880
 trying to accede 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.730
 then the price paid for a heavy one 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.920
 job he thinks about being different 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.900
 final round also shows willpower 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:45.739
 and mental and, say, physical 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.200
 resistance and resilience and nys wins 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.060
 as usual when you are at its best 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.489
 nothing to do about it 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.290
 pina is happy with black 2 only 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.150
 fixed in which of the following crosse 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.909
 this place could become one and 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.829
 always is of things 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.480
 another podium place for albert 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.159
 so that last year so once or 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.500
 five stood next to the podium for the rest 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:09.170
 Also every time there on 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.370
 no spina always vantornout girl van 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.629
 hair supporter 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.730
 walsleben arnouts love is the top 10 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.940
 also and so is telling sns is yours 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.659
 story of the competition not such a good one 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.400
 Start 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.930
 I was a little more in the park Mike 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.739
 do carry that up fairly quickly 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.959
 damage and I have a bit of the cat there 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.420
 looked out of the tree and I made one 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.489
 steering error that caused me to fall 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.470
 but could come back to very quickly 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.659
 estimate between close it is like anyway 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.980
 a sign that you are there with a good fee 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.109
 and sit there and then once the 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.359
 entered photos and then I felt that 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.819
 I the best nico as the news came 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:49.370
 still fairly short but had to be there too 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.680
 we had to adjust at some point too 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.989
 just like nothing played and order 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.389
 financing but was with me 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.459
 also in the garden and I walk 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.810
 passage will crawl working time 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.639
 class then well that are in advance the 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.819
 masks are apparently going to lose weight 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.940
 your facade the best god this is his will 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.319
 circumstances that I really like 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.090
 maybe a little too much for me 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.280
 would have preferred a little more power 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.870
 to keep cycling but that is not here 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.000
 the doing the climbs are too steep 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.060
 so you have to get off the bike and that is not 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.729
 Always in my favor but yes, 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.320
 if windows are good today 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.090
 omen for what is coming alone 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.430
 my back stays a little bit with 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.669
 my worried child for the moment it is 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.110
 not yet optimal but yes it is 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.300
 enough to win already and it's me 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.830
 radio satisfied last year look at 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.330
 ours against a considerable backlog 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.830
 you have a head start 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.020
 that's good for the purpose 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.080
 final ranking yes it is of course still 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.070
 very early in the season but last 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.890
 year was much faster 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.420
 now it's really a motocross and I had 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.790
 already feeling good legs yesterday 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.700
 had him a bit like everything then 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.500
 looks and you can do at the right time 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.460
 what you have to do then yes then I know 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.340
 just being in this kind 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.690
 circumstances can win the race and me 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.310
 got off to a good start 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.840
 klaas vantornout who came to the 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.480
 Comic still against that barely got any more 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.160
 what said they wanted immediately 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.600
 a hot shower is pretty decent 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.570
 extreme 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.880
 yes the wind and rain start the ears 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.800
 to the end and you do 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.140
 also not too many clothes because everything 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.940
 gets wet he gets heavy so needs a 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.820
 bit the golden mean and d 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.170
 And I can do better with others 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.670
 max he also has to shiver so that 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.990
 that is, kouters on to it 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.510
 stage to the warm camper and 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.850
 care in loenhout is all 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.030
 in front of 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.860
 video starke language and then after the world cup 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.290
 enough dicks and never someone you join them 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.890
 all 8 in this bpost bank trophy 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:49.260
 That is the trophy that took over the lesson 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:53.190
 from the gazet of antwerp 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:56.550
 which is 25 years of china to two 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.500
 still fine but the winner of the 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.810
 great prize from its former cover 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.200
 competitors that you mark the world 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.200
 absolute 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:12.900

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:20.610
 flowers and the soenna of femke what on the 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:22.260
 so don't leave romance again 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.660
 say the pina 7 years 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.850
 luckily I had no pain in my 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.020
 legs and not in one and that 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.980
 if only I was happy about it 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.980
 so those were tears 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:40.440
 martin bina brother even though 33 big but 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.230
 arriving there last year the upward 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:47.550
 that is not yet dramatic 30 in montana

 turned 30 on May 21 it is one 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.840
 contemporary position must 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.310
 Modi and nose went through his sudden 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.180
 saw that energy coming couple 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:02.880
 and that already doubles and earth 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.410
 definitely a spot is tea party you 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.570
 could possibly consider it anyway 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:12.050
 control cabinets on knew I still want it 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:12.050
 torsion shaft i required 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.699
 hi podium the only caution there 

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:21.389
 step off 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:24.710

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:27.629

 Have a day and they feel after the order 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.849
 three pounds and then it goes without saying 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.639
