00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
this entire episode this dude was just

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.010 
this entire episode this dude was just
being<00:01:16.470> used<00:01:16.590> bomb<00:01:16.890> Oh<00:01:17.130> day<00:01:17.939> son<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.659> his<00:01:18.840> been

so<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.170> really<00:01:22.350> think<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.680> little

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
so like you really think that little

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.260 
so like you really think that little
bomb<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.250> he's<00:01:23.430> gonna<00:01:23.549> blowing<00:01:23.820> them<00:01:23.939> up<00:01:24.060> no

bomb and he's gonna blowing them up no

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.789 
bomb and he's gonna blowing them up no
because<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.540> didn't<00:01:24.689> really<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:25.200> anything<00:01:25.439> I

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
because I didn't really do anything I

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.100 
because I didn't really do anything I
guess<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.369> don't<00:01:26.970> know<00:01:27.150> but<00:01:27.479> if<00:01:27.570> he<00:01:27.600> blows<00:01:27.840> up

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
guess I don't know but if he blows up

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.569 
guess I don't know but if he blows up
he's<00:01:28.320> right<00:01:28.470> next<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.829> print<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.220> print<00:01:29.460> guy

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
