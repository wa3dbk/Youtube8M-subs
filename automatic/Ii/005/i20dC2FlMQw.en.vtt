00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
showing how these radios work but we're

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.010 
showing how these radios work but we're
just<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.060> kind<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.360> tune<00:01:27.509> across<00:01:27.659> the

just going to kind of tune across the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.069 
just going to kind of tune across the
frequencies<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.770> see<00:01:28.950> what<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.280> hear<00:01:29.610> and

frequencies and see what we can hear and
we're<00:01:31.079> listening<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.740> non-directional

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
we're listening for non-directional

beacons stations designed for aircraft

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.999 
beacons stations designed for aircraft
and<00:01:35.640> marine<00:01:36.000> these<00:01:36.630> are<00:01:36.810> marine<00:01:37.140> type<00:01:37.560> radios

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
and marine these are marine type radios

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.730 
and marine these are marine type radios
but<00:01:38.369> mostly<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.600> area<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.170> I'm<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.500> land

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
but mostly in the area here I'm on land

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.520 
but mostly in the area here I'm on land
there's<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.159> lot<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.869> beacons<00:01:42.869> for<00:01:43.110> aircraft

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
there's a lot of beacons for aircraft

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.539 
there's a lot of beacons for aircraft
the<00:01:44.040> band<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:45.200> basically<00:01:46.200> from<00:01:46.530> about<00:01:46.740> 190

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the band is basically from about 190

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.330 
the band is basically from about 190
kilohertz<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.420> about<00:01:48.659> 535<00:01:49.500> kilohertz<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.189> is

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
kilohertz to about 535 kilohertz this is

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.580 
kilohertz to about 535 kilohertz this is
right<00:01:50.520> below<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.970> AM<00:01:51.240> broadcast<00:01:51.840> band<00:01:52.110> so

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
right below the AM broadcast band so

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.649

zone<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.510> check<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.900> out

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530

if you'd like to try copying any of
these<00:02:15.330> beacons<00:02:15.780> from<00:02:16.020> home<00:02:16.290> if<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.680> have<00:02:16.860> a

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
these beacons from home if you have a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.590 
these beacons from home if you have a
receiver<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.000> will<00:02:18.150> cover<00:02:18.330> these

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
receiver that will cover these

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.510 
receiver that will cover these
frequencies<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.890> don't<00:02:20.100> know<00:02:20.250> Morse

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
frequencies and you don't know Morse

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.000 
frequencies and you don't know Morse
code<00:02:20.850> don't<00:02:21.720> worry<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.410> can<00:02:22.620> just<00:02:22.830> write<00:02:22.980> down

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
code don't worry you can just write down

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.010 
code don't worry you can just write down
the<00:02:23.400> dots<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.910> dashes<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.510> decode<00:02:24.870> them

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
the dots and dashes and decode them

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.430 
the dots and dashes and decode them
later<00:02:25.230> on<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> Morse<00:02:26.280> code<00:02:26.640> chart<00:02:27.300> because<00:02:27.900> they

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
later on a Morse code chart because they

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.080 
later on a Morse code chart because they
repeat<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.980> same<00:02:29.190> two<00:02:29.430> or<00:02:29.459> three<00:02:29.580> letters

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
repeat the same two or three letters

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.750 
repeat the same two or three letters
over<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.930> over<00:02:31.230> again<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:31.770> it's<00:02:32.340> pretty<00:02:32.610> easy

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
over and over again so it's pretty easy

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.630 
over and over again so it's pretty easy
to<00:02:32.910> do<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.870> let's<00:02:34.140> check<00:02:34.470> out<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.860> video<00:02:35.069> from

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
to do so let's check out this video from

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.199 
to do so let's check out this video from
last<00:02:35.910> night<00:02:36.270> here<00:02:37.100> so<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.130> have<00:02:38.400> three<00:02:38.730> vintage

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.800 
radios set up on the table here we're
going<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.160> give<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.370> try<00:02:41.790> when<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.360> gets<00:02:42.540> closer

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
going to give a try when it gets closer

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.310 
going to give a try when it gets closer
to<00:02:42.930> sunset<00:02:43.260> here<00:02:44.330> first<00:02:45.330> two<00:02:45.510> radios<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.080> see

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.170 
navigator 550 so we're only going to try
one<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.130> first<00:03:05.370> radio<00:03:05.670> since<00:03:06.000> they're

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
one of the first radio since they're

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.059 
one of the first radio since they're
pretty<00:03:06.450> much<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.690> same<00:03:07.050> here<00:03:07.380> we'll<00:03:07.769> try<00:03:08.010> the

pretty much the same here we'll try the

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.660 
pretty much the same here we'll try the
Rogers<00:03:08.700> since<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.209> did<00:03:09.510> do<00:03:10.140> some<00:03:10.470> external<00:03:11.160> or

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670

and<00:03:19.470> I'm<00:03:19.980> hearing<00:03:20.280> station<00:03:21.030> fq<00:03:21.570> in<00:03:21.810> Fairmont

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
and I'm hearing station fq in Fairmont

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.100 
and I'm hearing station fq in Fairmont
Minnesota<00:03:22.890> I'm<00:03:23.070> for<00:03:23.370> 20<00:03:23.700> kilohertz<00:03:24.110> that's

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
Minnesota I'm for 20 kilohertz that's

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.670 
Minnesota I'm for 20 kilohertz that's
probably<00:03:25.410> about<00:03:25.500> 50<00:03:25.950> miles<00:03:26.130> or<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:26.610> from<00:03:26.640> me

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
probably about 50 miles or so from me

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.890 
probably about 50 miles or so from me
this<00:03:28.680> band<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> lot<00:03:29.519> like<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.940> M<00:03:30.090> broadcast

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
this band is a lot like the M broadcast

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.870 
this band is a lot like the M broadcast
band<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.709> get<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.010> longest<00:03:32.670> distance

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
band you get the longest distance

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.120 
band you get the longest distance
usually<00:03:33.360> during<00:03:34.110> hours<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.500> darkness

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
usually during hours of darkness

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.240 
usually during hours of darkness
so<00:03:35.790> around<00:03:36.269> sunset<00:03:36.600> until<00:03:37.290> sunrise<00:03:37.530> that's

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
so around sunset until sunrise that's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.180 
so around sunset until sunrise that's
why<00:03:38.459> I'm<00:03:38.610> trying<00:03:38.820> it<00:03:39.090> here<00:03:39.269> now<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.980> did<00:03:40.980> add

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
why I'm trying it here now I did add

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.849 
why I'm trying it here now I did add
some<00:03:41.670> additional<00:03:41.970> LED<00:03:42.780> lighting<00:03:43.170> behind<00:03:43.560> the

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
some additional LED lighting behind the

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.430 
some additional LED lighting behind the

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.800 
much hearing the same stations over
again<00:06:15.840> this<00:06:16.260> radio<00:06:16.910> just<00:06:17.910> isn't<00:06:18.300> pulling<00:06:18.540> out

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
again this radio just isn't pulling out

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.630 
again this radio just isn't pulling out
some<00:06:19.410> of<00:06:19.530> those<00:06:19.590> stations<00:06:20.160> that<00:06:20.250> are<00:06:20.310> way<00:06:20.460> down

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
some of those stations that are way down

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.300 
some of those stations that are way down
on<00:06:20.820> the<00:06:20.850> noise<00:06:21.090> here

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:36.410 

so<00:06:27.090> let's<00:06:27.330> give<00:06:27.630> the<00:06:27.780> Bendix<00:06:28.670> try<00:06:29.670> here

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.680 

there<00:06:37.080> we're<00:06:37.260> hearing<00:06:37.530> AXA<00:06:38.460> and<00:06:38.490> Algona<00:06:39.150> Iowa

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
there we're hearing AXA and Algona Iowa

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:50.720 
there we're hearing AXA and Algona Iowa
4:03<00:06:40.350> again

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.900 

and<00:06:50.910> stations<00:06:51.540> iy<00:06:52.080> +<00:06:52.380> f2<00:06:52.770> again<00:06:53.130> source<00:06:53.520> radio

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
and stations iy + f2 again source radio

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.580 
and stations iy + f2 again source radio
seems<00:06:54.270> pretty<00:06:54.480> much<00:06:54.690> comparable<00:06:55.170> to<00:06:55.470> the

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
seems pretty much comparable to the

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.560 
seems pretty much comparable to the
first<00:06:55.830> to<00:06:56.040> which<00:06:56.460> I<00:06:56.640> was<00:06:56.790> expecting

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
first to which I was expecting

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.020 
first to which I was expecting
and<00:06:58.260> notice<00:06:58.560> how<00:06:58.710> I<00:06:58.740> rotate<00:06:59.220> the<00:06:59.400> loop<00:06:59.550> antenna

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
and notice how I rotate the loop antenna

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.090 
and notice how I rotate the loop antenna
I<00:07:00.120> can<00:07:00.420> know<00:07:00.600> all<00:07:00.810> one<00:07:01.020> station<00:07:01.320> and

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
I can know all one station and

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.740 
I can know all one station and
improve<00:07:02.490> the<00:07:02.610> signal<00:07:02.790> of<00:07:03.030> the<00:07:03.120> other<00:07:03.240> station

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
improve the signal of the other station

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.940 
improve the signal of the other station
