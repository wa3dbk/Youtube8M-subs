the<00:00:36.739> day<00:00:36.890> it<00:00:37.550> is<00:00:37.699> vitally<00:00:38.179> important<00:00:38.600> that

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
the day it is vitally important that

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.229 
the day it is vitally important that
your<00:00:38.870> chicken<00:00:39.199> never<00:00:39.440> runs<00:00:39.679> out<00:00:39.890> of<00:00:39.949> water<00:00:40.239> so

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
your chicken never runs out of water so

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.689 
your chicken never runs out of water so
here<00:00:41.659> we<00:00:41.839> have<00:00:42.050> a<00:00:42.230> four<00:00:42.530> liter<00:00:42.710> drinker<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.579> a

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
here we have a four liter drinker and a

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.880 
here we have a four liter drinker and a
two<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:43.969> a<00:00:44.059> half<00:00:44.269> liter<00:00:44.569> thinker<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.679> terms

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
two and a half liter thinker the terms

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.840 
two and a half liter thinker the terms
are<00:00:46.010> hard<00:00:46.159> for<00:00:46.249> you<00:00:46.339> to<00:00:46.399> drinker<00:00:46.699> you'd

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
are hard for you to drinker you'd

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.660 
are hard for you to drinker you'd
probably<00:00:47.089> have<00:00:47.479> for<00:00:48.010> two-stroke<00:00:49.010> three<00:00:49.339> hens

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
probably have for two-stroke three hens

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.180 
probably have for two-stroke three hens
and<00:00:50.030> this<00:00:50.690> one<00:00:50.899> perhaps<00:00:51.170> about<00:00:51.559> four<00:00:51.920> hens

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
and this one perhaps about four hens

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.959 
and this one perhaps about four hens
here<00:00:52.639> but<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:53.629> just<00:00:53.659> unscrew<00:00:54.079> it<00:00:54.409> like<00:00:54.739> that

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
here but you just unscrew it like that

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:04.240 
here but you just unscrew it like that
pour<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.120> water<00:00:56.329> in<00:00:56.690> and<00:01:02.199> then<00:01:03.199> just<00:01:03.440> simply

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
pour the water in and then just simply

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.120 
pour the water in and then just simply
insert<00:01:04.670> that<00:01:05.210> in<00:01:05.390> turn<00:01:05.659> it<00:01:05.840> make<00:01:06.590> sure<00:01:06.620> it's<00:01:06.920> on

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
insert that in turn it make sure it's on

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.889 
insert that in turn it make sure it's on
tight<00:01:07.159> otherwise<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:08.150> water<00:01:08.270> will<00:01:08.570> come<00:01:08.720> all

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
tight otherwise the water will come all

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.310 
tight otherwise the water will come all
over<00:01:09.079> yourself<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:10.600> then<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:11.780> can<00:01:11.930> just<00:01:12.110> push

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
over yourself and then you can just push

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.800 
over yourself and then you can just push
it<00:01:12.439> on<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.619> ground<00:01:12.829> like<00:01:13.100> that<00:01:13.430> or<00:01:14.119> of<00:01:14.600> course

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
it on the ground like that or of course

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.719 
it on the ground like that or of course
hang<00:01:15.680> it<00:01:15.829> up<00:01:16.039> at<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:16.280> back<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:18.500> can<00:01:18.770> use<00:01:19.039> water

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
hang it up at the back you can use water

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.679 
hang it up at the back you can use water
troughs<00:01:20.240> or<00:01:20.570> some<00:01:21.170> people<00:01:21.469> find<00:01:21.770> an<00:01:21.920> old<00:01:22.100> bowl

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
troughs or some people find an old bowl

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.999 
troughs or some people find an old bowl
around<00:01:23.689> their<00:01:24.140> house<00:01:24.320> but<00:01:24.560> I<00:01:24.649> wouldn't

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
around their house but I wouldn't

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.789 
around their house but I wouldn't
suggest<00:01:25.159> that<00:01:25.579> because<00:01:25.789> you<00:01:26.630> have<00:01:26.899> a<00:01:27.109> they<00:01:27.740> can

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
suggest that because you have a they can

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.499 
suggest that because you have a they can
quite<00:01:28.100> easily<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.579> chickens<00:01:28.909> will<00:01:29.060> walk<00:01:29.270> in

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
quite easily the chickens will walk in

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:30.940 
quite easily the chickens will walk in
it<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:29.840> then<00:01:29.960> their<00:01:30.079> droppings<00:01:30.320> go<00:01:30.649> into<00:01:30.859> the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
it and then their droppings go into the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.639 
it and then their droppings go into the
water<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:32.020> contaminate<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.140> water<00:01:33.170> for<00:01:33.590> a

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
water and contaminate the water for a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.620 
water and contaminate the water for a
start<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.399> then<00:01:34.759> of<00:01:34.880> course<00:01:34.909> they<00:01:35.210> might<00:01:35.359> just

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
start and then of course they might just

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.539 
start and then of course they might just
tip<00:01:35.780> if<00:01:36.049> it's<00:01:36.200> not<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.380> really<00:01:36.679> heavy<00:01:36.920> dish<00:01:37.280> or<00:01:37.520> a

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
tip if it's not a really heavy dish or a

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.910 
tip if it's not a really heavy dish or a
trough<00:01:38.060> they<00:01:38.570> tip<00:01:38.840> it<00:01:38.960> over<00:01:39.079> and<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:39.500> find<00:01:39.799> you

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
trough they tip it over and you find you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.050 
trough they tip it over and you find you
come<00:01:40.100> back<00:01:40.219> from<00:01:40.310> at<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.520> end<00:01:40.549> of<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.759> day<00:01:40.880> and

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
come back from at the end of the day and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.609 
come back from at the end of the day and
they<00:01:41.119> haven't<00:01:41.299> got<00:01:41.479> any<00:01:41.630> water<00:01:41.840> left<00:01:42.079> which<00:01:42.350> is

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
they haven't got any water left which is

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
not ideal at all an egg is 75% water so

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.099 
not ideal at all an egg is 75% water so
I<00:01:45.890> cannot<00:01:46.670> emphasize<00:01:47.119> enough<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.450> importance

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
I cannot emphasize enough the importance

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.620 
I cannot emphasize enough the importance
of<00:01:48.380> making<00:01:48.560> sure<00:01:48.950> they<00:01:49.429> do<00:01:49.490> not<00:01:49.609> run<00:01:50.420> out<00:01:50.600> of
