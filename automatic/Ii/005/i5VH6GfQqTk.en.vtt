you my way and this is also a guide to
tears<00:04:26.630> basically<00:04:27.630> you<00:04:28.590> go<00:04:29.130> for<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.400> blue

tears basically you go for the blue

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.670 
tears basically you go for the blue
because<00:04:31.920> that<00:04:32.160> gives<00:04:32.850> you<00:04:33.030> points<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:34.140> green

lowest<00:04:35.220> points<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:35.730> changes<00:04:36.150> all<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.420> time<00:04:36.450> I

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
lowest points it changes all the time I

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.250 
lowest points it changes all the time I
believe<00:04:37.350> going<00:04:37.740> in<00:04:37.920> a<00:04:38.100> less<00:04:38.400> filled<00:04:38.760> world

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
believe going in a less filled world

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.890 
believe going in a less filled world
means<00:04:40.260> they<00:04:40.590> change<00:04:40.950> less<00:04:41.340> often<00:04:41.580> so<00:04:42.300> if<00:04:42.690> you

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
means they change less often so if you

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.470 
means they change less often so if you
want<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.650> do<00:04:43.800> that<00:04:43.830> what<00:04:44.610> this<00:04:44.850> does<00:04:45.180> is<00:04:45.450> it
