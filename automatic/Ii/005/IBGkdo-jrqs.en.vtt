00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:09.110
 hello I want to show you today how 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:15.330
 you make a magic ring and that 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:19.920
 Take care to settle for wool 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.490
 a bit of wool from here is the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.779
 beginning phase now you take your stand 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.710
 you put on the hand under the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:37.309
 forefinger and wrap him around the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.969
 thumb goes on the thumb wraps him 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:47.809
 around would have to be good around the free 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.809
 Wrap thumb and hold a little 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.579
 Now take your guild under yours 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:01.399
 thumb in the loop 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.399
 get your thread through 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.570
 and now you have a bad one on the 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.179
 crochet hook will pick you up again 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.409
 thread and wake up through this sleep 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:20.369
 Now you have the ring or the bend 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.560
 those around the thumb have to lose weight 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.959
 keep her there where he was a 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.340
 Air Force did you hold fast 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:32.700
 and take the thumb out now the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.149
 hold the loop again 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.289
 it looks like that and now you have to go in 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:45.360
 this ring firm stitches for now 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:50.220
 just get a thread in this ring 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:56.939
 and by the time we do now 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.939
 10 times 2 again in the ring 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.939
 3 almost always on you both have 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.429
 not only the sling but also 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.530
 this thread with which it with the 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:13.019
 drumrum rule under which would have to 1 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.019
 continue crocheting 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.609
 45 to 10 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.800
 67 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.530
 8th 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:39.930
 9 and if you did that yours 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.190
 Fixed mesh in the ring the rule 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:49.740
 should that look he pulls the thread 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:54.270
 the lurching size now take yourselves 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.520
 take the loop in the left hand 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.270
 you are the thread or the other way 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.750
 really do not care 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.870
 the initial phases just now 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:09.390
 pull tight and hold the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.730
 draw early phases 0 we have one 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.360
 made ring 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.030
 Of course you can still one 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.040
 tighten the pieces more firmly 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:23.100
 this really is to see no more 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.370
 and that's how the magic ring looks like 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:33.960
 can also close it now and 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:39.090
 Although with a chain you are seeing here now 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:47.040
 Do you have your first brand this woman there 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:49.170
 now get a sting thread and 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.580
 at the same time through this first loop 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.880
 pull and loosen again 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.630
 Now we have a perfect one 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.630
 closed ring 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.680
 Have fun if we see you next 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.680
