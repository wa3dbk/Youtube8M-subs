00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
it's kind of spread out so that's what I

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.600 
it's kind of spread out so that's what I
use<00:04:21.450> water<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.410> conditioner<00:04:22.919> but<00:04:23.400> when<00:04:23.580> I

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
use water and conditioner but when I

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
love it like I said the hair was pretty

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.810

good<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.930> West<00:04:36.200> were<00:04:36.440> good<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:37.190> curl<00:04:37.460> patterns

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820

very<00:04:38.060> pretty<00:04:38.450> it's<00:04:38.750> a<00:04:39.110> tight<00:04:39.350> curl<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:40.310> only

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
very pretty it's a tight curl the only

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.879 
very pretty it's a tight curl the only
thing<00:04:40.790> is<00:04:40.820> you<00:04:41.240> have<00:04:41.360> to<00:04:41.780> really<00:04:42.260> really<00:04:42.560> blend

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
thing is you have to really really blend

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.580 
thing is you have to really really blend
and<00:04:43.160> that<00:04:43.610> may<00:04:43.850> be<00:04:44.180> troublesome<00:04:45.080> for<00:04:45.380> some

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
and that may be troublesome for some

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.200 
and that may be troublesome for some
people<00:04:45.889> depending<00:04:46.250> on<00:04:46.250> your<00:04:46.460> hair<00:04:46.669> type<00:04:46.850> or

whatever um but if you can get that part

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.840
