childhood lupus is a condition where the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.449 
childhood lupus is a condition where the
body's<00:00:07.819> immune<00:00:08.240> system<00:00:08.740> reacts<00:00:09.740> for<00:00:10.280> some

body's immune system reacts for some

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.839 
body's immune system reacts for some
reason<00:00:10.850> against<00:00:11.420> its<00:00:11.840> own<00:00:12.019> tissues<00:00:12.710> up<00:00:13.639> to

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
reason against its own tissues up to

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.579 
reason against its own tissues up to
twenty<00:00:14.150> percent<00:00:14.450> of<00:00:14.660> people<00:00:14.870> present<00:00:15.410> in

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:15.589 
twenty percent of people present in

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.650 
twenty percent of people present in
childhood<00:00:15.980> but<00:00:16.250> it<00:00:16.730> can<00:00:16.849> affect<00:00:17.150> them<00:00:17.300> in<00:00:17.419> many

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
childhood but it can affect them in many

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.570 
childhood but it can affect them in many
different<00:00:17.990> ways<00:00:18.200> so<00:00:18.680> some<00:00:18.980> children<00:00:19.430> will

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
different ways so some children will

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.109 
different ways so some children will
have<00:00:19.689> skin<00:00:20.689> or<00:00:20.930> joint<00:00:21.230> involvement<00:00:21.790> others<00:00:22.790> it

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
have skin or joint involvement others it

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.150 
have skin or joint involvement others it
may<00:00:23.270> affect<00:00:23.390> a<00:00:23.779> major<00:00:24.020> organ<00:00:24.500> so<00:00:24.860> that<00:00:25.040> it

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
may affect a major organ so that it

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.819 
may affect a major organ so that it
could<00:00:25.340> have<00:00:25.489> kidney<00:00:25.849> disease<00:00:26.380> it<00:00:27.380> can<00:00:27.559> affect

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829

could have kidney disease it can affect
their<00:00:27.980> neurological<00:00:28.669> system<00:00:29.149> so<00:00:29.419> it<00:00:29.509> can

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
their neurological system so it can

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.870 
their neurological system so it can
affect<00:00:29.960> their<00:00:30.110> brain<00:00:30.380> or<00:00:30.829> how<00:00:31.340> their<00:00:31.610> nerves

affect their brain or how their nerves

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.630 
affect their brain or how their nerves
work<00:00:32.390> others<00:00:33.350> it<00:00:33.530> can<00:00:33.620> affect<00:00:33.920> their<00:00:34.070> heart<00:00:34.340> or

treatment<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:25.139> very<00:02:25.499> important<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.280> lupus<00:02:26.700> the

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
treatment is very important in lupus the

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.449 
treatment is very important in lupus the
reason<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:28.079> that<00:02:28.109> is<00:02:28.499> that<00:02:28.530> we<00:02:28.950> know<00:02:29.129> that<00:02:29.340> if

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
reason for that is that we know that if

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.849 
reason for that is that we know that if
we<00:02:29.489> switch<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.150> inflammation<00:02:30.780> off<00:02:30.959> there's

we switch the inflammation off there's

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.390 
we switch the inflammation off there's
less<00:02:32.099> chance<00:02:32.129> of<00:02:32.790> causing<00:02:33.030> damage<00:02:33.629> to<00:02:33.659> those

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
more a challenge with lupus you do have

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.520 
more a challenge with lupus you do have
to<00:05:17.639> realize<00:05:17.970> that<00:05:18.020> and<00:05:19.020> you<00:05:19.050> do<00:05:19.229> have<00:05:19.410> to

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
does changes you as a person makes you

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.580 
does changes you as a person makes you
mature<00:05:26.909> quicker<00:05:27.240> it<00:05:27.630> makes<00:05:27.810> you<00:05:27.960> stronger<00:05:28.289> it

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
mature quicker it makes you stronger it

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.990 
mature quicker it makes you stronger it
makes<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:28.889> more<00:05:29.009> understanding<00:05:29.610> with<00:05:29.849> other

makes you more understanding with other
people<00:05:30.530> it<00:05:31.530> is<00:05:32.009> a<00:05:32.310> challenge<00:05:32.870> but<00:05:33.870> it's

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
people it is a challenge but it's
